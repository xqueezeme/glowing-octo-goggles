        "CHAPTER 21: LUST\n\nA loud argument outside causes her to jerk awake. For a moment she believes she is back in her carriage, in the forest all alone, her happiness just a distant dream until she feels Rick's hand wrapped around hers, their fingers entwined. He still holds her tight but loosens his grip when the front door bursts open. Though she doesn't want to, Mora forces herself to stand up and lean against the table; she is slightly embarrassed at being seen in such a private moment. Several people burst into the bar, none seeing the two lovers' embrace.\n\n\"Unhand me you sorry excuse for a woman! I tell you what, it is no wonder the sun avoids shining on this awful country\u2014everyone would be forced to see exactly what Sceduian women have to offer!\" A familiar, rough voice calls out.\n\n\"Oh shut it, don't be sore about being beaten by a lady,\" James taunts the man.\n\nSari, clearly irritated, shoves the bound man to the ground, \"This coward says he knows Mora.\"\n\nHis hands tied behind his back, he rolls to his side so he can shout at Sari, \"I am not a coward! That horse would not stop, I tell you...and even if it did, it isn't like I wanted to recall my last encounter with your kind!\" The familiar voice comes from Franklin.\n\nMora walks swiftly over to him, determined despite her dizziness. She is forced to brace herself on passing chairs for support. She kneels down to the man, quickly untying his ropes despite Sari's objections. When Franklin sees Mora he sits up enough to raise his left knee where he rests his forehead, right hand on his heart, left hand in a fist on the ground, \"I'm sorry, Princess Namora, I didn't think these heathens would actually take me to you. Please excuse my outburst.\"\n\nShe laughs, glad to see her old friend. She holds his shoulders, taking a look at his healing eye, \"You should be kinder to Sari, she isn't as nice as I am.\"\n\nFranklin sits up, mumbling, \"If that is what the Sceaduians call a woman it is no wonder the Queen wanted you to stay here for a while. Perhaps she wanted someone civilized to talk to,\" he directs his statement to Sari.\n\nMora smiles, touching his cheek to draw his attention back to her, \"Why are you here, Captain? Surely by now, you must realize that crossing the Sceaduian border isn't without risk...\" She is glad to see a familiar face.\n\n\"I came to give you this,\" he pulls a letter from his pocket, \"I meant only to stop at the border and wait to pass it off to a Warden but that damned beast of yours refused to stop!\" He folds his legs in front of him, sitting before Mora as he waves his arms to emphasize his story, \"Every day he has been waiting at the western most part of the royal pasture because he knows that you're out there somewhere. Advisor Laren told me I must get this to you quickly and as soon I as mounted that thing you call a horse he took off and wouldn't stop, no matter how hard I tried. He blew past the border, past those three and kept running. It was like he smelled you out, damned dog.\"\n\nMora takes the letter from Franklin. She opens it, immediately recognizing Laren's handwriting. As she reads, the smile begins to fade from her face. The sun rises high in the sky, looking for the brush tiger nearby. Not knowing the tiger has been slain, it grows restless with disdain. In distant land beyond yonder hill, upon the morrow the sun will rise feigning sorrow. Shall time pass it by, where they meet, eye to eye?\n\nShe sits back on her heels, clearly shocked. Franklin gently touches her arm to get her attention, \"Princess, is everything alright? What did it say?\"\n\n\"Nothing good. I need a piece of paper, something to write with...\" Franklin pulls both out of his pocket and hands it to Mora. She stands, taking them to the nearest table where she places both in front of her. Sitting with her hands resting in her lap, she inhales and exhales slowly, her mind now wide awake with the news. It takes her a few minutes to come up with a response. Rick picks up Laren's letter from the table next to her; he reads it. As the worry begins to cross his face, he reads her composition over her shoulder as she writes. \n\nTime waits for none, but the tiger and so it shall, nowhere near the fire. Hunter with tiger pelt will greet, beyond yonder hill the sun they meet. Together no stone will be left unturned, the sun will set, never to return.\n\nMora folds the note. Rising, she walks back to her friend and hands it to him. As Rick comes over to join her, she reaches over and takes his hand. She quickly kneels down before him. She closes her eyes and presses the back of his hand to her lips. Everyone looks at her with surprise, though none more than Rick. Taking a deep breath, she looks up at him, still holding him tight.\n\n\"Prince Varickan,\" she starts, unsure of how to continue, \"I understand the customs of your country but I am asking that you pardon Captain Franklin and set him free as I need him to deliver my message. In return, I offer you the remaining years of my life, should you desire them.\"\n\n\"Prince!\" Franklin exclaims under his breath, \"This place only gets odder.\"\n\nRick's brow crinkles together. He cups Mora's face in his hands, smiling sadly at her. He pulls her up and into a standing position. Letting her face go, he wraps his arms around her waist so that he can draw her close. His forehead rests against hers, speaking in that tender, private tone, \"I desperately desire all of the years of your life but it is worth more than you ask. I wish only to honestly earn your affections. Captain Franklin is pardoned; he is allowed to move freely between our borders as necessary.\"\n\nShe closes her eyes; wishing to lean in, to melt into Rick yet she restrains herself. She smiles at him, \"Thank you.\"\n\nTurning back to everyone, she fidgets with her vest awkwardly; she can feel herself blush, \"Captain Franklin, if you would be so kind as to take that message to Advisor Laren...\"\n\nHe bows, chuckling, \"Amyee will be pleased by this.\" When he rises, he gets an over exaggerated look of aggravation on his face, \"You must come and assure that monster that you are fine or he will never leave.\"\n\nOutside, Jacob hesitantly holds on to the very end of Graystar's reins, obviously terrified of the animal. The horse paws the ground angrily, huffing with impatience. As soon as he sees Mora he lets out a loud whinny and jumps up onto the boardwalk in front of the tavern. She rests her cheek against his forehead, rubbing his chin and whispering to him softly. Standing next to him, his size makes her seem like a child. She tugs playfully on one of his ears before standing back; the demeanor of the animal has completely calmed and he waits patiently like an old mule for Franklin to mount.\n\nAs Franklin climbs upon the beast, he offers Mora a small smile, clearly pleased that she has finally found a match. His smile fades when he looks to Rick; straightening up in the saddle, he attempts to threaten the man, \"I hope that you realize how much Derven loves its Princess. Should you hurt her, in any way...\" he shakes his head at the idea, \"hundreds of men will be after you, but they will arrive only to find your body torn to shreds by a herd of frightening women, led by my Amyee. Tread carefully, Prince Varickan, we are not a people to be messed with.\"\n\nGreystar turns and begins to trot back to the woods; Daniel and James escort him, leaving Sari behind. Rick looks at Mora, unnerved by his threat but managing a grin, \"Are all women of Derven as angry as you?\"\n\nShe smiles, appreciative of the brotherly love that Franklin has developed for her, \"Oh yes. And all of them fight almost as well as I do.\"\n\nHis smile fades, \"You aren't going to tell them I broke your shoulder, are you?\"\n\nShe laughs, \"If I do, I'll make it clear that I almost killed you after that.\"\n\nOnce the horses turn off the main thoroughfare and to the road that leaves to the border, Sari begins to bicker, \"I can't imagine that any woman would subject themselves to his company\u2014this Amyee, is she his wife?\"\n\n\"No, Amyee is his sister,\" she turns from the road to her friend.\n\n\"Poor girl,\" Sari says.\n\nWinking at her, Mora smiles, \"I think he likes you, Sari.\"\n\n\"What! Did you see how he talked to me? I can't imagine a dog would ever like that man...\"\n\nRick tucks Mora's arm under his and leads her back into the tavern. The three sit around a table, joined by Todd and a bottle of wine. Mora drinks from her glass slowly. She finds that she likes the taste, even if it comes from a sacrifice-nourished tree hidden in a cave. Rick remains seated next to her, his chair pulled up close so that he can lean his arm over her arm rest to hold her hand; he rubs the back of it idly with his thumb. Unable to stop herself, Mora leans towards him, resting her head on his shoulder. She no longer feels ashamed at their display of affection; their companions seem just as happy for them as they are. \n\nSari reads Laren's letter. Her eyes narrow, mouth forming the words but not speaking them. Frustration grows on her face and after trying to figure it out for a while, she gives up, \"Out with it then, what does it mean?\"\n\nUsing his free hand, Rick plays with the bottom of his wine glass, \"I think it means that King Irron plans on meeting Mora tomorrow. Doesn't sound like he's too happy, either\u2014am I right?\"\n\nShe nods her head against him, not to thrilled about seeing Irron again, \"It sounds like Laren caught wind of it. I'm guessing that King Irron thinks my father was forced into it by Queen Sheynne and that it was against my will, so he wants to meet with me. Probably to assure me of his undying love or to declare war in my name. Laren wanted to know if he should tell my father.\"\n\nTodd fills her glass again, \"And what did you say back?\"\n\nRick looks down at Mora, trying to see her face but he can't because she's so close, \"You told him not to tell your father until it was too late, right? I don't think I quite understood the rest of it, though...\"\n\nShe knows he's lying but she affirms his suspicions, \"I told Laren that you would take me to meet King Irron and that I would tell him where my heart has led me. However I don't think that it will end peacefully and no matter what happens it will most likely start a war.\"\n\nLucas busts through the tavern door, out of breath like he ran from the castle, \"Queen Sheynne sends word that King Irron demands to see the Princess, in the Meadow tomorrow evening. She has sent word to the General to prepare for war,\" he swiftly walks over to Rick and the others, dropping his voice even though they are alone, \"She has asked me to ride to Geofen. The Queen wishes for me to bring Prince Phillip to the neutral ground but keep him out of sight so that he may see the true nature of King Irron. I don't know why but she thinks that if he sees Mora tell Irron the engagement is off, that they will side with Sceadu. She said,\" he shifts uncomfortably, looking at Rick, \"that she would like Prince Varickan to accompany her and Mora to the border tomorrow.\"\n\nMora suspicions are affirmed. Queen Sheynne was hoping that Mora's presence would spur Rick to claim his place as Prince and that they would fall in love. She now knows that because the Queen asked her father to simply give them the opportunity, not demand or threaten like King Irron, that he complied. She doesn't, however, understand what path her father means for her to travel so that everyone can 'rest in peace.'\n\n\"Yes, the Prince shall accompany them,\" Rick replies. He squeezes Mora's hand.\n\nAs Lucas begins to leave, Daniel and James come back. They walk into the bar, the look of disbelief on their faces. James speaks first, \"That Captain Franklin of yours,\" he says to Mora, \"I hope that all men of Derven aren't as...\" he doesn't even know what to say. He throws his arms up, looking to Daniel for help.\n\n\"I think he likes Sari,\" Daniel spits out.\n\n\"What?!\" Sari shrieks; despite her attempt to look disgusted, her face turns bright red.\n\nDaniel and James sit down; seeing Sari's face they continue with the full intent of embarrassing her, \"Oh you should have heard that man!\" Their faces crinkle with a disapproving look and they attempt to mimic Franklin's gruff voice, \"Does she have a husband?\"\n\n\"Is she seeing anyone?\"\n\n\"What does she like to do?\"\n\n\"I bet a woman like her has to be so strong in order to beat down all of her suitors.\"\n\nSari, grinning uncontrollably, buries her embarrassed face in her hands. Lucas, Daniel, James and even Rick can't help but snicker at her expense. She peeks out at Mora, looking for help.\n\nAll Mora can do is smile. She loves Franklin like a brother and wouldn't ever approve of anyone less tough than Sari, \"I told you so. Ever since I've known that man the more he complains about something the more he likes it. And,\" Mora adds quietly so that only Sari can hear, \"Even though he can beat most men by pure strength alone, he hasn't yet come up with enough cunning to win a fight against his sister or I.\"\n\nThe group of friends tries to laugh and joke, making the best of the ominous situation that the new day brings. Having already accepted Mora as one of them, she begins to open herself up to the idea of having friends who don't care what her title is. The fact that they welcome her and treat her as an equal instead of a superior makes her feel like a true person. As the dawn approaches everyone begins to grow somber, knowing that they will soon be at war. Todd packs a few supplies for Lucas' trip. He reluctantly says good bye, hugging Mora to reassure her that he is glad to have gotten to know her, \"Even if you emasculated me in front of everyone when you beat my ass into the ground.\"\n\nJames and Daniel playfully shove her, James saying somewhat apologetically \"I'm still not sure who would win, in a fair fight between you and Rick.\"\n\n\"My wager is on you though,\" Daniel winks.\n\nMora smiles and says jokingly, \"If Rick and I ever were to fight again\u2014and I don't think that we ever will\u2014it would be to the death.\"\n\nSari shifts uncomfortably in front of Mora, waiting for Rick to walk Daniel and James out. She avoids her eyes, mumbling, \"Do you really think that he likes me? I don't know how that would work, with us living in two different countries and all...\"\n\n\"Love will always find a way,\" her reassuring voice captures Sari's attention, \"I mean, look at me\u2014I never thought I could love someone but from the moment I saw Rick...I was doomed. And I was engaged to his enemy; I was stuck between a rock and the ground with no way out. But, it found a way and now I am free to give my heart to whom I please.\" Mora smiles to herself, scarcely able to believe that she has finally found her match.\n\nSari squeezes her shoulder, now sharing her smile, \"We will all ride with you to the border tomorrow.\" As she walks past Rick to leave the bar, the bounce in her step is noticeable. \n\nTodd begins to lock up behind her when Mora notices Rick standing only a few feet away; he heard their conversation. \"Doomed, huh? From the moment you saw me?\" He walks to her, his hands deliberately lingering on her skin as he slides them around her body. He doesn't ask if she needs help, he simply picks her up and cradles her in his arms, walking to the stairs.\n\nShe rests her face in his chest, her fingers grasping his shirt tightly, \"I wanted to tell you...but I couldn't. I am so sorry that I wasn't honest from the beginning.\"\n\n\"When I first saw you in the castle, standing before me half broken, weak and timid\u2014I knew that there was more to you,\" his voice softens as he recalls the first day they met, \"I knew you would be the end of me. I have known many women but the moment I gazed into your eyes\u2014I was lost to this world. My life could never be complete without you.\"\n\nAs they enter the bedroom, Mora wraps her arms around his neck. He gently lowers her body to the ground behind the screen. His hands wander from her waist, up her sides and arms to her hands, where he unclasps them from behind his head. Still holding on to her hands, he twirls her before him, pressing her back into his chest. Her body is still weak from all the blood she lost and she isn't able to get undressed by herself. She can feel her skin tingle with excitement when his hands wander over her stomach to her vest. His fingers trace the vest's path up to her shoulders, where he takes hold of it to pull it off. With his touch sliding under her shirts and up her back, Mora feels her knees begin to get weak; she leans herself against him after he takes her shirt off. Being a gentleman, Rick slips her night gown onto her, remaining behind her, so he only ever sees her bare back. \n\nWith the gown drifting down her length, Rick crouches behind her so that he can help her with her pants. Mora is forced to turn toward around and lean over his shoulder when her knees finally give out. As he takes liberties with the path his hands follow up to her waist, she lets her own trace their way down his back and latch on to the bottom of his shirt, pulling it up so that she can put her face against his skin. When he gets her pants down, he wraps an arm around her thighs so that he can lift her slightly to pull them off of her feet. After he sets her back down he begins to rise but she doesn't let go of his shirt until she succeeds in pulling it off over his head.\n\nHe gathers her up into his arms, letting his face get buried in her hair. Carefully, he sets her down in the bed as he had done for the past four nights when he tended to her shoulder but instead of climbing in after her, he turns and snuffs out the lights. Mora waits and though she finds it hard to hear anything over the pounding in her chest, she knows that he stands in the shadows, unsure what to do.\n\n\"Will you lie with me?\" She asks the darkness. There is a pause as Rick hesitates. The bed shifts beside her when he climbs in. Large, strong hands find her body and pull her close. She turns to him, drowning his lips with hers. Never before in her life has she felt so safe, so complete. As her hands trace the lines of his chest, she wishes this moment would never end. Rick presses his hand into her lower back trying to melt into her flesh. She forces herself closer, wrapping her leg around his waist.\n\nShe can't think of anything she has desired more, anything she has needed so badly before. Her body pulses with passion, voice airy when she tries to catch her breath, \"I want you.\"\n\n\"You have me,\" he whispers, face buried in her neck. His hand slides up her thigh, fervently gripping at her skin. She tries to tug at his pants but their bodies are so entwined she can't free her hands. She bites at his shoulder, frustrated at the listless pace of their passion.\n\n\"I want you to take me,\" she clarifies, surprised by the amount of sternness in her voice. Her ravenous appetite for his body consumes her.\n\nHe rolls, turning her onto her back. Though he presses himself against her and his hand wanders from her thigh further up her gown to her ribs, his kisses slow, the frantic desire behind them softening. He continues to hold her tight, but rests his cheek against her chest. She starts to fear that she did something wrong, but his voice, husky with restraint, calms her worries, \"Believe me when I say I want to take you, but...we need to wait until the time is right.\"\n\nMora's body groans with impatience, but she knows that he is right. She wraps her arms around him, tangling her fingers in his hair; she tries to quell the yearning inside herself. Knowing that she now has Rick and that he has her, she assures herself that there isn't any reason to rush. There is a proper order in which things need to be done and she must first tell King Irron to his face that she wants nothing more to do with him. Then she will be free.\n\n\u2003\n\nCHAPTER 22: DECEPTION\n\nShe awakes to the sweet sound of Rick's voice accompanied by the caress of his hand on her face, \"Time to get ready, Mora.\"",
        "She leans against his touch, not wanting wake up and spoil the moment. Reluctantly, she opens her eyes. The man standing before her, though the face is familiar, is completely transformed. He is dressed like proper royalty and for the first time she sets eyes on the Prince of Sceadu. Wearing a white button up shirt under a lush, deep green over coat and dark pants he seems suddenly out of place in the humble room. His blonde hair is brushed back perfectly, accentuating his handsome features. \n\nFeeling completely infatuated with him, Mora blushes at her hunter, \"You look...different.\"\n\nShe sits up, sliding out of the bed. Mora can't help but smile at him; she is looking forward to spending the afternoon alone with him in the carriage. He shifts his weight from one foot to the other, feeling uneasy about how she looks at him. Rick clears his throat, turning to walk across the room as if he just remembered something. He lifts up a black velvet box from the couch and carries it back to Mora.\n\n\"The Queen sent over a dress for you to wear,\" he sets the box on the bed and opens the lid. \n\nMora gasps, quickly covering her mouth. Rick mistakes her distaste for shock; he lifts the blood red dress out of the box. It unfolds neatly, the silky fabric flowing down to the ground. Rick tries to hand her the dress but she holds her arms close to her body, trying to find a polite way to decline, \"That is...my mother's color. It would be disrespectful for me to wear it...\"\n\nShe tries to smile at him but bright color seems unnatural to her and makes her feel nervous. While she is used to seeing her mother in a red dress in her portrait, she has never seen the color on another person in her life. \n\n\"Well,\" he appraises her for a moment before setting the dress on the bed, \"I'm afraid unless you want to go in pants, there isn't much choice...besides,\" he leans in, brushing his lips against hers, \"you should get used to wearing the color of a Derven Queen, Namora.\" Rick touches her cheek, trying to dissipate her anxiety. He hovers near her for a moment, hoping that she will come around but when she still looks warily at the dress he realizes that it is something she will have to overcome alone. Though he worries that she might need help, he only offers her a smile before turning and leaving the room.\n\nThe thought of wearing red makes Mora's stomach churn. Even though she is now free to choose whom she will spend her life with, she has begun to question if she is ready to be a Queen. Despite the fact that the cancelled wedding to King Irron was beyond her control, as is the inevitable war looming on the horizon, she feels selfish that the events unfolded in a manner that was amiable to her. Her conflicting feelings of the love she has for Rick and the love she has for the people of Derven make her wonder if she should have completely sacrificed herself and tried harder to keep the peace.\n\nShe busies herself by attending to her hair, brushing and twisting it as best as she can to hide the blood still soaked in it. Mora manages to pin it all back carefully before she takes off her night gown. Though her body quivers with panic she tries to tell herself that since she is in Sceadu, red is just a meaningless color. She forces herself to pick the dress up; it feels just like fabric. When her hands start to shake, Mora squeezes her eyes shut trying to imagine the color is anything but. She pictures a deep, luscious green that matches Rick's jacket. The dress slides over her skin like a snake but she keeps the image of Rick in her mind. She is able to open her eyes and smile when it dawns on her that he will be the one to take her dress off.\n\nIt fits differently from the white one with a square cut neck, tight sleeves that stop at her elbows and a slender waist--the dress emphasizes her womanly features significantly. Upon gazing at herself in the mirror she is taken aback, now able to see for the first time that she bears a resemblance to her mother. Her body begins to calm down as the confidence seeps back into it. Smoothing the fabric around her waist, Mora speculates that the Queen's dresser has a knack of picking out clothing to reinforce the events of a meeting.\n\nShe leaves the room, knowing this time that she will see it again. As she walks down the stairs with her head held high and her hands folded neatly in front of her, she understands that she must confront King Irron in order to begin creating a life with Rick, much like one must cross a bridge to get over a river. \n\nMora takes a deep breath before pushing the tavern doors open and walking outside. Before her, Rick waits patiently with Daniel, James and Sari. When her friends see her, despite her dislike of the dress, the looks on their faces makes her believe that it was the right choice. When Rick sees her, the look on his face makes her blush.\n\nJust as he begins to reach for her, they notice a black carriage coming down the road. Drawn by two magnificent looking black steeds, the elegantly crafted, well maintained carriage seems entirely out of place in the worn down town. As it pulls up to the boardwalk, she feels like a true Princess for the first time in weeks when Rick properly takes her hand to help her into the carriage. But when the coachman opens the door, both are shocked to see the Queen sitting inside. It never occurred to Mora that all three of them would ride together\u2014she assumed that the Queen would meet them in the Meadow.\n\nShe motions the pair to join her and they hesitantly comply. Mora's confidence retreats allowing her nervousness to once again take hold of her.\n\nQueen Sheynne's cold demeanor seeps into the air; none of them talk. Mora formally arranges herself in the seat, making sure her dress is draped adequately over her ankles before she clasps her hands in her lap. Within the close vicinity of the Queen, she is able to get a good look at her for the first time. Her tightly pulled back blonde hair is mounded on top of her head, inside her black crown. Her pale skin seems almost translucent and the same piercing eyes she shares with Rick draw the \n\nAs the ride draws on, the frigid silence between the mother and son causes her to feel like an intruder. She gracefully allows her head to droop so that she can stare at the floor.\n\nBeside her she can feel Rick's body tense with agitation during the duration of the almost two hour trip. When he finally draws in a breath to speak the Queen beats him to it, \"Thank you, son, for coming along on this trip.\"\n\n\"I didn't come for you, I came for Mora,\" the anger directed towards the Queen only emphasizes the mysteriousness of Rick and Mora's relationship. \n\nThough she can feel Sheynne stare at her, Mora keeps her face blank and her eyes down. She wishes to stay out of their dispute. When she feels Rick shift next to her as if he is angry at her for not coming to his aid, she realizes that he has been out of high society so long that he has lost the finer points of polite social interaction.\n\nSilence once again falls on the three of them. After about another mile of it, the Queen lifts a square box onto her lap from the bench beside her. She opens it slowly. Mora allows her eyes to look up though she doesn't raise her head. She is shocked to see a thick, dark, masculine crown in it, though shiny like metal it is crafted in such a way to appear as intertwined branches. Rick looks displeased. When the Queen reaches into the box, she doesn't pull out the crown but rather a small, ornate silver key. Mora recognizes the designs on it as a match to her chains and her collar.\n\nQueen Sheynne hands Rick the key; when he takes it, she speaks to Mora, who lifts her head up to give the woman her undivided attention, \"For the purposes of this meeting, I believe you will agree that it is necessary for you to appear to be here of your own free will and for King Irron to believe it was your choice to call off the marriage.\"\n\nRick turns to Mora, reaching for her collar. His fingers intentionally brush the back of her neck as he reaches around to find the small keyhole. It clicks quietly when he turns the key. Again his hand barely grazes her as he removes it from her neck; Mora hides her shiver by reaching up to touch her now bare skin. Though the collar is small and delicate, she feels lighter. Queen Sheynne continues to watch her; Mora lets her face remain calm, pushing away the heat that threatens to make her cheeks flush.\n\nShe keeps her voice level and neutral when she responds to the Queen, \"I am not here of my own free will? I thought my actions made my intentions clear, your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Queen's cold affect remains unchanged, \"You are of Derven; your actions merely emphasized your choice to take the path with the least amount of casualties.\" \n\nIt finally occurs to Mora that while Rick's feelings for her are obvious, she has kept her own sentiments hidden safely behind her learned nature. The Queen has not seen Mora's jealous outbursts, anger or laughter; all she knows of the Princess is the selfless acts she has done to save another. She briefly thinks of telling the Queen about her love for the Prince, but dismisses the thought when she realizes that words are but a poor substitute for action.\n\nSheynne continues, \"The place we meet King Irron is a large field of neutral territory that we call the Meadow; it lies south of the trees that mark the border of Sceadu and north of the public road. If you leave that field and therefore my custody I shall see it as a violation of the arrangement between King Nathanial and I, at which time I will have no choice but to declare war on Derven.\"\n\n\"That's absurd, Mora would never--\" Rick's voice is thick with the grit of his aggravation.\n\nMora cuts him off, trying to save him from the Queen's displeasure, \"Sceadu could never win; if I were to\u2014as you say\u2014violate your agreement with my father, it would be in favor of Alumenia. Your declaration of war against Derven would cause both countries to respond, surely you realize.\" She has no intention of leaving the field with anyone but Rick but the way the Queen speaks to her causes her anger to boil inside.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" Sheynne responds, \"and that would result in tremendous casualties to all three countries, a disaster that no Derven would want on their conscious.\"\n\nRick looks at both women, unsure exactly which he distrusts the most. Despite her intentions of protecting Rick from the Queen, the coolness of Mora's voice coupled with the words coming from it make him start to doubt her love of him. Mora can sense his worry and though she wants to reach out to him and assure him of her unwavering love, she is forced to maintain her hostile stance until she can prove to Queen Sheynne that her heart beats true, which can only be done through her actions against King Irron.\n\nQueen Sheynne finally breaks her stare with Mora. She carefully lifts the crown out of the box and leans toward her son. Rick stiffens, holding the open collar and key in his hands; he doesn't make a move towards her or the crown. Though she no doubt notices his contempt for her, the Queen chooses to ignore it. She perches the twisted metal on his head, turning it slightly so as to lock it in his hair. He isn't thrilled about it, but Mora's heart skips at the sight of Rick in his Princely appearance.\n\n\"It is also necessary for you to appear to be the Prince, Varickan,\" she says snidely towards him.\n\nMora has the feeling that they must be close and when the carriage pulls to a stop her hunch is confirmed. She turns her head to the small, stained glass window by her side. From the lack of trees, she knows they are now in the Meadow. The coachman opens the door; the Queen is the first to exit. When Mora shifts to follow, Sheynne's sharp voice halts her movements, \"I wish to speak to the Prince, privately if you don't mind.\"\n\nCaught off guard, Mora freezes in place. Rick looks over at her briefly before he gets out. The door shuts between them and even though they whisper, she can hear every word.\n\n\"Is this really necessary, Queen Sheynne? Hasn't Mora made her feelings clear? She isn't going to leave Sceadu,\" Rick's voice sounds angry, but with a slightly skeptical tone.\n\n\"You are foolish to trust her, Varickan. She may be a pretty face but underneath she is still the same woman who agreed to marry King Irron in the first place. I am only allowing this meeting because King Irron would attack Sceadu if I didn't.\" \n\nThe Queen's distrust of Mora is affirmed, though she can't tell which the Queen dislikes more: Mora and Rick together or Mora and King Irron. Though it was the Queen's decision to guide the two into falling in love, she wonders if Sheynne is regretting her choice. She obviously underestimated Mora's stubbornness, which has now resulted in her holding more power than any one ruling entity on the island. No matter what side she chooses, she understands that war cannot be averted but she senses the Queen's worry because Mora's choice will be the difference between Sceadu being attacked or Sceadu doing the attacking.\n\nRicks voice, still angry, draws Mora back to their conversation, \"He will attack us no matter what, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid I know that too,\" Sheynne's voice sounds mournful for a moment, before the harshness returns, \"Our only hope that Derven will choose to fight with us is if she remains here when he does. As soon as this meeting is over, Princess Namora is to be recollared. Under no circumstances is she to leave Sceadu, am I clear?\" When she gets no response, the Queen's voice drops, \"If she leaves, the punishment will be severe, even for a Prince. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" Rick spits out distastefully.\n\n\"You may let her out but she is to remain out of sight until we greet King Irron. We need to put distance between us and her, to emphasize\u2014\"\n\n\"The appearance that she is here of her own free will,\" Rick cuts her off in a slightly mocking tone. The Queen, obviously angered by his attitude, walks from behind the carriage and towards the center of the field.\n\nWhen the door opens, he extends his hand into the carriage to help her out. Eagerly she reaches for it but when his fingers wrap around hers and she climbs out of the coach, she instantly knows that the Queen's words have succeeded in placing the seed of doubt. His hand does not grip hers tightly, nor do his fingers rub her skin; instead, he holds her hand carefully as if she were no more to him than a stranger.\n\nShe looks upon his face to see rage and dubiousness, feeling worry show on her own. When he lets go of her hand, her heart drops. She forces her fingers to form a fist to stop from shaking. Mora doesn't know what to say to get him back. Tears well up in her eyes when he looks at her; her vision blurs when the tears threaten to fall but she feels his hands rest on her cheeks. He moves closer to her, touching his forehead on hers. Though he speaks with that tender tone, there is still a hint of suspicion in it, \"Mora, I want you to know that I lov--\"\n\nShe quickly closes the gap between them, stopping him short when she pushes her lips against his. The fact that he doesn't entirely trust her saddens her but she knows that she deserves it because of the secrets she kept. His hands reach up to wipe her face dry only to cradle it after; he leans into her, deepening the kiss. She braces herself against his chest, making herself pull away from him. Mora looks into his eyes, trying to convey her feelings genuinely, \"You can tell me tonight, when we are back in the tavern.\"\n\nHe smiles softly at her, still holding her face. Finally recognizing the woman he fell in love with, the doubt vanishes from his eyes. He leans forward once more, planting a tiny peck on her lips, \"Don't come out until the time is right. If anything happens, I will be right there.\" He kisses her once more before walking out to join his mother.\n\nNow alone, the nervousness begins to take over her body. She opens and closes her hands into fists, pacing uneasily behind the carriage. Though it shields her view of anyone, she can hear a dozen or so horses in the field beyond. She recognizes the quiet grumblings of Eric and Dell. When she catches a strong whiff of metal, she knows that King Irron and his guards have arrived. She can hear their conversations carried by the wind.\n\n\"Queen Sheynne, thank you for arranging this meeting. It is good to see that you are...well,\" King Irron's arrogant voice is thick with fake politeness.\n\n\"Likewise, King Irron. Have you met my son, Prince Varickan?\" Her voice is cold enough to cut glass.\n\n\"I do believe I have\u2014briefly. How are you, Prince?\" Though some would mistake real sincerity in his voice, Mora picks up on the sarcastic undertone.\n\n\"Lovely,\" Rick tries to say nicely but it comes out as a growl.\n\n\"Good to hear,\" Irron lies. \"Now, where is my soon to be wife? I wish to speak to her...\"\n\nMora inhales deeply; as her lungs fill with air, she forces her shoulders back and her chin up. She clasps her hands tightly in front of her and wraps her nerves with steel before she stoically walks from behind the carriage. She keeps her eyes still so as not to appear worried but takes in everything. King Irron stands about fifteen paces away from Sheynne and Rick; behind him are several guards, still mounted on their horses. They look alert, but mindless; their dark eyes make Mora feel uneasy. She sees Daniel, James, Sari and the three Wardens Eric, Dell and John, as well as a few others on top of their horses surrounding the backside of the Queen. The Meadow is large and they are closer to the public road than to Sceadu. She has suspicions that King Irron made sure of that.\n\nShe has almost completely forgotten the hue of her dress, but when her eyes fall on Irron she is reminded once more that she wears an unnatural color. At the sight of Mora, clad in red, Irron's face has a truly shocked expression, \"Oh, my love, that color is ravishing on you,\" he says loud enough for everyone to hear and for the first time he actually means the words he speaks. \n\nShe stops in the space between Irron and Sheynne, perfectly dividing the two. Grabbing the middle of her skirt with her right hand she flourishes a beautiful curtsey to Irron, \"King Irron, what a pleasure.\" Though it is a lie, Mora makes a little more effort to be convincing than he does.\n\n\"There is no need to bow to me, Namora\u2014soon we will be wed,\" he purrs to her in a tone suggesting that they are more familiar with each other than is true. \n\nShe clenches her jaw and refrains from sneering with disgust. Her voice, overly sweet, replies \"Oh, King Irron, don't toy with me,\" she rises, looking innocently at Irron, \"You know my father has called off the wedding.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had heard...but I thought perhaps your sentiments haven't changed,\" he steps closer to Mora. She can hear the Sceaduians behind her tense nervously; it takes all she has not to step back away from him. Holding as still as a sculpture, Mora stands her ground as he approaches her.\n\nIrron slowly reaches out and takes her hand, bringing it up to his lips. He kisses the back of it, his eyes searching her face, \"Surely, my love, you realize that calling off this engagement will snap my heart in two.\" His voice has a hint of threat in it.\n\nThe moment he touches her, her anger flares up so quickly she almost slaps him. Instead, she lets a smile grow on her face, letting him hold onto her. Just when he\u2014and everyone else\u2014thinks that she has changed her mind, Mora pulls back her hand, clasping them in front of her, \"Snap in two, much like a burwood tree over a public road, I imagine.\" Her voice comes out colder than even the Queen could muster. While there is almost a sigh of relief behind her, she is close enough to Irron to see the vein in his neck begin to pulse faster.",
        "As King Irron stands upright, his expression begins to lose its charm and is replaced with what Mora guesses to be his true self, \"Why Princess Namora, I am afraid I don't understand,\" he says flatly.\n\n\"Oh you don't?\" The frigid sarcasm in her voice is obvious. She turns from Irron to look at his guards, searching from face to face. Though they all look different, they share the same blank eyes. Finally, she spots the one she is looking for; his face is dotted with healing scratches and though he sits tall on his horse his right arm seems to rest awkwardly at his side. Frankly, she is surprised that there is only one injured guard, but then she realizes that the others are probably too crippled by their injuries to be of much use to Irron. Mora holds out a slender hand, pointing at him, \"Perhaps your guard could remind you.\"\n\nKing Irron looks stiffly at the man before turning back to Mora, warning her to rethink what she says, \"I think your imprisonment in Sceadu has begun to affect your rationality.\"\n\nShe smiles tightly, \"A piece of advice, my King\u2014the proper way to cut down a burwood tree is with a saw, not an axe.\"\n\nEven though she is prepared for it, Mora's body is still weak from the previous day, so when King Irron wraps his left arm around her neck she is unable to avoid it. He spins her so suddenly she almost loses her footing. Pressed against his body, she is now facing the Queen. \n\nThough Rick tried to rush to her aid, the Queen has a firm grip over his wrist, stopping him from saving her. Mora locks onto his eyes; not only is he furious but he is also terrified at losing her. He tries to wrench free from his mother's grasp but Mora shakes her head slightly, telling him not to. His face darkens with rage.\n\nBehind them, the Wardens along with Daniel, James and Sari dismount their horses before stepping cautiously forward, swords drawn. When Irron reaches across Mora's body with his right hand, drawing his own sword, everyone freezes. She knows that she is on her own; her mind frantically tries to come up with a plan. The more she squirms the tighter he squeezes, his unforgiving arm threatening to crush her throat.\n\nHe whispers into her ear but she knows that the wind carries his words to the others, \"It is a shame really, that you managed to live. I was counting on your death to ignite the rage against Sceadu but now I guess I will have to improvise. I am sure that after I kill you, I will be able to convince the Geofens that it was really Prince Varickan and his unkind ways that caused your death.\"\n\nHis chest feels hard against her. She recalls the time he almost broke her wrist with the plate of steel around his middle. Her plan begins to piece together. He starts to drag her backwards towards the public road. She lets her body go limp, forcing him to slow down when he has to carry her extra weight. He shifts his hand from around her neck to just under her arm to compensate, releasing his tight hold on her throat. Desperately, she inhales, forcing the air into her muscles; she hopes that she will be able to summon enough strength. Slowly, everyone moves forward to follow them. Mora thinks she can see the veins pulsing in Rick's neck as he tries to restrain himself from running to her aid. She tries to stall Irron until she can find the last piece of the puzzle, \"King Irron\u2014you know my father will fight with the Sceadu.\" \n\n\"I beg to differ, my dear. I will simply let him know that if he does, I will ensure that each and every person who fights against Alumenia will be tortured and murdered. Any Derven, even your father, couldn't stand the thought of allowing that to happen,\" he purrs to her, his voice thick with pleasure at the thought of death.\n\n\"King Irron, please stop...,\" she lets her voice go small and weak, surprised at how good her acting has become over the past few weeks; she adds a touch of longing, \"I will go with you.\" \n\nMora knows her lie is convincing when the Sceaduians before her stop, dead in their tracks. The hurt look on Rick's face gives her anger enough fuel to cause her skin warm. She feels slightly betrayed at the idea that he, of all people, believes her. However, his disbelief combined with Sheynne's outrage are enough to make Irron stop. From the corner of her vision she can tell they are but steps away from the public road. Mora clenches desperately at the sides of Irron's cloak, pretending to use her hands to brace herself while she regains her footing; with his face pressed against hers, she can feel his stubble scratch her cheek as he begins to smile. When she finds what she is looking for, she lets her feet plant into the ground. Her hands remain still, grasping his cloak tight; though it appears that she holds on to him for protection, in actuality her left hand is clamped over the wooden knife in his belt.\n\n\"Oh really, my love?\" Irron tilts his head forward, letting his lips press against the curve of her neck. She focuses on Rick\u2014Sheynne no longer holds him back; completely dumbfounded by her betrayal, he stands alone with his arms folded over his chest. Mora has to close her eyes to block out the pain she causes her love; she leans her head to the side, offering up her skin to Irron. His mouth runs along her neck back up to her ear, \"I would prefer you be dead, but I suppose I would rather enjoy bedding you first,\" he breathes to her. \n\nHis arm loosens as he takes a hold of her right shoulder to spin her around. Filling herself up with all of the hatred she has towards him, she feels her face grow cold when she opens her eyes. She is able to catch a brief glimpse of shock on Sheynne's face when it dawns on her. As King Irron spins her to face him, Mora slides the dagger out of its sheath and swings her arm upward with the momentum. She catches him alongside his cheek, leaving a long red gash. He shouts with surprise and drops his sword. When he reaches up to cover his face, he releases Mora. She quickly hikes up her skirt and plants her foot square in his stomach, kicking him harshly backwards onto the public road.\n\nShe inches away from him, hands holding her skirt and raising it a little so that she doesn't trip over it. Mora tilts her head to one side, voice heavy with sarcasm as she backs up, \"I am shocked, King Irron, that those beautiful words have yet to secure you a wife...\" She stops fifteen paces away from him, before releasing her skirt to hide her feet as they plant themselves firmly into the ground. Her body is intentionally turned away from him with her left side forward so that she can hide the dagger in her right hand behind herself. She grasps the blade so tightly in her fingers that it slices into her skin. Though her body is rigid, preparing for attack, no one can tell.\n\nIrron scrambles to his feet, angrily grabbing a sword from one of his guards, \"It is a shame you are so beautiful, Princess Namora. I will almost regret not having you to myself before you die.\" \n\nIt is almost as if time begins to slow. She watches Irron's knuckles turn white from his grip on the sword. His whole body shifts forward as he prepares to run at her. With perfect form and execution, her body winds up and releases--before anyone has a chance to react, the dagger leaves Mora's raised hand. She can see each spin it makes, knowing exactly where Irron will be when the two impact. It hits him in the right shoulder with such force that he is thrown off balance before he can bring himself to a stop. The sword falls from his useless hand. She feels a wicked smile form on her face when she knows her perfect aim has completely severed the muscle that controls his dominant arm. The satisfaction she gets from seeing his face change from shock to rage to pure agony makes her own bleeding hand stop hurting.\n\nClearly in pain but full with anger he screams at her. He has to hold his right arm tightly with his left so that it doesn't move while he backs away towards his guards. Through clenched teeth he snarls at her \"I declare war! One week, right here!\"\n\nIrron has to be helped onto his horse before they gallop away as fast as possible.\n\n\u2003\n\nCHAPTER 23: WARDEN\n\nMora doesn't move until she can no longer see King Irron and his troops. Her body slowly relaxes. She turns towards the Queen and Rick but avoids their eyes by focusing on her sliced up hand. She is upset that Rick thought she would betray him. When she finally raises her head to look upon him, the hurt in her eyes instantly makes him regret his reaction. He stares back at her, apologetic and remorseful.\n\nShe is about to say something when the sound of hooves make her tense again. She whips her head around, spotting the source of the noise before anyone else hears it. From the western edge of the field, Lucas rides next to an older man. Clad in teal, he is accompanied by several armored warriors. When they reach Mora and dismount, she looks him over. His rich brown face appears boyish, sleek black curly hair only adding to his youthful exotic appearance; then she spots the crown on the man's head.\n\nBefore she has a chance to curtsey, the man stops in front of her and takes a knee. His deep voice contrasts his looks, \"It is a pleasure to meet you, Princess Namora.\"\n\nShe steps back a little, shocked at the sight of an equal kneeling down before her, \"Prince Philip...you do not have to kneel before me.\"\n\nHe smiles, \"I choose to. I have seen everything from the woods over there,\" he points over his shoulder, \"and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. I have never seen a woman like you...nor do I think I ever will. While your father is a great ruler, Derven will be a force to reckon with once you take his place.\"\n\nMora closes her right hand when her blood starts dripping into the grass. She manages a tight smile, suddenly queasy when she remembers her red dress, \"Those are very kind words, Prince Phillip.\" She feels out his intentions as he rises to his feet, \"Hopefully I will get a chance to rule Derven, if we are able to defeat Alumenia...\"\n\nHe stands and genuinely places his hand over his heart, \"By my word, Geofen will be here to help you and your friends.\" Phillip turns and bows deeply to Queen Sheynne, \"If you will open your borders to us, our army, will be here in three days.\"\n\nShe nods gratefully, \"All of Geofen is welcome.\"\n\nPhillip flashes Mora a brilliant smile which makes her blush. He extends his arm forward; she politely places her uninjured hand in it. Very gentlemanlike, he brings it to his lips and kisses the back of her hand, \"I hope to see you again, Princess Namora.\"\n\nShe smiles at him, \"And you shall, Prince Phillip.\" Mora doesn't have to look over to know that Rick wears the green mask of jealousy on his face, at the idea of another man touching her so. She can't help but think that he deserves a little punishment for not trusting her earlier.\n\nPhillip mounts his horse and turns west, riding away with his troupe. Mora watches him go not because she cares but so she can avoid Rick's piercing gaze. Feeling the blood drip down her finger tips, she holds her hand out slightly so as not to ruin another dress. When she hears everyone begin to walk back to their horses, Mora turns to follow and is relieved to only see the back of Rick's head as Queen Sheynne talks to him.\n\n\"So...the Princess fights?\" She states, more than asks; the surprise in her voice it irritates Mora.\n\n\"Hard to believe your Majesty but she has quite a temper,\" he says somewhat proudly.\n\nWhen they reach the coach, Sheynne looks back at Mora. The distain from earlier is now gone but it is replaced with the knowing smugness that Mora saw when they first met. The Queen looks to Rick before she says, \"I think I fancy some fresh air. I will take a horse back to the castle; you two can ride back in the carriage.\"\n\nLucas offers up his horse for the Queen. She mounts it gracefully and without delay she turns and trots back to town. Though John, Dell and her guards follow her at once, Eric seems to linger behind briefly. Mora keeps her eyes down, knowing he wishes to talk to her; she doesn't have enough energy to deal with both him and Rick at the moment. Sensing her avoidance, he rushes off after the royal entourage. \n\nLucas climbs up onto the carriage next to the coachman while James, Daniel and Sari all get onto their horses, each one smiling at Mora.\n\n\"That's my Princess,\" Sari says with a wink before she turns her horse and starts back towards town with the others.\n\nWaiting for her outside the carriage, Rick watches Mora as she walks towards him. He nervously holds the collar in his hands. Though she knows she can't be mad at him for much longer, she keeps her face blank to punish him a while more. She stops before him, watching him squirm. Finally, he lifts the collar up and slides it around her neck but he hesitates, not locking it. His hands rest on her shoulders before his arms drop to the side, \"Mora, I can't begin to tell you how...\"\n\nHe stops when she reaches up but instead of touching him like he thought she would, she clicks the collar shut. Without a word, she climbs into the carriage. He slides in behind her, shutting the door. \n\nMora stares down at her fist; it is sticky with drying blood. She no longer feels upset with Rick but she doesn't exactly know how to move on from her cold disposition. When she opens her hand, the wound stretches wide, causing it to bleed again. Rick's hand reaches for hers; she looks up at him when it takes it. She watches him slowly bite down on his lip until it starts bleeding.\n\n\"I am so sorry I didn't trust you. It was foolish of me,\" he pauses, bringing her palm to his face. She can feel lips press against her hand, mouth forming words against her skin, \"It just seemed impossible that someone as beautiful and magnificent as you could truly want to be with me.\" \n\nShe shivers when his tongue drags along her palm, cleaning up the remaining blood. He lowers her hand and but doesn't let go. His bite has already healed but his lips are still bright red. Slightly taken aback, she doesn't know what to say in response to him. Instead of speaking, she leans forward. She licks their mixed blood off of his lips before pressing her own against his. \n\nWhen she sits back he looks at her gratefully, relieved that she forgave him. The two sit in silence for a while, lost in each other's eyes as the carriage sways back and forth with the lethargic pace. Finally, Rick speaks again, \"Your aim was a little off. A man's heart is here,\" still holding onto her hand, he lifts it and presses it over the left side of his chest. She watches him for a moment before she moves across the carriage to sit next to him, in the middle of the bench on his side. She leaves her hand on his chest.\n\n\"When King Irron came to Derven for his engagement party, he would follow me around the castle so that he could catch me when no one was around. One evening I tried to hide in the orchard but he discovered me. He sat next to me,\" she scoots closer to Rick, \"closer than he should have. He tried, very hard, to do things that should be saved for the privacy of a bedroom, not an orchard.\" \n\nWhen Mora sees the anger begin to show in Rick's face, she takes his left hand and slides it behind her back. Making sure she has his attention, she hikes her skirt up a bit to reveal her bare knee. Her usually hidden, pale skin contrasts greatly to the bright red fabric of her dress. She places Rick's right hand on her thigh. His touch sends a jolt of excitement through her body. She can hear his breathing become shallow when his fingers caress her skin.\n\nShe takes a big breath to steady her voice before she continues, \"He isn't a very kind man but I was in no position to be rude to him, since we were to be married,\" she slowly slides Rick's hand up her knee and to her inner thigh. Her heart pounds faster. She can tell that Rick is angry at the idea of another man touching her like this but he also is enjoying their reenactment.\n\nMora takes a hold of his right hand and lifts it up, pulling her dress back down before putting his hand back in her lap. She smiles embarrassedly, mimicking her own words in an overly feminine tone, \"I would say, why King Irron, it seems pointless for us to get wound up when we aren't able to do anything about it until after the wedding. But of course, that didn't stop him either.\" \n\nMora looks deep into his eyes as she takes a hold of his shirt. She leans backwards on the bench, pulling him down on top of her. She can't help herself when she tips her face up to his, lips touching. She gets carried away in his kiss, her body always wanting more. Rick runs one hand up her rib cage, letting the other find its way back under her skirt to the outside of her thigh, her purrs encouraging him. He presses his body against hers, kissing his way down to her neck. \n\nShe moans with excitement but pushes him slightly away from her when she remembers her story had a point, \"No, this didn't happen,\"\n\n\"It better not have,\" he says, breathlessly, sitting back a little.\n\nMora gently motions for him to come back towards her; when he leans in, he is stopped unexpectedly by her fist planted in his sternum, \"When he tried to do to me,\" she breathes slowly, calming her racing heart, \"what you just succeeded in accomplishing, I stopped him like this. He about broke my arm before he realized it was there. When I cried out in pain, he explained to me that he has a hard time feeling anything on his chest,\" she unbuttons his shirt so she can run both hands over his bare muscles, around his sides and to his back \"because he wears a metal plate around his middle. The only parts that are free are here,\" she points the soft spots below his shoulders while admiring his toned body. \n\n\"I didn't miss his heart because I didn't aim for it\u2014it would have done no good. Instead,\" she leans forward, nibbling on the skin near the spot she hit on Irron, \"I aimed for here so I could sever the muscles that control his sword arm.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" he leans forward. Continuing where he left off, his hands wander against her naked skin to find their place, \"you are too clever for your own good.\"\n\nRick lightly bites at the unclothed portions of her chest, Mora giggling with pleasure. She pulls his shirt out from his pants, determined fingers unbuttoning them. She slides her hands in them along his hips with the full intent of removing his clothing.\n\nThere is a soft rap on the door of the carriage.\n\n\"Rick, Mora?\" Lucas clears his throat, \"We're back at the tavern now...I'll...give you a few minutes...\"\n\nCaught up in each other, neither of them realized the carriage had stopped. Rick pulls back begrudgingly, looking longingly into her eyes, \"I think we should call it an early night.\"\n\nShe pulls her skirt down while he sits up and buttons his shirt. She can feel her face flush with a smile. \"I think you are right, I do feel awfully tired,\" she fakes a yawn. Mora turns to Rick, to help fix his ruffled clothing before they get out. She can't help herself when her hands run up his legs so that she can button his pants.\n\nHe smiles wickedly at her, \"You will be awfully tired if I have any say in the matter.\"\n\nHer mouth falls open with shock at his cheeky statement. He laughs and leans forward to kiss her on the cheek, tucking a stray strand of her hair behind her ear.\n\nAfter they have straightened themselves out, Rick unlatches the door. He slides out, fixing his overcoat before he reaches a hand back in to Mora. This time, when she takes it, he holds her tight, his fingers rubbing her skin. She avoids looking at Lucas, afraid that he knows just exactly what was going on inside of the carriage. Though she is now standing next to Rick, he doesn't let go of her hand. Mora can feel her face turn bright red when he winks at Lucas, \"I think the Princess and I both feel a bit more tired than usual...perhaps we will just go to bed.\"",
        "Following them across the boardwalk, Lucas laughs. He places his hands on the door knobs to the tavern and smiles regretfully before opening the door, \"I don't think you'll be able to.\"\n\nThe tavern doors swing wide open, revealing a bustling crowd. Dozens of people at tables, walking around and on stage stop moving when they see Rick. Collectively, they turn to him and bow. Flabbergasted, Rick leads Mora inside. They walk barely through the doors before the questions start.\n\n\"Is it true, Prince Varickan, are we going to war with Alumenia?\"\n\n\"Will any of the other countries help us?\"\n\n\"We need to train, will you help us your highness?\"\n\nStunned, Rick lets go of Mora's hand. He slowly reaches up to touch his head, realizing the crown is still on it. He takes it off, holding it in his hands like it is a magical object he has never seen before. He turns his back to the crowd, coming close to Mora. \n\n\"I want you...\" he whispers so only she can hear. His voice is full of wanton and regret.\n\nShe can't help but smile. She reaches out, her own hands stroking his before she takes his crown. \"You have me.\" \n\nShe looks at the people waiting eagerly for his help; Sceadu once again has a Prince. Mora swiftly trots up the stairs, a sense of relief washes over her when she walks into Rick's bedroom. It has become like a second home to her and she feels comfortable there. She changes quickly, grabbing her gloves on the way out, in a hurry to get back to the excitement downstairs. By the time she rejoins her friends, everything is in full swing.\n\nLucas and Daniel are standing separately, each with clusters of townsfolk around them. Daniel shows an old man how to hold onto a spear, demonstrating where to put your feet before throwing. Lucas wraps a young boy's hand around a sword, showing him how to stand just like he showed Mora her first night in the tavern. \n\nRick gives her a small grin; he is up on stage directing a younger man on how to attack James, who waits patiently on the other side. \n\nNear the door, Sari talks to the small handful of women who were brave enough to come into the tavern. All of the women look uneasy and rather small compared to her but they give her their undivided attention. Sari looks annoyed but dignified as if all of her hard work leading up to this day is finally acknowledged and justified.\n\nMora weaves her way among the crowd. As the tavern is almost full to the brim, she has to take a long indirect route to get to the bar, where Todd struggles to keep glasses full. He spots her and by the time she reaches him, he has a glass of wine waiting for her.\n\n\"Would you like something to eat, Mora?\" he asks politely, though it is obvious that he is stressed.\n\nShe smiles, \"Your cooking is wonderful Todd but I think that you have more important things to do than to tend to me.\" Not only does she not want to be a bother, she doesn't feel hungry. Mora can't tell if it is all the excitement or the wine that has caused her lack of appetite; she thinks it must be the excitement.\n\nHe nods before he rushes off to the backroom for more beer. Mora turns around, resting her back against the bar while she takes in all of the action, sipping her wine slowly. She has never before been a part of a war, let alone the cause of one. The closest thing she has to compare it to is the Huntress Festival; all of the women who have been through it no longer worry but each year the new girls that join them are excited and terrified all at the same time. Though the people of Sceadu are tough and trained, the air has a smell of apprehension in it. \n\nShe looks up when the door opens and sees John, Eric and Dell walk through, all clad in regular clothing. Mora can't help but smile at how odd they look dressed as normal people; they remind her of the first time she saw Rick and how his clothing seemed too tight. She figures they must have come to help with the training or at least Eric used that as an excuse to come talk to her, knowing he is probably upset that she ignored him in the Meadow. Mora doesn't really want to talk to him because she's afraid she will do nothing more than hurt his feelings; after seeing those women fawn over Rick, she knows how Eric must feel about her. Despite her reservations, she finishes her glass and leaves the bar to greet them.\n\nMora has noticed that her time in Sceadu has caused her inner anger to roam freely in her body. Though she still values the peace that all Derven hold dear, her temper remains unchecked which is dangerous because her anger is the first thing to react before her mind has time to reevaluate the situation.\n\nWeaving her way around the overly full tables, she is forced to pass by one with a particularly loud, drunk group of men. One of them makes the mistake of reaching out and slapping her on the backside, calling rudely to her, \"Bring us some more beer, wench!\"\n\nHer anger is quick to respond before she has a chance to consider his ignorance is due to his intoxication. Though all in the bar hear his shout, it isn't until Mora grabs his arm, twists it behind his back and slams his head into the table that everyone stops what they are doing to watch. She can feel her face growing hot, irritated that he would consider treating any woman like that.\n\nHer pleasant voice comes out with a growl, like velvet when rubbed the wrong way, \"In Sceadu, a tavern is where you go to get into a fight and happen to get drunk. Since you seem to already be drunk, perhaps you would like a fight instead?\"\n\nShe waits patiently for an answer but doesn't get one. Mora looks up at his companions; the whole table looks completely dumbfounded at the idea that a woman like her has their friend pinned. Their shock only deepens her irritation.\n\nShe twists his arm a little more causing him to scream in pain, \"I'm sorry, I don't think I heard your answer?\"\n\n\"No--no fight. I'm sorry, ma'am, that I touched your...rear,\" he cries out, almost in tears.\n\n\"Very well then,\" she lets go of his arm, feeling slightly bad that she hurt him over something so stupid.\n\n\"That's my Princess!\" Sari hoots from across the bar. Her words of encouragement cause Mora to smile, flustered. She turns away from the man and gives Sari a slight bow of thanks. When she rises, she sees that the Wardens have made their way across the room and now stand next to her near the rowdy table. Eric's sincere smile hits her with a pang of guilt. She freely looks him over, trying to come up with something to say. He is cleanly shaven, freshly groomed hair brushed back. Without his stubble, if one could ignore the sheer massiveness of his body, he appears soft and kind despite the scar on his face. \n\nHis green eyes wander over her; sensing her apprehension, he speaks first, \"How about a fight? I'm obviously more your type then he is,\" he continues to smile as he points over to the injured man. The drunk table bursts out in laughter. Eric, who stands more than a foot over Mora and is probably three times as wide, seems like a formidable foe. He is undoubtedly the largest man in the bar, his size even making Rick seem small.\n\nShe smiles at him, thankful for his lighthearted attitude. From the corner of her eye she sees Rick looking over at them from on stage. When she wonders if the expression on his face is concern or jealousy, she drops her head, removing her eyes from Eric's. She doesn't ever want to give Rick another reason to doubt her faithfulness. \n\nSpeaking to the floor, she says it louder than she intends, \"Don't you know, Warden Eric, you're only supposed to pick on people your own size?\" Despite the fact that the table of men behind her want to see her lose, they laugh at her comment.\n\nHe reaches out, lifting her chin gently. She feels malfeasance by the familiarity of his touch, knowing that Rick is watching; but Eric, the first man to touch her in a loving way, ignores the stares, \"Yes, but you don't know that, Princess. Besides, I need to assure myself that I beat you last time because I could, not because you were injured.\"\n\nMora pulls away from his touch, saddened to see the hurt look on Eric's face. She pulls her gloves from her pocket, rubbing the soft leather between her fingers. Though confused at first, the group of men behind her start to connect the dots; they shift nervously, whispering amongst themselves.\n\n\"Very well then,\" Mora gives in. She pulls her gloves on, turning from Eric to climb up onto the stage. The previous fighters, having just finished in a draw, take seats with the rest of the crowd gathered to watch the fight. Rick looks at Mora curiously; though she thinks he is jealous, she doesn't blame him. She was too, when those women sat on his lap. She offers him a wink as reassurance. He snorts at her, standing ready to proctor the fight.\n\n\"What weapons are you using?\" He softly asks Mora.\n\n\"Swords,\" Eric responds for her, climbing up onto the stage. It takes him less than six steps to cross it to the wall of weapons; he picks out two, handing the smaller one to Mora. \n\nShe takes it, twirling her wrist to check the weight. She finds that it has a feel similar to a staff; stretching her right arm above her head, she bends to the left to loosen her muscles while looking at Rick. His expression is definitely jealousy. Smiling to herself, she walks to the opposite side of the stage from Eric; the fact that he is jealous of the idea of her fighting another man seems absurd but it must mean that he loves her. Rick, standing near the wall in the middle, gives them the go ahead.\n\nEric trots to her, swinging the sword at her left side. Mora blocks easily, expecting the force of his hit to send a jolt of pain through her arm but it doesn't. She is surprised to see that his fighting style is significantly delicate, unlike the brutish rough one of Lucas. He is very experienced, moving deftly away from her attacks but coming right back without hesitation. They fight, moving back and forth across the stage, Rick circling them cautiously. Within minutes, Mora spots Eric's weakness. \n\nWhen he strikes her, she defends but twirls her sword around his, causing it to fly up into the air. She catches it easily in her left hand. Knowing that he should have been holding onto it tighter, she gets the feeling that he is pretending to be weak, to make her look better. She pauses for a moment before she throws it back to him, slightly irritated that he would try to throw the fight, \"You're not trying very hard, Warden.\"\n\nHe catches it easily, grinning at her in response \"Neither are you, Princess.\" \n\nFinally dedicating himself to the fight, Eric comes at her harder this time, swinging at her feet. She dives out of the way, tucking her body into a roll. By the time she draws herself up, she is astounded by how quickly he crossed the stage. His sword comes down from overhead. Mora holds the hilt of hers tight in her right hand, bracing the flat side of the tip on her left palm. There is a loud ringing sound when the two swords impact. Eric pushes hard against her, forcing her to step back or buckle under his weight. Not letting up, he tries to force her down to her knees but she keeps her body upright, retreating reluctantly until her back is pressed against the wall. Without the use of her hands, she's pinned under Eric's force.\n\nA cocky grin crosses his face, now assured that he could easily beat her in a fair fight; she shakes her head at him, knowing that he has once again underestimated her too soon.\n\n\"Ready to give in?\" He leans in so that he is inches from her face. He looks at her like a thirsty man looks at water. \n\n\"No,\" she says honestly. She sighs, already lamenting what she has no choice to do, \"but I will admit, you do have something I don't.\"\n\n\"What's that, darling,\" he mocks her, his arrogance giving her the last bit of affirmation she needs.\n\nWith a swift jerk, Mora's knee connects with Eric's groin. He instantly doubles over in pain, dropping his sword when he falls down to his knees; a collective groan comes from the men in the crowd while the few women try to hide their snickers.\n\nShe kicks his sword away from him, leaning down so she can see his face, \"Ready to give in, darling?\"\n\n\"Is that legal?\" Cringing, Lucas asks Rick.\n\nMora looks over to her love with a smile; his jealousy is gone, replaced by a small amount of pride knowing that she is his. Rick shrugs turning back to Lucas, \"All is fair in love and war.\"\n\nShe pats Eric on the back, \"Sorry, you didn't give me much choice. I'll count it as payback--consider us even.\"\n\n\"For what?\" He huffs out, getting to his feet with her help.\n\n\"You bit me, remember?\" She laughs, punching him in the arm, \"Now walk it off.\" \n\nHe throws his arm over her shoulder. Struggling under his weight, she does the best she can to help him off of the stage.\n\n\"So, what is this I hear about you and the Prince?\" He says quietly while he deliberately leans more of his weight on her to slow her down. Mora avoids his eyes. She can't help but smile at the thought of being with Rick. Since she doesn't know what to say, she keeps quiet. She finally finds an empty chair which she deposits him in. Eric finally catches her attention; he has a remorseful look, as if it finally occurred to him that he never stood a chance. She feels sorry that she hurt his feelings. Before she turns to walk away, he grabs her hand, making her look back at him. He offers her a smile, \"You deserve to be happy...but if you change your mind, let me know.\"\n\nMora reaches up, touching his cheek gently, grateful that he understands. \"Thanks for not killing me that day in the woods.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes, leaning against her hand. She quickly lets it fall to her side, not wanting him to suffer anymore. Before he can say anything else, she turns and walks swiftly to the bar, keeping her eyes focused on Todd. \n\nHe waits for her, sliding a full wine glass across the bar when she reaches him. As she brings it to her lips, she sees Todd look from her to something behind her, before looking back at her again. He raises a brow. Mora takes a long drink, the hair starting to stand up on the back of her neck. She slowly turns around to find everyone in the tavern looking at her. Cautiously, she sets the glass down, not sure what is going on.\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading!
