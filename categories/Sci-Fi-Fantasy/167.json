        "After saving the man's life, Kal was invited back to his house for lunch. He Insisted it was the very least he could do as thanks. His wife was wary of the mage until her son excitedly told the story of how a cat-girl fell out of the sky and ripped open his father's arm then moments later Kal appeared and healed him. The man confirmed the boy's story and explained their guest was the magic user who saved him while bringing to her attention the sleeve shredded by the cat-girl. Kal had cleaned the blood from his shirt with a little bit of magic.\n\nAs the man showed her the torn fabric, the mage reminded him to be careful with that arm as he had only taken the one healing potion and he would probably need another to mend the bone fully. He also mentioned that the man had lost a fair amount of blood and probably should be getting something to eat soon. Kal's explanation along with her husband's tattered shirt and pallid complexion finally convinced her their story was true. Sobbing, the woman ran into her husband's arms.\n\nKal was going to quietly exit and leave them to their moment but the son stopped him, reminding his father loudly that he invited the mage over for the midday meal. In the hour that followed, Kal sat beside a low table on a large, circular rug that took up most of the room and was treated to the best meal he had experienced in the city. He also slipped the man another vial of healing potion while his wife was in the other room. Finding out she nearly lost her husband seemed to make her quite amorous and clingy; Kal didn't want the man to accidentally re-break his arm due to some overly excited appreciation.\n\nLeaving their home, he ran across another of the cow-girl rickshaws. The woman was on a quiet side street away from any onlookers, squatting. Concerned at first she might be hurt, a moment later he heard the sound of splashing liquid. Kal could understand that the city folk might not want to see the girls take care of this particular function out on the busy roads.\n\nAs she stood up, Kal asked if she was available. His overly full stomach was not relishing the thought of hiking back across town and he thought the covered cart might make him a little harder to find just in case the cat girl hadn't given up for the day. With how scared she appeared when fleeing from him, he doubted she was going to make a second attempt.\n\nBlushing bright red and casting embarrassed glances at the puddle, which was quickly soaking into the dusty street, the cow-girl nodded. The woman had roughly the same build as the cow-girl from earlier except her pale skin was covered with large blotches of black tint. It looked as though someone threw ink on her and it stained her skin except for her bovine legs where the tinted skin became coarse black hair. She also had two tiny horns, one on either side of her head, that curved up and poked through her large straw hat.\n\nMuch like the girl this morning, she took note of his interest beyond just being a mode of transport and began to preen for him. On this nearly deserted side road she was much more overt than the woman from earlier as well. Staring at him with hungry eyes, she pressed her breasts together as if presenting them to him but what caught his attention was when she pulled a small brush off her harness and bent over to flick the dust off her hooves and reveal they were polished to a glossy shine. Kal resigned himself to never understanding women's obsession with their feet no matter what their species. To him, it was just another tidbit of proof that monster girls were women and not animals.\n\nUnfortunately for the cow-girl, it wasn't her shiny hooves that caught his attention but the view from the seat of the rickshaw. Kal retrieved some coins from Ria. He briefly contemplated summoning the avatar just for someone to talk with, but decided against it. He was probably going to get an earful anyway for not calling her immediately after being attacked. Kal counted out the coins into the woman's hand, then counted out the same amount a second time, instructing her to stay off the main roads and to make sure her hooves stayed clean.\n\nConfused at first, the cow-girl's eyes lit up and she was nearly shivering with excitement when she realized what he was asking of her.\n\nThe mage climbed into the covered cart and got comfortable as the woman pulling it flicked her tail to one side, making it lay across one of the poles connecting the cart to her harness. Taking her small brush, she dusted her hooves off once again. As she bent over, the mage could already see the moisture coating the lips of her sex and a moment later he breathed deeply through his nose as the scent of her arousal reached him. Checking to see his reaction as she stood back up, she glanced at his crotch before replacing the small brush and leaning into the harness.\n\nKal smiled. After the day he had, he was going to enjoy the trip back to the Inn.\n\nHe wondered on the way why he was doing this. Part of him still wanted to go chasing after the cat-girl despite the trail being cold as ice by now. He was angry that he had been attacked, confused as to why someone targeted him, and feeling guilty that he hadn't told Ria of any of this yet. He realized part of it was avoiding how angry he was and trying to let his head cool before tackling the situation he was in. This flirty and amorous ride back to where he was staying was doing an excellent job of distracting him whenever he felt the rage build up inside him.\n\nClose to his destination, he asked the cow-girl to take him to a place like where he found her. He assumed that she would know plenty of secretive spots for taking care of such business. A few minutes later she pulled Kal into an alley barely wide enough for her cart and with one end blocked off. Hopping out of the seat, Kal used the strength rune to leap over the cow-girl's head, surprising her.\n\nInstructing her to wait here, he handed her the small fee she required. Dropping the coins into her pouch, she nervously glanced behind her to see if anyone was watching before pushing her hat back off her head then bending over and opening her mouth, her broad, soft tongue extending in invitation. With a pleading expression, the woman's eyes shifted between his face and crotch.\n\nKal and the cow-girl both wanted to do something entirely different but back in Carriston Jerran had been quite firm that the cow-girl slaves would not allow a man to have sex with them, no matter how badly she wanted to, and that they were not allowed to touch themselves for fear of having them openly masturbating between fares. There was a hint of bitterness in the guild leader's voice that made Kal wonder if he had personal experience with being rebuffed by one of the bovine women.\n\nHowever, there were workarounds. As tempting as the woman's tongue looked, he wanted to do something just for her as thanks for hauling him around and giving him such a wonderful show in the process. Coaxing her back into a standing position he wetted two fingers in his mouth and reached for the large woman's sex. The cow-girl tensed in anticipation and Kal stopped, there was a little bit of fear hidden behind her lust. Unsure if she was scared being discovered or if there was something else in the slave collar's restrictions he didn't know about, he decided to be cautious.\n\nMoving slowly, he gently touched her mound, running his fingers through the white hair that was surprisingly soft. Continuing down, his fingers found the top of her sex and pressed in slightly until he felt her clit beneath his fingertips. He continued sliding his hand back until he heard a whimper from the bovine woman. Looking up, he saw the fear again as she shook her head so slightly it was barely noticeable. Moving his hand forward again made her visibly relax, until his fingertips brushed across her pearl. With her teeth and lips clamped together she let out a moan that sounded a lot like a cow's lowing.\n\n\"Ria,\" he called quietly as he began teasing the woman's clit in earnest.\n\nThe sprite appeared and quickly took in the situation before landing on his shoulder and whispering, \"How can I help?\"\n\n\"I want you to give her one of those treats you've been saving for Ikuno just before she comes.\"\n\nRia nodded before flying down between her legs for a better view.\n\nThe cow-girl started to roll her hips toward him and he was beginning to have difficulty keeping his fingers away from her entrance. It wasn't long before the woman's panting, muffled moans were nearly on top of one another and her body started to clench up.\n\nThe woman whined in protest when Kal's fingers stopped. \"Keep silent and open your mouth,\" he said quietly to the cow-girl. Confused, but too close to climaxing to care, she once again opened her mouth and extended her tongue. Three specks of light flew up and landed on the outstretched tongue, each turning into small white pools of his seed.\n\nHer eyes widened as the taste flooded her senses. At the same time, Kal's fingers began vibrating back and forth on her pearl. She felt the human's hand cover her mouth the moment her world exploded.\n\n\"Ria! Soundstone!\" the mage called out as quietly as possible. As soon as the small enchanted rock appeared on the ground, Kal spoke the command to activate it. It was a gift from Ikuno so he and Perra could be as loud as they wanted the night of Perra's birthday when she gave Kal her virginity. No noise could escape the area while people inside could hear any sounds coming in. When Kal removed his hand from the cow-girl's mouth, her orgasmic shriek bounced off the walls of the small alley until it hit the edge of the stone's enchantment.\n\nPanting, the bovine woman leaned forward and laid her chin on his shoulder as she recovered. When her breathing returned to normal, she lightly kissed his cheek before standing back up and mouthing the words 'thank you' which got her a small jolt from her collar. Ignoring the moment of pain, she put her hat back on her head and carefully backed the rickshaw out of the alley. With a final smile in Kal's direction, she trotted off toward one of the main roads in search of her next fare.\n\n\"That girl's going to be grinning like that the rest of the day thanks to you,\" Ria chuckled.\n\n\"I needed to do something good for someone else to offset how bad the rest of this day has been,\" he sighed before picking up the soundstone and deactivating it.\n\nThe sprite was still facing the end of the alley where the cow-girl disappeared but turned toward Kal at the unusual tone in his voice. \"That doesn't sound good.\"\n\nKal looked at the sprite hovering just above him, \"Someone tried to kill me, Ria.\"\n\n---\n\n\"This is not how someone who is being hunted should be acting!\" the sprite yelled at him the next morning. A bump in the road made the avatar bounce off Kal's shoulder for the fifth or sixth time since he rented the rickshaw.\n\nThe mage ignored her. Though it looked like he was staring intently at the backside of the cow-girl in front of him, in truth he was focusing on any signal from the ward he cast before they left the inn. A frown flickered across his face at the memory of learning the spell from the cleric assigned to his small hometown.\n\n---\n\nKal looked on in confusion as Elta stepped out the front door of her house. He had specifically not sent any word to the woman that he was coming to check up on her, yet the blonde woman stood calmly in her white robes on the steps in front of her door as though expecting him.\n\n\"Stop there, mage,\" she growled.\n\n\"You knew I was coming?\"\n\n\"No, when Perra mentioned you were stopping on your way through I cast a ward, so we didn't cross paths while I was unprepared.\"\n\n\"Perra said you were had gotten better when it came to me.\"\n\n\"Just because I can hear your name without soaking my undergarments doesn't mean that I can deal with walking around a corner and bumping into you face to face,\" she snapped. \"The people of Telsin don't need their connection to the Goddess ripping her clothes off and bouncing on the cock of the man she claims to hate.\"\n\n\"Do you still hate me?\"\n\nElta looked away, \"No, I don't. You didn't cause me to be like this, and instead of jumping at the chance to get me into your harem, you saw it as a last resort to save me. Now that I know how monster girls were made, I can't even hate you for consorting with demons.\" Her eyes met his again, \"But I can hate you for making me feel like this every time I see you.\"\n\n\"I thought you were getting help from the Tanner's son.\"\n\n\"That... didn't last long. It helped my urges but not my heart. I felt so guilty after each time we were together it was making me ill. Eventually, it became too much, and I had to put an end to it.\"\n\n\"Guilty? Why were you feeling guilty?\"\n\n\"Because I wasn't thinking about him,\" she said while giving him a stern glare.\n\n\"Oh,\" Kal replied lamely. \"You said you set up a ward to know I was coming?\" he asked quickly in a poorly veiled attempt to change the subject. \"Ikuno used wards to warn her of any possible intruders but I didn't know it could target a specific person.\"\n\n\"They can do more than that,\" said Elta, summoning a magic circle in front of her hand. \"As you probably know, wards ignore anything under the size of a normal dragonfly and alert you if anything else crosses the boundary. But wards can detect types of creatures as well. If you were out hunting and set one for 'deer' then it would alert you every time a deer or elk entered the area.\" As she spoke one of the glyphs changed from 'creature' to 'deer.' \"But if you saw a huge deer that you wanted to bring home for the supper table and got a tuft of its hair from a tree branch,\" the magic circle changed again, the glyph changing from 'deer' to 'human' before sigils in the outer ring shifted to allow three new glyphs for 'one,' 'match,' and a third which allowed the caster to choose a target. Holding up a small vial on a necklace she pulled from her robes, she removed the stopper and carefully pulled out its contents, a couple of hairs that matched those on Kal's head. Holding them up, she activated the spell and Kal's magic sight let him see the bubble of magic form, banishing and replacing the one already there. He had noted the existing ward on his way there but didn't know as he passed through that it was specifically for him.\n\n\"It looks like I have some studying to do when I get back,\" said Kal as the cleric's spell faded and she lowered her hand.\n\n\"You need to leave,\" said Elta.\n\nTaken aback, the mage was about to ask why when he realized he had crossed half the distance to the cleric while studying the variants of the ward spell she was showing him. Looking more closely, he saw that her face was flushed, and she was breathing heavily as she stared at him with desire burning in her eyes.\n\n\"She's about to break, Kal. Get out of there, she's not ready for this... yet,\" came Perra's thoughts through their bond.\n\nNodding as much in response to Perra's instructions as Elta's words, Kal said, \"I suppose you are right.\" Activating the flight rune pressed to his back and hidden beneath his shirt, Kal floated about a pace off the ground before activating the Jump spell his flight rune was partially based off. The spell sent him streaking straight up into the air before he turned and moved at a more languid pace toward Telsin's inn. Those last few moments had gotten tense, and he was thinking a tankard of ale might be a good way to relax.\n\nElta watched until he was out of sight, then stared longingly after him until one of the townswomen walked up to check if she was okay. Pretending she hadn't heard the woman call out to her, the cleric turned and slipped back inside her home before the lady could get close enough to see or smell the evidence of her arousal.\n\n---\n\n\"You're neglecting your women,\" said a black-haired dog girl later that night as she entered the library in his tent.\n\nKal looked up and smiled. Daxas's pack was still dedicated to patrolling around his farm in Kal's absence and it looked like the pack's Beta drew the assignment for the next few days. The woman's belly bulge from his last visit was gone as she had given birth to her and Kal's daughter while he was still at Prentas's Tower. Unfortunately, her milk-heavy breasts now looked too large for her frame.\n\n\"Hello, Alina. I'm not neglecting them nearly as much as you might think. Perra is still angry at me for checking on Elta earlier.\"\n\n\"Enough that you are sleeping out here?\"\n\nThe mage shook his head, chuckling, \"No, I'll be joining her and Talin later, I just need to look into learning more about wards. Before things got weird between me and Elta earlier, I learned they are a lot more useful than I at first thought. Part of the problem with learning magic from an immortal is that they always feel like they can come back and learn more about a subject later. They seem to stop once they learn the points of most immediate use then forget to revisit the topic. Even though I knew Ikuno used wards I never studied them because they felt so limited.\n\n\"Once I got this tent, I found it did the same thing automatically that Ikuno used them for. That took away any incentive to learn more. But after what Elta told me, I think I need to look into them again.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\" asked Alina, moving closer.\n\n\"I could use them to warn me if a monster girl is nearby, though I don't think I have the glyph right as it didn't signal me before you came in. Or maybe if mine and Perra's positions were reversed and I was mad at her I could make the ward warn me she was coming while ignoring everyone else.\"\n\n\"You had a ward up to warn you if I was coming?\" said the dog girl, sounding hurt.\n\n\"Not you specifically, but I'm playing with the glyphs and there isn't one I can find that covers all monster girls. I found symbols for canine- or insect-type monster girls and even harpies but nothing that encompasses all of you.\n\n\"Since you are here, would you mind helping me for a little bit? Elta uses the held version of the spell but I'm playing with the drawn version. I'd like to test what I've gotten so far.\"\n\n\"Do I get a reward for helping you?\" Alina asked, her canine ears lifting slightly as she glanced at his crotch.\n\nKal raised an eyebrow, \"Did you honestly think you were going to get out of here without letting me feel that amazing mouth of yours?\"\n\nThe black-haired retriever licked her lips and smiled, \"I certainly hoped not.\"\n\n---\n\nAs the rickshaw bounced down the road, Kal focused on the ward, worried that he might miss the spell's warning. The main restriction with wards was that their range was tied directly to their complexity. 'Creatures' had the largest radius but that shrank significantly when a type was added and continued to get smaller as the constraints piled up until it got to what he was doing, looking for a specific person. Luckily for him, the fleeing cat girl lost a few hairs from her paws or tail when she landed on the man yesterday and Kal plucked them off before cleaning the blood from his shirt.\n\n\"Are you even listening to me?!\" said Ria, her voice getting loud enough to make some of the people on the street take notice.\n\n\"Yes, I'm listening,\" he replied a few moments later. \"I understand this is not how I should be acting knowing that someone is hunting me, but I think that's exactly why I should be doing this. When I was chasing after the cat-girl, she wasn't just fleeing, she was terrified, she was shaken. She stuck a knife in a man's throat and instead of dying he pulled it out and was running after her. Now I'm wandering around the city as though nothing happened. She's tried to kill me twice if my guess is correct. Yet here I am, acting like I don't care. On her next attempt, I want her just as shaken and unsure, I want to force her to make a mistake.\" Looking forward at the cow-girl pulling the cart he added, \"Plus, the view from back here should raise my spirits a little.\"",
        "The bovine woman's step faltered at his words and she stole a glance over her shoulder at him. When the cow-girl looked forward again there was a slight smile on her lips and a sway in her hips that wasn't there a second ago.\n\nKal called out to the woman pulling the rickshaw, \"Just so you know, I don't have any real destination, I'm just looking to keep moving for most of the day. If you can think of any interesting views or places to go, then head in that direction. You know this city better than I do.\"\n\n\"Would you quit thinking with your dick and take this a little more seriously?\" Ria growled.\n\n\"I am taking it seriously,\" he replied, his eyes losing focus as he concentrated on the ward for a moment. When they focused again, he looked over at the glowing woman sitting on his shoulder. \"But I won't sit in my tent, cowering in fear.\" He looked down at his arms where his normal thick leather vambraces had replaced the lighter, less noticeable ones he made for his trip into the city, \"This time I know she will be coming. This time I'm prepared.\" Though Ria couldn't see it, each of the runes on the arm guards were glowing but were so faint they would only be visible in a pitch-black room.\n\n\"So why the tour around town for the entire day?\" asked the sprite.\n\nKal smiled, \"You'll see.\"\n\n---\n\nKashka cursed this infuriating human as she leapt from one rooftop to another, trying to keep up with the man's cart. She thought yesterday that he had two different cloaks when she didn't see the glow from the magic dye his cloak had been marked with at the bazaar. When he emerged from the Inn that morning, she was certain it was the same cloak he was wearing when she poisoned him, but he had somehow removed a dye that was supposed to be permanent.\n\nWhy was he doing this? There's no way that he could think she wouldn't try again. Did he think it was just a fluke that she attacked him? Did he feel like he ran her off and was safe now? Questions flooded her mind as she sprung over to the next rooftop, stumbling slightly as her feet came down on the sun-baked, clay-like material. It was approaching noon and she had been trailing the human's rickshaw for hours now with only brief respites when the cow-girl stopped to get a drink from one of the public fountains or to relieve herself. Her only indication he was even still in the cart was the way the bovine driver posed and presented herself to her rider whenever they got a few moments alone.\n\nThe silver clip holding her tan cloak closed warmed against her skin indicating the border of a ward was nearby. It seemed to be the only precaution the man had taken, though she wasn't sure if the ward was working since the rickshaw had passed numerous other cat-girls out on the street and the mage didn't appear to take notice of them.\n\nShe didn't think it was possible the ward was tuned specifically to her.\n\nAs she watched from a distant rooftop, the cow-girl half turned and pointed to her mouth before rubbing her belly. Though the mage's ward kept her too far away to hear what they were saying, it was easy to tell that he gave her permission to get something to eat. The rickshaw drivers only ate at one of three stables positioned around the city. A smile came to the cat girl's face, she already knew where the nearest one was located.\n\nAs the mage's cart started moving, she whispered the command word activating the magic in her cloak which made her unnoticeable to those not specifically looking for her. Seeing the bovine woman turn in the direction of the nearest stable, she darted off to check the place out before their arrival. With luck she would be done with this frustrating human within the next hour or so.\n\n---\n\n\"She's gone,\" Ria reported, becoming visible once again.\n\n\"Good,\" he replied before calling out to the cow-girl, \"Change of plans. You indicated there were a few places you could go to eat, take me to the one furthest from here and get there as quickly as you can.\"\n\nThe woman pouted while rubbing her belly.\n\nThe mage gave her an apologetic smile, \"I'll make it up to you when we get there, I promise.\"\n\nThe cart driver's pout was replaced by a smile and a shiver of anticipation before turning the rickshaw around and heading west at a jog.\n\nAs they bounced along, Ria floated just above her normal perch on his shoulder. \"I'm confused. You let her follow you for half a day and now you are running away from her.\"\n\nThe mage nodded though a bump nearly hid the motion as he bounced around inside the cart. \"She has spent all that time leaping from rooftop to rooftop or following behind us on foot. Now, when she realizes I'm not going where she thinks I am she is going to spend a good amount of time running around trying to find me. If I time things right, you and I will get back to the inn about the time she gives up and comes back to wait for me.\"\n\n\"What is the point of doing all this just to have her catch up with you at the inn?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" the mage chuckled.\n\n\"Dammit, Kal! Don't screw with me, I'm worried about you!\"\n\n\"I know Ria, but I think you will understand better when you see her. I don't want to insult you, but my reasons are specific to the living. Besides, it's kind of fun to tease you.\"\n\n\"Fine, whatever,\" she said, crossing her arms. \"Call me if you're wrong and she ends up catching up with you,\" she snapped before fading away.\n\nDirecting his attention to the piece of leather pressed against his back, he activated the wind-screen that slowed the air rushing at him so he could breathe properly when flying. The topaz brooch that kept the dust and sand off him was getting overwhelmed by the dust kicked up by the jogging cow-girl's hooves.\n\n---\n\nIt was close to an hour later when Kashka returned to the last place she saw the mage. In a nearby shadowy alley, the cat-girl grabbed up a beggar by the rags he was wearing, \"Which way did he go,\" she snarled in his face.\n\n\"Fuck off pussy-cat. I already told ya, Guild ain't said nothin' about reportin' to you.\"\n\nUnsheathing one of the daggers on her belt, she jabbed it toward the man's chin, \"I don't care what the guild has or hasn't told you. If you know which way the man with sprite went, then tell me.\"\n\nHe flinched away before giving her a toothless grin. \"Kitty hurtin' a human. You'll piss off the guild bad doing that.\"\n\n\"If I don't kill this man, then my master will kill me. Do you know what that means?\"\n\nThe beggar's eyes narrowed, \"What?\"\n\n\"If you don't help me, then I'm dead and I don't need to give a damn what the Beggar's Guild thinks.\"\n\nThe man laughed, \"Just another dead pussy rotting in an alley,\" he scoffed until the dagger slid under his chin and into his brain.\n\n\"You first,\" she said, letting his body drop and cleaning the dagger on his clothes before kicking some of the nearby trash and dirt over him.\n\nKashka was disgusted with herself for killing an unarmed man out of anger. Thinking back to all the times she hid outside one of the city's inn and listened to the bards and minstrels sing songs of heroism and honor, she wondered about what those heroes would think of what she just did.\n\nWhen she killed for Bozun, she was just a weapon and killing was her duty. She need not be any more concerned about honor than the daggers on her sides. But killing the beggar was her choice and the thought didn't settle well with her.\n\nStepping away from the dead human, the cat-girl bounded between buildings until she reached the rooftops. Looking to the east, she decided to check the next of the rickshaw driver's stables in the direction she last saw the man traveling. After a day of following the mage, her only chance to rest had been the short time she sat waiting for him to arrive at the stable. As she leapt from building to building, the distance between them felt like it was growing as soreness began creeping into her legs.\n\n---\n\nThe stable they arrived at was a long wooden building, making it stand out from the mud-brick structures surrounding it. Trotting into the large wooden doors on one end, he saw that a third of the building was filled with rickshaws like the one he was riding, all parked and driverless. Beyond the carts was another wall with two more large doors and a smaller one next to the human woman's booth. 'Smaller' was relative, the door was sized for the tall bovine women it was made for.\n\nThe older woman sitting in a small booth inside the stable regarded Kal skeptically. \"Well, you seem young enough to go for a while, how much do you want for taking care of a few of my girls?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry... what?\" asked Kal, thinking he had misheard her.\n\n\"How much do you want to fuck Popeh here,\" she waved at the cow-girl who had brought him, \"and as many of the others as you can handle.\"\n\nKal stood there, dumbfounded for a moment. He had somehow forgotten that having sex with monster girls was so distasteful to the people of this city they had to pay men to take care of the bovine women's needs. He had only been joking when he considered the idea as a way to make some money if needed, now that he was standing there...\n\n\"I'll pass,\" he said.\n\n\"Well damn,\" replied the woman as Popeh let out a groan of disappointment.\n\n\"On the coins. I'll pass on the coins,\" he looked up at the cow-girl next to him, \"I'm not quite ready to become a prostitute yet.\"\n\nThe human woman looked confused, \"So, you're still going to fuck her?\"\n\n\"If she wants me to.\" Out the corner of his eye, he could see Popeh nodding emphatically.\n\n\"Whatever gets you off,\" the woman replied, her voice bordering on a sneer. Looking at the cow-girl she held out a hand, \"Pouch.\"\n\nPopeh unclipped the coinpurse from her harness and handed it over. As the woman was counting the coins, Kal's ears picked up on the noise coming from the other side of the large door next to the booth. Instead of lowing, which was all he had heard from the cow-girls out on the streets, he was hearing a normal conversation between several women. The voices and words were unmistakable even if they were noticeably deeper than a human's.\n\n\"Here,\" said the woman, handing Kal a few coins, \"the least I can do is refund your fare for taking care of some of my girls.\"\n\n\"You call them girls, and not 'heifers'\" Kal pointed out.\n\nThe woman glared at him before pointing at the door next to them, \"Go get your dick wet.\"\n\nPopeh barely kept herself from running through the door while Kal followed, closing it behind him. As he turned around, he found himself lifted into a crushing hug.\n\n\"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" the cow-girl cried out as Kal put some power into his strength rune to keep her from accidentally breaking his ribs. Dropping him to the ground, she grabbed him by the hand and pulled him toward the empty stalls in the back of the building. \"This isn't my home stable, we need to go to one of the guest stalls,\" she explained as Kal jogged along to keep up with the woman's long strides.\n\nOn either side of the central aisle were open stalls with wooden dividers between them. Each stall was set up the same. Suspended from hooks on the back wall was a bag of oats and a water bucket while off to one side was a small shelf with a bowl, eating utensils, and a brush. Below the shelf on the hard-packed dirt floor was a large but surprisingly normal-looking bed with a stool in the opposite corner. Looking to the side, the mage saw a number of the women sitting on the stools eating a bowl of watered oats mixed with what looked to be the crushed up sweet brown seed pods he saw the other day at the bazaar. He guessed the girls each got an occasional day off by the few that were still asleep despite it being the middle of the day but most of the ones they passed were empty since their occupants were still out working.\n\nCatcalls and cheers followed him and Popeh as the other women took notice of his presence, peppered by a few requests to be next and more than a couple yells of, \"Lucky Heifer!\"\n\nAs she pulled him into a stall that looked much less lived-in than the others, the cow-girl's harness dropped to the floor. While one hand was occupied with pulling Kal along, the other had been working at the buckles of the leather apparatus. Kicking it to the side, the mage noticed then that she was a bit shorter now and that her legs had changed from bovine to human. She spun around and dropped to her knees before reaching out to start working at his belt.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the rush,\" she apologized, slurring her words slightly. As her hands finished with his belt and went to work on his trousers. \"We only have enough time to eat once we come through that door.\" Tugging his pants down, she didn't waste a moment before sucking his cock into her mouth. Her large, thick tongue felt heavenly to Kal and she had to get his attention to help him slip out of his boots and pull his pants the rest of the way off. He noticed that the other cow-girls seemed to speak in a similar manner and wondered if their pillowy tongues were the reason. As her tongue swirled around his prick, he quickly found himself not caring.\n\nTaking a few extra moments to savor the feel of him in her mouth, her tongue lovingly coated his cock with her spit as she slowly pulled off him. Dragging Kal along, she fell back onto the bed while positioning him between her legs.\n\n\"I need you inside me, but I want you to finish here,\" she pointed at her mouth before reaching down and placing him at her entrance. As she grabbed his prick her eyes went wide with surprise. Propping herself up on an elbow, she looked down between her legs. \"You weren't that big a second ago,\" she said with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\nThe mage smiled, \"I have some tricks up my sleeve,\" he said as he slowly moved his hips forward. The cow-girl's pussy clamped down as the head slipped inside, the large woman's sex was unused to such a large intruder, but the copious amount of spit she left on him along with how wet she was allowed him to continue pushing. She gasped at the feeling of stretching around him as her legs wrapped around his waist and pressed him deeper into her. The head of his cock nudged the entrance to her womb and she tilted her head back to let out a very cow-like bellow.\n\nCheers erupted from the other girls in the stable.\n\nOnce their hips came together the walls of her pussy relaxed slightly, Kal took this as a signal to start moving. The inside of her sex was slightly rougher than what he was used to, but not to the point where it was uncomfortable. Instead, the texture seemed to intensify the sensation as he began sliding in and out of her with long strokes. Because of their time constraints, he was going to warn her that he normally took a while but after the first few times sinking into the woman's depths, he didn't think that was going to be an issue. When she reached down and began playing with her clit, her other hand pulled his head down to one of her breasts. Taking the wide nipple in his mouth and sucking hard, he felt the hand trapped between them rubbing her pearl start to move even faster. Though he wasn't excited about the need to hurry, the mage started hammering into her, his enchanted cock letting him take longer strokes than normal which only increased their pleasure more.\n\nDeep lowing moans escaped Popeh's mouth with each stroke, gradually rising higher in pitch until she grabbed Kal by the hips and held him tight against her pussy, grinding her clit against him. Clamping her mouth shut, she breathed loudly through her nose as her body shook through her orgasm. Sensing her coming climax, Kal managed to take a deep breath just before she mashed his face into the soft flesh of her large breasts.\n\nNot wasting time, Kal pulled out of her sex as soon as she relaxed. As he slipped free, a quiet, \"Whoa,\" from behind them let him know they had gained an audience. Quickly moving up the cow-girl's body, he straddled her belly and laid his cock between her massive tits.\n\n\"You're a big one,\" she said, pushing her breasts together to make a soft channel for him to slide through. Lifting her head, her tongue just managed to swirl around the head of his prick. Looking up at him, she was about to say something when she saw that his eyes were closed in concentration. With his eyes still closed, he reached down and took hold of one of her horns, holding her head in place. A moment later she felt movement between her breasts at the same time the head of the human's cock nudged her lips. The man's prick continued growing until the head was completely in her mouth.\n\nPopeh wanted to play with her clit again as the feel of the man sliding between her breasts and into her mouth was something she never thought she would experience. A few seconds later two fingers that couldn't have been the human's, since his hands were using her horns to pull her mouth further down his prick, slipped inside her sex, collecting some of her fluids before bringing them up to her pearl and starting to make tiny circles. There was no way for her to know who it was, but she thanked them from the bottom of her heart.\n\nKal ventured a peek down at the cow-girl beneath him, hoping that it didn't disrupt the image in his head that he was doing this with Ikuno instead. Seeing that she was enjoying herself so much she looked like she was about to cum again, he closed his eyes and focused on the wonderful feelings from his cock and how happy Ikuno was going to be in a few seconds when he filled her mouth.\n\nPushing her arms away from her breasts, Kal swung a foot up to the side of Popeh's head, changing this angle so he could get deeper into her mouth before speeding up. With her clit being taken care of, the cow-girl pulled him into her until he was nudging the back of her throat.\n\nPressing against the entrance to her throat but denied entrance, Kal grunted and began filling the woman's mouth. The first shot of his seed coated Popeh's tongue and a moment later her back arched as her second climax washed over her. She bounced off the bed before going into another arch, and another, then another before she finally relaxed enough to pull off Kal's prick and gasp for air.\n\nTheir opportunity to enjoy the afterglow was brief as she leaned over the side of the bed and asked the onlookers, \"How long do I have?\"\n\n\"A couple of minutes, at most.\"\n\nPopeh gave Kal an apologetic smile, \"Sorry, I wish I had more time.\"\n\nThe mage stood up on the bed, allowing her to get up and start putting her harness back on. \"I understand, I'm on a schedule too.\"\n\n\"My home is the northern stable,\" she said as she cinched up her buckles. \"Four days from now is my next rest day. The other girls and I would love it if you stopped by when we could have more time.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm just passing through. By then, I will be crossing the desert.\"\n\nPopeh pouted for a moment but it was quickly replaced by a smile. \"The offer is open next time you pass through then.\" She pulled him down and kissed him on the cheek. \"Thank you so much.\" Grabbing a handful of oats from the bag hanging on the wall, she shoved them in her mouth before fetching her large straw hat and jogging toward the exit.\n\nPulling off his shirt but leaving his vambraces on just in case he needed to wrestle with one of the large women, Kal laid down on the oversized bed and put his hands under his head. \"If I'm correct then I still have another hour and a half before I need to leave,\" he told the three bovine women still standing at the end of the stall.\n\nThe two in front immediately turned toward the larger woman standing behind them with pale skin and hair that somehow managed to not look sickly on her. \"Chae, you should go first,\" said one of them. \"He's the biggest human I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"Do you think you have another in you?\" said the tallest of the three, looking at his half-hard cock.\n\nReaching down, he cast the rejuvenation spell while focusing on the pale-white cow-girl, she looked to be only a few finger-widths shorter than Ikuno and it showed as his prick grew to Chae's ideal size. Seeing the looks of surprise on the girl's faces, he chuckled, \"I think I have a few more left in me.\"",
        "\"That's an offer I can't refuse,\" said Chae as she entered the stall.\n\n---\n\nKal was fiddling with the top clasp of his shirt when he finally came back through the door next to the woman's booth. One of the cow-girls followed him out while chewing on one of the sweet brown bean pods. He failed to hide a smirk at the knowledge that the woman's sex was currently filled with his seed.\n\nThe girls on their rest day let those coming in have a quick turn with Kal if they wanted before getting something to eat. Sometimes they came, sometimes they didn't, but all of them appreciated experiencing a human who enjoyed being with them, even if it was only for a minute or two.\n\n\"Young man,\" called out the lady in the booth.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Here,\" she said, placing a bag that jingled with the telltale sound of coins on the thin shelf in front of her.\n\nThe mage frowned, \"I told you I'm not willing to become a prostitute.\"\n\n\"It's not payment. It's a gift. These girls get the dregs when it comes to men, some of them are so ashamed they can't even keep it up. Since you went in, a lot of my girls walked out of here with the biggest smiles I've ever seen on their faces. From the sounds of it, Chae would follow you to the ends of the earth if it weren't for that collar.\"\n\n\"I have a lover a little larger than her, I know how to handle big girls,\" he said, grinning. The large cow-girl had started to get a condescending tone as she rode him. The differences in size between them made her cocky and she had started to sneer about how small he was, at least in stature since she had no complaints about the size of his cock. That came to a sudden stop when Kal's strength rune lit up and she found herself flipped onto her back and held down as the mage fucked her through a string of rapid-fire climaxes. The look on the other two cow-girl's faces when he let the pale bovine up was a mix of awe, fear, and anticipation.\n\n\"Whatever you did, I appreciate it,\" the woman said waving at the offering.\n\nThe mage picked up the coinpurse and pulled some of its contents out. Handing the coins to the cow-girl next to him, he dumped the rest into Ria's bag. \"I had Popeh cart me around most of the morning. I'll be making a stop at the inn I'm staying at and then I'll need you to do the same until dark.\" The woman nodded in understanding, reminding him that now she was outside the stable, normal slave rules applied and she wasn't allowed to speak anymore.\n\nStepping aside, he let her lead the way back to her cart.\n\n---\n\nKashka seethed as she saw the mage get back into the cart he had just exited moments ago to walk into the inn. What was the point of all this running around? Dropping to the ground from her vantage on top of a nearby shop, she stretched out her tired arms and legs before jogging after the rickshaw.\n\n---\n\n\"I get it,\" said Ria, appearing above Kal's shoulder. \"She's following us on foot now, and she looks exhausted.\"\n\n\"She chased me all the way across the city yesterday, I figured she would do the same today,\" the mage replied. \"I did some research last night and based on her markings I believe she takes after a small desert cat.\"\n\n\"That explains why she's so small compared to the other cat-girls we've seen in the city.\"\n\n\"Her size isn't the interesting part. These black-footed cats are described as stunningly good hunters that catch almost everything they stalk.\"\n\n\"A perfect breed to make into an assassin.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm thinking. But why? I haven't been in town long enough to make anyone that mad.\"\n\n\"Maybe Toba is trying to off you so he can walk away with your gold?\" offered the sprite.\n\n\"No, I know his personality. He's a merchant foremost and dead clients are a source of bad reputation instead of money. We'll see what we can find out when we meet her tonight.\"\n\n\"You're a fair fighter, Kal, was all this really necessary?\"\n\nThe mage nodded, \"I believe it was, I think Kedder would have had difficulty making the throw she got me with, and our rogue friend probably has a decade and a half of more experience than this girl. If she's that good, I want her wore out and making mistakes when we come face to face.\"\n\n\"Will you kill her?\"\n\nKal gave the sprite a sharp look before shaking his head, \"I can't get information from a corpse, but if I have to...\" he shrugged.\n\n\"And after you get your information?\"\n\n\"Oh... I didn't think of that, I can't just let her go if she tells me what I need. Ria, I need one of the slave collars, I'll have to change it back, so it isn't an explosive anymore.\"\n\nThe sprite waved a hand and a moment later Kal was holding a collar taken from one of Daxas's pack after he rescued them.\n\n\"While you're doing that, I'll go check on our cat-girl,\" said the sprite before making her body invisible.\n\nKal didn't answer as he began draining the mana crystal embedded in the collar so it would be safe to make changes to the runes inside.\n\n---\n\nKashka leapt to the roof of the inn where the mage was staying. Stumbling as she landed, she cursed quietly under her breath at her aching legs, Normally, she wouldn't think about attempting to complete an assignment in her current condition but it wasn't as though she could return to Bozun's hideout and rest for a while. If she came back without killing the human, her life was forfeit.\n\nLike most of the buildings in Fazal, the inn had a flat roof supported by wooden beams and covered in the mortar used to hold the mud brick buildings together. Rain was extraordinarily rare in Fazal, but the roof still had a slight slant directing any possible rainwater to a hole in one corner that dropped into a barrel below. In the daytime, the roof was brilliant white, those who could afford it had the tops of their buildings painted to help reflect some of the sun's heat. At night, the tiny white crystals in the paint caught the moonlight, making the roof flicker and shimmer as she crossed over to the side above the mage's room.\n\nLooking over the edge, she saw the human's window was open. A few seconds later the light inside dimmed, then dimmed again as though he was putting out candles. The room went dark and Kashka breathed a sigh of relief. With the window open she could drop down to the sill, as she had hundreds of times before, then slip inside, put one dagger in his heart while the other slit his throat, and be out the window and gone within seconds. All she needed to do was wait a little while until the man had gotten into his bed.\n\n\"He's not in there,\" came a voice from behind her.\n\nWhipping her head around and seeing two glowing red eyes, the cat-girl launched herself up and to the side, her puffed-up tail windmilling frantically to keep her upright as she sailed through the air. When her feet touched the roof again, her cloak was sticking out behind her, held up by her tail. The mage looked like he shrunk slightly as his boots scraped across the rooftop. How had she not heard him coming up behind her? The question was quickly overtaken by the realization he had been waiting for her. In the blink of an eye, daggers appeared in her hands. Her plan was still the same, the only change was he was standing up.\n\nKal regarded the woman carefully. The cat-girl's most striking feature had to be her eyes, in the low light the way they gathered light gave them an eerie glow. Her fighting stance was good but unpracticed and she looked neither calm nor comfortable holding the daggers defensively in front of her. The jet-black skin of her forearms combined with the black hilts of her daggers made it look like she had blades instead of hands.\n\n\"Who wants me dead? Did I wrong you in some manner? Or maybe the man you work for?\" he asked indicating the slave collar around her neck.\n\nThe woman pressed her lips together and gripped her daggers harder.\n\n\"Well, I had hoped that would work. A better question might be, why are you here?\"\n\nOver the last hour and a half, Ria had been checking on the woman while she followed them around the slowly emptying streets. He was trying to wait until darkness fell and the city roads became deserted enough there would be less chance of an incident like with the man and his son yesterday. Kal had expected the cat girl to give up the chase out of exhaustion, at which point he would turn the hunt around knowing that she was too worn out to properly flee. For some reason he couldn't figure out, that never happened.\n\nAfter a few moments of her continued silence, the mage sighed, \"I guess, I'll have to get my answers the hard way. Ria, staff.\"\n\nKashka blinked in confusion as the staff appeared in his hand before remembering the knight saying this man had fought him to a standstill. She assumed he meant with spells, not that the mage had crossed swords with him. This disrupted her plan of waiting until he began drawing a spell to strike. Remembering the knight also reminded her how excited she had been to face someone who might be an actual challenge. That sentiment hadn't aged well considering she was about to fight for her life against a man whose full range of abilities weren't known except for the few details the knight had given them when hiring she and Bozun.\n\nKal began circling the woman carefully while using his ability to see magic to scan her. The cloak and daggers each had low-level enchantments on them, probably for hiding and sharpness respectively. There was also a small spot of magic inside her mouth along with a mild enchantment on her eyes. The flows of magic in her eyes seemed to be linked to an item in a pouch on her belt. The only surprise was the lack of magic coming from her slave collar, it appeared to be fake.\n\nKal was thankful he cast Darkvision on himself beforehand or he wouldn't have seen the woman's legs shift from human to feline when she crouched just before leaping at him. His speed rune flickered as he darted to the side and well out of her reach. He held up this staff defensively in case she tried throwing one of her daggers but instead found himself spinning it to block a flurry of quick attacks as she charged in.\n\nThe girl was fast, forcing Kal back on his heels for a few moments. The mage was able to verify one of his biggest concerns with the woman. She never missed. Every time she tried to cut him the dagger moved swift and true. The only way to defeat her ability was to block, deflect, or otherwise make it physically impossible for the weapon to reach him. It made dodging impossible unless avoiding her blade took him out of her dagger's range, the tip of the blade would adjust to his motion as though tied to its target.\n\nThe flip side of her talent was that she hadn't learned how to use it defensively. While she landed a number of nicks on him, which he healed over immediately, in return she took several precise blows on her arms and calves designed to slow her down further.\n\nKashka grunted in pain as the mage's staff came down on her forearm, numbing her from elbow to wrist and nearly causing her to drop her dagger. Skipping backwards, she took both weapons in her good hand and stretched out her arm, wiggling her fingers until she was certain she could hold the blade. The mage's face was a mask of confusion as she again took a dagger in each hand and advanced on him.\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" he asked again.\n\n\"Because I don't have a choice. Either you die, or I die,\" she said, her voice calm despite the mounting fear inside her head.\n\n\"I don't want to kill you; I just want to know why you are trying to kill me. More specifically, who hired you?\"\n\nThe cat-girl's eyes widened for a moment, surprised that he knew she was an assassin. Of course, her previous victims never got the chance to ponder such things. She brought her daggers up again, \"I said too much. It's not a weapon's place to speak.\"\n\nThe mage sighed, \"So be it.\" Instead of waiting for her, the human closed the gap. Batting her daggers wide as she attempted to attack him, she instead found herself skidding backwards across the inn's roof from a kick to her stomach she never even saw. Flipping up onto all fours before she came to a stop, she realized she had lost her daggers. Looking back toward the mage, she saw them laying where she first hit the roof. The human made a motion with his hand and both blades skidded off in opposite directions.\n\nHer arms shifted to their black-footed feline forms; she didn't need weapons to be dangerous. Bounding towards the human, she leapt at his head, claws outstretched. The mage crouched and Kashka swiped down at him as she passed over, but the tips of her claws only ruffled his hair. A hand closed on her ankle and her forward momentum came to a jarring halt. She thought she felt something in her leg pop but didn't get to think about it as he swung her sideways. Out the corner of her eye, she saw two runes on the mage's vambraces glowing brightly, one deep red and the other white. Her mind barely registered that she should have fallen to the roof already when the human swung upwards and let go, sending her sailing into the air above the city.\n\nFor the second time that night, her tail spun to get her body oriented. She wasn't afraid of the fall, as a cat-girl, she could fall safely from any height, she just needed to be facing the ground and spread her arms and legs to slow herself down before landing. Kashka's tail managed to get her flipped over but she only had a fraction of a second to pick a place to land before a shadow came streaking towards her from below. The cat-girl barely managed to make out the mage's face before his fist caught her in the stomach. Pain exploded in her mind for a moment before her eyes closed.\n\nA few seconds later Kal gently laid the feline woman on the inn's roof, \"Ria?\" he called out.\n\nThe sprite flew over from a nearby building, \"It looks like she was working alone. I haven't seen any indication of backup or even an observer.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he held out his hand, \"Sleep powder please.\" Sprinkling some of the fine sand onto the feline woman's head, he cast the sleep spell to make sure she wouldn't wake up before lifting her onto his shoulder. Activating the flight rune, he silently drifted over the edge of the inn's roof and down to his window.\n\nAfter carrying her inside the tent, he sealed it behind him and laid her on the bed in his guest room. \"I need the collar I modified earlier, Ria,\" he said removing the fake one from her neck and tossing it to the side.\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\nKal fastened the new collar around her neck and was about to start tending to the many wounds he had inflicted when his ability to see the flows of magic drew his attention to her mouth. The spot he saw earlier was getting brighter as it drew in energy and released it toward the collar he just put on her. Filling himself with magic, Kal's eyes glowed purple instead of blue thanks to the Darkvision spell and he watched as the thing in her mouth scanned across his collar as though searching for something. When it finally completed the loop there was a moment's pause just before a small pop and a flash lit the inside of the cat girl's mouth. A second later, wisps of green vapor rose from between her lips before her breathing spewed it out into the room.\n\n\"Ria! My mask!\" the mage yelled in panic. Grabbing the feline woman's arm, he activated the cure poison rune on his back and pushed half of the magic into her.\n\nThe leather mask that appeared next to the cat-girl on the bed allowed Kal to breathe underwater, but its original purpose was to filter toxic air found deep underground. He was far from needing to worry about running out of mana but pushing the cure poison rune was going to burn through it quickly, the spell wasn't meant to be used constantly in this manner. The mask took much less energy, saving the cure poison rune for the cat-girl until the tent's magic could scrub the toxin from the air. Putting the mask on one-handed was a bother but with some help from Ria, he managed to get it into place and soon enough the runes on the outside lit up and began pouring out purified air on the inside for him to breathe.\n\nMaking sure he remained in contact with the feline, he knelt next to the unconscious cat-girl and opened her mouth. The top of one of her teeth had popped off and the green vapor was still oozing out.\n\n\"If this doesn't wake you up, I may have hit you harder than I thought,\" he said, reaching in and grabbing the tooth. It took three tries before he got a good enough grip but with the help of his strength rune, he removed the fake tooth and had Ria store it.\n\nSurprised that she hadn't woken up through all that, the mage resumed tending to the girl's wounds.\n\n--\n\n\n\nI update my Bio with the latest Chapters and projects I'm working on each time I put up a new post.\n\nAs always votes and feedback are greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks for Reading!"
