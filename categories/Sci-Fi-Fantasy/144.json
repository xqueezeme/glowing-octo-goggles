        "Author's note: this story continues my tale, 'Going feet First', and follows Galen, a soldier once in Vietnam, now on a journey into a medieval fantasy world filled with Elves, Magic, and all kinds of fantastical creatures. \n\nWelcome to Raska. \n\n.................. \n\nGoing Feet First \n\nChapter 6: Hellfire \n\n.................. \n\nGrey clouds rolled through the sky above Atzla to become the closing curtain over the morning sun, casting the land in a shadowed gloom. Little else aside from the roar of water cascading over the edge of Rock Falls on the river High filled the lifeless silence of the forest. Tree tops rustled in the wind; tiny droplets of rain fell on morning dew and pattered on leaves. The temperature dropped a bit as a sudden, rouge breeze sent chills down the back of a lone Tree Elf as she wandered through the woods. \n\nHer pale ivory skin was bare to the downturn in weather with neither a coat nor small cloth to cover it, usual for her clan. The only adornment to her delicate body was her long, light golden hair wound into a triplet of braids over her shoulders and back. Lengthy bangs framed her face around silver-speckled, grey eyes, and a green aura illuminated her personal space with an earthy light. She was a beauty to behold if one could see her with the unaided eye. \n\nEven with her nipples firming up and her limbs becoming less responsive in the cold, she traipsed through the woods and let loose the magic with which she was blessed unto the world around her. A single touch of her fingers healed a savage tear in a tree's bark. A nonchalant wave of her hand bathed a patch of yellow grass in a lively green. Body invisible to all not blessed with Elven Sight, she crept up to a sickly deer whimpering on the ground, chanting a cure to its ailment and helping it back to its feet. \n\nIt was all part of her duties as a Life Giver of the Tree Elves of Atzla. Heal the injured, restore the ill, give strength to the weak, and ensure the health of the forest and its purity for all who dwelled within. \n\nNot long after the deer went leaping off into the brush with energy it had not known in weeks, the Elf's throat dried and she felt light-headed, as though she were elevated into thinner air. Two signs she was overusing her magic. She had more territory to cover by herself with Celia now gone, and with their numbers already short of the desired fifty, the Mana-Wells which cast their special magic out to the Life Givers just barely conjured enough to keep the majority of their group from tapping into their personal energies. Most of the time. Some still had to dig within to carry on. \n\nThough a drained feeling weighed down her core and a touch of fatigue drew on her eyelids, the Elf focused on the splashes of flowing water nearby. Her path shifted through the brush and around the trees, her magic silencing her footfalls while holding off the elements that would no doubt endanger her otherwise. After only a short walk the grass underfoot changed to sand and the canopy overhead cleared for the clouded sky over the landmark waterfall. \n\nSomething was wrong. \n\nCaught in the rocks at the top of the falls, about to disappear from view, was a body. It was one she instantly recognized as a human in odd green pants and a striped shirt of the likes she'd never seen before. No, she had seen clothes like that. In fact, very recently. \n\nThe Elf bolted toward him as the waters were slowly shoving him over the rocks toward the edge. Any fall there would be caught the jagged points of the rocks below and a most certain death. \n\nCareful not to lose her footing herself, the Elf waded through the moving waters toward him. The moment he was in reach she grabbed the human by his shirt and pulled him along the rocks. The water beat at her claves and tried to force her over, but the Elf shifted her feet to the stones that protruded over the water line and used the dry surface to keep her from slipping to her own demise. \n\nNecela curse me if I let anyone die today, she thought. \n\nOne foot behind the other, she pulled the human closer to land while trying, and failing, to keep him from knocking himself against every bump on the way. He was nearly too heavy for her to move. It took short, heavy pulls to drag him one pace at a time and the way a rock just jabbed into his back after she braced to yank him along had her thinking of how many kinds of sore he would be when he woke. \n\nAfter several frightful moments and with a final tug she pulled him from the current's grasp and onto the shore just enough so it wouldn't pull him back. Panting heavily, the Elf stepped over to his feet and shifted his legs to the side with the water flow, making it seem as though he washed up onto the bank. \n\nIt was when she had him lying in a mostly natural position, that she saw the remnants of a bandage stuck to the bottom of his shirt. And then the blood darkening the garment around his right shoulder. A hacking cough erupted from his lips and spattered blood out of the man's mouth and caused her to bounce back with a yelp. His head shifted, but then he went still again as his breathing settled. \n\nThe Elf calmed when his eyelids didn't even peek open and he appeared to fall asleep again. \n\nMoving with a degree of caution, she approached him again and knelt down at his side. Her green aura flared slightly as she then brushed her hand over his shoulder, sensing the damage to his right lung and the destroyed a section of ribs and muscle. He would need months to recover without a mortal \"surgeon\" or healing magic, if he recovered at all. \n\nA lung with not one, but two holes tearing through it would not allow one to survive long. Though it was curious how this human was wounded in a way not dissimilar from the wounds inflicted upon the Nekos that fought with Celia's human. \n\nAs the Elf pondered the thought of another offworlder among them, she leaned in to inspect this human's clothes, the boots he wore, and even the material it was all made out of. \n\nEverything he wore was near identical to the things worn by that man that had recently won the grace of the clan's beds. Gavin, if she remembered his name correctly. The material that made up his garments, the color used in dyeing them, the green shirt with black stripes... For the sake of curiosity, she probed into his pockets, feeling the shape of a metal weapon exactly like what Gavin carried himself. \n\nEven more curious, she reached past the steel tool for the fleshy one beside it. \n\nAnother of your kind... she thought, biting her lower lip with a grin. I hope you come back in ten years' time, human. \n\nHer hand lit up in a green glow and she chanted low, touching a finger to the wounds in his back. She couldn't heal him completely, lest she give him suspicion of some form of immortality or intervention, but she could heal him enough to survive. Or at least get by without much need for medicine beyond keeping his wounds clean and his arm resting. If he was anything like Gavin... Garen... Galen... that name sounded right... it was the least she could do. \n\nA voice caught her ear then, old raspy words that were given a response by a younger crisper one. Sighing and whispering a farewell to the human, she took several gulps from the river and ran off into the woods. With a snap of her fingers, the sand shifted and hid the footprints that could've proven she was ever there. \n\n... \n\nYawning as his cart squeaked along the bank of the river High, an old human kicked his feet up on the rests in front of his seat and shut his eyes. That area was safe enough to not worry about attackers, and he had the confidence in his co-driver to let the lad take reigns of the bear that pulled them along. Only a zetran and a half of riding and they would be out of the forest, another seven and they'd be at the first wall in the Trench. After that, one more zetran and they would be at Redding's gate and back in civilization. \n\nAfter a long tour around the Atzla forest peddling wares to various tribes and gathering a healthy stock of indigenous goods, there was nothing he wanted more than to get back to the ale and the wife that awaited him alongside a hot meal in his own home. In the morning, he could take to the market and sell off what he had and buy new stocks to start the trade cycle again. \n\n\"Catchin' shut eye?\" his co-driver asked. \n\nThe old merchant looked to his assistant, a scraggly boy with unkempt, black hair and a strip of a beard down his chin. He had a witty look about him along with the dull, yellow eyes of a mountain boy of northwestern Astiko. Like other folk of his home, he was built like the mountain he was born on. \n\n\"Yup, wake me only if something comes up,\" the merchant said, getting comfortable. \n\nHe stroked his grey beard and tipped his thin-brimmed hat down over dark brown eyes. Bundled up in a heavy, wool coat, he settled in and let the rustling leaves and rushing water of the falls downstream fade from his ears. \n\n\"Oi yoi! Don't pass out yet! Something's up ahead!\" \n\n\"Oh, let the Three an' Kin damn ya, boy, what is-\" \n\nEven with his old eyes he saw the body lying on the beach ahead. Their bear gave a groan and picked up speed, the cart bouncing a bit as their animal charged ahead to investigate. Right as the beast got to man, it had its nose over his back to take his scent in quick, rapid inhales. Not wasting time, both merchants hopped off their cart and moved to inspect the body as well. \n\nTaking one deep breath to lock in the man's scent, the bear backed off so its riders could come closer. Both of them saw the blood on the back of his shirt and immediately they looked worried. Hesitantly the old man pressed an ear to the man's back and listened, breathing out his relief as he heard the steady heartbeat. \n\nSitting up, he looked to his co-rider and ordered, \"Help me get him in the cart, he's fightin' for breath and may not last a day or two if we don't get him to a doctor.\" \n\n\"Guess we're going to get to Redding on a hightail, yeah?\" \n\n\"Yeah, so button up and get his shoulders, and watch that wound of his. Lotta damage been done and I don't wanna watch some bugger die before I retire.\" \n\n... \n\nOne hand resting casually on the hilt of his sword as he walked, Farok continued marching along the river High between two tracks left behind in the sand on the shore. Despite the annoyance of a number of human scents crowding his senses, he could still pick out Petra from it all. Her smell was not nearly as fresh as theirs, but still distinguishable from the nature around it and that was all he needed. \n\nI'll reach Redding by nightfall, given that is the parasite's destination... he thought, unconsciously hastening his pace. I can already hear Rock Falls. \n\nThe roar was faint in his ears past the rushing wind and the buffer provided by the trees, but it was there. It was one reference on his map that marked the closing distance to the end of Atzla and a point where one could see the forest break off into endless plain stretching farther than the eye could see. \n\nFarok would believe that when he saw it. \n\nHe pressed onward around a river bend. The distance he covered for the time of day was not something he was happy about, but he could only blame himself as he had overslept this morning. Though his body thanked him for it, his conscience did not as his mind constantly wandered to what the human could have had his assassin doing at his bidding. All the things he could have her do. She could be acting as some sex outlet or a servant to wait upon him hand and foot. \n\nAll the rules known to twirl about the collar that came with servitude were set by the goddess Necela herself with the Neko elders of long ago. One didn't dare break them, nor did they leave much for loop holes. If at all. But if Farok ended Galen without Petra's knowing, she wouldn't see punishment. And without a master she would be free. \n\nBut then again, if Galen had other motivations for sentencing her to his service... reasons of honor... the ex-Hunt Commander would maybe accept what he has done. Maybe. His decision couldn't be made until he knew the situation. \n\nWhy did he smell another human? A new smell floated over the air, a familiar one. Frowning as he took it in more deeply, Farok could have sworn it was the scent of the wounded man aboard that crashed chopper... But he had leapt into the river... did his corpse wash up? \n\nThe Neko came to a straight section of river and he, along with his heart, stopped. His eyes locked on the sight of Rock Falls, or rather what lay beyond it. His map was not wrong. \n\nOver the edge of the drop he could see every twist and turn the river took for entirety of the next expanse of forest, all the way to where the trees gave way to the Rock Lands. And by the great goddess Necela, did the Neko feel tiny. The Sundered Trench, the Rock Lands, the mountains in the south, they stretched for eternity until the world fell below the horizon. No new line of trees, no field of green, just yellow. Yellow for eternity. \n\nSome unacceptable amount of time passed as Farok fathomed this world beyond the forest. When he began move again, it was as though half his joints had seized as each limb staggered and refused to budge. Somehow he managed to turn to the river and drop to his knees in the water. The stiff shock from the cold against his fur and a splash of water onto his face sent a shiver through every muscle in his body and brought his mind around to what lay ahead. \n\nIt's for Petra, he reminded himself. I betrayed my kind for her... she nearly died because of me. \n\nDoing his best to keep calm and breathe normally, he stood and took it one step at a time back to dry land and on his trek again. The falls was a stone's throw away when he noticed a change in the wagon tracks he followed. It looked as though both men that had been riding it dismounted and approached a sizable depression in the sand. A depression the size of a small boat, or animal, or... human body. \n\nEyeing the tracks and watching how they moved, the way they aligned and moved as one sideways back to the wagon tracks. As though they picked up some weighted object and walked sideways to carry it. Farok could only guess they picked up the body and put it in the back of their cart... \n\nMind processing the marks in the sand, he moved to a patch of blood and got down on all fours to take in the scent. \n\nThe human. He's still alive, lucky Rakec Neerik. \n\nA second goal locked into his sights, Farok stood up and took off in the direction of the cart tracks. Galen was a man of unending loyalty to his comrades, something the ex-Huntmaster witnessed firsthand the day he came to the forest. If Galen had any loyalty to the wounded one that just arrived, then Farok only needed to get a hold of him and wield his wellbeing in a way that could secure Petra's freedom. \n\n.............. \n\nUnusually bright moonlight pierced through the window onto Flak's closed eyelids. Grunting and cursing, he pulled his blanket up and rolled over in his bed, immediately screaming out as he put weight down onto his wounded shoulder. In a flurry of fists and kicks to throw the covers off, he sat up with his left hand grabbing onto his shoulder. A slew of swears poured from his mouth intermixed with his howls of pain. \n\nHunching over and taking long, deep breaths, he fought back the Hell of agony that was his right-side chest and the ribs beneath them. A tear nearly escaped his eye as he tried to look down at his wound, though the hole in his body was too high up his chest for him to see. \n\nAcross the small room from his bed, a mirror hung on the whitewash wall over a vanity covered with both his shirt and his weapons. Grimacing at the shots of pain constantly tearing through his chest, he stood up and stepped over to the mirror. \n\nDamn, I need a shave and a haircut, he thought, running his fingers up the lengthening stubble on his cheeks and then into his unkempt mess of black hair. \n\nDark blue eyes shifted downward, his attention returning to his wounds. With a gentle touch he traced his hand over the tight wool bandages wrapped around his bare chest and followed the wrappings over his shoulder to the exit wounds. Everything was done right, and looked clean enough, but a deep frown still creased his face. \n\nHe wasn't in any American hospital so that meant he wasn't picked up by his own troops. These bandages weren't the type to be used by any army he knew, even a Vietnamese one in the most desperate of times. Even if they were done right, the knots were sloppy, the gauze was itchy, and it all reeked of hard liquor. His guns were also left in the room. Not that he was complaining, but any smart doctor wouldn't leave a weapon with his patient. \n\nSo that left the question: where in Hell was he? \n\nNot willing to waste time pondering, he got his KA-BAR sheath strapped to his hip and his M1911 tucked into his waistline. Using his knife he sliced the remaining sleeve of his tiger-stripe shirt so both the sleeves were cut off roughly in the same spot around the elbows. With that torn sleeve, he ripped it into two strips and tied his revolver to his right calf against the scabbard of the knife strapped above his boot. \n\nWith his ammo pocketed he sheathed his KA-BAR and turned to face the door as footsteps were approaching from the hall outside. \n\nFlak grasped his Colt with his left hand and cocked it as the door opened. \n\nTo his surprise, a white man walked in, his brown hair tied back into a small tail at his nape. There was no doctor coat on his back as the Marine expected. Only a long, black shirt tucked into the waist of his brown pants. He didn't even wear shoes. \n\n\"I didn't think you'd be so lively getting out of bed,\" he started. \"You were out cold and half-drowned when you showed up.\" \n\nFlak flexed his fingers and pulled his pistol half way out his waist. \n\n\"Who are you, where the fuck am I, and how long have I been out?\" \n\nThe \"Doctor\" blinked with a surprised look. \n\n\"You were brought in last night, been out all of today... Look, I'm Jorgensen, this is my home. You're safe here, you're in Redding.\" \n\nIt was Flak's turn to look confused. \"Which Redding?... California?\" \n\nJorgensen cocked his head to the side and shook it, \"Uhhh... no?\" \n\nThe Marine's eyes narrowed, \"Iowa?\" \n\nAgain, the Doctor shook his head shook. \"No... Rock Lands, west of Atzla forest... North of Astiko...\" He trailed off giving a narrowed, questioning look to Flak. \n\nTaking in a slow, deep breath, and letting it out just the same, Flak asked, \"And where on God's green earth are those places? If you don't start making sense, I'll start getting pissed off. And if you piss me off, I'll give you a dirt nap. Now where. The fuck. Am I?\" \n\nThe doctor took a step in retreat at the threat. He swallowed and eyed the steel... thing in the man's waist. He hadn't any idea what the potential weapon was, but he did know of those nasty-looking knives he had strapped to his side and to his calf. There was no doubt he was a killer and at this point, Jorgensen was not willing to provoke him to use his skill without the company of the city guardsmen waiting downstairs. \n\n\"I'll be back,\" he muttered, turning for the door. \n\n\"Hey, I want answers! You're not leaving!\" \n\nFlak dashed forward but the Doctor was quick to retreat and slam the door behind him, dropping a latch on the other side. The Marine slammed into the door with his good shoulder, only to find it too solid to bash through. He stepped back and roared as he drove his boot at the handle only to bounce back and nearly lose his balance. \n\nSwearing up a storm, he turned to face the room to find an alternative exit; his eyes fell on the window on the far wall. A harsh scowl spawned on his face as he ran to it and threw it open to look outside. One floor up from the ground wasn't that far to fall. ",
        "Boots started clomping down the hall outside. Flak climbed onto the window sill and swept his feet out. Before the door could open he lowered himself down and kicked off the wall to drop the last seven feet to the ground. \n\nHis boots hit the street and he rolled forward into a couched position, taking an immediate look around. The thumps in his chest picked up, his breathing growing hasty. He was on a cobblestone street, surrounded by buildings ripped right from the renaissance and built in the shadow of a giant canyon. It wasn't Vietnam. No way was he there. In fact, it wasn't anywhere he knew. \n\n\"Where the fuck is this? What in the FUCK is all this?!\" he roared, trying to clear his thoughts. \n\nFlying... over 'Nam... then fucking ZAP, lightning... crash... cat man... cat man... Redding... Rockland... forest... forest.... This ain't Earth... he thought, a bead of sweat running his brow as he swung his head in every direction to take in the buildings around him. \"WHERE THE FUCK AM I?!\" \n\nThe door to the Doctor's home opened up, two men in armor stepping out and drawing swords. Right away the Marine spun around and examined their defenses: leather armor bolstered by simple steel breast plates and cups over their groins. There were plate coverings on their gauntlets as well but nothing sufficient to hamper an offensive. \n\n\"Hold it right there, whoever you are,\" the lead... knight ordered. \n\n\"You gonna fuckin' lock me back up in that fucking room?\" Flak growled. \n\n\"No, just want to talk,\" the warrior replied as he stepped in toward the Marine, his partner circling around to cover an escape route. \n\n\"You don't look like you're gonna talk,\" Flak growled, pulling his KA-BAR and shifting his feet to a defensive stance. \n\n\"Taking precautions. Drop your knife,\" the lead commanded, now cornering Flak between him and his partner. \n\n\"Make me.\" \n\nThe first shuffle of boots came from behind him. Flak spun and dodged the sword as it swung down at him. Acting on the knight's forward momentum, he stepped forward and drove a fist into his gut and slammed the pommel of his knife into his temple. \n\nThe iron-clad warrior stumbled from the blow, but quickly came around with a retaliatory right-hook. Flak ducked the strike and swung upward with the bone of his elbow, growling with pleasure at the satisfying crack of a nose shattering. \n\nA body covered in steel plates crashed to the ground sending a calamitous racket echoing through the street. Yet with only a drop of sweat running the side of his face, the Marine sheathed his blade and turned to the next foe in line. Holding the knight's gaze, Flak turned his head and spat on his partner who still groaned on the ground. \n\n\"You gonna get some, too? Won't even use my knife, C'mon!\" Flak taunted, motioning with both hands for the medieval warrior to step in. \n\nA scream pierced the night as a scorching pain lit up Flak's spine. He dropped to all fours, fists clenching and unclenching while his whole body shook as though he were suffering a seizure. He could feel thousands of tiny knives stabbing into his neck where the spine met the skull and a tornado in his flesh like blenders working his organs. This Hell dragged on for several seconds until Flak finally clamped his jaw down and pounded a fist into the stone street. Still roaring through clenched teeth, he brought one knee up and braced against it to push himself back to his feet. \n\nHis efforts were rewarded by another collapse and an even louder scream as that pain came down on him tenfold. \n\nA man in red and yellow robes stepped out from the Doctor's house, waving his hands around in front of his chest as he chanted in a low voice. When his words stopped, so did the pain, and a moaning Flak was left sprawled out over the street, barely capable of raising a finger. When the shackles locked around his wrists, he knew he was done. \n\n\"We only wanted to talk,\" the lead knight patronized. \"Now his face is busted and you're going to the stocks.\" \n\n\"Get your filthy, fuckin' hands off me,\" Flak growled in a hoarse voice. \n\n\"Still got some fight in you?\" He raised a black club. \"We'll fix that.\" \n\nThe Marine still managed a solid \"fuck you\" before he saw the stars and his vision faded to black. \n\n............ \n\nAccepting demeaning glares and violating probes from his own kind was tolerable, but patience was a resource of Farok's that was being tapped dry. Rapidly. The first checkpoint on the narrow, cliff-side path leading to Redding was laced with Petra's scent. It was also guarded by a half dozen men proudly sporting the city's colors on their chests and, as Farok quickly learned, they were not fond of a Neko, or one wearing armor at that, asking for permission to enter their precious country in the early evening. \n\nA man with a crossbow sat on a cliff above, keying his weapon as he kept an eye on the blond, bipedal feline. Farok noted his position and gauged the distance to wonder if he was within range of a throwing knife or one of his pellets of shock powder. Of course, such an act could easily thwarted by the two men in mail on the Neko's left, the other two on his right, or the man right in front of him in full plate-armor inspecting the kit he carried. \n\nFor all intents and purposes, the ex-Hunt Commander would be better off to kill them here and blame the Dark Elves with whom they warred. But explaining his own survival would prove a headache and how to replicate the signs of an elven incursion was beyond his knowledge. \n\nHe could simply kill them. Ensure none survive to witness his act. That course of action would require him to keep discreet in the Human lands for a few days, then approach the city once their suspicions died down. It would have to be a last resort, one he shouldn't have to use so long as his armor did not come off to reveal the mark seared into him upon his last promotion... \n\nThe fur on his shoulder was still grey where they burned in the image of the claw and the ranking emblem for Hunt Commander. That had been in a time before Hector. Before Farok was in a position to loathe his leader. Even with the position he found himself in now with his tribe, that promotion was still be one of the proudest moments of his life. \n\n\"So you are from the forest, Mr. Salkahn? A mere tribesman?\" the commanding knight asked as he used the tip of his sword to shift Farok's cloak aside to view what he carried. \n\n\"I've never left the woods until today,\" the Neko replied, arms crossing over his chest. \n\n\"Hmm, why is that? Leaving, I mean. Wanted to see the power of ingenuity and civilization?\" \n\n\"To find a woman, another Neko that came here several days back.\" \n\nThere was a chuckle from the guards. \n\n\"I can understand that. You kitties go ass over end when you find 'the one...' What I can't get my head 'round though...\" The leader withdrew his sword from Farok's cloak, but didn't sheathe it. \"Is why a forest cat is wearing armor. And good stuff at that.\" \n\nFarok shrugged, \"Bandits and Ra'zorlichs prowl those woods. And the dead have no need for what they once carried.\" \n\nThere was a mutual hum of approval from the humans. \"Kill some them Red-Talon fucks, huh?\" \n\n\"Only the ones who lacked the wisdom to leave me in peace.\" \n\nFarok had to force himself to withhold a grimace at his own comment, thinking on the weight it carried. It wasn't a lie, exactly, but that wasn't what bothered him. How quickly his own men had turned upon him was what disturbed his thoughts. How they abandoned the warriors bond for an unjust royal. That is what bothered him. \n\n\"Why were they after you?\" one of the lessers probed, earning a scowl from Farok. \n\nBalancing on teetering nerves, the outcast Ra'zorlich was going feral from the scent of his assassin floating in the air. Their questions ebbed on the last strings of his patience when the delays he faced were already bringing him to the end of it. Even if his assassin was in their city, they held no right to block his path to her. \n\n\"Answer him. And don't try to lie to me, I will know and you won't see your woman again,\" the Commander ordered. \n\nFarok's eyes drifted to his right, his mind tracing back to the last time he had seen Petra. And Teirie. After they had been given their mission and were getting ready to go out on their hunt. The lead Shadow Stalker had passed their target's picture over to her younger and then turned to him. \n\nSo how did you get such a good look at the humans without being close enough to kill them? she asked. \n\nHe had frowned and hunched over slightly while still trying to maintain his authoritative posture. I had gotten close to them, but the weapons they held proved too much for me to handle and I had to retreat. \n\nYou are a terrible liar, Petra had told him bluntly. \n\nCouldn't fool one of your own troops even if he were stumbling drunk, Teirie added. \n\nFine, Farok admitted. One of the humans had a magic weapon. He threatened to kill us all, including himself if we persisted in our chase. I refused to accept the risk. \n\nHmph, Petra coughed, when I kill him I'll bring back his weapons. Then we'll see if you are a commander, or a coward... \n\nI am no coward, Farok grumbled. A coward knows how to lie. \n\nHe let a growl loose from his throat as he looked up at the human before him and answered, \"Very well. They were 'after me' because I failed an impossible task set by our king.\" \n\nIt seemed his words didn't fully work their way into the heads of these men, as some confusion was stuck over their faces. In moments however, their leader clued in. \n\n\"Failed your king? You were a Red-Talon?! You're talking about the Ra'zorlich king, aren't you?!\" \n\nThe Neko shrugged as the men immediately had their hands on their weapons. \n\nNo use holding back now. \n\n\"Speak of him I do, as I was once his Hunt-Commander. A... general, of sorts. He asked me a task and let his pride cloud his vision. I failed, he came for my head, and I became hekarrim, one without a tribe. Fool as he was, King Hector followed me after I fled and I slew men I once called brothers.\" \n\nOne human drew his weapon from its sheath, but Farok still kept his hands clear of his. It was this lack of action that he hoped the humans recognized. After all, it was their last chance to see he meant no harm, a courtesy that would not be extended a second time. \n\n\"I was one of them before, but no longer,\" he clarified. \"All I have left is what I carry on my back and the woman I seek. I offer you no ultimatum, no intent to remain among your people or do harm. I wish to only collect her, and leave as timely as possible.\" \n\nThe lead shook his head and gripped his bastard sword with two hands. \"Once a Ra'zorlich, always a Ra'zorlich. And all your kind is ordered to die before you foul our home.\" \n\nFools. \n\nFarok moved back a step and pulled his sword from his sheath with a flourish, hunching over slightly as he took deep, calming breaths. He analyzed the men around him, watching their footing, their posture, how they held their weapons. From their form he could estimate their skill and from there he could decide who to kill first. \n\nShifting his feet shoulder-width apart, sliding his lead foot forward a half step, he brought himself to a ready position. His teeth showed as he glowered at the crossbowman above that was taking aim at him. The man wrapped his finger over the trigger and let his shoulders drop as he let out his lungs. \n\nThe arrow launched forth from the drawstring and Farok began his deadly dance. \n\nWith lightning movements he took a step back and raised an arm for the bolt to bounce off the plate over his forearm. When the commander stepped in to take advantage of this retreat, Farok charged forth and deflected the incoming thrust with the flat of his blade. Manipulating the whole of his body mass, he brought his sword up to strike at the joint of the chainmail between his opponent's hand and wrist. \n\nBlood sprayed Farok's face as the appendage was sundered from the arm, the blade clattering to the ground. Not wasting a moment of opportunity, the Neko's slammed his shoulder into the commander's gut to send him crashing back into his two men on the left. \n\nThe guards to the right fell in Farok's sights next and he stabbed forward with his sword. Steel clashed and sparked as the rightmost guard parried the incoming strike, but that didn't matter as a claw followed up to tear off half his face before digging in on his cheekbones. Ignoring the agonized scream, piercing the night, the Neko's reared up and booted him in the chest to send him over the cliff. \n\nThere was no time to watch his descent as Farok spun and used his weapon to block a slash coming to slice his head in two. A battle cry thundered from the guard's throat he started hacking away at the Ra'zorlich in a blind rage. With each strike the Neko took a step to the rear while blocking and deflecting the attacks with ease. \n\nSteel rang and sparked several times over before Farok managed to lock their blades together and use the pause as a chance to drive his knee up into the human's gut. The Reddite guard gave a solid \"oomph\" as he doubled over. His skull gave a sickening crack as the tip of a blade stabbed through his forehead, just as quickly was withdrawn again. Even this small victory offered no chance at rest as the guard was replaced by his comrade charging forward from the left while sweeping his blade low. \n\nA feral simper curled up Farok's lips. He swung his blade down to block, and with a flourish and a flick of the wrist sent the human's sword flying from his hand. Another redirection of the weapon's momentum, and the ex-Hunt Commander had his longsword buried to the hilt in his enemy's gut. \n\n\"Pathetic,\" was all the Neko growled, ripping his blade free and letting the corpse fall aside. \n\nThree men slain, Farok turned to the commander of this group of guards. Wrapped in his cocoon of steel he laid in the arms of his last swordsman, staring at the gushing stump where his right hand once was. At the sound of heavy breathing drawing closer, both of the men looked up at the approaching Neko and started scrambling backward, calling desperately for help. \n\nOn the rocks above, the crossbowman tried to scale the cliff and escape. In moments the screams below turned to gargled groans, then to silence as the golden terror tore into them. The bowman's leather pants soon reeked of urine, his face dripping with fresh tears as he climbed for the top of the trench and away from that monster's bloodshed. \n\nHe took only a moment to look back, and when he did he saw the fur-ball stripping off his cloak and the gear he carried. It took only a few counts and he was down to nothing but clothes and armor. And with this unnecessary weight dropped, he leapt onto the rocks of the cliff and started scaling wall after him. \n\n\"Oh fuck!\" the guard yelled, scrambling to get up higher, faster. \n\nHe could hear that steel armor of the cat-man clatter behind him, the Nekonian curses as he dug his claws into the Rock. He was gaining. Fast. \n\n\"I don't want to die, I don't want to die!\" \n\nHe threw his hands over the top of the cliff, grabbing onto the solid yellow grass of the plain around the Sundered Trench. With every ounce of strength he had, he forced himself up and over the edge, ready to sprint away to get the distance he needed for his crossbow. \n\nThat was his plan until a claw dug into the back of his leather jerkin and sank into the flesh of his lower back. He tried to get a grip on the dirt and grass as he cried out for help, but his strength was outmatched by the Neko pulling him back.  \n\n\"Then you should have let me pass,\" Farok grumbled before he heaved the guard over the cliff to send him wailing down onto the sharp rocks below. \n\nPanting heavily after his mad dash up the stone wall, Farok looked out across the Trench and spotted a building not too far down the road with lights burning in the window. Many more of Redding's guardsmen were rushing out the door and to the horses lashed to posts outside. \n\nDamn, reinforcements... Farok mentally grumbled. \n\nThe climb back down wasn't nearly as swift as his climb up. Every part of his body felt ready to fall to pieces under their own weight after having to propel him so quickly up the cliff in his armor. His foot lost its grip more than once and each time had him one failed grasp away from joining the two he had tossed to their ends. \n\nWhen he was back down on the trail, he donned his gear again and set a quick pace away from his slaughter. His map said Redding was perhaps a half-day walk, but Farok didn't have the strength in him for that. He would need what little he had left to avoid the men coming to investigate what had not been a quiet engagement. \n\nFind shelter, rest, wait. No doubt their alert will rise when they find the bodies, I'll have to wait until it clears. \n\nIt was wait he never anticipated to take so long. \n\n........... \n\nA line of torches along the wall lit the hollow interior of the Great Tree with a dim, flickering light as the moon rose to its peak in the night-sky outside. The next night would be the new moon judging by how it waned, and when it came a great darkness would fall across the land. In more ways than one if Tanza's visions rang true. \n\nThe torture of a sleepless night haunted her after Galen's departure with Celia. Horrible flashes of sights that the boy had to suffer and her sister had to endure, sights she wished she never had to hear or see. There was an impossible urge for the elder to leave her sisters and journey out to influence the outcomes herself until Necela finally granted her a new vision. \n\nOne that revealed the light at the end of the couple's dark path. \n\nAs it had come to her, she had brought it to Celia; a gift the youngling no doubt relished as her world seemed to crumble after her capture. But now the time had come to see if Galen had the strength to see it true. If he still lived. The Drow hadn't been a part of Tanza's vision, they never even occurred to her until he met them on the edge of the forest. Now they played the wild card that could sow seeds of victory, or wreak their own destruction upon everything Galen had worked towards. \n\nWith no new vision to assure her of either, the Tree Elf elder waited and gazed through her cauldron to find something to distract her. \n\nHer magic pot could only show her what happened within the forest, and she mostly watched her Life Givers doing their duties outside and the Mana-Wells, working within the safety of their magic home. But when she desired to do so, she could spy upon Galen's friend, Michael, as he continued to settle in his place among the Willhers. It was distraction enough to keep her mind off her worries. At least until a sudden heat flourished in her belly. \n\nTanza blinked as the glow of her white aura over violet skin shimmered and shifted inward to her midriff, then focused around her core. Unnoticed by her, her ultramarine eyes took on a pink glow within her pupils same as the skin below her navel. Fresh tears pooled in her eyes, tracing her cheeks around the broad smile drawing up on her lips. \n\nYes... yes... she thought, wrapping her arms over her stomach while on the verge of giggling as more drops of happiness streamed down her cheeks. Necela and sweet Calia, thank you. \n\nAfter fifteen days of wondering if she had caught or not, her visions refusing to grant her an answer, her closure had come. The unnerving wait finished and she could feel the rabble of Nightwatchers twirling inside her. Elation steamed her chest as her heart pumped an impossible cheer through her body and the new soul growing within her. ",
        "As she started to wipe her face, an image formed at the back of her mind and prodded its way into Tanza's sight. But before she could truly see it she forced it back and cast it from her thoughts and memory. When her mind tried to bring it forth she crushed it down again. \n\nSo little had the chance to surprise her in her lifetime, but the one thing she always managed to keep a surprise, to keep her guessing, was what her future daughters were destined to look like. She never knew the appearance beyond the aura of her first two children and that record would not be spoiled on her third. Ten months in the dark always proved a price well paid for the joy of seeing them for the first time the day they came into this world. \n\nClosing her eyes and finally releasing her giddy giggles, Tanza made mental contact with her other sisters who had enjoyed the human's love and summoned them to her. It did not take long for them to depart from their duties and file into the tree. Together they gathered in a semi-circle around their Elder's throne and were literally glowing with joy at seeing Tanza's glowing midriff. Then, one after another, their auras shifted as well. \n\nTanza sucked in a breath and covered her mouth with both hands at the sight, the corners of her eyes creasing as she tried to relax her unrelenting smile. \n\nZaky, the young, violet-skinned elf that was once a virgin until Galen had tended to her, summoned a light grey aura to her belly to supplant her sunshine-yellow glow. Bacil, the clan cook with the iron grey hair and pale green skin drew a white aura out from her deep green. The Fire Twin, Imichi, her red aura only flushed an ever-so-slightly darker shade of crimson around her pale white belly, which had both her and her sister giggling as they both rubbed around her belly button. And lastly there was Urit. An Elf with light brown skin and glossy black hair, a pale blue aura and a smile as wide as the forest as her belly was accented with a blue glow darker than her own. \n\nAs Tanza stood up and hugged her sisters, the visions of their children came to her mind. From each of them she saw strong, beautiful, Elves gifted with an unusual magic talent. Especially the younglings growing within Zaky and Imichi. What the Elder Elf witnessed from them surprised even her. \n\n\"Would you like to hear your daughter's gifts?\" she asked Zaky. \n\n\"Is she going to be special?\" \n\n\"Well, when she grows older... I will be able to step down once I have her in control of her powers of a Blessed.\" \n\nZaki couldn't fight the broad grin creasing the whole of her cheeks. With a squealing cheer she threw her arms around Tanza, and in return the Elder held her close and gave her a soft kiss atop her head. Blesseds like herself were few and far between, coming around only once every half millennia, if then. It would allow her to retire from her role as the Tree Elf Elder and once again find her own path in the world beyond their forest. \n\nCatching the sideways glance they received as well, the Fire Twins asked in unison, \"Will our daughter be special?\" \n\nChuckling and softly rubbing Zaky's back, Tanza answered, \"I see only perfect mirror images of the both of you in both of your daughters.\" \n\nThere were several unified cries of glee as the new mothers crowded the twins, smothering them with kisses and congratulations. The Twins were the first of their kind in the clan, and now that they caught another pair was something Tanza couldn't even fathom had she not saw it herself. It would be interesting how the rest of the clan took the news as it definitely warranted a celebratory feast. \n\nGalen, you magical, young man, the Elder thought as she started sending her thoughts out to her sisters. I wish upon you and Celia the great joy you have brought us today. May Necela bless. \n\n........................... \n\nIcy water flowed out of a spout in the ceiling and Galen stumbled under the chilling stream in a daze. Crimson tinted the water running through his clothes, turning into a red river which ran toward the drain in the middle of the large shower room. Free of his helmet and gear, the Private stood clothed but barefoot as the aftermath of battle washed away from his attire \n\nWith a distant look on a fatigued face, he lifted his bloodied hands and blinked as the water running off his chin washed more of the red from his palms. When he could see his own skin color again he turned his hands over and washed away the red traces on his knuckles to reveal their partially shredded skin. \n\nEven as his hands were cleaned of the physical mess, he couldn't shake the feeling like he was still standing in a cloud of filth. His chest echoed with a hollow ache while the images of what he had done and witnessed jumbled around within his head like the scenes of some horror film. And that vigorous tremble returned to his left hand. \n\nNecela cut down like a common mortal. The bodies scattered across the tunnel floor, both human and Drow... At least four of the dead Elves being some he had gotten personal with, in either training or in bed, during his time in the Underdark. There were the corpses of their fallen foes, all being stripped of everything they had and then getting stacked like garbage at the side of the tunnel. \n\nThen there were the men from Redding who had survived... though they didn't for very much longer. Jrastra and one of the Red Sister leaders made certain of that after the women of their units had finished whatever revenge they wished to reap. Their actions were something the young soldier did his best to forget in the aftermath of that bloody battle. \n\nBefore Galen even realized it, he had fallen to his knees and lost whatever was left in his stomach. He coughed, and then hurled to let out his guts again. The world spun as he came down onto his hands, and between his heavy breaths he spat out whatever bile still lingered in his mouth. \n\nAs the sickness passed, he remained on all fours, collecting himself as the aftermath fully sank in. That forty Drow were gone. Nine of them part of the Sun-kissed with countless more wounded. He almost retched again as he thought of how he found Felyn, an axe buried into the stomach plate of her armor to an unknown depth. She had begged for him to heal her, and with everything he had he tried. \n\nHis hands didn't, couldn't, light up. The vine and feather tattoos that once decorated his left arm were gone and with their absence, everything Galen had been gifted with from the Elves and Necela was proven taken by the witch just as the princess had been. \n\nThe loss didn't stop Galen from using his last medical kit and doing what he could. With Keetle's help he tore the Empath out of her armor and got the axe out of her belly so he could spring into action. Starting her with a shot of morphine, he had poured sulphonamide powder over the wound before wrapping it up in gauze the best he could. It felt to be the longest minutes of his life as he pressed both hands down onto her belly, keeping pressure on where the axe had gone in. But he wasn't a medic. He only performed what first aid he knew and cursed himself for not being able to do more. \n\nWhen she realized what Galen was doing, Keetle used her magic to replace his hands and the Private was able to cinch a wrapping around the Empath's midsection to keep the bandages tight to her body. After that, they could only wait and watch as the aide fought for her life, the Private unable to do a damn thing beyond what he had already done. \n\nUnder the warming water of the shower, he looked to his hands and tried to strike them up into a glow for a hundredth time. He could still feel magic pulsing within him, powering his Dark Vision, but no trick he knew brought the light back to his fingertips. That witch had stolen all of it from him. \n\nGalen clenched his fists as his nostrils started flaring with forced breaths. He was going to kill her. He was going to make her regret everything she did this day. She was going to wish she never stepped foot into the darkness of the underground. \n\nCursing Haru's name Galen let loose a battle cry and slammed his fists into the floor, his tears joining the streams of water running his face. As the women of the Red Sisters, Royal guard, and Sun-Kissed died without him there to heal their wounds, she would die for denying him the power to do so. \n\n... \n\nAfter wringing his clothes dry the best he could and cleaning his gear as much as possible, Galen donned his armor pieces and got his clothes back on. Near the exit to the baths was a small alcove in the wall, barely high enough for him to stand up straight. Its walls were plated in sheets of tanneran and stepping inside he could feel the heat pouring out from the glowing, blue metal. \n\nAn enchantment of some kind was at work in the closet, he guessed, as he thought of how his cuirass could change its temperature to accommodate his current conditions. Such as how it now produced heat to counteract the cold of his damp clothes. \n\nHeat off the walls was mirrored by heat coming off his chest armor to spawn trails of steam rolling off his clothes in moments. When he felt dry enough to be comfortable, he went for his weapons against the wall beside the exit. Picking up his rifle, he took notice of how the stock had fresh, bare patches in the moss where the original walnut was showing through once more. Given how Haru's beast batted him with a homerun strike, he wasn't entirely surprised. \n\nIn addition, his pistol had a new crack in the right handgrip and a gouge in the slide near the muzzle. Thinking back to how he had thrown it after the witch disappeared, he was lucky those were the only things done to it. A Drow could've taken it, the barrel could've been damaged, something could've been bent... he got off easy considering the alternatives. \n\nFully equipped with all his gear, he opened the exit door and stepped into the long hallway of the barracks. Along the walls on both sides of the corridor were the doors of the personal rooms of the Sun-kissed, the closet's worth of space that the Private called his own being among them. \n\nAs he hesitantly paced down the hall, he saw the room next to his being emptied of the last of its previous owner's property. Same with the room five doors down from him. And another down and across the hall from there. Nine rooms total were being stripped of the personal effects of the nine Drow that would never come back to claim them. \n\nGiving a sigh, Galen carried his somber cloud onward, past the male servants clearing out the rooms and to the door that carried on into the stairwell. When he was cast into darkness with the closing of the door behind him, his eyes buzzed and his Darkvision kicked in to light up a glowing life aura right in front of him. Keetle was leaning against the center pillar that the stairs spiraled up around and twirled a knife in the air with her force magic. \n\nUpon seeing the surfacer she made a sweeping motion with her head up the steps and started climbing. \n\n\"How's Felyn?\" Galen asked, marching up the steps behind the Aide. \n\n\"Fine. Blood stopped and she sleeps.\" \n\nHis lungs emptied as his shoulders dropped, Thank God. \n\n\"And Zyrtwi?\" \n\nThe knife twirling above Keetle's head fell and landed in her open palm to be returned to its sheathe. \"Don't know. Sword went in gap in armor under arm. She's sent to Faerdron.\" \n\nAll done in the first moments of the battle. Once the Drow had gotten themselves collected and focused, the attackers couldn't stand much of a chance. But in those initial seconds when they had surprise and the crippling effect of the flare, the Dark Elves paid a heavy price. Galen could only wonder how much worse it could've been had he not spotted that first man coming out from the ceiling... if he hadn't given a warning. \n\nA slight trace of a smile appeared as he thought about the lives he saved. All things considered, maybe he should focus on that. \n\nAs they reached the top of the staircase, Keetle waved her hand and the door leading to the main hall opened to let the lights from inside pour out. His vision returning to normal, Galen followed the Aide and joined the gathering encircling the three Commandants who leaned over the round planning-table under the light of the chandelier. Both Dreek and Jrastra looked up and took notice of him, the former motioning him in while the latter spoke out with a raised voice. \n\n\"You have your orders, prepare what you need and review your roles! I want you all able to tell me your objectives backward in a surface tongue by departure time!\" \n\nThe Drow in the room acknowledged the first Commandant and made their way to the exits. In a tone that sounded none-too-pleased, Aufryn'uit grumbled lowly to Dreek and cast a nasty glare at Galen. Taking notice, the Private returned the second Commandant's spiteful look as she pushed off and moved for the door leading outside. \n\n\"Galen, come here,\" Dreek ordered. \n\nHe watched with narrowed eyes as Aufryn'uit disappeared into the exit tunnel before acknowledging the third Commandant. When he approached the table, he looked down at the three large maps spread out over its wooden surface. Several arrows drawn in multiple locations all pointed to the same area of what looked to be city on one map, while the area they pointed to was blown up into a floor plan on another. \n\nWith great interest, Galen peered at the human script at the top of the map. He recognized the characters from before. They meant something he knew but he couldn't quite figure it out. He looked to the first map again, which detailed what looked to be a giant crack in yellow earth... Kind of like the trench that housed a certain place he intended to raid. \n\n\"This is... Redding?\" \n\n\"The map of the Sundered Trench, Redding, and the King's castle,\" Dreek clarified, pointing to each of the layouts as she listed them. \"All the pieces fall into place tomorrow night which, by luck, is a new moon. The darkness will be an indispensable ally.\" \n\nScanning over the map of the city, Galen found an area that looked to be taken up by a single, massive house. It was circled in red ink with several notes scrawled over it with arrows and symbols drawn over the rooftops and streets leading to it. Closer inspection had Galen recognizing the symbols as bows, horses, swords... \n\n\"Is this Fretheim's place?\" he asked. \n\n\"With guard locations, horse patrols, and plans of attack. Once the main mission is complete, we go after the Princess and your mistress,\" Jrastra explained. \n\nThe Private's eye twitched at the term used for Celia, but he ignored it as he responded, \"Right, what's the plan?\" \n\nDreek tapped her finger on a large hall in the castle floor plan, \"Their King's eldest son has finally returned from a venture in Astiko for the celebration of their princess' reaching the beginning of her second decade. A grand dinner will have both princes, the princess, their generals, top officers, and even heads of ruling houses of the city attending. All the people who refuse to deal in a bloodless end to this petty war will be in one place.\" \n\n\"You wanna kill 'em,\" Galen surmised, swallowing hard as he thought of the little girl. \n\n\"Correct, but not all. We intend to spare some royals, and those people that have come around to a bargain: humans that can do well to clean up the mess after we've finished.\" As Dreek said that, Jrastra stifled a chuckle and let her fellow Commandant continue. \"As for the others... We've found more... promising figures in Redding who can take over their positions. We kill those in the way, they step up, and we can finally stop wasting resources holding off their assaults and raids on our borders.\" \n\nA low heat radiated from Galen's cuirass as a gloomed look pulled down on his features. As much as he hated it, he knew that no change can come without cost. But just how much more blood is going to spill? Was there a need for it? \n\nWould the children have to witness? \n\n\"Just what kinda king does Reddin' have? For him to need die?\" The words rolled out of his mouth before his mind had a chance to stop them, and he grew acutely aware about how quiet the room was as the two Drow before him looked up from the table. \n\nDreek's eyes narrowed on his. He swallowed. \n\n\"Belly growing weak for bloodshed?\" the third Commandant questioned. \n\nPicking up on the shivering chill in Galen's heart, the grinding stone of regret inside, Jrastra rolled her eyes and spoke up, \"The King is the kind that likes to watch beheadings and hangings for entertainment. The kind that orders all Elves, of all kinds, to either be exiled or executed in his city unless they're enslaved by a noble family. The kind that demands something they call 'registration' for anything not human that wants to even look at their city. Not to mention the talks of him considering a new assault on Atzla and the swift execution of his critics.\" \n\nDreek had looked over her shoulder to cast a questioning eye upon Jrastra before glancing over to Galen with a raised brow. \n\n\"He's a racist dictator,\" Galen concluded, his gaze too focused on the maps to notice Dreek's relinquishing glare. \n\nAt the same time, sensing the flames stoked in the Private's belly by her words, Jrastra grinned and answered. \"Yes, but there is more. Two Scouts were captured and fell under his personal interest since the war began. The first was some time ago and we... confirmed... her execution when he had her head lobbed at our tunnel guards... The second was caught on Dreek's last surface raid. The day prior to your first meeting, actually. Contacts in the castle say she is being tortured in ways only a male could a female... Sometimes by the King himself behind the Queen's back.\" \n\nThat fire was turning into a twirling inferno now, and Jrastra confidently decided she needn't say more. She merely had to wait as the gears turned in his head and feel what emotions worked through his chest. \n\n\"Alright,\" he murmured. \"Walk me through it. Getting into the city, how do we do it?\" \n\nJrastra's grin evolved to a broad smile while she pointed her finger to the front gate of the city. \"That is the part of the plan in which we require a... human touch, for there is a bounty upon any and all Sun-kissed, especially a Commandant. And should one of us be captured... you would be granted a royal audience...\" \n\n........... \n\nA yawn escaped the mouth of an archer as he stood on overwatch, positioned on a flat roof above the road leading to Fretheim's manor. Grunting and clearing his throat, he knelt down while pulling a flint and steel from his pocket. Using a rolled piece of waxed paper, he struck the flint to light a small flame. Before he could lose it, he pulled his pipe from its pouch and used the burning roll to light the tobacco already prepped inside. He sucked in one puff, then two to get the tobacco smoldering, then tossed the paper down to stamp out the flame. \n\nContent, he breathed out a cloud of smoke and sat cross-legged on his rooftop. Still watching the street, he laid his bow across his lap and hunched over to rest his elbows on his knees and hold his head up in his hands. A sudden, chilling breeze whipped through the air and sent a ripple of goosebumps up his back alongside a shiver. He quickly shrugged off the cold and blinked his watered eyes dry just as a beast strolled right onto his street below from an alleyway. \n\nHe had an arrow pulled from his quiver and planted on the drawstring in an instant. His pipe still in his mouth, he came up on one knee and prepped to fire. In the next moment he realized what was below him and his pipe nearly fell from his lips.  \n\nPeople in Redding heard of the monsters that roamed the forest to the east. Of all sorts of twisted creatures born within the trees, but the archer never thought he would witness one within Redding. If his readings were accurate, a creeger stalked the street below. A cat the size of a hay wagon with fangs the length of one's hand protruding out of the corners of their mouths. Two wicked tails flayed the air behind them with razor-sharp blades of bone adorning the tips. ",
        "Their pelts were plenty soft, but trying to claim one was a death wish unless you had twenty men to back you. This one had fur as black as ink and murderous, red eyes... and someone riding on its back. The archer had to look twice, but then the rider, a woman, sat up. Her dark armor almost camouflaged her against the beast's back and had it not been for her white hair, he wouldn't have seen her at all. \n\nShe yawned aloud as she woke and stretched out her arms with a groan before mumbling, \"Are we close, Xerivan?\" \n\nThe creeger growled and kept moving. \n\n\"Good. I tire of this place already.\" \n\nHow in the Nether did she domesticate that?! \n\nThe archer was left wondering as he pulled his arrow off his bow and returned it to his quiver. Just to be certain he pulled his pipe out of his mouth and sniffed the contents. Nothing funny that he could smell, but just to be safe he dumped the ashes out and put it away. First thing in the morning, he was going to get a new source of tobacco. \n\n... \n\nThere was another thud against Haru's boot as Xerivan's belly was struck from the inside. \n\n\"Ooooh, Xerivan, the child's kicking, what will we call her when she's born?\" She laughed. \n\nThe shadow beast snarled toward its midsection before something shifted within its insides. There was a muffled scream, but the kicking stopped though the body within still continued to fight against her captor. Gentle fingers suddenly rubbed up along the beast's spine between its shoulder blades before the nails dug in to scratch its back. \n\nAs Xerivan groaned in contentment, its rider using both hands to satisfy itches it wasn't even aware of, the burden within its stomach didn't feel like such a bother anymore. Thoughts of morphing into a small dog and snuggling in its Matron's arms were growing ever more tempting as her fingers continued working up its back. \n\n\"Later, Xerivan,\" she whispered, as though feeling its intentions. \n\n\"I WILL DESTROY YOU!\" screamed a Drow voice from under the demon's skin. \n\n\"Must've got the gag off... Sorry about this, Xervy\" Haru whispered in her mount's ear before booting at his belly, getting a yelp of pain out from the woman within. \n\n\"Quiet or the humans here will kill you,\" the witch hissed. \"Your rank means nothing to the people around us and you will suffer a good long time before they even consider killing you.\" \n\nThere was no response from the Princess trapped within the demon's belly though in the newfound silence the shape shifter huffed with relief before outright groaning with pleasure when Haru scratched behind its ears. \n\n\"We're almost there. Let's go stealthy and see who we're meeting.\" \n\nNodding, Xerivan exploded into a cloud of smoke that was quickly encompassed by a transparent sphere. In the time it took to blink one's eye, the witch, demon and Princess were engulfed in a bubble, invisible to all outside of it. \n\nHaru clenched her teeth, her body shivering as she fought to bring the spell to full strength. Her creature of shadow kept them hovering just off the ground while his dark tendrils wrapped around the Drow Princess to keep her silent and restrained. It was far less painful to cloak when there was just the two of them, but the third body added a new challenge for the Witch to overcome. \n\nHis smoke-like essence flooding the space within the bubble, Xerivan carried his passengers to a rooftop across the street from the manor that belonged to the issuer of Haru's contract. He touched down on a flat roof and released Haru from his grasp. Before she could make a sound, the creature reshaped his shadowed form into a snake to wrap himself around the Princess's body. \n\nWith a dull white glow lighting up her irises and a flourish of hand motions, Haru stepped to the edge of her cloaking bubble and looked out over the compound across the street. Something was happening in the yard of Fretheim's home to bring a demeaning glare to her deathly, black eyes. \n\n\"Where are we?\" Iim'treemay asked as Xerivan's neck pulled off of her mouth, allowing her to look at her surroundings with a wide-eyed look. \n\nHaru was quick to shush the Drow and kept her focus on maintaining the bubble and watching the events unfold below. \"We're in Redding.\" \n\n\"Redding?!\" the Princess snapped, her focus snapping from the foreign world of the surface city straight to her captor. \"You fucking surface whelp! If the Sun-Kissed don't flay your hide-\" \n\n\"Xerivan.\" \n\nThere was a hiss and Xerivan's neck extended and wrapped around the Princess's head and force her mouth shut while he kept his gaze on the scene below. Haru's frown deepened as a shirtless man walked out of the front door of the manor onto his front lawn, to where two men held a nude woman's arms behind her back as she wrestled to get free. Mr. No-Shirt came to them and grabbed onto the girl's golden flow of hair and threw her down to the ground before dragging her screaming across the grass. Blood was flowing from stab wounds in his chest, and more steadily trickled from the skin across his stomach where he was sliced open. \n\nWith a furious heave he threw the woman onto a stone path in front of him. When she tried to get up, he didn't hesitate to drive his foot into her face. Haru cringed at the sight, but kept silent as the woman fell flat on the ground with one foot planted on her back to hold her down. The bloodied man kept her like that for a few moments as he ran both hands over his head to smooth his blond hair back and suck in a deep breath. \n\n\"After everything I have done for you,\" he sighed, touching his fingers to one of his wounds and staring at the blood with a demon's rage in his eyes. \"After all the gifts I bestow and the comforts I grant, you do this to me?!\" \n\n\"You're... evil,\" she whimpered, drooling blood. \n\n\"Evil? No no no. No, my dear,\" he growled, leaning down to speak directly into her ear. \"Evil, would be locking you in a cell until I wish your company. Evil would be constantly passing you among my men like a whore. EVIL would TORTURE you for trying to kill your lord!\" \n\nHe pulled his foot off her back and knelt down producing a knife from the pocket of his pants. She squealed when he grabbed her by the hair again to peel her head back. When he had her eyes locked with his, he brought his weapon to the underside of her jaw. \n\n\"Evil wouldn't have granted you the luxuries that I gifted you and all my other pieces. Nor would it be as merciful as I. You betrayed my trust. You betrayed your other pieces. All I asked was your loyalty and obedience. By denying me this, you betrayed yourself. And now you will pay the price.\" \n\nBefore she had to witness the kill, Haru sighed and turned away. In a respectful silence Xerivan lifted their cloaking bubble off the rooftop to bring them back down to the ground. Even the Princess merely just cast a glare upon the witch in the aftermath of what they just witnessed. \n\nWhen her feet left a solid surface, Iim'treemay shifted uneasily in the grasp of the foggy demon. Floating some distance in the air, she looked out over the human city, taking it in properly for the first time. \n\nThis is the place Mother wanted me to keep in check beyond Faerssune, she thought. \n\nWith thousands of her kind brewing and scheming on how to keep power to themselves after she arrived, she was also expected to deal with this place? The world underground was difficult enough to handle by itself, let alone with another surface cesspool thrown into the mix. But then again, her mother would not be failed. It wasn't an option. If the Princess Regent wanted her power and the favor of her Val'Sharess, she needed to get a grip on her outbursts. To be able to control her emotions even around the Witch and her demon would be a good testament to her perseverance, something one would need if she ever wanted to make her mother proud. \n\n\"I don't get it,\" Haru declared when Xerivan brought them to the ground just outside Fretheim's front gate. \n\nThe Witch turned to the Drow Princess and shook her head. \"I mean, I get the bastard wants to get a point across, I give my kills a few words before I let them pass on, but why give a whole speech?\" \n\nXerivan reassumed the shape of a creeger, his tail splitting in two while still wrapped around the Princess to keep her bound. He dipped down to allow Haru to climb onto his back while she continued to rant, \"Tell them goodbye, tell them to rest in peace, but don't give a speech to someone who's on Death's doorstep. It's a waste of time and breath. Honestly, on Death's good graces...\" \n\nHaru cast her hands around her and the edge of the bubble around them shuddered. Fretheim had already returned to his house by now to let his men deal with the body in the yard. But he likely couldn't have made it very far from the door. \n\nQuirking her mouth and frowning, Haru said, \"I guess the only exceptions to the rule are the cute ones. But they don't get speeches, only parting gifts. Like the handsome, little soldier of yours I found in the tunnels...\" \n\nThe Witch giggled as she looked back at a scowling Iim'treemay seated on the base of Xerivan's tails. \"I was so saddened to kill him that I gave him a little kiss goodbye. He could have been a fine sire.\" \n\nWith a gust of air, the bubble of invisibility shattered around Haru and Xerivan. Every guard in earshot came to alert, every person with a line of sight readying their arms. And under the threat of drawn bows and arrows, the Demon and the Witch waltzed forward to get within arms-reach of Fretheim's front gate. \n\n\"Fretheim! Your men are dead!\" Haru yelled. \"But I brought my end of the bargain!\" \n\nShe sat there on Xerivan's back for several moments, carefully eyeing the guards closing in around her. Given that this client's representative fell victim to the abilities of a Sun-Kissed elder, she didn't expect him to have much trust for her on their first meeting. Not that he had much choice. She had something he wanted, he had something she wanted, and she was taking what she wanted one way or another. \n\nHaru still made the mental note to meet the client personally before taking contracts next time. No more third-party deals. \n\nBefore long, the front doors of the manor opened up, a quartet stepping out. Right away Haru recognized blond Mr. Shirtless, only now he had a leather coat on over a bandaged torso and two escorts in full plate armor at his back. The fourth man, however, was wearing mithril and kept to blondie's flank. As he drew closer Haru could feel the magic coursing through her go cold. Worse than cold. \n\nIt was going dead. \n\nSomething was very wrong about that man in mithril, but very familiar as well. She just couldn't place it. \n\nAs the four men came to the gate of the manor, Xerivan gave a low growl that brought the two guards to alert. Haru chuckled weakly and stroked her fingers behind the ears of the demon's feline form. \n\n\"Calm, Xerivan. I think this is our customer, Lord Fretheim?\" \n\nShe could sense the glower she received from the Princess behind her, paying it no mind as she dismounted. The men stopped at the gate, Shirt-less Blondie coming face-to-face with the Witch and presenting his hand through the bars. \n\n\"You would guess right, love,\" he announced. \"You would be the Skull Wraith, my Magic Mercenary?\" \n\nHaru grinned and took his hand. \"In the flesh.\" \n\nHer smile was returned by Fretheim who brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her knuckles. The Mercenary gave a girlish giggle and the lord turned his gaze to the Drow on Xerivan's back. \"And this is the fabled Iim'treemay Relynviir, second daughter to the Valsharess?\" \n\n\"Don't start,\" Haru griped. \"She's the Queen's daughter, true, but she's a magicless whelp too young to play in Drow court by my opinion. More of a bull's-eye on your back than anything... I'm kind of helping you commit suicide here, when you think about it. Drow don't appreciate their royals being taken for political prisoners or being used as leverage.\" \n\nTo her surprise, both the lord and the man in the mithril gave her questioning looks, then glanced at each other. First it was Fretheim that started chuckling, then his armored friend joined in as they had themselves quite the reserved chortle. Quirking an eyebrow, Haru glanced back on the coal-skinned elf who still scowled at her with Xerivan's tail still wrapped over her mouth. \n\nFacing the men again she asked, \"What's so funny?\" \n\nFretheim shook his head and quickly composed himself, \"I have no political ambitions for the sweet Princess. I wanted to add more elven blood to my collection of divine beauties and she is the second divinely unique piece of Elven kind that I have had the opportunity to obtain.\" \n\nIn that moment, Haru's eye twitched. Her smile wavering. \"Well... then... if that is the case, then I wish you the best in trying to hold her. I'll take my reward and you can take the Qu'essan. Ending my contract.\" \n\nFretheim nodded and motioned one of the men behind him. Haru shifted her attention to the knight who pulled a bag off his hip and presented it to her through the bars of the gate. She took the small package and opened it up, sifting through the countless gold pieces to a green, metal medallion buried within. Upon touching its smooth surface, the witch shuddered and closed both her eyes while giving a breathless chuckle. \n\n\"So you did have it after all. I shan't ask how.\" \n\nShe turned to Xerivan and motioned her head to the gate. The demon growled as it suddenly lowered itself to the ground, claws coming out of its paws. In one pounce it sprang clear over the high privacy wall of the estate and slammed into the ground beside Fretheim's group. Both the accompanying guards pulled their swords, but the oversized, twin-tailed tiger merely dropped the Drow onto the grass beside the lord and man in mithril before it exploded into a black cloud. Without solid mass, he passed back through the gate and reformed as a dark horse at Haru's side. \n\nWith a sharp look in her eyes, the witch gave Fretheim a smile and climbed onto her mount's back. The slack-jawed noble couldn't even blink as he awed at Xerivan, his mithril armored friend pulling a medallion out of his armor to inspect it while worriedly glancing at the demon as well. \n\n\"We are done, Lord,\" Haru declared. \"Enjoy your peace.\" \n\nHer mount exploded into smoke again and, along with its rider, disappeared into the night. \n\n........... \n\nHer sobs were likely heard by everyone on this floor, but Celia didn't care. If the whole house heard her she didn't care. Tears ran down her cheeks from puffy, reddened eyes as they kept locked on the lone window of her room. This was the only time she locked it and shut the curtains herself. \n\nShe didn't want to see the aftermath of what happened. The body that was now undoubtedly being dragged away. \n\nThe body of the girl that had brought her food. That had washed her bedding. Scrubbed what little she had for clothes. Celia remembered how calm she felt at the girl's voice, how soft she was in the words she spoke and how she never showed annoyance for the Elf's linguistic shortfall with human tongue. \n\nAnd now she was gone. In the flick of a wrist she was gone. Celia didn't even know why. Sniffling, she pressed the first knuckles of her hands together and joined the tips of her thumbs. It was a traditional pose for her to hold as she prayed to Necela, Calia, and Moitri to keep her safe as she passed to the next life. \n\nA time later, after her tears had dried and the voices outside went quiet, Celia was wrapped up in her blankets trying for a desperate sleep when there was a rap at her door. The Tree Elf sat up in an instant and drew her knees to her chest, quivering as her mind raced through all the reasons one would come to her at this time of night. \n\nNobody ever came to her door after she'd been given dinner. \n\nThe guard on the other side of her door shifted to one side. Steel boots could be heard shuffling across the floor with each movement. Cocooned in her blanket with only her eyes exposed, the Elf swallowed as her door opened and her visitor stepped into her realm. \n\n\"Celia,\" she was addressed immediately. \n\nShe blinked once. Then twice. Swallowing with a dry throat in a weak voice she asked, \"Val?\" \n\nThe door closed behind Pretayus' pet as she stepped over to Celia's bed. A dull orange glow, barely noticeable even in the dark, still weakly shone from her olive skin. Her smooth brown hair, once kept in the most elaborate, little braid Celia could wind, was now clipped short and flowing free down to just touch her shoulders. \n\nAnd then there were her eyes. In a time before, Celia thought of them like the night: pure black with a twinkle of joy in them like a star above. Now they were just black. The sparkle she knew and the cheer that made it glimmer was gone. Like the last ten years stole away what a hundred had given. \n\n\"You haven't changed at all, have you, Sister?\" Val asked, seating herself on the foot of the bed. \n\nWith watering eyes Celia swallowed the first words that had come to her mind. Val hadn't visited her or communicated with her in any significant way since her capture. No conversations, no notes, no explanations. What was the lost sister doing now? Celia tightened the blanket around her and tried to loosen her throat enough to speak. \n\n\"W-w-we are not...\" A tear ran Celia's cheek as she quivered with the words on her tongue. \"Not sisters. Not anymore. You're... You're gone.\" \n\n\"Am I?\" the enslaved elf questioned with a smirk and incredulous look. \n\n\"Yes!\" Celia cried, fresh rivers running her face as she pressed it into her quilt. \"I don't know you! What happened to Val?! What happened to my friend?!\" \n\nHer breaths were short and shaky, though Val lifted her eyebrows and quirked her mouth looking none-too-impressed. \n\nGasping past her sobs, Celia let it all out into her quilt while she questioned, \"Where was my clan-sister when my Galen suffered from Pretayus? Where was she when those brutes locked me away me in this room? Where were YOU when I spent all this time trapped in this prison?!\" \n\nThe Elf's chest was heaving as she looked up from her quilt, her red eyes meeting an indifferent stare. Val slouched over, holding her head up with her arm braced against her knee. Then with her eyes unshifting and still locked with Celia's, she grinned. \n\n\"Downstairs, in the company of my master.\" \n\nCelia's ears drooped, and she pushed her face back into her blanket before she broke down again. Val kept still and watched in silence as the sobs of the other Elf carried on. \n\n\"For ten years we wanted you back... we cried, we prayed for you...\" she pouted. \"We tried to sneak all four of you away in the night... We did everything we could...\" \n\nVal shook her head. \"Why? Why waste the effort when I was finally set free?\" \n\nCelia hiccupped as her head snapped up, her eyes wide. \"F-f-free? You were enslaved!\" \n\nA firm nod preceded the words, \"A short chain to the soaring bird is better than the long leash to the grounded tree. Not living under Tanza, not facing the hardships of those primitive ways we lived with in those Goddess-forsaken woods. I got the chance to see unimaginable constructs, monuments of mortals, felt the love of men without having to wait ten turns of winter.\" \n\n\"You were enslaved...\" \n\nVal huffed a breath of a chuckle. \"My dear, I would say rescued. Afterall, If the clan was so great, why did you go with your demon?\" \n\nCelia frowned and sniffled. \"He is no demon. He is a gifted human who loves me as I love him.\" \n\n\"He didn't love you until after the first kiss, am I right? One lip touch and he was bound to you by the charms of our kind.\" ",
        "At those words the bundled Elf flinched and cast her eyes guiltily to the side. \"He loves me. The Charm wears away in zetrans. He stayed with me long after it would have worn away. He still does.\" \n\n\"Oh? How do you know?\" Val asked, quirking an eyebrow. \n\nCelia paused, biting her lip. \n\n\"You don't, do you?\" Val asked, one brow raised. \"Can't accept the fact that he is a corpse now, but he is. Your Neko girl-friend with the black fur confirmed it.\" \n\nThe green-haired Elf froze with her eyes opened to their fullest. Not even her lungs were moving as her mind registered what she had just heard. That her Galen was gone. \n\nHe wasn't. He couldn't be. She shook her head and suckled on her lower lip where she bit through the skin. \n\n\"You lie,\" she said flatly, voice teetering on the edge of a pout. \"Tanza gave me her visions. I've seen the time when Galen comes for me... Not all of it but... he is. And when he arrives, he will kill the slaver men. Pretayus, Fretheim... Even you, Val.\" \n\n\"Even me?\" she repeated, a touch of surprise to her tone as she sat up straight. \n\n\"He will do anything to protect me. With how you acted at the river, he would attack if you got in his way. He could kill you...\" She swallowed a lump in her throat. \"You would need to come back, Val. The real you has to come back. The you that belonged with our clan ten years ago. The clan-sister that loved me those nights when the chastity spell lifted from us. Please. I still love you, Val. I still want you safe.\" \n\nThe other Elf was taken back, blinking in wonder. Her breath fell silent and a shamed look dawned on her face as she said. \"I... I am safe... Love... Even if your Galen comes, Pretayus has safe guarded me against things you wouldn't imagine.\" \n\nStill curled up in her blanket, Celia probed, \"Has he fought back a troll?\" \n\nVal's eyes narrowed as their gazes met again. \"Has your Galen?\" \n\nCelia's eyes fell to the floor, a smile somehow creeping its way onto her lips as she thought back to a day only a short time ago. \"It was the way we met. I was... out... wandering, and needed a rest and what I thought a rock to sit down upon was actually a troll's thumb. Running only got me so far before I was snatched up in its hands and nearly squished. Galen came then. He showed just in time to fell the troll and save my life.\" \n\nAn unsure look crossed Val's face as she went into thought while listening to her former clan-sister. \"And if Galen is coming for you... Pretayus may not be enough to protect me if I appear a threat to him.\" \n\n\"Your 'Master' can't, he could get you killed if he puts you between me and Galen. I don't want that to happen. I don't want Galen to hurt you because of me. I want him to trust you; to bring you home to the clan and regain everything you've lost.\" \n\nVal pursed her lips and paused as her eyes fell to the floor. Somehow she seemed nervous, her hands fidgeting in a fashion Celia recognized. She was torn between choices. \n\n\"I'll try to keep my distance when Galen comes, then,\" she finally muttered in a low voice. \"But to earn his trust... I think I may know how.\" \n\nA hopeful look spawned on Celia's face as she drew her blanket cocoon back from her head. \n\n\"There is a journal that Pretayus keeps. It has the names and locations of all his customers. If I showed Galen where our other captured sisters are, would he trust me?\" \n\nCelia shrugged with an unsure look. \"We'd find out on the new moon. I think if I talk to him, he will.\" \n\nAgain, Val fell into silence as she thought things over. \n\n\"Are you really with his child, truly?\" She asked \n\n\"I don't know yet,\" Celia answered. \"The night before all this started was the night he laid with me for the first time, and became my first time.\" \n\n\"First time with a male,\" Val quipped, making Celia giggle. \n\n\"With a male,\" she echoed. \"We were so deep in bliss we forgot the potential of our union and he spent himself inside me.\" \n\nShe shuddered with a euphoric look. \"I still feel his heat sometimes, that divine pleasure of him filling me, pressing into my core... his seed erupting into me... I never came with such a rush in my life...\" \n\nWithout noticing Celia had brought one hand to her cheek, sighing against it while her other hand pressed between her thighs. When her awareness came about, her bright, white eyes blinking in realization, a red tint heated her cheeks and she quickly looked away to the floor. \"Sorry, Val.\" \n\nHer sister chuckled in reply. \"Don't apologize. Males are what we are born for, and love just makes everything better.\" \n\n\"It does...\" Celia agreed with a longing look before they sat in silence, the two of them staring at their feet. \n\n\"I have to go back downstairs now,\" Val said as she rose. \"They will be expecting me.\" \n\nCelia nodded slowly with a sigh and gloom to her face. \"May Necela bless, Sister.\" \n\n\"May Necela bless.\" \n\nVal went to the door and gave it two sharp raps. The door opened a hair, the guard peering in before he opened it the rest and permitted Pretayus' Elf to leave. Then the door shut, Celia's ears drooping again as the lock clicked into place. \n\nHer Sister's footsteps continued on down the hall along with the guard that had been with her. When she couldn't hear them anymore, Celia let out her breath and looked to the window. Alone again. \n\nShe unwrapped herself from her blanket and lay down on her bed, shutting her eyes to sleep. Tomorrow she would find out if she had a child, and what fate awaited her in the future. Her toes curled at the thought of what was to happen should her belly prove empty. \n\nPlease let me carry... I don't want Pretayus to hurt me... I don't want to be like Val... \n\nTack tack tack. \n\nCelia sat up in a flash. Something was tapping at her window. Yet before she could investigate, it threw itself open to permit a black fog to roll into her room. Her mouth opened to scream only for a hand encased in black leather to reach out and grab onto her face. And from there the rest of the body began to appear. \n\nFirst was the face of a human woman with hair white like the clouds and eyes black like shadow. Then the leather armor that covered her body formed, the toughened hide stained black to match her eyes. As the last of her limbs formed, so did a solitary finger pressing over her lips. \n\n\"Sshhhhh, quiet girl. I'm not going to hurt you.\" \n\nThe Tree Elf blinked, her breathing heavy. Even with her extremely limited grasp of the common tongue she was able to understand the words \"quiet\" and \"not hurt you.\" The latter still didn't help ease her uncontrollable fear sending her body into a quiver. \n\nThe fog pulled away from the intruder, twirling around the room and shutting the window before shrinking down into solid black ball beside her on the bed. From there it changed again, Celia's eyes going wide as it morphed into the shape of wolf pup no bigger than her hand. \n\n\"Do you speak the common tongue around here?\" \n\nCelia had to force herself to look away from the shadow pup beside her so she could engage the woman's stare. \n\nSpeak common tongue... she repeated in her mind, thinking a moment more before she shook her head the best she could considering her mouth was still in the other's grasp. A yelp escaped her when the shapeshifter hopped into her lap, staring up at her with all-too-innocent eyes. \n\n\"Hmm, this is going to be real fun,\" the woman declared to the pup. She pulled her hand back from Celia's face, slowly, while again pressing the shushing finger to her mouth. \n\n\"Speak,\" she ordered. \n\nThe Elf was still shaking horribly, but after mentally translating that solitary word, she swallowed and asked in her native tongue, \"Do you speak Tree Elf?\" \n\nThe leather clad warrior frowned and quirked her mouth, \"That sounds like some garbled, backwoods High Elf language, girl. Tell me you speak more than gibberish.\" \n\nCelia again held a look of confusion after the woman's short rant. If her native language didn't work, she'd have to try for something more common. \n\n\"Nekonian?\" she asked, her hands unconsciously hugging onto the pup. \n\n\"There we go, that's something I speak,\" her mysterious guest declared with a grin. \n\n\"What do you want?\" Celia asked, her voice shrill as she still quivered in fear. \n\n\"Your name, first, then tea and cookies as we talk about the lovely storm that's rolling in.\" \n\nA chuckle escaped the woman as Celia looked to the window and back at her just as confused as ever. \"What storm?\" \n\nShe only giggled again. \"My favourite kind. Tell me, what's your name? We can chat while Xerivan fetches the tea and cookies.\" \n\nBefore the Tree-Elf could question Xerivan's identity, the pup dissolved out of her arms. Forming into a black cloud it slipped away between the floorboards much to Celia's awe. A pair of snapping fingers brought her jaw up off the floor and her attention back to the woman before her. \n\n\"Don't mind him, he's harmless. I asked you your name.\" \n\nBlinking, wide-eyed and bewildered, Celia muttered her answer. \n\n\"Nice to meet you, Celia. I'm Haru. Do you know that name?\" \n\nThe Tree Elf shook her head in the negative. \n\n\"Huh, well then. I'll have you know I am a devout follower of the orders set by our Goddesses and as I have come here tonight, I find myself disgusted by the state of affairs I have discovered.\" \n\nHaru leaned back and fell into a sitting position just as Xerivan's fog erupted from the floor below to catch her. The demon formed a high-backed chair, rippling with demonic thorns up the sides and boasting a carving that mimicked a dragon's skull at the head. \n\nTwo cups of steaming tea emerged from the fog on black plates supported by dark tentacles coming out from behind the chair. The Witch took one of the drinks for herself while the other was offered to Celia. The Elf hesitantly accepted, taking the cup just before a dark plate full of cookies came forward as well. \n\nTaking a sip from her tea as well as a pastry for herself to nibble on, Haru spoke again, \"Despite my disgust, I've decided to poke around first to get some answers before drawing to conclusions. You look the honest type, the door to this room is locked from the outside, so you will be the one to whom I pose my questions. Why are you here?\" \n\nCuriously sniffing the tea before sipping, Celia inhaled sharply and nearly cried as a divinely sweet taste bathed her tongue in glorious succulence she had not tasted in months. \n\n\"Honey!\" she gasped. \"By Necela's good graces, honey!\" \n\nShe didn't hesitate in taking another long drink, sighing in utter bliss at the flavor. Haru gave her a questioning look, then shook her head and gave a low chuckle. \n\n\"Been missing out on the spoils of this wealthy bastard?\" \n\nSmiling with content, Celia nodded and stared down at her cup. \"I've been eating bread, water, and boiled greens for the past two weeks. I barely leave this room and I can't use my magic to grow something better because of Pretayus.\" \n\nA grumble echoed out of Haru's chair, and the Witch was quick to offer up a cookie. \n\n\"Then here, get it while you can.\" \n\nThe Elf didn't hesitate to accept it and take a bite. Her whole jaw went slack as she let out a deep breath; the warm, sweet delight sending her into a state of pure bliss. Whatever this pastry was made of, she needed to get the recipe. \n\n\"Thank you. Thank you a hundred times. This is the greatest kindness I've seen in these lands,\" she said, looking up at Haru. \n\nRaising a hand dismissively, the Witch grinned and replied, \"You need not worry about it. If you wish, pay me back in answers. Like why you are here.\" \n\nAt once the Elf's gaze fell to her cup, the tips of her long ears sinking downward as she grasped it with both hands and drew it close to her stomach. \"Because my kind is unique. I'm a Tree Elf of Atzla and Fretheim... he wanted me to be here as trophy slave I think. I only know what Pretayus told me.\" \n\nHaru frowned and rubbed her chin, ignoring the grumble from her seat. \"How'd he find you?\" \n\nCelia swallowed and took a deep breath, letting it out in a long sigh. \"I was in Atzla when the slaver Pretayus roped me out of the bush. I strayed from my Galen a bit too far and then... Pretayus took me and brought me here. Galen fought to get me back, killed some. But Pretayus cut his horse out from under him and rode off to this city. The belief of me being with child is the only reason he hasn't tried to make me broken.\" \n\nHaru's demon chair gave a low rumble as the Witch's eyes narrowed. With a tension drawing on the atmosphere around her she leaned back onto one arm and slouched in the seat, touching a contemplative finger to her chin. \n\n\"I see... And Pretayus... is he the one in the shiny mithril?\" \n\nCelia sipped her tea and nodded. \"Yes. He is the slaver that has been roaming Astiko and Atzla for fifteen years. Four other Elves have been forced into his hands, and I make five.\" \n\nAfter taking another sip from her cup, Haru set it aside and leaned in toward the elf. \"Thank you for your co-operation, Celia. Before I go, I must ask, do you know if your Galen is still coming for you?\" \n\nWithout even a moment's hesitation the Elf nodded. \"He is. I've witnessed the visions of my elder and Necela herself set him on a mission to slay Pretayus.\" \n\nHaru's eyes widened a bit, thinking back to her battle in the Drow tunnel. To the one human there that wasn't on her side. \n\n\"I know Galen will come here and do what he was set out to do. He isn't the kind that gives up.\" \n\n\"Indeed...\" the Witch muttered, quirking her mouth. \"Well, it has been a pleasure, Celia. For now, I must bid you farewell.\" \n\nThe Witch's chair exploded into a black fog, encompassing her body before darting out the window. The cookies were gone, same with her cup of tea. Any trace of her even being in the room vanished, leaving the Elf in awe. But after a pause to collect herself and close the window behind her mystery guest, Celia returned to bed and once again lay down to sleep. This time finding success. \n\n............. \n\nWith sucking pop, a fresh bottle of wine was opened and the contents quickly poured into a pair of glasses. A blank, lifeless expression to her young face, the blonde elf set the bottle on a tray along with the filled glasses and picked the whole thing up with both hands. Moving with precise yet mechanical movements she climbed the steep, frigid steps out of the wine cellar and up into the kitchen. The cooks, resting in the corner playing cards, paid her little attention as she carried on through the normally hectic room into the dining room. A guard was there at the table, sitting fast asleep in a chair with his face planted in a half-finished plate of potatoes and sliced meat. \n\nThe Elf ignored him and moved to the open doors at the far end of the room. From there she crossed the hallway and stood at the next set of closed doors and righted her posture. Her movements swift and flawless, she held the tray at hip level with a single hand and knocked three times before retaking a firm grip on her tray. \n\nIn moments a Neko woman opened the door, her nude body on full display, and stepped aside to allow the Elf to carry on into the room. She set her tray down on a table set between two couches, making sure not to cover up the map spread across the table top. When the men had their drinks, she stepped back against the wall to wait until they called on her again. \n\n\"Tonight is going to be quite the tale in my journal entry,\" Fretheim muttered from his spot on one couch as he leaned in to grab his glass. \n\nThere was a wince that showed on his face, his free hand touching a bandage covering one of his stab wounds. As he sat back, another human woman\u2014a blonde with bright, blue eyes\u2014stepped forward to gently massage her fingers into his shoulders while a pouting look stuck to her face. \n\n\"Such is the result when you don't break in a bitch right,\" Pretayus growled as he glared at his waiting drink. \"Amateurs get good people killed. Turn promise and potential into worthless wastes of flesh.\" \n\n\"I wouldn't blame her trainer,\" the nobleman muttered as he relaxed and let the massaging fingers sink into his muscles. \"She'd been with me for nearly four years. I had grown complacent around her, relaxed. I let those nasty illusions of what's right and wrong contaminate her mind...\" \n\nHe took another sip of his wine and smacked his lips. \"No matter. We have a Drow in the locked room, a Tree Elf in the good girl's room, and the last pieces being set into place.\" \n\n\"So we leave tomorrow, at first light?\" Pretayus wondered, motioning to the map. \n\nThe Slavemaster cocked an eyebrow when Fretheim shook his head. \"Tomorrow night, as soon as my men get back.\" \n\n\"Get back?\" Pretayus echoed, leaning forward. \"From where?\" \n\nAfter another sip of his drink, Fretheim held his glass up and swished the red liquid around inside. \"I was listening when you were talking to your Lycan friend after you got back earlier this eve. Something about the Demon's pet Neko being hauled off by the city guard for being a Ra'zorlich?\" \n\n\"One that I know would not be easily broken,\" the Slavemaster challenged as he leaned in, squaring up his shoulders. \"If you sent your men after her they are going to die. If she comes here, whether under their guard or not, I guarantee you will die!\" \n\nLooking up from his swirling glass, Fretheim asked, \"Are you certain?\" \n\n\"Short of chaining her to a wall and torturing her head until its hollow, you won't break her. I could, but that would require us not moving her to some mountain fortress for several weeks. The risks during transport are too high.\" \n\n\"But you could break her?\" \n\nPretayus frowned. \"I've brought many hearts and minds to heel, Cael, but hers would not crack so easily. I lost my first advantage when the guards took her away. Even if you succeed in getting her here, warriors like her do not break easy and the one assassin I've snapped before wound up taking the fast way down from a bell tower first chance she got.\" \n\n\"Then torture her head hollow. Cinisus is pleasurable enough,\" Fretheim stated casually motioning to the elven woman in the corner. \n\n\"If that's not done right, she has a chance of bouncing back,\" Pretayus grumbled. \"And if I have to spend that much time and effort on Celia, the Drow, and the fur ball, then I will be asking for something more than the promised sum.\" \n\n\"Even if the money is there, you won't have the time.\" \n\nBoth men turned as Val closed the door to the room behind her. Pretayus' brow arched down as he looked at her, his eyes critically gazing over her. Despite this face he gave her, the Elf cane right to him, wrapping her arms around his chest and holding tight. \n\nTrying to take the surprise out of his expression, the slaver returned the embrace as he asked, \"I suspect Celia spoke of troubles.\" \n\n\"She's as na\u00efve as ever,\" Val declared as her hands fell to his hips and she leaned back to look into his eyes. \"But she knows what's happening next. My old clan leader could see the future, and the future said Galen isn't dead. You are. Celia slipped and mentioned waiting until the new moon and that is tomorrow night...\" \n\nWith a sudden sniffle and a tear starting to glisten in the well of her eye, she swallowed and finished, \"It wasn't a maybe about you dying...\" ",
        "\"No, he won't,\" Fretheim declared, finishing his glass. \"I have the money and manpower to send a wall of troops and bounty hunters against any threat.\" \n\n\"You may as well pull every stop because he kills you, too!\" Val snapped. \n\nSilence hung in the air as the men stared at the Elf who simply rested her head against her master's chest, trying not to weep. A dark cloud hung over Pretayus as he hugged onto his pet. His hand clenching around his empty glass, Fretheim let out his lungs and set it on the table. \n\n\"I'm not a man of faith,\" he declared correcting his posture. \"Nor am I one to be bound by fate or destiny.\" \n\nHe leaned forward and gazed at the map on the table before him. \"I will send my men out to secure the Neko. I want her, and I will have her. If I am unable to claim her, they'll kill her so that demon can't. Then, we will move to my new home. It's far enough into the mountains that he will never find us. Anyone who may know of it is either already there or dead.\" \n\n\"He will follow,\" Pretayus warned. \"If he is determined enough to pursue me still, he'll follow.\" \n\nFretheim chuckled. \"Let me worry about that.\" \n\n.............. \n\nClaws skittered across stone as two men dragged Petra down a stone hallway with their arms hooked under her shoulders. Her hands were locked in solid casts of iron that encased her appendages completely. Even her feet were bound together with rope from ankle to knee. What they didn't cover however, were her eyes and ears. \n\nThe guards brought her to a room three floors underground into the bowels of Redding's castle. As impressed as she had been with the stone work of the castle exterior, with the towers, spires, and massive constructions of stone and wood, she was careful take every mental note possible about every nook, cranny, corner, and loose timber she saw inside. Nothing escaped her nor slipped her memory. She wanted every detail for her escape. \n\nNineteen full paces she counted from the open stairwell to a door, eighth in the lineup down the sparsely lit hallway. Past the door was nothing but a round table with two chairs on opposing sides. Five candles hung in a makeshift chandelier above, with a strong scent of dust clinging to the air. \n\nThis place looks to have been empty for quite some time... Disuse means few are brought down here... she scowled. Great. \n\nFrom the door the guards dragged Petra to one of the chairs and forcibly sat her down. All the Neko did in protest was cock an eyebrow as though asking \"Is that all?\" Even in the low light this look did not escape her escorts and other than a disappointed grunt, they left without a word. \n\nThe door shut and the lock clacking into place, the assassin waited for their footsteps to fade, then she stood up and reseated herself on the tabletop. With relative ease she brought her feet up and rested them to her side while bending her body over toward them. After adjusting her legs twice to avoid a cramp, she managed to arch her head down far enough to get her mouth to the knot binding the rope around her feet. \n\nUsing her tongue to feel the path of the rope, she eventually tugged the lead string backward through the main knot and let the binds loosen up enough for her to wiggle her feet around enough for the cord to fall off. \n\nNext she stood back up and blew out four of the candles in the chandelier above. It left just enough light for her to see, though not enough for a human to spot her as she backed up into a dark corner, shrouding herself in shadow. \n\nShe stood there for what could easily have been a half zetran without so much as twitching her ears. Nobody came to her room. Nobody knocked. Nobody even walked by from what she could hear. \n\nNo matter. Her patience was far from running out. \n\nWhen the boots finally did come marching down the hall some time later, she tensed, though quickly forced her breathing into a pattern to drop her heart rate. \n\nCalm, focused, prepared, she thought, settling her nerves and clearing her thoughts. \n\nEvery muscle in her body ready to spring into attack, the assassin let her ears take the point of her senses. Only one person was approaching her cell that she could hear. That meant either there were some very quiet men already posted outside, or they were too confident in their binds. \n\nThe metal boots stopped outside her door. Petra bent her legs to pounce. With a soft thunk, the lock opened, then the door. In an instant she recognized the knight captain in the doorway and paused. He hadn't changed out of his full plate armor from when he had arrested her, its silver trimming glittering in the candle light though his purple kilt looked almost grey. Aside from trying to snap his neck, she couldn't see a way to kill him quickly and quietly while still slipping away before anyone noticed. \n\nRak. You men and your armor. \n\nA sigh escaped the human as he walked into the room carrying a pitcher of water and two mugs in his hands. He set them down and took a seat in the chair opposite of the one Petra had been placed in. Then he just leaned back and got comfortable; his expression hidden under his helm. \n\n\"I understand you are a patient woman, and a trained killer,\" he announced. \"But the mages that overlook the stairwell would kill you long before you make any escape. And if you intend to still dig your claws into Fretheim's chest, I suggest you take a seat.\" \n\nIn the shadows, the Stalker's eyes narrowed. \n\n\"Or take your chances, it doesn't matter. Dee wouldn't be happy if you were killed. Afterall, she doesn't have much for friends or family left in this world.\" \n\nThe Captain leaned forward to grab the pitcher and fill both mugs with water. There were no weapons on his person that Petra could see, only the keys he carried. Still, with a degree of caution the Neko stepped forward from her corner, the Captain's head instantly turning toward her. \n\n\"Your fur truly is darker than the night. I wasn't sure if I was talking to an empty room.\" \n\n\"What has Dee told you?\" Petra growled. \n\nThe captain leaned back and joined his hands over his stomach, his head tipping back to reveal the mail that protected his neck below the chin. \"A bit, actually. You're name is Petra, family name unknown. You come from Atzla, a Shadow Stalker of the Ra'zorlichs, got caught in the service of a powerful being and are working to free an Elf from the hands of that cretin Cael Fretheim for your master. Aside from your heritage, you are in trouble for overstaying your temporary registration papers, breaking the curfew ordered on those papers, attacking Redding guards, assaulting private militia, espionage, and intimidating Redding citizens.\" \n\nI will slit your throat, Dee, Petra cursed. \n\nThe knight captain kicked one foot up and rested it on his knee. \"It's a long list of crimes, but I'll admit only your clan ties and the espionage is worth hanging one over, but that'd have to be on the crown's judgement.\" \n\nA low growl escaped the assassin's throat. The captain touched the tips of his fingers together in front of his helm and she could have sworn she sensed a grin under that layer of steel. \n\n\"But, all of that isn't on your record. Not even the arrest that brought you here tonight. It sort of got lost in the paperwork and records I am tasked to keep. My office is so very messy with that horseshit. I might find the time to log it, I might not. If the guardsmen check and they don't know why you're in the cell, they won't waste time feeding you and just toss you outside the city gates. Or send you on your way inside the city if you had proper paperwork. The kind I have the authority to have printed.\" \n\nEverything that spewed from his mouth rubbed Petra the wrong way. Twice did prickles trace over her back and press her nerves. Both her ears suddenly twitched as padded feet shifted on the other side of the door. \n\nSo he wasn't alone, that was why he came unarmed. A game was being played here, but she didn't know what. \n\n\"What are you trying for?\" she asked, scowling. \n\n\"To help you avoid the headsman's axe,\" he answered with all seriousness. \n\nThere was a stifled chuckle outside then, and Petra turned her head toward it. \n\n\"Obviously something is funny about you desiring that,\" she said in a voice loud enough to travel. \n\nThe Captain paused, interlocked hands shifting to below his chin with his index fingers tapping against one another. His chair flew back when he erupted to his feet. Armor squeaking and boots storming down onto the stone floor with a terrible racket, he rushed to the door. The wooden frame nearly came out of the wall when he threw it open. Behind it two men in guardsmen armor were waiting on the other side. Without delay the Captain rammed his steel-plated fist into the face of the first, sending him across the hall before he backhanded the other. \n\n\"GET OUT OF HERE, YOU WEASLES! Tell Rigor to keep his fucking nose away from my duties or I will slice it off!\" \n\nHe stood in the door way, an imposing mass of muscle and metal as the two men whined and scrambled off. Petra couldn't help but giggle. \n\nThen the captain turned to the right. \"You as well. She is my responsibility and you fucks are interrupting!\" \n\n\"But we were ordered-\" \n\nThe captain's fist swung again at the man Petra could not see, but could hear hit the floor. \n\nHis voice low, and quiet, with a tone threatening enough to invite a sadistic grin to the Assassin's face, he ordered again, \"Leave. Now. Or you will find my blade so far up your ass, I could put the tip on one stick, the pommel on another, and spit roast you like the pig you are. Am. I. Clear?\" \n\nLeather and mail scratched on stone as the guard scrambled to his feet and bolted off down the hall. The captain stood and waited, ensuring the hallway was clear before he shut the door and stormed back to his chair. Petra chuckled. \n\n\"They've been outside since the start of our conversation,\" he said, collapsing into his seat. \"I had to make it sound good for when they return to the other Knight-Captain. I'm under enough suspicion as it is.\" \n\n\"Oh?\" Petra asked, cocking an eyebrow. \n\n\"Long story, that. Back to business, Dee said you wanted to kill Fretheim and a slaver that he's sheltering. After what happened to her mother, I'm not surprised she was eager to help you. And now that we've met, I am as well.\" \n\nPetra frowned. \"What interest of yours is this affair?\" \n\nThe Captain gave a stiff hmph, then reached up to undo the chin strap of his helmet and pull it off. He set the armor piece on the table in front of him and set his eyes on Petra. He had messy black hair long enough to reach his brow, eyes of a color impossible to identify in the low light. But he had a familiar look about him... A streak of blond along his trimmed sideburns... a natural radiance to a not-overly-handsome face. \n\nBut then his scent hit her. She did not spend an eve rutting with him in a bed, but the scent coming off of him was recognizable in an instant. From there, everything clicked into place. It brought a chuckle to the Neko before she shook her head and leaned back. \n\n\"You're related to Dee,\" she accused. \"Half-brother? Same father?\" \n\nAn impressed look came over the Captain. \"You are still fresh from the forest, and I'd guess the tribe as well, so you wouldn't know the degrees different races mix and pass their traits on to their children. How broadly it varies.\" \n\n\"I have observed that when a human fucks a Neko, she births a human with Neko ears and tail.\" \n\nHis eye twitched as he lost his amused look. \"Or sometimes she would birth a seemingly full blood human, only with a few Nekonian strengths... It's all about whose traits prove stronger in the womb.\" \n\nBoth of Petra's eyebrows rose at this. She carefully eyed him up and down, taking an extra whiff with her nose. She leaned forward and tried inhaling more deeply a second time, but her mouth quirked and she frowned shaking her head. \n\n\"I do not see nor scent Neko in or on you. You lie.\" \n\nAt once his nostrils flared and he slowly breathed out. \n\n\"You've been sleeping in my sister's bed. Recently, and after she finished, ahem, 'working' as her more... intimate scent clings to your fur. That or you were the one she was working with, but I know her well, and she wouldn't with another woman.\" \n\nPetra fought with every ounce of strength she had to keep from grinning at that, it was something she had to hide behind an impressed look as he added, \"You haven't bathed in at least two days, no more than four, and give it two or three moons and you'll be going into heat. Do not doubt what I know about myself, Petra. Dee got the appearance, I got the rest.\" \n\n\"And while she has to take a cock every night to survive, you live in a comfortable position once held by your father?\" the Assassin questioned, crossing her arms and provoking a sigh from the apparent hybrid across from her. \n\nShe could see his teeth grind in his mouth, his eyes narrow slightly before he reclaimed his composure from these subtle tells or irritation. He leaned in, resting his elbows on the table and joining his hands. \n\n\"There are reasons why she is in that position. And while I can take blame for much of her hardships, it all traces back to Fretheim and Dee's own choice to stay where she is.\" \n\nBrows arching down, Petra leaned back with her tail lightly lashing the air behind her, \"Hmm, I wondered why she hated him so much, care to enlighten me upon the reason?\" \n\nDee's brother, whose name was still unknown to Petra, quirked his mouth and rubbed his forehead. \"It's a wonder she hadn't told you... considering you were going to kill him for her.\" \n\nPetra shrugged. \"I hadn't pried, though I did ask. That answer I was given was 'reasons.'\" \n\nHe nodded slowly. \"That's fair. It can be a sensitive issue for her.\" \n\n\"But now that it's brought up, care to share?\" \n\nHe sighed, his gaze drifting downward. \"I guess that it isn't exactly a secret. You already know our mother was Neko...\" \n\n\"And an escapee from my tribe,\" Petra added. \n\n\"Escapee,\" he repeated. \"makes her sound like a criminal.\" \n\n\"Tyrants do that to the innocent,\" the Assassin retorted. \n\n\"Indeed. She was living in the city in secret with our father, and despite what my sister thinks, the two were in love. Madly, one could say. But due to the laws our current king imposed in regards to the Ra'zorlichs, he had to create false papers for her for registration. It worked for several years, but... a few months after I turned seven, one young brat named Cael Fretheim somehow laid his eyes upon her. He had a following of maids back then, who all waited on him hand and foot, and when he saw our mother... He decided he wanted her to be a 'maid' as well.\" \n\n\"He kidnapped her,\" Petra surmised, getting a nod in response. \n\n\"The Fretheim family is a line of nobles, with a lot of connections. When Mother never came home that night, Father went out looking. But with her history, and their relationship a secret, he couldn't openly hunt her.\" Dee's brother bit his lip while taking a deep breath to steady himself. \"Two weeks later, Father got a request from the elder Fretheim to register an apparent assassin for slavery after she tried to kill him in the night.\" \n\nHer claws poking out against the steel encasements around her hands, Petra growled, \"Your mother.\" \n\nStaring coldly at the table, the Captain muttered, \"She was tortured, bound, and broken. Father said she was still alive, her body mostly untouched, but if he looked in her eyes... all he saw was just...\" \n\n\"Nothing. A corpse that still drew breath.\" \n\n\"She may as well have been. Father knew of a brand she had on her shoulder... of the Ra'zorlich symbol and after he 'found' it, he acted under the authority of the king's decree, at the protest of a young Fretheim, to put her out of her misery...\" \n\nPetra's eye twitched as he pursed his lips and let out his lungs. \n\n\"There was no way to free her without risking his life and yours and Dee's lives,\" she said in a low voice. \"He ended her suffering, done by Fretheim after he stole her from you.\" \n\nOnce again, he nodded. \"I knew that, but Dee was only three. She had cried for weeks before she stopped. Then Fretheim started acting on the grudge he held for the killing of his potential slave. His men began poking around our home, watching it from the street, working to get father removed from his position as guard captain. Eventually Father got scared of us getting connected to our mother. Since she was executed for being a Ra'zorlich, we would've suffered a fate no different. Child half-bloods or not, we were just more Red Talons in the eyes of the King.\" \n\nA dark scowl drew down over the Assassin's eyes. \"This city is disgusting.\" \n\n\"Don't I know it,\" he agreed with a grumble. \n\n\"Doesn't explain why Dee hates your father, however, or why she takes a cock or three a night to get by.\" \n\nHis face soured at that comment, his lips pursed as he stared angrily at the table in front of him. \"Lies were told to keep her from seeking father out, and she's in her position by her own accord. Believe me when I say that was something I tried to change.\" \n\nIt was Petra's turn to scowl again, though she left the questions on her mind unasked. \n\n\"I have a feeling you do not plan to keep me shackled forever,\" she surmised instead. \"We both want Fretheim dead.\" \n\nHe shook his head and looked to her. \"There is a plan already, and I'll get you out when the time is right. But for now I have to put you in the stocks below. It won't be long, I assure you.\" \n\nGrumbling mentally at the thought of some cold, stone-floored cell, the Neko gritted her teeth and nodded. \n\n\"I understand, Captain...\" she hummed off the last syllable, eyeing him questioningly until his eyes widened in realization. \n\n\"I never did a proper introduction, did I?\" \n\nShe shook her head and he stood up and bowed at the waist, sweeping his right arm under him and bringing his fist to his heart. \"Fourth Knight-Captain Devon Sactau, at your service. If you would follow me, I'll show you to your temporary placement. I hope you don't mind the company.\" \n\n... \n\nThree floors below the interrogation rooms, standing before the steel bars of a prison cell, Petra idly stood as the escorting guards removed the casements from her hands. The men had to fumble with at least two keys trying to find the correct one for the cell door before they dealt with the lock that spent a few too many years without getting properly greased. \n\nIn all honesty, she could have easily killed them both even if her hands had still been bound. She may even have been able to escape. But Devon had requested her to accept this \"terrible inconvenience\" until the next night, a time that obviously held some significance as he had an anxious scent to him when he spoke of it. And the only explanation Petra got was that if he didn't release her by the morning following, she was on her own. \n\nA comforting thought, she commented mentally as the lock gave a solid clank. \n\n\"Got it,\" a guard murmured as he pulled the iron-bar door open. \n\nMoving with the arm pushing on her back, the Neko stepped into her new \"quarters\" and stared into the shadows cast from the single torch outside her cell. \n\n\"Get comfy, could be up to a week before we get around to lobbing off your head.\" \n\nWith narrowed eyes she glared over her shoulder at the guard who'd made the comment as he and his partner closed the cell and turned for the exit door out of the larger room on the outside of the bars. After the solid thud and clack of the lock to her only way out closing and locking, she listened as the guards turned right in the hallway outside toward the stairwell, and recounted their paces by habit. ",
        "From her expectations of how the \"civilized lands\" were supposed to be, this level of the prison, which consisted of a main hallway with fifteen doors on either side and one barred door on the end, was a let-down. Her room, which she suspected to be like all the others, had two rusting and unkempt cells on opposite sides of each other with a decrepit table in between and a torch on the wall beside the door. Too few guards, too little intimidation factors, and poor handling of prisoners. She could have killed the guards that were supposed to escort her many times over from all the little slip ups they had made hauling her down here. \n\nPathetic. \n\n\"'Lobbing' off your head? Just what the Hell did you do to earn that? Kick his ass at fucking soccer or did you fuck up his face so bad that he can't say 'lop?'\" a gruff voice asked in an almost amused tone \n\nThe Assassin clenched her fists and readied her claws as she looked back to the shadowed corner of the cell. She could make out the silhouette of a person, human by the scent, male by the voice, sitting in the corner with his head resting against the wall as if to sleep. No details could be made out until her eyes adjusted, but something had already struck her as odd. \n\nShe had her claws emerging from her fingers and she braced her legs to pounce. \n\n\"Neither,\" she replied, still trying to make sense of his apparent joke, \"my crime was being born Ra'zorlich.\" \n\n\"Wha-\" the man wondered as his head suddenly pulled away from the wall. \"A woman...? Wait, what the fuck kinda creature are you?\" \n\nPetra frowned as he fumbled around and brought himself up onto his feet. The way his body shifted, how his silhouette moved in the torch light, he was not like other humans around her. There was mass to his muscles, but precision to his movements. This put her on the defensive instantly. Powerful or not, one false step and she'll be using his corpse as a pillow. \n\n\"Well? It looks like we're stuck in this shithole together, may as well get familiar. I want to start with what the Hell you are.\" \n\n\"I'm a Neko. Haven't seen my kind before?\" \n\nHe shook his head, and leaned back against the wall, wincing as his right shoulder made contact with the stone. \"No. Lions, tigers, cats, yes. But no felines prowling on two feet where I come from.\" \n\nHer claws slowly retracting, Petra moved to the wall to her left and took a seat on the floor against it. \"And where do you come from?\" \n\n\"Iowa,\" he answered. \"The Hawkeye State of America, as if anyone here would know where that is... Where you come from, Kitten?\" \n\nAmerica? Petra wondered, thinking back to Galen's words the day they met the Drow. \n\nI'm an American demon, he had said. \n\nAmericans hail from America? \n\n\"Atzla forest, east of this city,\" she answered. \"What crime brought you down here?\" \n\nShe heard the distinct huff of a stifled chuckle. \"Smashing a grunt's nose, knocking out a voodoo fucker that cast a hurt spell on me, brawling with more guards when they brought me down here... knocking out at least two of them...\" \n\nIt was Petra's turn to chuckle. \"A fighter. I like you already. What is your name?\" \n\n\"Staff Sergeant Flaxen, but call me Flak.\" \n\n\"Petra Dihyor. First Claw of the Ra'zorlich Shadow Stalkers.\" \n\n\"First Claw? Sounds important.\" \n\n\"As does Staff Sergeant. Is it a higher rank than 'Private?'\" \n\nFlak's posture stiffened up; he pushed off the wall and squared up his shoulders as he fully faced the Neko. She couldn't make out his face in the dark, but she could guess there was a frown on it or at least a look of confusion. \n\n\"Where do you know that rank from?\" \n\nA grin curled up on Petra's lips. \n\n\"You are not the first American to come to Atzla. You are one of the few still alive, but not the first. The one I know bears the rank of Private, and I was curious if that rank was of any significance.\" \n\nHis chin lifted, he possibly smiled. \"Private is more than a few ranks below me, it's just one step up from recruit. The Private you know got a name?\" \n\n\"Galen.\" \n\nHis mouth opened, then closed, then he nodded with what sounded to be a relieved sigh. \"Galen Martin, I know the name.\" \n\nIt was Petra's turn to be surprised. \"You do?\" \n\nHe nodded. \"He was on the roster for the plane that went MIA. A plane I was supposed to find before I wound up here. You know where he is or how to find him?\" \n\nAt that point Petra shrugged, locking eyes with her potential ally. \"I have an idea.\" \n\n............... \n\nTwilight fell before the night and surrendered the last of its day's-end glow to the encroaching tide of stars. The cool breeze, the fresh air, the cricket singing someplace on the cliffs above, it was all a welcome change of atmosphere for the young Private sitting in the driver's seat of a prison box-wagon. His darkvision was active as they kept drifting up toward the infinite expanse of starry sky above. An unconscious smile pulled on the corners of his mouth as he admired what he saw. \n\nEven if he was in the Sundered Trench with Redding not too far down the road, he was on the surface again. He was out from the stone-entombed world below in the fresh air and open sky. And once he fulfilled his promise to the Sun-Kissed, he would be free. Free to find Celia. Free to restart his journey in finding some way back home. Free to hunt Pretayus and Fretheim down and put them both in the ground. With that last thought, his fingers tensed and his body grew slightly more aware of the pistol on his hip. \n\nThe two horses pulling his wagon, acquired from slain knights of Redding's forces, followed the road of the bottom of the Trench without any input from their driver. With only a small lantern just bright enough to light the road ahead to guide them, their familiarity did well to ease the tense edge on the Private's nerves that he hid within. They made it appear as though this were a normal route for him, like he belonged here. Attention avoided meant he could get his prison wagon to his destination without interference. \n\nHe hoped nobody in the city could sense the level of magic wielded by two Commandants riding in the back. \n\nIf there are two Commandants brought in, the eagerness of their King would have us all brought to him straight off, Jrastra had reasoned back at the planning table. \n\nAnd we could both keep track of the situation from the tip of the spear, Dreek had agreed. \n\nHere's to hoping to God and Necela that this plan works, Galen thought as his cart was pulled onward to another turn in the jagged, zig-zag pattern of this split in planet the humans here called home. \n\n\"Relax,\" Jrastra ordered from the back, her Empathy drawing a sense of relief over the Private like a warm blanket. \n\nHis eyes moved towards the back of the wagon for a moment, then returned to the front as he cycled his lungs, breathing out slowly as he rolled his fingers over the reins of his horses. A new city ahead, matching the description of something he would find in a history textbook if he looked up the days following the medieval age. Knights on horseback, foot soldiers wearing chainmail and carrying swords or longbows. Streets paved with stone and long rows of densely packed buildings filled with his \"kind.\" \n\nBack among humanity again... he thought, leaning back into his seat and adjusting the helmet on his head. Here comes the next step in this great adventure. The next step to get her back. \n\nThe horses followed the road straight again and Galen kept scanning the area ahead to the furthest distance he could see. After a few minutes, the glow of life appeared as the edge of his dark-sight. Then came the stone base of a building, then a massive door at least twenty feet wide and forty high in the side of it. His horses drew him closer, and more of the building came into view until he realized where he was. \n\n\"Redding. The main gate,\" he said aloud, staring up at the wall taller than the reach of his altered dark-vision. \n\nHe looked back to the group of well-armored men stepping forward from their posts in front of the gate. Four moved to his right, three to his left, while three more approached him directly with lanterns in hand. Breathing slowly and calmly, he pulled back on the reins of his horses to slow them to a near snail's pace. \n\n\"Show time,\" he muttered breathlessly. \n\nThe wagon shifted then, a slight rock that was almost too subtle to notice if one of the wheels didn't start creaking while one of the horses grunted as though taking on a new burden. Galen's eyes narrowed as he reached out with his senses. A third hum of life rode along just below him, clinging to the bottom of his wagon. \n\n\"We got a guest...\" he cursed in a harsh whisper as the gap between him and the Redding guards closed. \n\n\"I feel him,\" Jrastra hissed back. \"Redding rats are too close. I'll keep their focus off of him, but he dies inside the wall.\" \n\nFuck! If he gets caught we are screwed! the Private cursed mentally. \n\nAs his wagon rolled up on the trio of knights that came forward to meet him, Galen pulled on the reins and gave a firm \"Whoa\" to bring them to a stop. His darkvision gave way to his natural eyes in the lantern light and the red and yellow bars painted down the center of their chest pieces came into view. Gritting his teeth, Galen adjusted himself in his seat and looked out into the darkness on his left and right toward the life signs that he felt. \n\n\"Kind of late to be approaching the city gates, stranger,\" announced one guard as he walked up alongside Galen's horses, eyeing the beasts up and down. \n\n\"Not for what I carry,\" Galen replied, his voice low and growling. \n\nHe knew no man in this place saw any Wild West film and doubted any would catch him emulating the mean cowboy act. He hunched his shoulders with the best look of \"pissed-off\" he could manage. A corner of his mouth drew up in a snarl while he pushed out a lower lip to emulate it holding a wad of chewing tobacco; his brow wrinkling as though smeared with a permanent frown. He glared at the guardsman and inwardly smiled when the men hesitated in his step toward him. \n\n\"Oh yeah?\" he swallowed. \"What kind of load do you carry that warrants coming up on the city in the early eve?\" \n\nShifting in his seat, Galen leaned back and glared at the archers positioned on balconies above the gate. \"I heard about a rich bounty on some Drow, the ones that wear yellow armor. I came to collect on it.\" \n\n\"You don't have Sun-kissed in the back of your wagon,\" the guard stated, immediately moving that way. \n\n\"Get too close and the spell won't protect you,\" Galen warned, glancing at the bewildered looks of the other two men in front of his horses. \n\nThe crunching of gravel underfoot continued and the Private tipped his head down and shook it slowly. Through his senses he knew the man was coming to the door at the back of the wagon, that the two groups which had circled around his flanks were now positioned to the left and right of his transport. And whoever was holding on to the bottom of his cart was holding their breath. \n\nWhen that knight stepped up to the small window in the iron-backed door of the cart to look inside, the last words he spoke were, \"Galaeus' holy wrath he does.\" \n\nHis screams shattered the peace of the night. He hit the ground flailing while the others went into panic, but Galen relaxed in his seat. He shut his eyes and breathed as he waited until those screams turned to gurgles, then to silence. In moments the life that he could feel at the back of the cart finally went dark. \n\nThere were whispers all around and in response the Private audibly sighed. \n\n\"I warned him,\" he declared. \"I want inside the city, and I want my bounty. I got two Commandants in back and unless you want me to 'accidently' drop the keys to their shackles into the wagon there, I want my money.\" \n\nBoots shifted as the knights surrounding the cart took steps in retreat. Another guard approached Galen, giving the wagon a wide berth as he moved to the Private's side. \n\n\"You said two Commandants?\" he asked, and Galen nodded. \n\n\"What I heard when my men and I killed off their squads.\" Galen shrugged. \"Word is they were more valuable, so if one wasn't nice enough, I got two. Now where do I get paid?\" \n\nThe guard's jaw sagged as he struggled to get himself together. Turning toward the city gate he nodded, his feet barely able to keep him upright as he stumbled along. One of the other men had to approach him and take his arm over his shoulder in order to keep him from falling flat or fainting outright. \n\nAt the gate the guard being carried gave the steel portal two quick raps and, following a short pause, a final heavy smack. Chains rattled, gears started clicking, and with surprisingly few squeaks, the double-door entrance into the city swung open. Every guard then moved aside to allow Galen though, enabling him to breathe easy before he clicked his mouth to get his two horses moving forward. \n\nFirst objective accomplished, he thought, riding past the mighty gate into the heart of the wall. \n\nTwo men in plate armor immediately approached Galen's wagon, but were intercepted by the light-headed guard that had ordered the gate open. Whispers were passed between the three, and following a look of shock and awe, the two knights hesitantly nodded and approached Galen while the gate guard headed back to his post. \n\n\"We're to escort you to the castle,\" one of the men stated. \"With what you got back there, the King is going to want to see to this personally.\" \n\n\"He better give me the damn reward himself, too,\" Galen growled. \"Let's go. Mind your spacing with the cart.\" \n\nHe snapped the reins to his horses and the two animals started moving forward. His escorts took immediate positions on his flanks, though still holding a distance between themselves and the wagon as ordered. Their distance, along with their reluctance to even glance in the direction of the wagon, was yet another calming factor for the Private as they moved forward onto what he guessed to be Redding's main street. \n\nEither side of the road was lined with locked up shops and closed down stalls. On the rooftops one could spot the silhouettes of several bowmen standing at the ready with their weapons out, though with their arrows still sitting in the quiver. Cavalry patrols could be heard roaming the adjacent streets, and there were stationary guard posts evenly spaced out across the city blocks. So many eyes were watching, and there was still that somebody riding along the belly of Galen's wagon. \n\nA lot of people are going to die if he gets caught... the soldier griped to himself. Where is Dreek's contact? \n\nHe had to meet up with the Commandant's surface friends eventually. If he kept to the path he was made to memorize from the map, he would encounter them at some point. Hopefully... \n\nThe entourage continued along the lamp-lit street for a good five or six minutes before it came to what Galen figured to be a main square. A trio of knights on horseback held position in the middle of the area, their lanterns casting a flicking light on the bronze statue standing atop the three-tiered, marble fountain behind them. As soon as the noise of the Private's cart caught their ears, they had eyes on him and their voices dropped to low whispers. Adding to the armed presence were the pairs of guards stationed every thirty feet around the edge of the square in between the merchant stalls and shops. \n\nThat's a lot of troops. \n\nAs he pulled the reins to one side to guide his prison wagon to the left around the fountain, the three men on horseback stiffened up and adjusted their seating. The middle knight of the trio, a man in full plate armor glittering with silver trim trotted forward. Scowling Galen shifted in his place and glanced to his rifle across the floor boards of the driver's seat. \n\nOne in the chamber atop a mag full of rock and roll. This goes south, we'll be fine. \n\nOne of the horsemen moved his mount in Galen's way while the other took up a position on his left. That knight with the silver trim then casually traipsed his horse up along on Galen's right. Both of the men escorting the cart noticeably relaxed in the presence of the riders, giving not-so-subtle nods of comradery to them as they drew close. Grumbling, the Private stopped his wagon and waited as the leader rode up alongside him, inspecting his cargo and approaching the front of the wagon. \n\n\"A little late for a prisoner delivery,\" he commented, stopping his horse beside the driver's seat. \n\nThe Private eyed the man in the full steel helm sitting less than three feet away, doing his best to mask his nervousness with feigned fatigue and attitude problems as he snarked, \"Not with my prisoners. Mine don't wait.\" \n\n\"He's a bounty hunter, Captain,\" chirped one of the escorts. \"He has a pair of Sun-kissed Commandant's locked up in the back. We're to take him right to the castle.\" \n\n\"Sun-kissed?\" the Captain echoed, his head turning to the back of the wagon. \"As in Drow? The ash-skinned Elves with the pointy-tipped ears?\" \n\nBoth Galen's eyes narrowed. \"Commandants. With the pointiest ears of any.\" \n\nHe could almost feel the weight of the Captain's gaze as it fell on him once more. \"And you came to cash them in for some shiny coin?\" \n\n\"From the king himself, I hope. Considering the amount on the bounty and how much I lost catching these two.\" \n\n\"Fair enough,\" the Captain replied before he looked to the two escorts. \"Both of you return to your posts. I'll personally lead our guest and the captives to the castle.\" \n\nA look of surprise came over the two men, though Galen kept quiet. \n\n\"Sir?\" they questioned. \n\n\"Go,\" the Officer ordered more firmly. \n\n\"Yessir,\" came the unified reply. \n\nThe two men turned, and though one of them chanced a quick look back, started back toward the direction they had come. Both the horsemen then moved away from the wagon into defensive positions to his left and rear while the Captain motioned his head forward. The Private gave an affirmative nod and snapped his reins to motivate the two horses in front of him to start moving. \n\nUnder the moonless sky with only the streetlights to guide them, the four rode out of the square and back into the streets. A few minutes had passed in the silence, with only the clops of hooves against stone and the squeak of the wagon wheels to fill the void. Jrastra's influence had to press in on Galen's nerves to calm them as the Captain refused to say a word. \n\nLong after they had seen any sign of the heavy presence of the city guards, the Private took a deep breath and finally asked, \"We have friends among us?\" \n\nRight then there was a crash of steel against stone, and he snapped his head right to see one of the Captain's riders had fallen from his saddle. The knight was writhing on the ground and clawing at his helmet in desperation though he made no alarming noise. There was a squeal, his legs kicked, but with one last gurgle, he went limp. \n\n\"Now we're all friends here,\" the Captain announced, bringing a jumpy Galen's attention back to him. \n\n\"It's been a while, Captain Devon,\" Dreek announced from the cart. \"You ,too, Aius.\" \n\n\"My lady,\" replied the knight riding behind the wagon. \n\nGalen blinked, his eyes wide. He glanced at the back of his wagon, then at the Officer on his right. The steel helm looked back at him, an unseen gaze meeting his and bringing an odd sense of ease to him. Then the man nodded. \n\n\"You must be Dreek's newest agent. Pleased to meet you.\" \n\n\"Likewise,\" Galen replied, reaching for his rifle lying across the floorboards behind his feet. \n\nThe Private brought the rifle up and clicked the safety to the off position. His voice low, he leaned in toward the knight captain, who took the cue and leaned in as well. ",
        "\"Before we get into some pleasantries, though, I gotta handle an unwelcome someone who'd climbed onto my undercarriage on the way here,\" the Private warned, standing up and shuffling to the edge of the wagon. \n\nHe sucked in a breath, letting out it slowly as he closed his eyes and firmed his grip on his weapon. Gritting his teeth he leapt, landing on his feet and rolling forward with his rifle tucked close. Steel clattered against stone as he reached the end of his roll, and just as he spun to face his wagon, the stowaway was upon him in a fury of fur and claws. \n\nGoing on instinct, Galen struck out with the end of his rifle, the butt plate slamming into a forehead as claws raked both his cheeks. The Neko collapsed onto Galen's legs in a daze as the Private himself cursed and scrambled away. When he was out from under the armored feline, he pulled his left hand away from his rifle and touched his cheek to check for blood. \n\n\"What is that creature?\" Jrastra questioned from the wagon, Galen's ears tuning into the frustration in her tone. \n\n\"Goltrai vorkrim col,\" grumbled the Neko, its voice drawing the Private's attention back to him. \n\nA bloodied face glared at him with bright orange eyes glowing from the light of the street lamps, and in and instant Galen brought his rifle to the ready with his finger closing in around the trigger ready to fire. Those bright orange eyes blinked. The Private did the same as both parties paused as they recognized one another. Wary of the end of the weapon sitting a few hand-widths from his face, the Neko slowly raised his hands and pulled his hood back, revealing his golden hair and matching fur.  \n\n\"You,\" Galen muttered, holding his aim on one of the first faces to greet him to this world back in Atzla. \"You're that Ra'zorlich... that officer from my first day in Atzla. What were you doing on my cart? Your people don't leave your lands!\" \n\n\"The last encounter we had, Galen,\" Farok started while cautiously pushing himself off the ground and slowly standing, \"I was still a Hunt-Commander, both my Shadow Stalkers were alive in the barracks, and your friend was still bleeding out from a wound in his leg.\" \n\nA killing glare creased the Private's face and his finger tensed on the trigger. \"How do you know my name?\" \n\nThe Neko touched a hand to his forehead and growled as he found a crimson coating on his palm. \"Because that friend of yours told me back in the Willher village.\" \n\n\"Michael?\" Galen questioned, his shoulders dropping and his back stiffening. \"Why would he...? You better not have touched him, or Mila!\" \n\n\"Calm, Galen. I have not harmed any of your friends. Michael, in fact, had given me a message for you when I found you. That he was... Ten four, and into a fold.\" \n\nThe Private blinked, taking a step back and lowering his weapon. \"Ten-four, huh? Alright... Alright, I'll buy that. That's actually pretty good to hear. But why did you come here? Why were you looking for me? \n\n\"Because you have something dear to me. Or rather, someone,\" the Neko stated, fighting off his own urge to growl. \n\nCaptain Devon and knight Aius were both dismounted and positioning themselves behind Farok with swords drawn. Two pairs of red eyes were also watching from the slot window at the back of the prison wagon. A sudden wave of crippling energy pulsed, nearly causing the three humans present to blackout. Farok wavered in his stance, but quickly recovered and planted a hand on his sword. \n\nWhat the Private thought to be a fatal trick of empathy was blown off by the Neko. \n\n\"Stop that,\" the former Ra'zorlich growled, one eye twitching as he glared at the wagon behind him. \n\nGalen glanced in the direction of Jrastra's scowling eyes, and when he felt her gaze shift to him, he gave a subtle shake of his head. The Commandant's influence withdrew moments later though it did not cease. Sensing this Farok brought his attention back to the soldier before him, who in turn lowered his thunderstick. \n\n\"We can talk on the way,\" Galen said, moving toward the cart. \"But we gotta be quick, as we ain't got much time. I want to know why would Michael trust you in the first place, and why were you on my cart?\" \n\nFarok frowned, \"To your first question, I provided aid to Michael and his new clan when my tribe attacked. Answering your second question, I needed into the city. The day was too risky and that your cart was the one I managed to board this night was either luck or fate.\" \n\n\"Why did you need in the city?\" Galen asked. \n\n\"To find you,\" was the Neko's immediate reply. \"More specifically, my assassin that you took into your service. Petra. What have you made of her?\" \n\n\"Made of her?\" Galen retorted. \"A... friend I guess... she's here in the city, to find a slaver that kidnapped someone else that was with us.\" \n\n\"Your Elf,\" the ex-Huntmaster surmised. \n\nGalen's brow rose over wide eyes, \"How do you-\" \n\n\"I learned of her when I was told what state you left with Petra. As I said, I helped fight off an attack my former tribe attempted on the Willhers, and both them and Michael were very forthcoming with information afterward. I harbor no ill-will toward you Galen, I wish only to seek out Petra, to know she is well.\" \n\n\"If Petra is one you to seek,\" Captain Devon interrupted, sheathing his sword, \"I know exactly where she is.\" \n\n....... \n\nNearly four stories separated the guard from the ground when he peered over the edge of the castle's outer wall. If he fell, there would only be the square slabs of the stone street to cushion his fall. And one sloppy mess to mop up. Breathing deeply he stepped back from the battlement to his post overlooking the gate. Gazing over the edge was only an invitation to fall. \n\nOf course I get the Deadman shift, he thought, glancing toward the moonless sky before scowling at the dim lantern lights scattered about the city streets. Can't see shit out here. \n\nShifting his gaze he scanned over the rooftops of the city. In his periphery he could spot faint silhouettes of the nighttime archers at their posts, watching over the city for any suspicious activity. Just as they had for the past... ever since the war with the Drow was declared. \n\nHow the city had changed since those days before the fighting. The streets were always moving, then. Even at night. Guards were a shadow in the wall, silently watching rather than making their presence clear whenever they saw the opportunity. The streets also weren't so crowded then. The city hadn't been cut-off for weeks at a time without a single inbound trade caravan. Nobody had to rush to the market everyday just to try and get their hands on what goods did manage to make it in. \n\nBut thank the war for the choke up in trade. Thank the king for what the people of Redding received from the attempts to raid the underground. Hundreds of men gone in a single week. Paranoid rumors of spotting Drow moving at night within the walls. The endless presence of men like himself prowling the streets, watching for trouble or hints of sabotage. The crackdown on anyone who wasn't human. The \"Knife-ear decree:\" that single royal order to oust or slay all Elves in the city. \n\nShifting his feet the castle guard breathed out and rolled his shoulders to loosen up his back muscles. These dark days had to end sometime. \n\n\"Open that gate!\" \n\nWhat? \n\nHe hadn't taken two steps before the wall started rumbling below him. Mechanisms groaned, steel clanged and rattled, men heaved, and at the end of it all, the iron grate began to rise. Peering over the side of the wall the guard caught the sight of a metal prison wagon approaching the castle gate on the main street. From the street lights he could make out two men driving the wagon in, with two cavalrymen flanking them on either side. Just as a final clack sounded to signal the locking mechanism had engaged to hold the gate open, the double doors swung outward under the power of five men per door. \n\nWhen the envoy was inside the walls, the door was shut again and the grate's lock released to slam the defense shut in two heartbeats. At once the guard moved to the other side of the battlement to see the wagon and its two escorts turn onto the ring road that encircled the brightly lit courtyard. At the castle's front door, five of the Orrorein, the King's personal guard, stepped forward. Blood red, plate armor gleamed on their bodies with a fearsome shine as the wagon stopped at the steps leading up to them. \n\nThe two horsemen dismounted, as did the wagon drivers. Even from a distance the man on the wall could identify the silver trim and purple kilt of Captain Devon as he went forth to speak with the men of the Orrorein. After only a short conversation, one man got sent back into the castle while the other four came to arms around the wagon under the Captain's direction. The driver went to the back of his cart with the guards at his back, pulling a blue light from his pocket while his partner opened the doors. A hooded figure stepped out, one shorter than any man there, followed by a second person of identical stature. \n\nDevon stepped forward and pulled the hood down from one of the prisoners, revealing a long flow of distinctly white hair with a pair of long, pointed, black ears sticking out the side. \n\n\"Goddess be damned...\" muttered the guard on the wall. \"It's finally happening.\" \n\n......... \n\nInhale, exhale. Inhale, exhale. Inhale, exhale. \n\nEvery breath was calm as sunrise over the pond as they cycled through Petra's feline nose. Given his current state of awareness, Flak was almost jealous. With one eyebrow arching down over his right eye while the left kept fully open, he watched the Neko nap in her corner of the cell with an almost religious focus. \n\nNo coherent thoughts ran his mind, no philosophical chain of questions and answers, he simply watched his cellmate sleep more soundly than anyone he'd seen sleep in months. What rest he was able to get himself only ever came in three to four hours stints, and as Petra had told him: he whimpered and tossed about like a kitten under a show of lightning. \n\nI'd snap someone's neck for a cigarette right now. \n\n\"Anyone come by?\" a drowsy voice asked. \n\nFlak blinked and lost his cockeyed stare for a more neutral expression as the Neko began to stir. \"Nothing. Not even meals or to change my bandage. And if I don't get food soon, I'll chew out these bars and go hunting.\" \n\n\"Appetizing,\" Petra said, stretching her arms across the floor and raising her rear in the air to arch her back down. \"How long do you figure we've been here?\" \n\nA narrowed gaze focused on the bipedal feline as she sat back on the pads of her feet, though after a shake of his head, the Staff Sergeant responded, \"A day at least. You wrote off at least seven hours in your nap there.\" \n\n\"Hmmm, again with this 'hour,' your way of keeping time makes no sense,\" Petra mumbled as she pulled one arm across her chest to stretch out her shoulder. \n\n\"Deal with it,\" Flak stated. \"I don't give a flying-\" \n\nHe went silent before Petra had the chance to shush him. Steel was tromping down against stone at the rhythm of a walking pace. In an instant Flak was on his feet and cracking his knuckles in anticipation. He stepped close to the bars of the cell and just stood silent as Petra positioned herself behind him. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked in a low voice. \n\n\"Getting out of here. Coming?\" \n\n\"What of Captain Devon?\" her voice in a whisper as the footsteps drew closer. \n\n\"Fuck him,\" Flak whispered back. \n\nThe door to the room opened, a lone guard coming through with a tray of bread, meat, and two canteens. Flak snapped his hand out to grab him by the chainmail on his chest. There was a short yelp before he was slammed face first into the bars of the cell, once, twice, then three times. The tray fell, landing with a relatively quiet clatter as it came down on the bread while the canteens gave a solid thunk when they hit the stone. \n\nHolding the unconscious troop upright, the Sergeant turned to Petra and said, \"Pockets.\" \n\nShe nodded and instantly set to patting down the pouches hanging off the guard's belt. A knife hit the floor beside Flak's feet, then a pair of silver coins, bandages, then a pipe. \n\n\"Found his keys,\" Petra announced. \n\n\"Oh, sweet Jesus,\" he said with relief. \n\n\"Sweet who?\" the Neko wondered, tuning to find her human cellmate scooping the pipe off the floor and whiffing its contents. She raised an incredulous eyebrow as he jabbed a finger down into the packed tobacco then took a deep inhale of whatever scent came out. She took note of his puzzled look as he then started to examine the pipe itself. \n\nFlak caught her glance and shrugged nonchalantly before refocussing on his treasure. \n\n\"Humans,\" she muttered as she went to get the lock on the door. \n\n\"Don't even start with me,\" he grumbled as the tumblers clanked and the door squealed open. He stormed past the feline and went right for the torch on the wall and held the pipe up to the flame just long enough for the contents to start burning. When he brought it to his mouth and sucked in, a sweet sigh of relief came out along with the lungful of smoke. \n\n\"That's good,\" he grinned before sucking in another breath and leaving the pipe in his mouth. \"Now let's roll.\" \n\nIgnoring Petra's puzzled look, he scooped a canteen off the floor with a piece of bread and stepped out into the hallway. Munching as he went, he took a quick look right, toward the stairwell past the ten other rooms housing more cells and possible prisoners. But after biting off another hunk from his snack, he turned left and started into a swift walk. \n\n\"Flak,\" Petra called out, trailing after him. \n\nHe swallowed what he had in his mouth then tossed the rest aside. After a quick swig from the canteen, he hooked it to his belt and burst into a full sprint toward a door at the end of the hall. Without slowing down he reared up and drove his boot into the door handle, smashing the door through its frame and around on its hinges to crash into the wall. Two men were inside the room, both of whom were scrambling to get themselves off the floor after they fell from their chairs. \n\nIn full charge Flak bolted to the first troop and came down with a heavy fist smashing across his jaw with enough force to slam his head into the floor. Petra leapt past them onto the second guard, slamming him into the ground and pressing her fingers onto the sides of his neck until his eyes fluttered shut. Both the men unconscious, the two stood and took in their surroundings. \n\nThe two unconscious bodies lay next to their upturned chairs, their playing cards still in their place on the table. Right next to two near-empty bottles of wine. Flak rolled his eyes and moved to inspect the footlockers lining the sides of the room. At the other end of the room Petra was inspecting a board that held a pair of iron-backed, double doors in place. Marks in the wood indicated its recent and frequent removal from its place as well as a sweaty stench drifting out from the seams of the portal. \n\n\"This is where you fuckers stashed it.\" \n\nThe Neko turned to see Flak pulling items from an open footlocker, namely a hand-boom weapon like to one Galen carried along with a pair of knives and other things. Leaving him to collect his equipment, she looked to the sign over the door before her and frowned as she made out what it said. \n\nThe Hole. \n\nNow curious, she lifted the board out of its place and threw it aside. Following the deep breath she took to ready her nose, she pushed the barricaded door open and let an overwhelming male musk flood out. \n\n\"Oh, Christ,\" Flak cursed, tossing his pipe aside and using his sleeve to cover his nose. \"Did you just crack open a stash of rotted gym socks?\" \n\nGagging, Petra covered her face with one hand and grabbed a torch off the wall beside the door. This new, dark room was only five paces deep, three wide. Its only furnishing being a wooden cross with a body lashed to it in a spread-eagle position. \n\nFlak stood up with a deep frown arching his brow. He walked up behind his feline partner and gently nudged her aside so he could inspect this new-found prisoner. \n\nHer skin was like tar with both its natural color and how tacky it had become with her sweat. Scabbed wounds over her nude body spoke to the Sergeant of abuse, with the dried fluids on her thighs screaming of something worse. He brushed her matted, snow-white hair aside and leaned in to hear weak breaths struggling to pass over cracked, dry lips. \n\n\"Petra, blanket,\" he ordered. \"Something to cover her with. I'll cut her down.\" \n\nThe Assassin was gone in a second as the Marine pulled his knife off his hip to slice the binds holding the prisoner's hands above her head. For a moment her eyes opened to watch as he brought his blade up to her wrists. A relieved look came to her as she struggled to find her strength for words. \n\n\"Finally... killing... me?\" \n\nCocking an eyebrow, Flak looked to her with questioning look before cutting the rope binding her right hand to the cross. Her whole right side slumped right over into the Sergeant's arms as though there were not a muscle on her bones. When he had a firm grip on her torso, he cut the rope holding her left side up and lifted her smoothly over his shoulder. Considering she was two heads shorter than him, Flak wasn't surprised how weightless she felt. Then again, he could also feel the definition of her ribs. \n\nSheathing his knife, he carried the alien woman out of her dark room and into the lit one he came from. As gently as he could, he slid her off his shoulder and laid her on the floor. In the torch light he could start to see purple discolorations in her ashen skin; the raw, purple-grey flesh around her wrists where the ropes had been rubbing for some time. \n\nFrowning, but genuinely curious, he brushed her greasy, shoulder-length hair aside and observed her elongated ears sticking out off the sides of her head. Then she opened light, maroon-colored eyes, her brow furrowing in the torch light. \n\n\"Never see... a Drow before... surface crawler?\" \n\nFlak shook his head a negative then turned his attention to her injuries. \"Nope, never... I'm not seeing any serious injuries aside from your wrists, how long have you been stung up in there?\" \n\nThe Drow frowned as the human stood and went to one of the bodies that she realized to be a dead, if not dying, prison guard. \"I don't know... the moon was only a dying sliver when I saw it last...\" \n\nA fearsome scowl was planted on her rescuer's face as his gaze turned from her wrists to her face. His teeth ground in his mouth as he then stood and stepped away from the \"Drow.\" Using what strength she could muster, she turned her head to see him tear a sleeve off one of the unconscious men on the floor and snatch up one of the wine bottles off the table. Dousing the cloth in wine he returned to her side and ripped the already-torn sleeve right up the middle. \n\n\"Mo-ther-fuck-ers,\" he growled under his breath as he wound the cloth around her wrists. \n\n\"I'm back,\" Petra declared as she entered the room, carrying the cloak that had been worn by the guard who had come to feed them. \"We have to hurry. One of them already came to check on his friend. I put him out before he could yell, but more are bound to come soon.\" \n\nFlak nodded and took the canteen off his hip to offer it to the Drow as he helped her sit her up. \"Get some water into you. Can you walk?\" \n\nWith shaky hands she took the container and struggled to life it to her mouth. After a good, long drink she nearly spilled the rest on her lap trying to set it down gently. Frowning at her weakened state, the Drow shook her head. \"I haven't stood on my own for days and everything hurts... I need time.\" "
