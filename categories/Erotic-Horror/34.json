I finished up the paperwork on the Tylenol Bottle case, then turned to the emails that had begun piling up in the last four hours. Paperwork never stops. \n\nAs I read through the emails, which were mostly copies cc'd to me, my assistant Helena buzzed me and said that Captain Cindy Ross wanted to see me. Captain Ross is one of the very few people in this world that could barge into my office without having to ask Helena, so for her to ask to come in suggested something important. I told Helena to let Cindy come in.\n\n\"Whassup?\" I said as Cindy came in, taking the chair I motioned her into.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"With Captain Briscoe now with the Campus Police, we have no Press Relations Officer. The Press is massing in the Press Room, demanding you come there and make a statement about the Independent State Counsel.\"\n\n\"Sheesh.\" I muttered. \"So I guess you're getting an early start on the Deputy Chief thing, huh?\"\n\n\"I am prepared to take a green crowbar to some Press backsides.\" Cindy replied. \"Good practice for the Police Boxing Matches.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\" I said. \"By the way, is the Chief here?\"\n\n\"No sir, he's still at City Hall, meeting with the Sheriff.\" Cindy said.\n\n\"Good.\" I said. \"Take some Uniformed Officers and go in and clear the Press room. Kick every one of their arses out. If any of them give you the slightest bit of shit, have that person arrested and taken through booking for trespassing.\" Cindy excused herself, then stalked out to carry out my instructions. I got the impression she was really looking forward to it.\n\nThree minutes later, she was back. This time she barged in, and had Captain Teresa Croyle with her. \"Sir!\" Cindy all but shouted, \"we just got an incoming call to 9-1-1. Missing child. Alton Taylor, 10 years old.\"\n\n\"Alton Taylor?\" I almost gasped. \"He's one of the kids I rescued at Ward Harvester, when Ned shot me.\" (Author's note: 'Sperm Wars: The Family Menace'.) Cindy nodded, and I said \"What happened?\"\n\n\"He was playing Little League baseball at the Ronald Reagan Park baseball complex.\" said Teresa, referring to the baseball and softball fields in a circular array on the northeast 'backside' part of Ronald Reagan Park. \"Someone hit a foul ball into a clump of woods, and he went to get it. He never came out of the woods, so everyone went looking for him. At first they thought he was playing a trick and hiding, and then they got worried he might be hurt and unconscious, so one of the coaches called the Police and his mother. We've got two units on the scene now.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"put out a tri-State alert for him, and call out the Auxiliary and Search & Rescue Volunteers. Bring the parents here, and ask Father Romano or one of the other Chaplains or the parents' minister to be here with them. I'll call the Chief. Cindy, did you kick the Press out?\"\n\n\"No sir, I was intercepted by the Duty Desk before I got there.\" Cindy replied.\n\n\"Good.\" I said. \"Let them stay in there. Don't say a word to 'em about any of this. Okay, y'all can go.\" They moved out with a purpose.\n\nI called the Chief, who said he'd tell the Sheriff and Fire Chief. Then I sat back and contemplated. Of all the things we had to deal with, a missing child was just about the worst, at least in my own mind...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAbout thirty minutes later, I got a call from Cindy on my Police iPhone.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"I think you need to come down here.\"\n\nOh no, I thought, they found the child's body. \"Did you find a body?\" I asked.\n\n\"No sir.\" said Cindy. \"Just a piece of paper with a drawing on it...\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThe sheet of paper was tacked to a tall tree, about eight feet off the ground. With my 6'4\" height, I was able to reach up and remove it, wearing latex gloves to damage as little of the evidence as possible. Officers crowded around to see what was on it.\n\nWords drawn in crude crayon said \"Don't look or it takes you\", an 'X' at the top right corner, and a stick drawing of a figure in black, with a white head with no facial features.\n\n\"Damn.\" I muttered, then said more loudly: \"It's one of the Slender Man Eight Pages...\"\n\nPart 2 - It Begins\n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, All the children try to run. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, To him it's part of the fun. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, Dressed in darkest suit and tie. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, You most certainly will die. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, His branching arms are for collecting. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, His face is empty of expressing. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, He won't let you say goodbye. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, You most certainly will die. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, Sometimes hums a lowly drone. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, He will wander 'round your home. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, Blends in well within the trees. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, In the fog he's hard to see. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, Dressed in darkest suit and tie. \n\nSlender Man, Slender Man, You most certainly will die.\n\n--- 'The Slender Man Song', attributed to Zip Zipper.\n\n8:00pm, Thursday, April 19th. The page, in a protective plastic sleeve, was hanging on the whiteboard in MCD, held up by a magnet, and we were staring at it.\n\n\"It has a peculiar smell, like a chemical smell.\" I said. \"But it appears to be plain crayon.\"\n\n\"There's a tiny '1' at the upper right hand corner, right next to the 'X'.\" said Joanne Warner, who'd been studying the page with a magnifying glass.\n\n\"Geez,\" said Captain Ross, \"I hope we're not going to have seven more kidnappings.\"\n\nThe search was ongoing, as volunteer crews combed through Ronald Reagan Park, along the River on both sides as well as downstream and upstream, and in the subdivisions to the north of the Park. Except for the piece of paper and the baseball he'd gone after, no trace of Alton Taylor had been found. His shocked parents were in the Pastor's Room with their minister.\n\n\"Has the Press put out an alert yet?\" I asked.\n\n\"They had coverage of the Taylor disappearance on their 6:00pm newscasts.\" Cindy said. \"They've got crews out following our Search & Rescue teams.\"\n\nI nodded. I had a bad feeling about this... and rightly so...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n9:15pm. Tommy Tomlin came into the den of his home on Cone Street, where his dad Bart Tomlin was watching a baseball game on TV.\n\n\"Dad,\" Tommy said, \"there's someone in the backyard.\"\n\n\"What?\" snarled Bart. He got up and looked out the sliding glass door that went to the back deck. Seeing nothing, he turned on the floodlight. The backyard was illuminated, but he still saw nothing.\n\n\"Boy, what have I told you about lying?\" Bart said sternly to Tommy as he turned out the light. Ever since the divorce and Tommy's mother moving out to live with another man, Tommy had told a lot of fibs.\n\n\"I'm not lying, Dad.\" Tommy said. \"I saw him, a man in a suit.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no one out there now.\" said Bart. \"And our yard is closed in by all the surrounding houses, so nobody's just walking through.\"\n\nTommy went to the glass door and flicked on the light. \"Dad! There he is!\"\n\nBart came up to the window and looked out. In the middle of the back yard was a tall man in the darkest of black suits, white shirt and black tie. The man's head was ghostly white and had no facial features, but seemed to be 'looking' right at the father and son.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" Bart said, pulling Tommy away from the sliding glass door. \"Stay away from that door!\" He ran to make sure the front door and door to the garage were locked, then came back to the sliding glass door. Looking out, he saw nothing.\n\n\"Dad! Are you going to call the Police?\" Tommy asked, his voice quavering.\n\n\"Not yet.\" said Bart. \"Come back to the bedrooms.\" Tommy followed his dad down the hall, and saw that his dad had grabbed his wallet and car keys and cell phone. \"If we see the guy again, we'll call the cops.\"\n\nThey made their way to the den again. Turning on the floodlight, they saw no one in the backyard. As they turned and came back into the room, they heard a creak in the kitchen and looked through the door. Standing in the kitchen was the Slender Man!\n\n\"Oh my God! Run!\" yelled Bart. He all but dragged Tommy to the front door, unlocked it, and flew out into the front yard. \"Get in the car!\" Bart yelled.\n\n\"But Dad!\" Tommy tried to call out as Bart violently pulled him along.\n\n\"Dammit, kid! Do what I tell you and get in the car!\" Bart yelled. He grabbed Tommy, all but shoved him into the front passenger seat, then raced around the car to the driver's side. Getting in, he locked the doors, inserted the keys, and turned on the motor, which lit the headlamps. \n\nThe headlights illuminated the man in the suit, who was standing right in front of the car!\n\n\"Aaauuugh!\" screamed Bart as he tried to engage the gears in Reverse. They would not move as the Slender Man seemed to glide around the front of the car and the passenger side to the door.\n\n\"Dad! Help! Auughhh!\" Tommy screamed out as the door opened and the man grabbed him. Bart grabbed for Tommy, but he was already whisked out, and the Slender Man was taking him around the corner of the house. Bart got out of the car to pursue, but when he got to the corner, there was no one there, no movement at all.\n\n\"Tommmyyyy!\" Bart yelled out, fear gripping his soul. \"Toommmmyyyyy!\" Dogs barked, lights came on in the adjacent houses. But there was no sign of Tommy at all...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAt 10:05pm, I came up to the house. Lightbars were flashing on the tops of Police cruisers, and I debated whether or not to order them turned off. I decided not to; people needed to know there was a crisis here.\n\n\"Whaddya got?\" I asked Detective Warner.\n\n\"Sir,\" Joanne said, \"we have a hysterical man who saying his son was kidnapped by a tall man in a suit and tie, and a head with no features on it. We also found this taped to the passenger-side car window.\n\nJoanne handed me the piece of paper in the plastic sleeve. It said \"HELP ME!\", written in crayon, and there was a tiny, barely visible number '2' in the top right hand corner.\n\n\"Shit.\" I muttered. \"Another Slender Man page.\"\n\n\"Sir, do you think this is a copycat of Larry Lance?\" Joanne asked, referring to the 'Slender Man' case of just over a year before.\n\n\"I don't know.\" I said. \"This one has a... different... feel about it. Let's go talk tooooo...\"\n\n\"Bart Tomlin, sir.\" said Joanne. \"His son's name is Tommy.\" I nodded and we walked up to the man sitting on the steps to the front porch, with three Uniformed Officers attending him.\n\n\"Mr. Tomlin,\" I said, \"I'm Commander Don Troy. What happened, sir?\"\n\n\"That... that man...\" said Tomlin, his face a mixture of shock, horror, maybe madness. His eyes were introspective and unfocused, and gave the the impression that he was a drug addict. \"He was in my house!\" The man started shaking. \"He was right in front of the car! I locked the doors, but he still opened it... he was just right there!...\"\n\n\"What did he look like, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Tall... that face...\" gasped Tomlin, who then snapped: \"That face! THERE WAS NO FACE!! He had no face!... Aaahhhh!!\"\n\nAn ambulance had arrived. \"Get him to the Hospital.\" I ordered. \"Mr. Tomlin! Go with these men.\" I really didn't need to ay anything; Tomlin was becoming catatonic. Medics helped him to the ambulance, put him inside, and the vehicle drove away.\n\n\"He just got worse and worse.\" said Sergeant Rudistan. \"When we first got here, he was upset, but pretty coherent.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" I asked.\n\n\"He said his son saw a man in a suit in the backyard.\" said Rudistan. \"He didn't believe the kid, then they both saw the man. He said the doors were all locked, but the man just... appeared in the kitchen, and Tomlin and his son ran out the front door to the car. When he turned on the headlights of the car, the man was right there in front of the car. Then he just came over, opened the supposedly locked car door, grabbed the kid and took him around the corner of the house.\"\n\n\"Any footprints?\" I asked.\n\n\"No sir,\" said Rudistan, \"and the soil is pretty soft around that side of the house. We're also looking for any footprints in the backyard, but 'no joy' on that, so far.\"\n\n\"What about inside?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing strange at all, sir.\" said Rudistan. \"No door locks were forced. Door to the garage and the sliding glass door to the back deck were locked. The boy's room is pretty messy, but looks more like a normal boy's room than having been ransacked.\"\n\n\"Not that one can really tell the difference, if my own sons' rooms are any indication.\" I said. \"Okay, good work. Rudistan, stay in charge of the scene until the CSIs are completely done, then post a couple of guards. Keep the Press off the property.\" \n\n\"Yes sir.\" said Rudistan. I turned and went back to Joanne Warner, who was near the end of the driveway. \n\n\"Have you heard from Captain Ross?\" I asked.\n\n\"Last I heard, sir,\" said Joanne, \"she was checking in with the searchers at Ronald Reagan Park.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I said. \"You stay here for now. You're in charge of the investigation. After the forensic work is done, you can go to the Hospital and see if Mr. Tomlin recovers sufficiently to give a coherent statement.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" said Joanne. I went to my Police SUV, and once inside the comfortable confines of it, I called Cindy on my Police iPhone. She answered, and said she was at Ronald Reagan Park. I asked if anything had been found.\n\n\"Not a thing, sir.\" said Ross. \"Myron sent up two infrared drones and searched the whole Park. No body heat signatures that were not Police or search volunteers. How long do you want to continue the search?\"\n\nI thought about that, and came to a conclusion: \"Call it off at midnight. Once everyone is clear of the Park, have Myron run another IR drone sweep.\"\n\n\"Wilco... oh, wait... what's that?\" Cindy had said that last bit to someone coming up to her. I heard muffled, indistinguishable voices, then Cindy got back on the line.\n\n\"Commander, they found something on the disc golf course. A bag full of discs. I'm going to go check it out.\" I told her to call be back if it was important, and we disconnected.\n\nI might as well go down there, I thought to myself. I cranked the SUV and headed out.\n\nPart 3 - A Glowing Discovery\n\n\"Whaddya got?\" I asked as I came up to the Disc Golf basket. It was the 11th hole basket, which ran through the woods on the hill in the middle of the Park, between the open spaces to the south and north.\n\n\"This, sir.\" said Sr. Patrolman Hicks. J.R. Barnes was finishing his forensic examination of a bag of disc golf discs. Attached to the bag were straps allowing a person to carry the bag like a backpack. In the pouch that was normally for a water bottle was what looked like a flashlight.\n\n\"Who found this, and when?\" I asked.\n\nCindy Ross said \"The bag was sitting on top of the basket, sir. Several search volunteers have admitted they saw it, but thought a disc golfer left it there and was helping with the search. About twenty minutes ago, old Mrs. Boddiker came up to Patrolman Hicks and pointed out the bag to him. When he checked it out, he found this taped to the chain below the basket.\" \n\nShe handed me a sheet of paper enclosed in a plastic sleeve. Drawn on the paper in crayon were a number of pine trees. In the middle of them was a drawing of the Slender Man, darkest suit and tie, faceless head. At the top left hand corner was a crudely drawn circle with an 'X' through it, the iconic sign of the Slender Man. Barely visible at the top right was a small '8'.\n\n\"Skipped to '8', eh?\" I said to Cindy. I then examined the bag. \"Hmmm, these are all glow discs, made to glow in the dark. Someone was playing night disc golf, or intended to.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said J.R. Barnes, \"there were no prints on any of the discs, the flashlight, or the drawing.\"\n\n\"Really?\" I said, surprised. \"That, Captain Ross, is a 'strangeness'. Let's you and me take this to Headquarters as evidence, if J.R. is finished with it.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" said Barnes. \"Just sign for it, please.\" I did so and Cindy rode in my Police SUV with me, after trusting the keys to her Police SUV to Detective Theo Washington...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Think these are a clue?\" Cindy asked as she examined the discs, wearing latex gloves as she handled them.\n\n\"I get the sense that they are.\" I said. \"The drawing certainly is. Maybe it was left separately, but that'd be a lot of coincidence for me to swallow.\" Cindy smiled at that.\n\n\"So Alvin Taylor is missing,\" she said, \"and Tommy Tomlin was plain kidnapped. Is Myron working up some data for us?\"\n\n\"You know it.\" I said. \"And I told him to concentrate on the Tomlin family first... I'm not totally sold on the man's story.\"\n\n\"Think he made it up?\" Cindy asked. \"Joanne said he looked really freaked out.\"\n\n\"He looked drugged up, too, when I saw him.\" I said. \"It occurred to me that he could've taken something... or been given something... that progressively acted upon him as time went on. Bloodwork at the Hospital will show if that's the case, or not.\"\n\nCindy nodded, then said \"I hope that this being No. 8 means that there will be no more kidnappings, or that any other drawings will come with disc golf bags and not missing children.\"\n\n\"Yeah, me too.\" I said, but not convinced that would be the case. We pulled into the parking lot of Police Headquarters. When we went inside, Chief Moynahan met us in the hallway.\n\n\"I hope the Press did not catch you guys playing disc golf during this time of crisis.\" the Chief said jokingly.\n\n\"No sir,\" I said, \"but if they had seen me carrying this bag, they really would try to say I'm playing disc golf and not paying attention to the case.\"\n\nHave I mentioned that I have a total lack of trust in the Press?\n\nI took the bag of discs to my office to examine them, and the Chief came in with me. Cindy took the drawing to the whiteboards in MCD as I examined the discs closely. They were all brand new, unused as far as I could tell, and a pretty standard set of disc golf discs made of plastic that glowed in the dark. \n\nAs Cindy returned to the office, I put the bag in the safe in my office, and the Chief and I signed the custody form. He then went to his office as I said to Cindy \"Let's go see Myron.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nClassroom 'F' had been converted into walled cubicle spaces with doors, with one of those cubicles being a server farm. Cindy and I knocked on Myron's cubicle door and heard a \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Got anything for us, Myron?\" I called out.\n\n\"I'll come to your office in five minutes, sir.\" said Myron.\n\nTrue to his word, I'd barely started a fresh pot of coffee in my office when Myron knocked on the door and came on in. I had him sit down in a hot chair, with Cindy sitting next to him.\n\n\"Bart Tomlin, 36 years old; one son, Tommy, aged 10.\" said Myron. \"Bart's wife left him a year and a half ago, went to live with another man, did not try to get custody of Tommy. I got some school records, and Tommy's grades dropped off after his mother left him.\"",
        "\"Bart is a factory worker at BigPharmaCorp.\" continued Myron. \"No issues with them that I could find, and he was on their Safety Advisory Board until last year. No criminal record, other than a couple of speeding tickets.\"\n\n\"Financial issues?\" I asked.\n\n\"None, really.\" said Myron. \"Makes pretty good money at BigPharmaCorp, spending habits reasonable, pays off his credit card every month.\"\n\n\"Social issues?\" Cindy asked.\n\n\"Bart's wife has a Facebook account.\" said Myron. \"She was pretty active on it before she left him, and she was always posting pictures of her, Bart, and Tommy. Some of those pictures were removed, and I found an order from the judge in the divorce decree requiring her to remove all pictures of Bart and Tommy from all social apps. That was one of Bart's biggest demands in the settlement. By the way, Mrs. Tomlin chronicled her leaving Bart and now shows pictures of her with her new man. That's one reason Bart was able to get any custody for his wife denied.\"\n\n\"So much for the double standard in divorce law.\" Cindy quipped, remembering our freshly solved Tylenol Bottle case.\n\n\"It's still a double standard.\" I said. \"I strongly suspect she willingly gave up any custody of Tommy. Tommy's grades show that he was not happy about that, at all.\"\n\n\"So Bart is not a social butterfly?\" Cindy asked Myron.\n\n\"No ma'am.\" said Myron. \"No social clubs, no church memberships that I've found yet. Fairly active in Union activities, though. I got into his cellphone easily enough, but the only texts were work- or Union-related. No social interactions with women, no one-time texts that could be considered threats to or from him. We'll have to do further investigating.\"\n\n\"I'll have Joanne talk to the neighbors, work associates, stuff like that.\" Cindy said.\n\n\"That's be fine, but as to Tommy, we're up against a serious time issue.\" I said. \"I'm less interested in the 'why' of his disappearance than in just finding him, and in a timely manner.\"\n\nJust then, Detective Joanne Warner knocked on the door and I called out for her to come in.\n\n\"We've wrapped up at the scene, sir, ma'am.\" said Joanne. \"None of the neighbors adjoining the Tomlin house saw anything at all, nor heard anything until they heard Mr. Tomlin screaming.\"\n\n\"Did you happen to talk to these neighbors about the Tomlins?\" I asked. \"What kind of people they are?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, we did.\" said Joanne. \"The Officers are writing their reports, which should give more details. From what I gathered, Bart Tomlin was not unfriendly but not outgoing, either. He became a bit more reclusive after his wife left him. No one could ever remember him yelling abusively at Tommy or seeing any signs of physical abuse on Tommy. We probably should call Tommy's school to get more on that, if there is anything.\"\n\n\"And if the wife didn't try to get custody of Tommy,\" I reasoned, \"then she didn't have any fears that Bart would harm their son. And nothing else at first glance that suggests his father would do away with him, or want to. So, Detective Warner, did you stop by the Hospital?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" said Joanne. \"Your wife was there, with Dr. Yates and Dr. Morgan. They had to sedate Mr. Tomlin; he was raving and losing muscle control of his body. They took blood tests for drugs in his system, but the preliminary tests came up negative for anything.\"\n\n\"Damn.\" I muttered. \"He's going mad. Literally.\"\n\nPart 4 - Slender in Police Headquarters\n\n2:05am, Friday, April 20th. I was sitting at my desk, poring over Police reports as they came in, looking for any clue that any person saw that could help us see where to look to find the missing boys. I leaned my head back, letting my body relax into my all-too-comfortable 'Command Chair'. I closed my eyes for a second...\n\nI was surrounded by a strange vortex, with flashes of light and sparkling energy all around me, the energy running through me. There was nothing to suggest this was a room or a confined space, only the swirling vortex surrounding me like a sphere. Which way to go to get out? I wondered. And then, there he was.\n\nFacing me, 75 feet away, was the Slender Man.\n\nI had my red crowbar, and I felt the irresistible urge to attack him. I ran at him, seemingly as fast as The Flash from my daughter Carole and her friend Marie's favorite TV show. But the Slender Man seemed to be gliding away just as fast, and I could never quite reach him to land a blow...\n\n*QURK* *SNZZ*\n\nI was in my office again. Had I fallen asleep? The noise had been from my Police Radio.\n\n\"This is Culver!\" said the radio. Patrolman Culver was on duty at the guardhouse at the gated parking lot entrance. \"Someone is in the parking lot! He's wearing a suit and tie! He's... AUUUGH!\"\n\n\"This is the Duty Desk. All available personnel at Headquarters to the employees parking lot!\" I whirled around in my chair and looked out the window. Standing in the middle of the parking lot, facing the front guardhouse, was the Slender Man!\n\n\"Don!\" shouted Cindy, running in. \"He's out there!\"\n\n\"Stay here!\" I ordered as I grabbed my crowbar. \"Keep your eyes on him!\" I ran out of the office and down the hall, joining a number of Officers that were rushing out the side entrance. As I ran, I noticed that my crowbar felt very warm in my hand. No time to think about that, though...\n\nWhen we got outside, the Slender Man was gone. Nowhere to be seen. Officers fanned out, looking behind and under every car in the lot. A few went to the guardhouse. \n\n\"Commander!\" someone shouted. \"Over here!\" I scurried over to the guardhouse. Patrolman Culver was lying on the floor, unconscious.\n\nThe Duty Desk Sergeant was checking for a pulse. Then Culver groaned as he began recovering consciousness, and was helped into a sitting position. \"Uhhh, what happened?\"\n\n\"What do you remember?\" I asked, kneeling in front of him.\n\n\"I...\" said Culver, \"I... saw a man... in a suit... I called in on the radio... only heard static... he had on some kind of mask because he had no facial features that I could see, but it felt like he was looking right at me... and... the next thing I remember is you guys standing over me now.\"\n\n\"Okay, Abram, Johnson,\" I said, \"take Culver to the Hospital to make sure he's okay. Have them take some blood for tests, as well.\"\n\n*SQWK!* went the radio. \"Alert! Alert! A man in a suit is walking down the hallway! I say again, intruder inside Headquarters!\"\n\nWe all rushed inside. I instinctively ran towards my office as others fanned out and went down both hallways, then scoured the building. No intruder would be found. But when I got to my office, I found Cindy Ross in my Command Chair... seemingly sound asleep. \n\nGoing in, I went to check her pulse. She woke up instantly. \"Wha... what happened?\"\n\n\"You tell me.\" I said. \"You were watching Slender Man in the parking lot. What happened next?\"\n\n\"Uhh...\" Cindy said. \"I... I don't know. I was watching him, I saw him right there, looking towards the guardhouse. Then it seemed like he turned his head and looked right at me... and that's all I remember until I woke up in this chair with you checking my pulse.\"\n\nI looked around. My safe was open. \"Did you open my safe?\" I asked.\n\n\"No sir.\" said Cindy. \"I don't have the combination.\" I looked inside. The disc golf bag was missing.\n\n\"Ah, shit.\" I said. I hurried into MCD, Cindy following. Everyone had run outside when the alert had been raised, and had not yet come back. In the empty room I saw that the pages were still on the whiteboard. And sitting on the desk nearest the back hall entrance to MCD... was the disc golf bag, still full of glowing discs.\n\n\"Now why in the hell did someone do that?\" I asked, in a manner of thinking out loud...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAt 4:00am, Friday, April 20th, Captain Teresa Croyle came into Headquarters and to my office.\n\n\"We ran search and rescue sweeps through the entire subdivision.\" she reported. \"We went through front yards, and back yards if they weren't fenced in. Some people were pissed that Police were in their yards, even when they were told we were looking for a missing child. But I'm not worried about that. The bottom line is that there is no trace of Tommy Tomlin, and no trace of Alton Taylor.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Everyone must be exhausted. Have them stand down, get some rest.\"\n\n\"You okay, sir?\" asked Teresa.\n\n\"Yeah... yeah.\" I said. \"We had a Slender Man sighting here. Several Officers saw him. Culver was taken to the Hospital to be checked out, but he seems to be okay. Cindy was found unconscious in my chair, the one I'm sitting in now. She refused to go to the Hospital, and I have Joanne keeping an eye on her. I think they're in MCD.\"\n\n\"We heard there was a sighting here.\" Teresa said. \"Anyway, I sent the volunteer S&R teams home at midnight. Police Officers and Fire Department teams did the search for Tommy. Want me to bring some of them here? Search the Fairgrounds?\"\n\n\"No, we had six guys here look around. They found nothing.\" I said. \"Oh... and let's make sure to send the TCFD our thanks for their help.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" Teresa said, then continued: \"Sir, I know you respect the Constitution, but I don't think the Founding Fathers wrote it to help kidnappers escape. I had checkpoints set up on all roads leading out of the County, especially over any point that crosses a State Line. We're making people open the trunks of their cars, or we're looking into the backs of their SUVs. Anyone that refuses gets pulled over and sits there until we get a warrant, which we've done six times now.\"\n\n\"We're going to catch hell for that.\" I said. \"But I'll take the arrows on it. You're getting warrants, so Constitutional rights are being protected----\"\n\nAnd then there was a loud knock on my door, followed by the Duty Desk Sergeant practically bursting into the office. \"Sir!\" he said, almost as a gasp \"We just got calls that two more children are missing!\"\n\nPart 5 - Mounting Losses\n\n5:30am, Friday, April 20th. The whiteboards in MCD had four children's pictures on the left-hand side, and now five drawings on the right.\n\n\"Rachel Fourier.\" said Joanne, as she put up Rachel's school photo. \"She was one of the children, along with Alton Taylor, that Commander Troy rescued from his nephew Ned at Ward Harvester. She just turned 11 years old.\"\n\n\"Captain Croyle!\" I called out as I listened to Joanne. When Teresa came up, I said \"Katie Gibson is the third child I rescued at Ward Harvester. She's 13 or 14 years old now. Send a Patrol cruiser to the Gibson home, explain to the family what's going on, and have that Patrol stay there with them, or bring them all here. Might help if at least one of the Officers is female.\" Teresa stalked out of the room to implement my orders. She then went to organize new search and rescue teams.\n\n\"The fourth child is Marie Pressman.\" said Joanne. \"She was the child that disappeared and was 'conveniently' found by Leonard Sharples.\" (Author's note: 'Cold As Ice', Ch. 02.) \"Both sets of parents thought they heard noises in their daughter's bedrooms, went to investigate, found their children missing, and called us immediately. Windows to the bedrooms were closed and locked, and Marie Pressman's room is on the second floor, well above the yard. It'd take Spider Man to climb the wall.\"\n\n\"Or Slender Man, who allegedly can climb walls like a spider.\" I said. \"Okay, these drawings were found on the girls's beds?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" Joanne said. I looked at them. One said \"Always Watches. No Eyes\" and had a round circle meant to be a head with 'X' marks where eyes should've been. In the upper right hand corner was a small '3'. The next one said \"Can't Run\" and some scribbling on the bottom. In the upper right hand corner was a tiny '4'.\n\n\"Where are the parents?\" I asked.\n\n\"Alton Taylor's parents are in the Pastor's Room still.\" said Theo Washington. \"Rachel's parents are in the breakroom next to the gym doors, and Marie's are in the Press Interview Room next to the Public Relations Officer's office. We didn't know if we should keep them separated or let them be in one room.\"\n\n\"If this keeps up,\" said Cindy, \"we won't have any one room big enough for them, except the gym itself.\"\n\n\"You know,\" I said, \"that's not a bad idea. Put some chairs in there, lay down some mats, then Father Romano can bring them in there. See how they react to each other's presences, see if anything strange occurs... though I doubt it will. They can get some sleep on the mats, too.\" Cindy stalked out of MCD to implement my orders.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"Let's feed Myron the information on these families so he can start doing workups of them.\"\n\n\"Already did, sir.\" said Jerome Davis. I nodded, glad to see the Detectives were ahead of me on that.\n\nChief Moynahan came into MCD. He'd been getting some sleep in his office, as he was going to be the face of the TCPD in the eyes and camera lenses of the Press. \"Sooooooo, anything new?\"\n\n\"No sir.\" I said. \"But I'm worried that we're going to get as many as three more reports of missing children. This Slender Man wannabee is going to want us to have the complete set of eight pages.\"\n\n\"Maybe he'll send us another disc golf bag instead of kidnapping children.\" said the Chief. \"The good news is that it's going to be daylight sooooon.\"\n\n\"That might not do us any good, sir.\" said Cindy. \"The Slender Man operates in daylight as well as during the night.\"\n\n\"You are not making my day any better, Captain Rosssss...\" admonished the Chief.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n5:50am, Friday, April 20th.\n\n\"Ohhhhh, yesssss...\"\n\nPatricia Ridley moaned as she descended upon the man's cock beneath her, enveloping his very average five inches of hard flesh inside the velvety warm wetness of her tight cunt. She grinded her hips and ass to secure him deep inside her, using his shaft to stir her aching channel, then began riding him, her hips and ass rising and falling in a slow, gentle rhythm.\n\nBurt West was the Editor-In-Chief of KXTC. He had met Patricia during interviews with her about the Tylenol bottle poisoning case. She had suggested that he take her out for a drink, and things went from there.\n\nWith her husband out of the picture, Patricia could bring other men into her home for sex. Zack didn't seem to care about his new 'uncle'; he just went on playing that video game of his.\n\nShe began riding him harder, faster, enjoying the feeling of a man's hands on her hips, pushing her down onto his shaft. Oh, what I wouldn't give for a big cock, a huge cock, driving up into me right now! she thought to herself. She thought of that Police Commander tall and broad-shouldered, and reputed to have an iron-hard crowbar between his legs.\n\nHer nasty thoughts of the Iron Crowbar had Patricia's juices flowing. She groaned as she felt her orgasm building, fantasizing of a real man behind her in a doggy-style spoon position, roughly fondling her breasts as he deeply fucked her. When she felt a pair of hands squeezing her breasts, pinching her hard nipples, her orgasm crashed into her like a lightning bold.\n\n\"Ahh! Uhhh!\" she gasped out as her cunt clutched down on her lover's cock. She did not feel his dick throb as it began squirting his semen into her, spraying her vaginal walls with his cock cream...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAs they lay together, cuddling in the afterglow of sex, they heard a creak downstairs.\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Patricia as her head flung up.\n\n\"I don't know.\" whispered Burt. \"I'll check it out.\" He got up and put on his pants as Patricia put on a robe. They went out into the hallway to the stairway landing, and looked down into the main room. The front door was closed, but standing in the foyer was the Slender Man!\n\n\"Oh my God!\" shouted Burt West as Patricia screamed. Burt ran to Patricia's bedroom to get his cell phone as Patricia ran for her son Zack's room, expecting the door to be unlocked. But when she tried the knob, it refused to budge! \n\n\"Oh God!\" she screamed as she lunged for her room. Just as she got there, seeing West in the doorway calling 9-1-1, she saw him look up in horror, and she turned her head to see that the Slender Man was coming up to the stairs and onto the landing!\n\n\"Nine-one-one, what's your emergency?\" came a voice from the cell phone. All the operator heard were screams of horror...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Didn't think we'd be dealing with Patricia Ridley again this soon.\" said Captain Cindy Ross as she and Detective Theo Washington came up to the home at 6:14am. Two Patrol cruisers were already there. A Patrolman standing guard at the front door let Ross and Washington in.\n\nInside, sitting on the sofa and sobbing was Patricia Ridley. Next to her was Burt West, his shirt haphazardly on him and not tucked into his pants, looking totally stunned.\n\n\"Mrs. Ridley,\" said Cindy, \"I'm Captain Ross, and you may remember Detective Washington. What happened?\"\n\n\"We... heard a noise downstairs...\" Patricia began intoning in an eerie, broken voice. \"We came out to look, and there was a man... tall man...\" Her voice drifted off as she stared sightlessly forward.\n\n\"How was he dressed?\" asked Theo quietly.\n\n\"Suit. Suit and tie.\" said Burt West, his voice also eerie, denoting his shock.\n\n\"What did his face look like?\" asked Cindy.\n\n\"That... that's just it... it was like he had on some kind of white mask on his head.\" said Patricia. \"He had no features... no mouth or eyes, or nose...\"\n\n\"Where's Zack?\" asked Cindy.\n\n\"Zack... oh my God, Zack!\" Patricia screamed out, beginning to get hysterical. \"I... I ran for his bedroom, but the door was locked. It's normally not locked! Then I ran to get a phone, and Burt was already calling 9-1-1, and then... and then...\" Patricia began sobbing.\n\n\"What happened Mrs. Ridley?\" asked Cindy.\n\n\"I... don't remember!\" Patricia almost shouted. \"I woke up on the floor, and Burt was lying on the floor. We got up, and the door to Zack's room was open, but he wasn't there... he wasn't there!\" \n\n\"Okay.\" Cindy said. \"Mrs. Ridley, let's you and me go upstairs and get you some clothes to wear. Then Mr. West here can finish dressing. Then we'll take you to the Hospital to make sure you're okay.\"\n\n\"I... I tried to film him.\" said Burt West. He held up his cell phone, which was unlocked. Cindy and Theo watched the video. It showed the Slender Man just coming into view on the landing, as if he'd just come up the stairs. Then the interference began, and the screen went gray with static.\n\n\"We're going to have to hold this cellphone, Mr. West.\" said Theo. He called up a CSI tech, who bagged the cellphone. Cindy took Patricia up to her room to get dressed, then Theo supervised Burt West doing the same.\n\n\"We found this on the kid's bed.\" said Christina Cho as Cindy was about to leave. She looked at it the piece of paper in the plastic sleeve. It was a drawing, which said only \"Leave Me Alone\" and a skinny cedar tree.\n\n\"And the number '5' in the right hand corner.\" Cindy said. \"Christina, get this to MCD right away...\"\n\nPart 6 - Break Of Day\n\n\"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Fox Two News!\" shouted the lovely redheaded reporterette at 7:00am, Friday, April 20th, from the corner of Courthouse Square with Police Headquarters in the background at an angle. \"Fox Two News is bringing you continuing coverage of the disappearances of five children in a fourteen-hour span!\"\n\n\"Five children,\" started Bettina, \"identified as Alton Taylor, Tommy Tomlin, Rachel Fourier, Marie Pressman, and Zack Ridley, were reported as missing or kidnapped beginning yesterday afternoon and continuing through the night. Bart Tomlin, father of Tommy, was admitted to University Hospital in deep shock after his son was abducted right in front of him.\"\n\n\"According to Police reports obtained by Fox Two News,\" continued Bettina, \"the assailant is described as a very tall man wearing a black suit, white shirt, and black tie, and either wearing a white mask over his head, or his head having no facial features. This description is consistent with that of The Slender Man, a legendary Internet horror character, and just over a year ago Police arrested Larry Lance, who used the Slender Man outfit to abduct several children.\"",
        "\"Search and rescue teams have found nothing to help solve these crimes, and there have been no ransom demands made to this point.\" Bettina went on. \"Police have not responded to repeated inquiries for more information on the cases, but Police Chief Sean Moynahan issued a statement saying he will give a press conference with an update on the situation later this morning.\"\n\n\"And in State news,\" Bettina said, her manner becoming considerable brighter, \"Independent State Counsel Robert Mullen was asked when he will subpoena Commander Donald Troy to answer questions, and if Commander Troy will have to testify before a Special Grand Jury that Mr. Mullen is expected to convene. Roll tape.\"\n\nTape rolled, showing Mullen saying \"We have preparatory work to do before issuing any subpoenas, and we'll make a determination about how we will interrogate Commander Donald Troy. What I can tell you is that Donald Troy will be subpoenaed and be required to answer my questions fully and truthfully, or he will be prosecuted.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"So, Commander,\" asked Cindy as we watched the broadcast in the nearly empty MCD room, \"would you rather be questioned in front of the Special Grand Jury, or just by Mullen?\"\n\n\"In front of the Grand Jury.\" I said. \"I might could influence them if I was answering questions in front of them.\"\n\n\"Where is everyone?\" Chief Moynahan asked as he came in to get some coffee, which I had made.\n\n\"At their desks, or out in the field.\" I replied. \"The Vice guys are hitting contacts and confidential informants to see if we can get any threads on these Slender Man kidnappings. The MCD guys are in Classroom 'E', getting Myron's report on the various families.\"\n\n\"And why aren't you two in there?\" asked the Chief.\n\n\"Sir, I wanted to see Bettina's report, to see what the Press has.\" I said. \"She didn't mention that KXTC's Editor-in-Chief, Burt West, was in Patricia Ridley's home with her when the Slender Man struck... and he forgot to call in to KXTC and let them know what was happening.\"\n\n\"And we confiscated his cell phone by the time he remembered.\" said Cindy. \"By the way, he and Patricia were released from the Hospital after bloodwork was taken. She's here now, in the Pastor's Room.\" I nodded.\n\n\"Anyway, Chief,\" I continued, \"Bettina didn't mention the pages that were found at the scenes, nor did she mention the disc golf discs, thank God. I'm hoping the Press does not know about all that stuff. And we'll get Myron's report later, either in writing or from his briefing to us...\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n8:30am, Friday, April 20th. The Public Health Department was next to Police Headquarters on Riverside Drive, to our right as one looked at the fronts of the buildings, the Public Health building being closer to City Hall and Courthouse Square.\n\nTown & County Solicitor Miriam Walters walked into the building and went to the office of Public Health Officer Beth Paige. They were longtime friends, and Miriam had called to ask Beth to discuss an issue with her. After preliminary pleasantries and getting coffee, they sat down at the conference table in PHO Paige's office.\n\n\"You're never going to believe this,\" said Miriam Walters, \"but I had a very interesting meeting with Commander Troy yesterday.\"\n\n\"Before all this crap about the missing kids started up?\" Beth Paige asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" said Miriam. \"It was in the morning. Commander Troy suggested that I run for D.A. instead of Solicitor this year.\" She recounted the gist of her conversation with the Police Commander.\n\n\"Wow.\" said Beth. \"So what's his motive in asking you to do that? I could've sworn he would be supporting Paulina Patterson.\"\n\n\"He said he does.\" Miriam replied. \"He also said he really wants Krasney defeated. On that, he and I totally agree.\"\n\n\"That makes three of us.\" said Beth. \"However, you are a shoo-in for Solicitor again. Would you give that up for a shot at District Attorney? A shot you might not win? What would you do if you lost?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about that yesterday.\" said Miriam. \"I also talked to my campaign team about it. All I have to do is make the top two, then there's a runoff election if no one gets 50%. My campaign staff are 'yes-men' and 'yes-women', but they think I have a good shot to make a runoff against Patterson. And Krasney is gone if that happens, whether or not I win or Paulina wins.\"\n\n\"You think Paulina will keep you on as an ADA?\" asked Beth.\n\n\"There's a good possibility.\" said Miriam. \"Or I get a job with the State, or a private law firm, maybe even teach at the University until I can plan my next move. For example, when Eldrick X. Weaver beats Sheriff Allgood for Mayor, Weaver will become such a polarizing Mayor over racial issues that I can beat him in two years and be Mayor myself.\"\n\n\"Unless Sheriff Allgood wins,\" said Beth Paige, aware that she was speaking about her boss, \"and if he does win, he's likely to be like Vaughan... Mayor-for-Life, if he wants it.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Miriam said. \"And the Mayor's office has never really been my lodestone. District Attorney is what I want. So, what is your advice for me?\"\n\n\"I'd suggest you take all the time available to you,\" said Beth, \"and try to figure out what the Iron Crowbar had in mind in asking you to run for D.A. He has to have an ulterior motive, and you need to know what it is----\"\n\n*BRING!* *BRING!* *BRING!*\n\n\"That's my personal cellphone.\" said Beth Paige, looking at the device. \"It's my daughter's school.\" She answered the phone.\n\n\"This is the Assistant Principal at Evergreen Elementary.\" said the Assistant Principal at Evergreen Elementary School, which fed into the County High system. \"We're calling about your daughter Bettie's absence. Is she sick today?\"\n\n\"Absent?\" Beth Paige gasped. \"I dropped her off at school this morning! She should be there!\"\n\n\"Er, she is not in her homeroom, and did not answer roll call, ma'am.\" said the Assistant Principal.\n\n\"Oh my God!\" Beth wailed. \"Call the Police! Immediately!\" She disconnected, then looked at Miriam Walters in shock. \"My daughter... they said she's not at school... I dropped her off there!\"\n\n\"Let's go next door to Police Headquarters.\" said Miriam.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nI was coming out of my office, headed for MCD, when I heard the commotion.\n\n\"Ma'am, you can't come back here without authorization!\" said the Duty Desk Sergeant as Public Health Officer Beth Paige came around the corner, followed by the Sergeant and Solicitor Miriam Walters. Considering that PHO Paige had the same rank in the Public Safety Department as the Chief, this could be bad.\n\nPaige turned on the Sergeant and held up her PHO badge. \"I am the Public Health Officer! Get out of my face, or I'll have you fired!\" She tried to continue down the hall, and the Duty Desk Sergeant did not relent. He grabbed her to stop her.\n\n\"Get your goddamned hands off me!\" Beth Paige screamed. Fortunately for him, I got there.\n\n\"Sergeant!\" I called out. Everyone froze upon hearing the power of my voice. I said in a normal voice: \"It's okay. Return to the Duty Desk. I'll handle this.\" The Duty Desk Sergeant nodded to me and moved out smartly.\n\n\"Get his badge number, I'm going to have him fired!\" Beth Paige screamed.\n\n\"No you're not.\" said Chief Moynahan, coming up behind me. \"He was doing his job, and the Commander and I will back him up all the way. What do you want, Ms. Paige?\"\n\n\"It's Bettie... the school called.\" said Beth, her voice beginning to quiver as her body began shaking. \"I dropped her off at school, but they said she's not in home room, that she's missing...\"\n\n\"All right, we'll start looking for her.\" I said. \"Evergreen Elementary?\" Beth nodded.\n\n\"I'll take her to the Pastor's Room.\" said the Chief. \"Ms. Walters, if you'll come with us...\" He led the women to the Pastor's Room, but not before I'd sprung into action.\n\n\"Captain Ross!\" I yelled out. She came flying out of MCD.\n\n\"I heard it, and I'm on it.\" she said.\n\n\"So am I.\" said Captain Teresa Croyle as she came out of her office. Miriam Walters looked a little less worried, seeing our fast response, but I felt her beady eyes peering at me, seemingly through me... \n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n9:15am. Joanne Warner looked exhausted as she came into MCD with Cindy Ross. \"We found this in the hallway at the school, next to Bettie Paige's homeroom.\" she said. It was a drawing, now in a plastic sleeve as evidence. There was a drawing of the Slender Man in the middle, surrounded by the words \"no no no no no no no no no no no no\". In the top right hand corner was the number '6'.\n\n\"Put it on the whiteboards.\" I said. \"Anyone see anything?\"\n\n\"No one saw a damn thing.\" said Cindy. \"Unless they're lying. We looked at the hallway cameras, and Bettie Paige never appears. The kids usually are on the fenced-in playground behind the school until the bell rings. The camera shows Bettie being dropped off, going into the building, then going outside. But then we can't find her on any camera overlooking the playground. The teachers watching over the yard saw nothing out of the ordinary, no man in a suit or anything like that.\"\n\n\"Wow.\" I said. \"Strangest one yet. Unless, like you said, someone is lying.\"\n\nCindy said \"Teresa was going to organize a search and rescue around the school. Old Mrs. Boddiker was there, and already had the volunteers, most of whom are from the Veasley Community Center and from some of the churches, organized and moving out on assignments. Teresa didn't say a word; she said everything Mrs. Boddiker said was absolutely correct and was what she herself would've said and done.\"\n\nI managed a brief smile. \"We shall have to find a way to reward Mrs. Boddiker for her help. It was she that pointed out the disc golf bag to Patrolman Hicks, as well.\"\n\n\"Do you think that's a clue to all this?\" Cindy asked. \"Or just some kind of coincidence?\"\n\n\"Two coincidences, therefore none.\" I replied. \"We found the bag as a child went missing, and there were no fingerprints at all on the discs. Then Slender Man moved it from my safe to the MCD room. Yes, I think that bag means something... but I'll be damned if I know what it is. There are no markings on the discs, no notes or drawings in the bag... just Page 8, that was found taped to the basket at the park and is now on our whiteboards.\"\n\n\"Sir...\" said Cindy, \"one page left. Think there will be another kidnapping?\"\n\n\"I hope not\" I said. \"All of the schools are alerted and on lockdown now. Officers at all of them, which stretches us way thin.\"\n\n\"I'll call up some Auxiliary Officers and some Deputy Sheriffs to help out with that.\" said Cindy. I nodded.\n\n\"Good.\" I said. \"Maybe Slender Man will give us a break, and tape the 7th page on my office door or something.\"\n\nPart 7 - Trouble Brewing\n\nThe outer gate to Greenville Minimum Security Prison in the southeastern part of the State opened up, and Dean Allen walked out. The son of the late State Senator Nathan Allen had served his time and then some. They'd added time to his sentence for trumped-up charges of smuggling drugs to another inmate, a man doing light time for financial crimes. The Town & County Police and that bastard Phil Kearns had worked hard to keep him from being paroled, but the Board had finally granted his release.\n\n\"How am I supposed to get back to town?\" he asked.\n\n\"Walk.\" said the guard at the gate. \"Or call a cab on your cellphone.\" Allen knew he didn't have a cellphone in his small suitcase, and the battery would be long since dead, anyway.\n\nJust as he began walking down the road, a mini-SUV approached him. \"Dean Allen?\" the man called out.\n\n\"Yeah.\" said Allen. \"Who wants to know?\"\n\n\"Me.\" said the man. He stopped the car and got out. He was tall, with curly brown hair, a large nose, and an arrogant countenance. He was wearing a sportscoat and slacks, and a black shirt with a white clerical collar. \"I'm SBI Chaplain Steven Ikea. I was sent down to pick you up. Some of my friends want to meet with you.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" said Allen, not having any real choice. Ikea put Deans' suitcase in the back of the SUV as Dean got into the shotgun seat. As they drove away, Allen said \"I remember you. You were with the Town & County Police.\"\n\n\"I upgraded.\" said Ikea. \"A lot of things have changed since they put you away.\"\n\n\"I've heard some of it.\" said Allen. \"Your buddy Donald Troy has kicked a lot of asses.\"\n\n\"And your buddy Teresa Croyle has been right there with him.\" replied Ikea. \"She's a Captain in the TCPD now.\"\n\n\"Shows just how stupid they are.\" said Allen. \"So, who wants to meet me, and why?\"\n\n\"Patience, Dean. Patience.\" said Ikea. \"You'll find out everything soon...\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nPottsville, the crossroads of the State. The town of 40,000 residents was a mixture of the old trading town and the 'Old Money' that had been made from it, and a newer mix of industries to the northeast along the Interstate and farming to the southeast.\n\nState House Ways and Means Chairman Wilson Hammonds (Establishment Republican) was of the 'Old Money' Hammonds family, in whose honor Hammondsville in the State west of the Iron Crowbar's Town and County was named. Chairman Hammonds wielded considerable political power in the State, and was virtually invincible and unstoppable in his own District.\n\nBut he now had two problems: Seamus 'Shane' O'Brady, and Donald Troy.\n\nO'Brady had never quite let go of the Butch Fulmer murder. And he was on the fringe of finding out that it was Hammonds that had secured the museum security guard job for Fulmer, as well as 'extra payments' that insured Fulmer would keep his mouth shut about the Harlan/Gonzales University scandal (Author's note: 'Pink Panther'.).\n\nThere had been plans to send O'Brady a 'message' that he was overstepping. But Hammonds's marked cards in the Pottsville Police Department had gotten word to him that the Iron Crowbar was watching, and would be 'most unhappy' if anything happened to O'Brady.\n\nAnd then there was Donald Troy himself. The Mullen probe was gearing up, but the Iron Crowbar was showing no signs of being intimidated, and every sign that he was going to fight Mullen with everything he could muster. On top of that, Troy and U.S. Senator Richard Nunn were relentlessly pursuing the BigAgraFoods documents issue... the documents the Guardians of Justice had released, showing BigAgraFoods's plans to control the food supply of the Nation, in order to subjugate the American People. And then there were the documents about the murder of the whistleblower Larry Wheeler. And that is what this meeting was about.\n\nGathering for a breakfast in Hammonds's Pottsville office were Hammonds, Lt. Governor Graham Collins, U.S. Senator Samuel Russell, State Senator Cain Mitchell, and State Rep. Jeff Canton. Russell looked like he had not slept in a month, and his collared shirt under his sportscoat was rumpled and slightly stained in a couple of places.\n\n\"Geez, Samuel,\" said Hammonds upon seeing the normally vigorous, well-dressed U.S. Senator, \"you look half dead.\"\n\n\"It's getting bad for me in Washington.\" said Russell. \"The FBI Executive Assistant Director for this region is not playing the Game, and he's in charge of Special Agent in Charge Muscone's team. My people are trying hard to stop them, but Senator Nunn, may he be damned by God, is working with them to get BigAgraFoods documents that will be... embarrassing, to say the least.\"\n\n\"Can they harm you in any criminal sense?\" asked Collins.\n\n\"No, no... you know nothing harmful ever gets documented.\" said Russell. \"But you also know how overzealous prosecutors can try to turn anything innocent into something criminal.\"\n\n\"Oh I know.\" said Graham Collins. \"In fact, we're counting on Independent State Counsel to do exactly that with regard to Donald Troy.\"\n\n\"What exactly is your plan for that, Lt. Governor?\" asked State Senator Mitchell.\n\n\"The plan,\" said Collins, \"is to get Commander Troy indicted, which will get him suspended at the least. Once he's stripped of any law enforcement power, we can then move against Jared, impeach him, and more importantly convict him and remove him from office, if he doesn't resign first.\"\n\n\"Once that's done,\" said Collins, \"and I am Governor, Senator Russell can retire and resign his Senate seat. I will appoint a reliable Republican in his place, a Republican that knows the Grassroots are to be ignored and spit upon...\"\n\n\"I hate the fucking Grassroots!\" exploded Wilson Hammonds. \"I despise those bastards, those TEA Party assholes, and those pieces of shit that don't understand their fucking places in this world.\"\n\n\"Yes, Wilson, we understand.\" said Collins calmly. \"But to piss in the Grassroots's faces, and show them that the Establishment is their true master, we have to get the bastards Troy and Jared out of the way. Then we can replace Russell with a reliable Republican, someone who understands that our big-money donors, Big Business, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce come before the puny ants of the Grassroots.\"\n\n\"On top of that,\" said Collins, \"we intend to take it further, to make damn sure the People of this State don't get any independent ideas like they did when they re-elected that fool Jared. I'm working with both sides of the aisle in the State Legislature right now. The plan is to call the Legislature into Special Session, rescind the SBI Bill that Molinari and Cerone pushed through, and pass a new Budget that will restructure the SBI into the dominant law enforcement entity in the State... and with full authority over the shit eating local law enforcement jurisdictions. Jack Lewis will be brought back as SBI Director, restored to his rightful place before the Iron Crowbar ran him off to be a teacher at Eastern State.\"\n\n\"How long is this going to take?\" asked State Rep. Canton.\n\n\"Mullen thinks he can get Troy indicted in June, maybe by July 4th at the latest.\" said Collins. \"He has to lay some groundwork first, though. He'll be calling other witnesses to answer questions under oath, and start building his case against Troy. Then he'll subpoena Troy, and ask questions in a way that Troy can't possibly answer without contradicting himself. And then it's over for Troy... the 'Scooter Libby' treatment will commence, and once the Special Grand Jury indicts Troy, that's it for him.\" \n\n\"It'll take that long?\" asked Russell.\n\n\"There's probably no way to do it more quickly.\" said Collins. \"Mullen still has to use the process of the law and move within the law to entrap Troy. The key is to use the legal system itself to crush Troy, to give him no way out with the power of Government using legal tools to destroy him. If Mullen doesn't follow the correct process, then Troy is slippery enough that he might slip out of the net.\"\n\n\"And once Troy is gone,\" asked Cain Mitchell, \"how long to get Jared?\"\n\n\"It depends.\" said Hammonds. \"If Troy is indicted, we'll let Jared know there's no hope for him, for Jared. We hope to force him to resign. We'll even suggest he pardon Troy and then resign.\"\n\n\"Pardon Troy?\" shouted Mitchell. \"Are you kidding me?\"\n\n\"No.\" said Hammonds. \"First of all, an indictment is not a conviction. Troy is going to fight like hell all the way. He just will be doing so as a former Police Officer and State Agent, not an active one. That's our lodestone for him.\"\n\n\"If he's pardoned,\" said Mitchell, \"they'll just put him right back where he was.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" said Collins. \"But he'll be damaged goods. Harlow will win the Sheriff race in November by running against his besmirched reputation. I'll be Governor, implementing a new SBI under the control of Jack Lewis. The SBI-OER will be gutted. The investigations of BigAgraFoods and other businesses that give us millions in contributions will be dropped. We will regain control of the State, things will be as they should be.\"",
        "\"And best of all,\" continued Collins, \"if Troy is pardoned, there won't be a trial that could acquit him. There will always be that question of corruption hanging over his head.\"\n\n\"And the Democrats?\" asked Jeff Canton. \"What's their part in this?\"\n\nGraham snorted a laugh. \"This whole Independent State Counsel thing was their idea. Maxine Watts is a batshit-crazy old bitch, but she's been very useful in giving us ammunition regarding the Jasmine Nix murder... there might really be a cover-up there. And it gives us the legal cover to go after Troy and Jared without the... 'Grassroots' getting too upset and coming after us with pitchforks.\"\n\n\"I wish to God the Grassroots would try to rise up.\" snarled Wilson Hammonds. \"I would enjoy seeing them mowed down by Government guns.\" The room quietened down.\n\n\"Don't let the Guardians of Justice hear you say that.\" said Samuel Russell. \"They'll tell the fucking world.\"\n\n\"I prefer the bloodless coup myself.\" said Collins. \"As long as we have control. Anyway, the Democrats will be with us until Jared is out. Then they'll try to exercise their power and come against us. We may well lose the State House and Senate, but the People don't seem to realize that it doesn't matter who holds the whips over their backs... we're just the left and right sides of the same coin... the coin of Government control...\"\n\nPart 8 - The Eighth Page\n\n11:30am, Friday, April 20th. The Missing Children hotline was processing calls from people saying they'd seen one child or another in various places from Courthouse Square to the State Capitol in Midtown. Some of the calls were obvious pranks, and I had Myron trace down the callers and sent Police to have a 'talking to' with them. Six children missing, and these assholes want to play fucking pranks? Gotta be a special kind of hatred-filled person to do pranks like that at a time like this.\n\nA pall of fear was also settling over the Town and County. The schools were on lockdown, and parents were not being allowed to pick up their children and take them away. After all, the Slender Man had taken children out of their locked bedrooms, out of a locked car, and whisked one child out of a school full of kids and teachers. Kids would be as safe at school as they would be at home Parents were allowed to stay at the schools, though, as their kids went to classes.\n\nTo my surprise, the Press had not yet teed off on the Police Force. Chief Moynahan had updated them with a statement a little over an hour before, and the names of the children had been released. The parents were here at Police Headquarters, which shielded them from the rabid Media. The seven pages had not been discussed, and no one in the Media had reported on finding them, to my amazement and relief.\n\nWhile the Detectives in MCD were processing leads, gathering information on the kids and their parents and others that might be involved, I had stared at the pages for a long, long time. I could see no clues in the drawings; nearest I could tell, they were the same as the 'Slender Man' video games.\n\n\"One big question has been where someone is going to keep seven kids, alive or dead.\" Joanne had said to me a half hour before. \"We've had patrols covering the farm fields to the west of the River and the southern parts of the County, we've had patrols and drones going to Point Hollow and all around that area, ditto that for the Reservoir Lake area. We're... we're looking for signs of digging, of a mass grave, as well as possible sightings of them alive.\"\n\n\"I have the feeling they're alive.\" I said. \"We find bodies, and whatever this guy is trying to do is over. He needs them alive... as bait.\"\n\n\"Any ideas where he's hiding them, sir?\" Joanne asked, perhaps a bit adroitly.\n\n\"If this guy can kidnap kids the way he has been doing,\" I replied, \"he can hide them just as easily. My question, Detective Warner, is 'what is his motive?'. Why is he kidnapping kids and leaving these drawings, and perhaps leaving a disc golf bag full of discs? And worst of all... there's one page left. One... frickin'... page... left.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nFifteen minutes later, I was walking out of MCD and down the hallway towards the Pastor's Room when the Duty Desk Sergeant came around the corner. \"Commander!\" he called out.\n\n\"Yes?\" I replied, slowing down.\n\n\"We got a call from one of the schools.\" said the Sergeant. \"Kids went to lunch, they wait in line to walk back while going to the restroom. One girl did not come out of the restroom that 30 kids watched her go into, and there's only one entrance and exit.\" He handed me the slip of paper with the report. I read the name and felt my heart sink.\n\n\"Thanks, Sergeant. You can go.\" I said. He went back to the Duty Desk as I turned to go to the office of the Captain of Detectives. \n\nI knocked on the door and Cindy called out \"Come in!\" I went in, seeing her at her desk, utterly exhausted, her ice blue eyes seeming to be a little too bright. She looked up at me.\n\n\"Another kid missing?\" she asked. As I nodded, she said \"Okay, I'll send Parker and a Uniformed team to the school, and have Teresa organize another search and rescue. Those guys are flat worn out, though---\"\n\n\"Cindy...\" I said, trying to get her attention. When she didn't quite respond, I said a little louder \"Cindy!\" She blinked, as if coming out of her thoughts.\n\n\"What?\" she said.\n\n\"There's more.\" I said, looking hard at her, my gray eyes boring into her ice blue eyes. \"This missing child... it's your friend, Susie Haskins.\"\n\n\"Oh, nooooooo...\" Cindy whispered as she fell back into her chair... \n\nTo be continued."
