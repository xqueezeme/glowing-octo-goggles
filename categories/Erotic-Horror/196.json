        "I've been reading stories involving succubi and demons for a long time on literotica and for even longer in urban fantasy novels. I was watching a Q&A on youtube a while back. One of my favorite authors was explaining that he purposefully writes at a high school reading level, so that the language of the story doesn't distract from the readers immersion. My immediate reaction was, \"Hey I graduated from high school, this whole writing thing can't be that hard.\" This story was the result. I had a lot of fun writing it and I hope a few of you can find some enjoyment in it as well.\n\nAll characters in this story are at least 18 years of age and YOU must be 18 years of age in order to read it. So if you are under the age of 18, please kindly click that back button. \n\nI love feedback and constructive criticism. So rate it and let me know what you think. Enjoy!\n\n***\n\nA forest could seem like an alien world at night. Tom Thornton couldn't tell if the snow was still falling or if it had just been whipped up by the wind. It howled around him, deafening him to his surroundings. The fresh powder stung his exposed skin, like a slap to the face. The lack of light played tricks on his eyes. There always seemed to be something just out sight or at the corners of his vision. Eyes in the darkness watching his progress. Or was that the hypothermia beginning to affect his mind? \n\nWhat the hell am I doing out here, he thought.\n\nThis was supposed to be a fun distraction before finals started. A weekend in the mountains skiing with friends, a way for them to clear their minds before they all put their nose to the grindstone. He didn't even like skiing. He hadn't done it since a school trip as a kid. It was his roommate that dragged him out here. He said he wanted him to get out of the house, give him an opportunity to be more social. Tom suspected he was really here to even out the numbers. Not that the odd girl out had shown any interest in him. It was clear Katie Evans saw only a geek when she looked at him. To be fair, that's exactly what he was. A geek. A fact, he would like to be proud of at the moment. Geeks didn't tend to freeze to death on ski trips. Yet here he was. \n\nThe trip had gotten off to a good enough start. The area was beautiful, fresh air and pine trees as far as the eye could see. The area was remote enough to be peaceful, without the crowds of more popular skiing destinations. His morning had been spent fumbling around, looking like an idiot with skies. He had fallen more than a few times, to the amusement of his much more experienced friends. Still the trip was fun, despite the unnerving feeling he sometimes got when looking out on the tree line. Something about this mountain set his hair on end.\n\nHe had gotten separated from the group sometime during the afternoon. A stupid mistake, the kind only the inexperienced would make. Went out into the woods to take a piss and got turned around. He had searched for the trail back to the cabin for hours. Before he knew it darkness fell, the sky clouded over and the wind picked up. Now the only things he saw were the trees and the endless stream of snow streaking past his vision.\n\nWhere the hell had this storm come from? There was nothing on the weather about a front moving in.\n\nAlthough warmly dressed for skiing, no one could be out in this type of weather for long. The chill had already started to sink into his feet and hands. Frostbite and hypothermia would soon follow. The gravity of the situation began to take hold. This was the type of weather people died in, he thought.\n\nHugging his arms to his body he trudged through the knee deep snow. His legs felt like a ton of bricks every time he lifted them. It seemed like every step took more energy than the last as he moved forward. He so very wanted to sit down for a minute and rest. Just a minute before continuing on. A little voice in the back of his mind told him to keep moving. That if he stopped he would never get back up again. Every minute was a struggle to keep moving. This was a game of endurance he knew he would lose.\n\nHis steps had just begun to waver when he saw it. A light cutting through the trees. A light in the darkness. \n\nI'm saved, he thought.\n\nHe made a beeline for that small glimmer of hope. If he could just reach that light it would all work out. \n\nI better not be hallucinating, he thought.\n\nAs he got closer he saw the light for what it was. A small log cabin, its illuminated windows casting dark shadows through the forest. It gave the area an almost sinister look.\n\nHe finally reached the door and fumbled with the handle, his numb fingers refusing to cooperate. After what seemed like forever the handle turned. Relief washed over him as he realized it was unlocked. Wrenching it open, he slipped inside. He barely got a look at the room, before he had to strain against the wind and snow to shut the door. He took a moment to breathe a sigh of relief, his forehead resting against the inside of the door.\n\nI'm alive, he thought.\n\nHe jumped as a warm breath on his neck sent a shiver down his spine. \"Well hello there,\" a feminine voice said.\n\nHe turned to find himself face to face with a woman. She was stunning. Her ash blond hair was so light it could almost be mistaken for the color of snow. Her pale skin and aristocratic features gave her a haunting beauty. She was wrapped in a thick blanket but Tom still got the feeling that she had a body any woman would die for.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I-I'm Tom,\" he stammered. \n\n\"OK. Tom. Why are you in my uncle's cabin?\"\n\nA good question considering he was a man who just burst in on a half naked women.\n\n\"I'm sorry for bursting in like this. I was lost and looking for a place to take shelter from the storm.\"\n\n\"Lost you say? Pretty bad conditions to get lost in.\"\n\n\"I was lucky to find this place. I got separated from my friends, then this storm hit and I wasn't sure which direction led back to the trail. I walked for what seemed like forever and then the path just seemed to open up for me. Before I knew it I had spotted this place.\"\n\nHe was rambling. He knew he was rambling, but he couldn't help it. Almost dying and having a conversation with a beautiful girl was more excitement then he could take. It didn't help that she seemed to be staring at him.\n\n\"This forest is old, it knows many things, many paths to follow,\" she murmured.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I said you were very lucky indeed. This weather is just horrendous. It would be very dangerous to stay out in it for long.\"\n\nHe thought he saw a shadow of something pass across her face. His eyes must be playing tricks on him. Her eyes looked like they glowed for a second there.\n\n\"My name is Shyira,\" she said. \"Although my friends call me Shy,\" she giggled at that.\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\nThe blanket had dipped down, revealing her black bra and the deep valley of her ample cleavage.\n\n\"It's a joke,\" she said, with a small seductive smile, \"because I'm not shy at all.\" \n\nUm. Wow.\n\n\"Oh you poor thing,\" she said, \"you must be freezing, why don't you come by the fire and warm up.\"\n\nAs he stepped farther into the room he got a closer look at his surroundings. A couch opposite a fireplace along the back wall. To his left stood a bed pushed up against the wall, to his right was a small kitchenette and table. The very picture of a small, one room cabin.\n\nAlthough out of the deadly weather of the storm, the room was still bitterly cold. Tom's breath created trails of fog as he breathed. He wanted to get warmer, but didn't want to invade the personal space of the strikingly beautiful woman in front of him. He was a stranger in her home after all.\n\nShe noticed his discomfort, \"Come closer to the fire Tom,\" she said, \"I won't bite...much, I promise.\"\n\nTom slowly edged closer. Shyira wasn't having any of it. She grabbed his hand and dragged him until he was standing next to her by the fire.\n\n\"That's better,\" she said.\n\n\"Ya it is a lot warmer over here\"\n\n\"So you said that you got separated from your friends?\"\n\nTom nodded, \"Went out into the trees to take a pis-...use the restroom and got turned around.\"\n\nShyira smiled at that, amusement in her eyes, but let his comment slide without comment.\n\n\"It can be easy to get turned around in these woods. I take it you're not much of an outdoors man?\"\n\n\"That obvious huh?\"\n\n\"Not terribly obvious, no. You just don't seem like the roughing it type of guy...or maybe I'm wrong. Do you like it rough, Tom?\"\n\nTom coughed nervously, shifting back and forth on his feet. The old floor boards creaked with his shifting weight. He wasn't sure how to respond to that. Girls simply didn't say things like that to him. He decided playing dumb was safest course of action. \n\n\"I'm not really the outdoors man type I guess. I got dragged out here to go skiing.\"\n\n\"Dragged out here by your girlfriend?\"\n\n\"No, I don't have a girlfriend,\" he said, sheepish.\n\n\"Oh.\" She raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"I'm not very good with girls,\" he said quietly. With more confidence he added, \"Besides I've had a front row seat to my roommate's constant drama with the girls he's slept with. It looks like nothing but trouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must be careful who you let into your bed. You may find yourself with unintended attachments.\"\n\nTom wasn't sure how to respond to that either. Why did it seem like girls spoke in a different language at times? Playing dumb seemed to be working so far, so he decided to stick with it and move the subject off of himself.\n\n\"So what brings you out here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Writing if you can believe it. I find the great outdoors...stimulating.\"\n\nStimulating huh? Well I suppose getting away from it all would be quite relaxing. He could get a lot of school work done out here.\n\n\"So what kind of writing do you do?\"\n\n\"Oh, I write mostly fiction with adult themes.\"\n\n\"What, like murder mysteries?\"\n\n\"More of the suck and fuck variety actually.\"\n\n\"Oh that's nice...\"\n\nDamn it. What's with this girl? He thought.\n\nShyira smiled.\n\nAlthough standing by a roaring fire, Tom was still wearing his damp clothes. Now that he wasn't moving, his body began to shake from the chill.\n\n\"We need to get you out of these damp clothes.\"\n\n\"No. I'm fine as long as I'm by the fire.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, you'll catch your death with these on.\" With no further warning she reached out and tugged on his shirt lifting it above his head. His boots and pants soon followed.\n\nTom shivered as he stood in his underwear. Shyira seemed to be staring at him with hunger in her eyes.\n\n\"Do you have another blanket?\" he asked nervously. He couldn't remember a time when a girl had stared at him like that.\n\n\"What,\" she said, as if snapped out of her own thoughts. \n\nFor a second Tom could have sworn he saw flames in her eyes. Must have been a reflection from the fire, he thought.\n\n\"A blanket. Do you have another one?\"\n\n\"Oh baby, you won't be needing one.\"\n\nSomething about the way she said it made Tom think of a small animal, coming face to face with a predator.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nShyira dropped the blanket from around her shoulders.\n\nWow. He was wrong. Shyira didn't have the kind of body women would die for; she had the kind of body women would kill for.\n\n\"I'm afraid I haven't been completely up front with you. It was no mistake that the forest brought you to my door step tonight.\"\n\n\"The forest?\"\n\nThis time he couldn't mistake the glow in her eyes as anything else. Her eyes seemed to be glowing with flame, like the wick of a candle.\n\nHe looked down as something else caught his eye. Something danced in the light of the fireplace behind her. Was that a tail?\n\nLooking up Tom saw Shyira silhouetted against the fire. She was still the haunting beauty she was before but now her hair was the color of snow and a pair of white horns curved out of her head. Her most striking feature were the leathery wings spread out behind her. The light from the fire illuminated the semitransparent wings. They seemed to cast a red tint to her ski. Or was her skin redder in color than before. One thing was clear the woman before him was the most beautiful, terrifying nightmare he had ever seen.\n\nThis is some biblical shit, he thought.\n\nShe smiled at him like a hungry predator. \"I brought you into my domain mortal, saved you from a certain death at the hands of the storm. I've been a perfect host and I think now is the time for you to repay me for my hospitality.\"\n\n\"I-I could just leave.\"\n\n\"You won't be leaving,\" she said confidently.\n\n\"Y-you'll keep me from leaving?\"\n\n\"Oh baby, I don't need to. Where would you go?\"\n\nThe wind howled against the window. She was right. There was nowhere else to go. He was trapped in this cabin until the storm passed. \n\n\"Come to me mortal,\" she beckoned with her finger, \"I'll keep you warm tonight.\"\n\nDespite the inevitability of his situation something clicked in his mammalian brain at her words. Something from a bygone era of human history, a time when mankind would huddle around the fire in terror of what lurked in the darkness. Tom turned and ran for the door. He didn't care that he was half naked and that outside the cabin meant certain death from the elements. His fight or flight reflex had kicked in; he chose flight.\n\nWith a single beat of her wings, little more than a jump, she was on top of him. She tackled him to the rug. Flipping him over, she straddled his waist. \n\n\"Oh I love it when they run, it makes me so wet,\" she giggled, \"almost as much as when they fight.\"\n\nHe looked terrified at her words.\n\n\"Not to worry baby we'll save the 'slap and tickle' for another time,\" she stroked his cheek with one of her horns. \"When I'm done with you, you'll never want to be separated from me again.\"\n\nHer comment didn't seem to mollify him much.\n\n\"Now we can't have you shaking like a little mouse,\" she said, \"other succubi may like to play with a little fear but I prefer my men to enjoy themselves.\"\n\nWith that she lifted her hand and blew into his face. The pink perfumed smoke hit him dead in the face. Before he realized what had happened, he had already taken an involuntary breath of the sweet substance. \n\n\"I prefer to take mortals au natural but I thought maybe a little encouragement was in order,\" she winked.\n\nEvery muscle in his body relaxed. Thinking became difficult as euphoria washed over him. The sensation was hard to describe. Like a warm bath and a post orgasmic bliss all rolled into one. For a second he forgot where he was and basked in the moment. He was hard as a rock now.\n\nNo. Succubus. Think.\n\nShyira leaned back and felt his growing erection, \"That's better.\"\n\nShe leaned forward and inhaled deeply as his arousal increased, caching his scent.\n\n\"A virgin. Oh this is a rare treat,\" she said with surprise.\n\n\"I-I was waiting for the right girl. I wanted to make it special,\" he said.\n\nAdorable. It was almost a shame she would put an end to that innocence tonight. Oh how she loved virgins.\n\n\"Oh baby, I'll make it special,\" she said, \"I'll give you a night you'll never forget.\"\n\nShe unsnapped her bra and smiled as her naked tits fell into his view.\n\nTom couldn't look away. His breath was ragged as he stared at her pale flesh. Her breasts were large and unnaturally perky for their size.\n\n\"Like what you see little mortal?\"\n\nHis cheeks felt flush as he forced himself to look away.\n\n\"No,\" he lied.\n\n\"Oh I think you do,\" she pushed her ass back until Tom felt warmth above his raging erection.\n\nShe began to grind herself against his manhood. \"I think this is the most erotic thing that's ever happened to you.\"\n\nShe continued for a minute before she leaned forward, pressing her body against his. Her fever hot skin felt wonderful against this cold body. Her breasts pushed against his chest as she came in for a kiss. Her unnaturally long tongue invaded his mouth as she moaned in pleasure. She explored his mouth with her tongue. \n\nBreaking off her kiss she looked him in the eye.\n\n\"I love the taste of a virgin,\" she whispered to him, \"they taste so fucking delicious.\"\n\nShe slipped down his body. Her nipples, brushing over his skin, sent shivers down his spine. She stopped when her head was above his crotch. She ran her hands over his thighs, her lips only inches from his virgin cock. She took her time teasing him. Tom could barely breathe. He was so off balance and excited he couldn't seem to put two thoughts together. He waited in nervous anticipation to see what the demonic seductress would do next. \n\nShyira finally moved her hands from his thighs, having tortured the young boy enough. She moved her hand to his erection, slowly rubbing her hands over the material of his underwear. She licked her lips before leaning in and kissing the head of his cock through the material. She made eye contact with him; her eyes seemed to glow with a look of mirth and lust before she abruptly ripped his underwear off. Tom yelped in surprise.\n\n\"You could warn me before doing that!\"\n\n\"And where would the fun be in that,\" she giggled. \"Besides I think your poor cock has been constrained for too long.\"\n\nShe leaned down and licked him from the base of his cock to its head, careful to maintain eye contact. \n\nHer lips slowly encircled his cock before taking the first couple of inches into her mouth, swirling her tongue around the head.\n\nTom gasped. \n\nThe entire length soon disappeared as she began to suck him in earnest. This girl could give porn stars lessons he thought. He tried to muffle the moan that was threatening to escape. He wasn't ready to give in yet.\n\nThis earned him a muffled laugh. The vibrations sent shivers of pleasure down his spine.\n\nHis resistance didn't last long. Tom was soon in heaven as he gave into the sensations. He had never felt anything like this before. If it wasn't for the horns, the white hair of the succubus could almost be mistaken for an angel.\n\nHis cock came out of her mouth with a pop. She smiled at him and kissed the head of his cock before taking his entire length into her throat once more. His head slammed back as his breath quickened.\n\nHer gag reflex was nonexistent. She seemed to stay down forever, taking his entire length. Tom didn't see how she could do that without having difficulty breathing.\n\nHe paused. Did a succubus need to breath? Not important right now, he thought.\n\nShe made a show of it. Taking him all the way to the base. Then completely removing his cock from her mouth for a moment before shoving it back in.\n\nTom could feel his orgasm beginning to rise. It started as a feeling in his muscles, a tightness he was all too familiar with, he knew he was only moments away.\n\nHis whole lower body seemed to thrust forward as he came. His first shot caught her square in the face. She quickly engulfed his cock, filling her mouth with the rest of his seed. When he was done she made a show of swallowing all of the cum she had collected in her mouth. His breath was ragged as his orgasm subsided. His chest rising and falling rapidly. What the hell was that? It was like he had just run a marathon. He didn't think he could move this body if he tried. \n\nHer long, devilish tongue snaked around his cock. Like only a succubus could. It coiled around his shaft like a snake and squeezed. The sensation was almost too much right after cumming. Tom got the feeling that she wanted him to remember not just who was fucking him but what was fucking him. As if Tom could forget.\n\nShe extracted herself from him. She stood above him, feeding herself the last of his cum from her fingers. Her legs were spread wide, her feet on either side of his chest. Tom propped himself up on his elbows, he had a perfect angle of her panties plastered to her pussy.\n\n\"You can't be a passive partner your first time baby. You have to take some initiative,\" she smiled, \"reach up and pull my panties off.\"",
        "Her words left no room for debate. Feeling lost in the moment, Tom tentatively reached up and grasped the material of her panties, slowly pulling them down her legs. She helped him remove them from her feet, leaving Tom to stare at the bare mound of her pussy, glistening with arousal.\n\n\"Like what you see?\" She didn't give him a chance to answer before squatting down on his face, mashing her arousal onto his open mouth.\n\nHe tried to squirm away but Shyira held him in place with her powerful thighs. \"That's it baby, lick me. You need to learn how to please a woman sometime and I can be a great teacher.\"\n\nTom pushed is his tongue into her pussy and began to explore her. He got his first taste of her sweet nectar and he liked it. He wasn't sure if this was how a woman was supposed to taste, given that he had nothing to compare this experience too. For all me knew a succubus was completely different from a mortal woman.\n\n\"Oh fuck, that it baby,\" she moaned, \"that's the spot.\"\n\nHe must be doing something right, he thought, so he paid more attention to where she directed.\n\nUnder her careful direction, Tom soon had Shyira breathing hard, a slight tremble in her muscles. After another minute of his attention, explosions went off in her head as the orgasm ripped through her.\n\n\"Baby, that was great\" she breathed, \"I think there's hope for you yet.\"\n\nHope wasn't an emotion he was feeling much of right now. \n\n\"Now I think it's time for the main course.\"\n\nTom noticed that he was hard again. Although with the euphoric fog he was immersed in, he wasn't sure he had ever gone soft. Going down on her hadn't helped. Her juices, or should he say venom was having an impact on his body. His whole body buzzed, like pins and needles.\n\nShe repositioned herself over his erection, a predatory gleam in her eye, \"It's time to have some real fun.\"\n\nHe wasn't sure if he wanted to know what real fun entailed. He felt something wrap around his cock and it wasn't her hands. Looking over he saw her tail guiding him to the entrance of her pussy. \n\n\"Ready to lose your virginity?\"\n\n\"Do I have a choice?\"\n\nShe ignored him. \n\nI guess not, he thought. If he was being honest he didn't really want to stop. If sex with her was anything like her blow jobs, he could find himself getting addicted real quick. Assuming he lived long enough to get addicted that is.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted as Shyira began her downward movement. The head of his cock pushed into the warm folds of her pussy.\n\nOh shit, he thought.\n\nHis head was swimming in pleasure. He thought her blow jobs were heaven. Being inside her warm embrace was like nothing he had ever experienced and that was only the head of his dick. \n\n\"Heavenly,\" he whispered.\n\nThat earned him a smile, \"Far from it.\"\n\nThrough the fog of his pleasure, Tom vaguely recognized that something was very strange about her pussy. It seemed to have latched onto his cock and Tom doubted that it would be letting go anytime soon. It was like a strange type of suction threatened to draw him further into her pussy, this was beside the fact that Shyira hadn't moved any further down his shaft. For some reason the image of a starving animal latching onto fresh meat popped into his head.\n\nShe let gravity do the work as she slammed the rest of his cock into her pussy.\n\n\"FUCK,\" he yelled.\n\n\"That's the spirit baby.\"\n\nWith no further talking, she began to fuck him in earnest.\n\nThey fell into a rhythm as Shyira bounced on Tom's cock. The only sounds in the room were the sounds of their sexes slapping together and the grunts and moans of their exertion.\n\nHad it gotten colder? It was certainly cold in the room. Long trails of fog emanated from Shyira's mouth as she fucked him. But despite the strenuous physical activity Tom was far from warm. In fact, Tom felt like he was getting colder. Like all of the heat in his body was gravitating towards his balls. Pooling there as if waiting for release. No...not heat, he thought, energy. She was fucking the life force out of him. Getting ready to drink from the pool of Tom's life.\n\nHe was terrified and utterly powerless to stop the proceedings. He was quickly finding out that once inside a succubus, there was no disengaging their sexes until she was done with him and she was nowhere near done.\n\nShe once again laid herself across his body as she continued fuck him. She leaned in and gave him a sloppy kiss. She pinned his arms down as she did. Further demonstrating who was in control. Breaking her kiss she looked at him with a hungry expression.\n\n\"Almost there baby. Once more and you're mine.\"\n\nTom could feel it too. He was close. A few more seconds and he would fall off the cliff into pure bliss and probably keep falling.\n\nHe resisted as long as he could. He didn't want to die. Ultimately it was futile. A mortal simply couldn't resist a succubus. They were humanity's natural predator.\n\nHis orgasm exploded, ropes of cum sprayed out of his cock. The pool of energy seemed to drain with every release. He felt like a tap had been turned and he had no idea how to turn it off, even if he wanted to turn it off. Tom plastered the inside of her pussy. His whole body seemed to be feeding his balls as his energy level dropped through the floor. Just when he felt like his balls were empty, another shot of cum came out. Black spots danced in front of his vision. \n\nHis reaction seemed to send Shyira over the edge. Her wings fully extended, her body arced in pleasure, she tilted her head back and screamed out into the night, \"MINE!\"\n\nThe storm raged outside as darkness took him.\n\n***\n\nThere was light streaming through the window when Tom awoke. The storm, it seemed, had passed.\n\nI'm alive, was his first thought.\n\nShyira lay on his side, their legs entangled. Her breasts pressed into his arm. Her tail wrapped affectionately around his thigh. One of her wings stretched out across him, covering him like a blanket. Between her fever hot body and her leathery wing he felt quite cozy. She looked almost innocent as she slept. Or at least as innocent as a succubus can look.\n\nAs he was looking at her she began to stir. She disengaged their limbs until she was able to look him in the eyes.\n\n\"I may have taken too much,\" she murmured, \"you slept like a rock.\"\n\n\"We never did make it to the bed.\"\n\n\"No, we'll have to rectify that problem at some point,\" she giggled.\n\nTom gave words to what he had been thinking since he woke up, \"You didn't kill me,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't remember telling you I was going to kill you,\" she flicked her tail innocently.\n\nTom thought on the events of the night a moment. No, I suppose she hadn't.\n\n\"I thought you were going to take my soul.\"\n\nShe gave him a look, \"I could have, very easily.\"\n\nTom shivered at the thought, \"Why didn't you?\"\n\nShe once again buried her head into his chest, \"There are many paths through the forest, little mortal. If it was your fate to die you would have wandered until the storm took you. Instead your path led to me,\" she smiled, \"besides, I've taken a liking to you.\"\n\n\"You saved me over that.\"\n\nShe traced the muscles of his chest with her fingers.\n\n\"I could feel you, you know,\" she whispered. \"The moment you stepped foot on this mountain I could feel your presence. I watched you out in the storm last night.\"\n\n\"You watched me? Why?\"\n\n\"You have a spark of talent in you. I felt myself drawn to your aura the moment you stepped onto this mountain. With some training, you and I could do amazing things together. I was already planning on visiting you. If you hadn't found me last night, I would have come to you. \"\n\nTom considered that.\n\n\"What makes you think I want that?\"\n\n\"Oh baby warlock, what makes you think you have a choice? Besides, I told you to be careful of sex and attachments.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I did more than just take your virginity last night...Master.\"\n\nTom's eyes opened very wide at that.\n\n***\n\nBig thanks to mbrow for looking over this story for me. Your time and energy are greatly appreciated. \n\nNot sure if this will be the only adventure of Tom. This story was originally written as a standalone story with an open-ended ending. Although now that my brain is mulling over new ideas it will probably get a sequel at some point.\n\nHope you all enjoyed it. Let me know what you think. "
