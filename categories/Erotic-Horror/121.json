        "Author's Note.\n\nI'd originally intended the story to be a stand alone, but on the urging of Gatorhermit and others I found more for the characters. This is a rough draft. I'm looking for opinions. It hasn't been beaten into submission by my Grammar Dominatrix Mistress Red Pen yet so please forgive my comma abuse. Please let me know what you think of where the story is going. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nAlone. It had never bothered me before. My own company had been my comfort, the only constant in a life in which I had little control. Lonely, I'd never thought myself such. More solitary than lonely. But now, since Roth had left, I was lonely. Desperately lonely. The brief glimpse of belonging he'd shown me had so quickly decimated my solitary resolve.\n\nI was lost with him gone; the thought seemed painfully wedged deep into my very soul. Like the talons of a vicious thorn it stabbed deeper with each breath. Outside the trees had just started to turn, showing the first subtle signs hearkening the start of an early autumn. From my high viewpoint I stared out the water stained window glass at one brown edged leaf, teetering on the edge of a fragile stem, willing it to fall to the ground. \n\nFall.\n\nSo strange to feel such loss.\n\nThis aching. \n\nIt pierced, the missing, hurting so much I was sure that it had physically manifested somehow. Scarred or marked me. I spread my fingers at the center of my chest and pressed into the center of the hurt. I had only known him twelve hours or so. How could it be that without him I was so lost? \n\nAfter The Choosing he had taken me from the Great Hall up to my new lodgings. In his arms I lay as he swept me up spiral stone staircases, through heavy wooden doors his sure step echoing in the lamp lit corridors. He'd placed me on a bed. \n\nGentle. \n\nDeep red velvet coverings beneath my naked skin, soft, but not as soft as his caress of his tongue as he lay sucking kisses down the length of my body. He'd fed me from his hand and I'd fed him, from the curve of my neck. At the memory my fingers flew to the slight mark that remained from his teeth. Five days ago now. Five days with not enough air, not enough warmth, not enough.... Him.\n\nLoss, Echoing loss.\n\nHe'd left the morning after The Choosing. His last words to me, I will return. But when? Where had he gone? Why had he left me?\n\n\"Mistress Chosen, your bath is ready.\"\n\nLooking away from the window I turned to see my maid Hatha at the doorway Her austere black uniform matched her countenance perfectly. She was as starched as the winged black cap that perched upon her head. I stood from the window seat and followed her into the bathing room that adjoined my suite. Inside the small marble lined chamber I lifted my arms and let her strip off my robe. The first time she had tried to undress me I had resisted. I was not used to the touch of others, especially for such intimate tasks. Ignoring my objections as if I had not uttered a word, she stripped me like a disobedient child. Since that moment I had acquiesced to her service of my body. It was easier than the humiliation of the futile struggle. Hatha's will was unyielding and irresistible, like a water shaping stone. Resistance was as futile as the shore line protesting the tide. In time, water and Hatha would always have their way.\n\nI had come to learn that Chosen did not mean liberated. Selection did not entail me to any sort of free will. I was simply subject to a different set of rules under the watchful eye of Roth's servant Hatha rather than Bandar. \n\nShe guided me to the copper bathing tub. A week later I still sighed in pleasure at the sight of the steaming scented water. In the village a full immersion bath had been a weekly privilege. I was not yet used to the luxury of daily bathing.\n\nShe held my arm as I stepped into the tub. I no longer fought her for the wash rag; instead I submissively leant forward and waited for her touch. She cleaned my back first in gentle circles. Oddly it did not bother me to be touched so. Ordinarily I had flinched from such contact, now I arched into it as if asking for more. I sighed and sank back against the molded edge of the tub when Hatha had finished with my back, offering her easy access to my unwashed front. I wanted to again ask her where the Prince had gone but I knew she would not reply. Instead I tried another tactic, starting a conversation in the hope that the information I most craved might slip. \"Tell me please Hatha, tell me of The Chosen.\"\n\nShe paused, her brow furrowing in concentration as if she weighed each word before speaking, \"What do you already know of The Chosen?\"\n\nYet again she answered my question with a question of her own. It was a particular skill of Hatha's that I found most frustrating. \n\n\"Different roles?\" I asked, deliberately adding another question to the mix. I could have answered her, I knew The Chosen were the privileged servants of the Night Masters, the human arm imposing their will. I knew they had specific jobs, specialized tasks but I wanted to hear Hatha's explanation.\n\nHatha's hands moved to my chest, soapy fingers first holding the weight of my breasts and then moving to my puckered nipples. My mind fogged as pleasure seeped warm and intoxicating through my body. \"The Chosen are all special, but in different ways. They all serve a different purpose. Each belongs to a different class.\"\n\nI heard her words but it seemed as if they came through the filter of water. Waves of need rolled over me as her fingers continued to tease the hardened tips of my nipples. \n\n\"Each Chosen has a different role. You had Chosen in your village did you not?\"\n\nHer hands stilled on my breasts for a moment allowing me the thought to answer, \"Yes, she was Nastacia Chosen. An advisor to my Uncle the mayor.\"\n\n\"She would be of the Political Class. They are selected for their skills in negotiation and legislation.\"\n\n\"What other classes of Chosen are there?\"\n\nAgain the hands started to move. This time from the swell of my breasts down my stomach. It was hard to think while nimble fingers danced across slippery skin. I should have asked her to stop, but for some reason the very thought of losing her touch seemed painful. \n\n\"There are Selectors, Performers, Warriors, Artists, Teachers...\"\n\nI interrupted Hatha to whisper, \"And Pleasure.\"\n\n\"Yes and Pleasure.\" A rare smile crossed her Hatha's face. Her square jawed look softening slightly. \"That's what you are my sweet girl. You are of the Pleasure Class.\"\n\n\"I don't think I am.\"\n\nI still questioned that I had been Chosen. Each day I waited for the announcement that they had made a mistake. I wondered if that was why he had left, if perhaps he had found me lacking.\n\nHatha paused her delicious stroking and said, \"Do you not remember what happened in the in the Great Hall when you questioned your status?\"\n\nI nodded, burning with shame to remember the feeling of the brother's hard cock spanking my sex. \n\n\"Perhaps you need further convincing,\" Hatha said plunging her hand deep in the water to cup the aching mound between my legs. She squeezed hard, her fingers slipping inside the sweet entrance while the heel of her hand pushed down on the pubic bone.\n\nShe began to circle her hand, just like she had while soaping my back but this time pressing down upon the need that centered between my wet thighs. Soapy fingers lathered my sex. \"Look at you arch into my hand. Your body knows. Knows what is has been created to do. You have been Chosen because it is your destiny. You will serve freely, give Pleasure gladly because without it you are nothing.\"\n\nI wanted to protest, I'm not nothing. I wanted to ask more questions, why do I feel this way? To know more. But the insistent circling pressure of her hand drove those thoughts from my mind.\n\nAll I thought. All I wanted...was more.\n\nI arched up out of the water, bowing my back and pushing my sex into her hand.\n\n\"The Masters who selected you know. They see all, they see down into your soul. You are made for Pleasure. You are desire. You are wanting. You are coming. Coming now.\" And as if I were but a mere puppet on Hatha's strings I came into her hand, my sex contracting and spurting out my wanton juices. She raised her palm slick with my release and brought it to her mouth. Closing her eyes she licked the palm as if it were ambrosia. \n\nAll thoughts all questions cleared from my mind. All I felt. All I thought was of the ache that centered between my thighs and spread in burning need across my skin. Once was not enough. I splayed my knees, pushing up my bottom into the hand that had stilled between my legs.\n\n\"Wanton,\" she murmured with an enigmatic smile.\n\nI hated her even as my body pleaded for her touch. I hated the need I so desperately craved and the control that had been taken from me. \n\nI did not beg, but I cried\u2014whimpered like an animal in pain as I offered her my swollen sex to use. Abuse. I turned my head away so I could not see her knowing gaze as she brought her hand down to slap at my wet mound. Water sprayed up as her palm met my sex with sharp painful satisfying hits.\n\nMy thighs trembled with the effort of arching up to meet her hand. I pushed up on my feet, the edge of the tub digging into my straining neck as I levered my body out of the water. Closer to the slapping hand. \n\nThe slaps rained down, hard, hurting, fulfilling the need the gentle stroking hand had started. My thighs seized as the orgasm hit. My body jerked rigid as the waves of painful pleasure consumed me, until I was nothing but the pulse of cum that jetted from my sex.\n\nSpent and ashamed I sank into the water letting my head fall back into the cooling liquid. I heard Hatha speaking but I did not raise my head, staying under the water until finally the burn of my lungs made me rise. As my eyes broke the surface I saw her. She stood before me, offering me a towel. I had once thought myself the master of calm fa\u00e7ade, but I had met my match in Hatha. She showed nothing of we had just done. Of what she had just done to me. The only evidence lay in her slightly damp bodice. She stood like a submissive servant despite the way she just mastered me with her hand.\n\nComing quietly behind me she lay the soft towel across my shoulders and then placed her hands under my arms. She lifted me with ease. I could have struggled in protest, I wanted to, but my body was too spent to cooperate with my protesting pride. I came to my feet and allowed her to dress me. Bowing my head I offered her my arms like a compliant infant which she easily threaded into the sleeves of the light blue gown. Over the gown she strapped me into yet another tight corset. This one a dark blue. It pushed my breasts up until they plumped obscenely over the top. I did not protest as she pushed and pulled to create maximum cleavage, even though the sight of the heaving flesh filled me with disgust.\n\nShe sat me down with a push to my shoulder. She brushed my hair pulling it into a tight band and then weaving it into a long plait that she curled and pinned on my head. \n\nI did nothing. Said nothing. Hating myself the whole time.\n\nAs soon as she left I released my hair, ripping it free of the tight band. Pins sprayed hitting the floor in a shower of sound. I paced. Striding back and forth until I felt I might explode. My chest fired with unspent fury.\n\nI had to do something.\n\nI opened the door to see the same two guards that had shadowed me since Roth's departure. I glared, they bowed and refused to meet my eyes. \n\n\"Stay where you are,\" I ordered replicating the memory of my cousin Bandar's snapping commands.\n\nI strode off down the corridor. Their footfalls sounding heavily behind me. I picked up the pace, glancing over my shoulder to see them do the same. I ran. My light clothes and slender form escaped them with surprising ease. Weighed down by their heavy armor and weaponry they struggled to keep up with me. I darted through the corridors. Not sure where I was going. Anywhere. Just away. Away from them. From Hatha.\n\nThe Palace was a labyrinth of corridors and with no purpose I just took the first I saw. Up stairs. Down stairs. Left then right, then left again I ran until my lungs burned with the effort. It felt good to hurt with something other than the constant missing of him. \n\nI rested against a wall, panting with my cheek pressed to the cool stone. Voices came from behind, they didn't sound like the guard but still I did not want to be caught by anyone. I went from door to door testing each handle until I found one unlocked. I fell inside the door closing it fast and resting my forehead against the wood. I turned fell back and deliberately let my head hit the wood with a thunk.\n\nWhat now?\n\nAs I closed my eyes and pondered the thought I heard soft laughter. I jerked upright and opened my eyes. \n\n\"You escaped.\"\n\nAt the window seat was a man. Long blonde hair moved in the breeze of the open window. My hair was blonde, but nowhere near the shade of this stunning man. He stood and my mouth fell open. Framed by the soft light of the window he seemed almost ethereal. A vision. He was tall, broad shouldered, lean rather than big and oh so beautiful. As he stepped closer I realized he was silver haired rather than blonde. \n\nTransfixed by the hair my hand moved without conscious thought. Just before I touched him I realized what I was doing and withdrew it with a jerk.\n\n\"You can touch me,\" he murmured. A voice like Roth's, dark and sweet like rich bitter chocolate. His big hand encircled my wrist drawing my hand back up to his hair. \n\n\"Please,\" he said and removed his hand as if to give me the choice. That and his gentle plea made my decision. I splayed my fingers and drew them through the soft strands. Silken silver draped over my forearm as I brushed my hand through his long hair. I shivered in delight at the feeling.\n\nHe sighed, a slight sound of pure pleasure than made me look from his beautiful hair to his face. His eyes were closed, his lashes lay deep silver on his face. I wanted to touch them too. I released his hair and stroked my fingers across his cheek. He did not move, allowing me free access to his face with a trust that was intoxicating. I ran a thumb across the sharp edge of the cheek bone before bringing it up to smooth down his closed eye and across the silken lashes.\n\nHe sighed again. The sound shot through me in a flash of heat.\n\n\"You smell just as I knew you would. Incredible.\" He breathed in deep and leaned in closer.\n\n\"You know who I am?\" I asked, surprised.\n\nHis eyes flashed open. Smoky blue irises circled in silver. \"Of course. Roth's Chosen, Roth's prisoner.\"\n\nAnger coursed quick and violent through me that he would dare criticize my Dark Prince. \"Prisoner? I am here! Am I not?\"\n\nHe did not laugh but amusement shone in his eyes. \"Ahh, but to get here you escaped your guard. Did you not?\"\n\nI did not answer him instead asking curtly, \"Who are you?\"\n\nHe stepped back and swept into an elegant bow. \"I am your friend Mistress Talia.\"\n\n\"My friends have names,\" I said, still angry at him for calling me Roth's prisoner.\n\n\"Do you wish to know my name Mistress Talia? If you demand it, know that it comes at great cost.\"\n\n\"Cost?\"\n\n\"The wrath of the Dark Prince.\"\n\n\"Roth does not want me to know you?\" My tone softened as curiosity overcame anger.\n\nHe stepped forward again, sandwiching me to the door without contact. The heat of his body seemed to pulse over my skin leaving me yearning for his touch. \"Do you think perhaps Mistress Talia that your Roth does not wish you to know not just me but anyone?\"\n\nI opened my mouth to protest but no words came.\n\n\"He keeps you locked in the tower does he not?\"\n\n\"He is my Master,\" I whispered.\n\n\"I doubt you have any Master.\"\n\nHe brought his head down; his silken hair fell over my exposed cleavage. His mouth came close to the curve of my neck, at my pulse, but did not touch. I bowed my back, offering him my neck as I had Roth. I wanted him to bite me, pierce my skin, let my blood flow hot.\n\nHe did nothing other than breathe on my skin. The bite I craved did not come. I looked up at him and saw eyes shining black.\n\nHe was a Night Master. \n\nHis teeth had extended. He was old enough to bite, but not as old as Roth. I shivered, goose pimples shot across my skin. He raised a hand to run a tip across the sensitive bumps.\n\nFrom behind the door came rough shouts and loud footsteps.\n\n\"They search for you now Mistress Talia. You should go.\" He pressed into my hand folded foolscap. I looked down.\n\n\"Read it later,\" he said as he stepped back. \n\nI pressed the folded paper between my skin and the tight corset. He watched the movement with hungry eyes. \n\n\"Go,\" he said, his voice rough and low.\n\nI brought my hand to the handle of the door started to turn it and paused. I looked over my shoulder. He'd gone back to sit at the window. \"Will I see you again?\" I called softly.\n\nHe smiled, \"I hope so Mistress.\"\n\nI opened the door and almost fell straight into the arms of my angry guard. I did not flinch from the guardsman's fury instead with haughty intent I commanded him to return me to my suite. As I followed the guard through winding corridors back to my chambers I realized I still did not know the Silver Master's name.\n\nI waited for some time before I fished the paper from my corset. I did not know if they would take it from me but I felt that my guard and Hatha should not know what had happened. \n\nThe foolscap was half covered in a long line of ink drawings. Symbols. Some seemed to be flowers or vines, others like an ancient language.\n\nLooping writing ran along the line of ink figures. It said, \"Paint this on your left forearm. Copy the symbols exactly. Practice before marking your skin. They must match. You will be able to freely move about the Palace with this marking. Find the library, seek the key. You will find your answers.\"\n\nAnswers. Yes, I wanted answers.\n\n* * * *\n\nIt was two days before I tried the symbols. Two more days before I had perfected them enough to attempt them on my skin. Hatha had given me the ink and paper without complaint or questions. I had feared asking. I told her that I wanted to write to my sister. At her easy answer I wondered if my fear came not of any truth but only because of the honeyed words of the Silver Master. Fear of his agenda made me uncertain of trying the symbols. In the end curiosity and boredom won over fear. I needed to do something other than wait for Roth. The more I waited the more I yearned. Hatha's daily bathing torture was wearing on my very soul. I both craved and feared her hand upon my sex. The orgasms that came with her vicious slaps were mere shadows of my time with Roth. I needed more. With each passing hour in the tower away from my Master I felt more prisoner than Chosen. \n\nI painted the symbols down my forearm after Hatha had finished my morning bath and departed. I knew I would not see her again until the afternoon. If I was going to explore the time had to be now. \n\nAt the first symbol my skin began to tingle. By the time I had finished my sex was wet and my nipples had beaded into tight aching points. I did not question the power of what I had written on my arm, I felt it throb through my body, but I did wonder how it was to allow me to leave the room.\n\nI opened the door to see my guard snap to attention. I stepped out into the corridor to hear their steady footfalls follow. So much for allowing me to leave, I thought with a sorrowful sigh. I turned back to the guards, \"Please,\" I said, \"Return to your posts and leave me be.\"\n\nTo my surprise they did. They turned on their heels and marched back into place at my door. I stood open mouthed. Were they under my command? Under the command of the symbols?",
        "I needed to know. On unsure feet I stepped back to stand before them. \"Put your hands on your heads,\" I said, issuing the first command that came to mind.\n\nBoth guards dropped their weapons and placed their hands on their heads. \"Jump,\" I said and watched in open mouthed wonder as they did their armor clanging as their feet hit the ground.\n\n\"As you were,\" I ordered and they retrieved their weapons and stood to attention. \"You will stay here until I say otherwise. You will tell anyone who comes that Talia Chosen is sleeping and does not wish to be disturbed. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mistress Chosen,\" they chanted in unison.\n\nI turned away and walked down the hall looking back twice before I turned the corner each time half expecting the guard to come running after me. They didn't and the sense of freedom that overwhelmed me made me forget the purpose for my outing. The library. I didn't know how to get there.\n\nI walked the halls for some time, trying open doors to no luck. Empty chambers seemed to abound. I came across a chamber maid in one room she looked up at me in shock. She squealed and placed a hand across her mouth.\n\n\"Do not fear,\" I said. \n\n\"Yes Mistress,\" she said in a dull monotone.\n\n\"You will take me to the library. You will return here to your work and forget that you saw me.\"\n\n\"Yes Mistress.\"\n\nThe young chambermaid walked at a break neck pace I had to half run to keep up with her. By the time she left me at the library door I was panting. I opened the heavy wooden door halfway and peered inside. Floor to ceiling bookshelves lined the walls. An elderly man looked up in shock as I entered. His face lined deep had been well weathered by time. His head had one tuft of grey hair, it stood up as if it had been planted. He was seated at a grand desk, surrounded by dusty tomes. He appeared to transcribing something, he had a quill in his ink smeared hand. \"You should not be here Mistress Chosen,\" he spluttered.\n\nI raised a hand to stop him, \"You do not see me. You will walk now to the books that tell of secrets of The Chosen you will return to your work and forget that you saw me.\"\n\nHe got up from his desk and started off down the back of the room. He moved fast, the little sapling of grey hair wobbling from side to side as he walked. I followed him through three archways and then turned into what appeared to be a dead end alcove. He looked behind straight through me and then left and right. He reached up to the third shelf and pulled on a black book. The shelf turned with a grinding of gears and opened as if a door. He went inside and I followed. The room was lamp lit; it had no windows and no door. I was concerned for a moment how I would exit experiencing a moment of panic that I might become trapped when the elderly man turned pulled on the lamp nearest the shelf through which we entered and it opened again. He left. To return to his desk no doubt to forget he had seen me. I looked down at the symbols on my arm slick black on pale skin and marveled once more at their mysterious power.\n\nI turned, spun in a circle and took in the room I had sought. Now what?\n\nI was frowning, wondering how I was to find anything in the dusty piles of books and packed shelves when I heard a familiar chuckle. He was here. I turned to the sound and saw him seated on a leather wingback chair in a darkened corner. I couldn't see his face but the silver glow of his hair made it obvious who it was.\n\nI moved towards him, keeping my arm bent the symbols facing him like some kind of shield. \"You will tell me your name,\" I commanded when I stood before him.\n\nHe laughed again. \"Will I now?\" he murmured, reaching forward and wrapping an arm behind my knees he pulled me off balance and into his lap. I fell easily my rump landing on his powerful thighs. He held me firm at my waist, his big hands spread wide at my hips.\n\n\"The symbols do not work on you,\" I said quite obviously.\n\n\"But they do on humans,\" he replied as he reached up and tucked an errant lock of curling hair behind my ear, \"Which answers some of my questions about you.\"\n\n\"What questions.\"\n\n\"You are more than you seem.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" I whispered, afraid what he said was true. He tucked his large hand behind my head and guided it down to rest on his shoulder. I should have resisted but instead I found myself sinking into his chest, desperate for the comfort he offered even as I remained uncertain of his motives. The moment of peace nestled on his chest was exactly what I needed. \n\nHow did he know?\n\n\"Can all Chosen command with these symbols?' I asked my mouth moving against the warmth of his chest.\n\n\"No,\" his answer rumbled against my ear.\n\nI sat up, meeting his silver blue stare. \"What am I?\" I asked.\n\n\"More than Chosen,\" he answered cryptically.\n\n\"Does Roth know?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHis hand reached up again, this time pulling my hair back to expose my neck. He stared hungrily at the frightened pulse in my neck. His eyes slid into black and I knew he wanted me, wanted my blood. Even as I was frightened, even as I feared his bite I wanted it too. I tilted my head and stroked a finger across the beating pulse he watched.\n\n\"You want me,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered the hunger obvious in his rasp.\n\n\"You want to taste me.\"\n\n\"Bite,\" he said, \"Suck. Consume.\"\n\nEach word pulsed heat in my sex as if he stroked my very center.\n\n\"Is that different to taste?\" I asked.\n\nHe nodded. His hands had moved from my body to grip the arms of the chair. He lacked control. I knew I tempted him but I could not stop. I did not want to stop until I felt the skin break at his fangs and his mouth suck on my vein.\n\n\"Do it,\" I said, leaning forward and offering him my neck, \"Take me.\"\n\n\"You know not what you ask,\" he said through clenched teeth. I could see his fangs. They extended over his lip, the grinding pressure had made a cut, a sliver of blood stained his mouth.\n\nI wanted to taste it. I leaned in, brought my tongue to the red stain of blood and lapped his mouth clean. He growled. An inhuman sound. His mouth opened wide and for a moment I thought he meant to take me but he did not instead he pushed me from his lap to the floor.\n\n\"Don't,\" he said as I moved to stand.\n\nI stayed at his feet. The bulge of his desire just above my eyes. I came up on my knees to see him better. The laces of his breeches strained from the erection contained. I wanted it. I wanted him. To be pierced by his cock, his fangs. Taken. He saw where my eyes had fixed and growled again.\n\n\"You tempt me,\" he said with a bitter laugh, \"How you tempt me.\"\n\n\"Is that a bad thing,\" I asked.\n\nHe laughed again. \"I cannot take you until you know.\"\n\n\"Know what?\" I cared for nothing other than the incessant beat of my desire. I could not think while it burned so.\n\n\"You must have a clear mind. You must understand.\"\n\n\"How can I think when I feel like this?\" I cried, \"I too want to know but all I feel is the beat of this.\" I cupped my sex in a lewd action that shamed me as I did it.\n\n\"You have servants do you not? They must offer you release,\" The Silver Master rasped.\n\n\"Not enough,\" I whimpered, \"It's never enough.\"\n\n\"You miss the bite.\"\n\nAs he spoke I realized that I had moved my hand up to stroke the faint marks where Roth had last taken me. \"Yes, I miss the bite.\"\n\nMissing was too small a word. Did the starving merely miss food? The drowning miss air? Burning heat and cold flashed across my skin. Anger and lust swirled within clenching my womb.\n\nWant. Want. Want.\n\nNadar's eyes remained fixed on my neck. He laughed, a bitter sound. \"I cannot give you the bite you seek. I have vows that I cannot break. Not even for the desire I have for you.\"\n\nI didn't understand what he meant, what vows? All I knew, all I felt was centered in the all consuming need pulsing between my legs. \n\nHe gripped the arms of the chair. Long fingers curved around the ornate carved wood. He was holding himself still. Holding himself back, from me.\n\nI stepped forward. He pulled back, pushing further into the chair. \n\n\"No,\" he said, voice as thick as winter cold molasses.\n\nI pulled at my gown, teasingly raising it to swirl around my calves.\n\n\"No,\" he said once more, but did nothing to stop me.\n\nHis eyes fixed upon the slow rise of my skirts. When cool air hit my bared thighs I heard him groan in appreciation of my lack of drawers. \"You do not have to take the neck,\" I said angling the plump smooth vein of my inner thigh toward him.\n\n\"Talia,\" my name issued forth like a hissed plea for mercy.\n\nI came forward, a woman possessed. No longer Talia of Hawthorne Shire, no longer the Chosen, nothing other than the need that throbbed within. It would not be denied.\n\nI spread my legs. Both hands gripping the folds of my skirt high at my hips I came up on his chair. On my knees I straddled him. Over his tensed thighs. Rigid, he sat, his only movement the rasping rise and fall of his chest. Letting the soft folds of my skirt fall over us I slowly slid my hands up his body, over the hard tense plane of his stomach, up his chest. My thumbs brushed his nipples. He gasped but still did not move. \n\nWhen my hands finally came to rest at his shoulders I leant in, draping my hair to one side I offered him the curve of my neck. Still he did not move. I shifted closer until the pulse at the base of my neck rested on his lips.\n\n\"Take,\" I said. Not pleading, but issuing a husky command.\n\n\"No!\" he rasped, his fangs grazing my skin as he spoke.\n\nIt was so fast. So rapid that I had not time to think. His hands came to my hips pushing back and lifting all at once. He spun me around, my back to his chest my skirt rucked high. He brought his fingers to my nipple and one hand to rest at my bared sex all within the space of an intake of breath.\n\nRough he pulled me back until I pressed tight against his body. He shifted me as easily as if I were a child. My leg he forced to move until I straddled his right thigh. The hard ridge of his erection pushed into my buttock. I rolled my hips into it and heard his gasping response. The fingers at my chest gripped the edge of my corset yanking it down until it sat under my breasts, forcing out the plump curves. My nipples poked through the thin chemise. His fingers came to brutally twist one and I moaned in satisfaction at the pain.\n\n\"Yes. Yes,\" he murmured in my ear, \"That's what you need.\" The sound vibrating in my ear. I was wet, shamefully wet. My sex slick and swollen I rocked forward until it pressed into the ridge of his leg muscle.\n\nHis long fingers brushed the front of my sex. I rocked back to give him room to push inside but he did not. He pushed me forward and brought up his knee until my wet slit rode his thigh. \n\n\"Take it,\" he said, \"Take what you need.\"\n\nI did. I pushed into him, riding his thigh like a wanton. The soft brushed leather of his breeches slicked wet with my desire. I rocked my hips, forward and then in undulating circles. It built. Clenching heat, delicious surging pleasure claimed me with each rock of my hips. I pushed down mounting him hard. The feeling swept over me. Cascading in shimmering waves of rolling heat. My skin burned, tight and hot as if I were roasting with pleasure. More, more I wanted, needed more. I whimpered. Rocking my hips against his leg. I cried. Desperate, needy shameful sounds of wanting.\n\nNot enough. Not enough.\n\n\"I know,\" he murmured, \"I know what you need.\"\n\nThe feeling built. Built, higher, harder, clenching tight, my thighs rigid ready for the coming release. I released my hold falling into the pleasure, hoping that it would be more than I had had with Hatha. Hoping that the Silver Haired Master could finally give me the release I craved.\n\nAs the orgasm hit he cut me. At the beat of my pulse at the base of my neck his sharpened thumb nail popped through the skin and a hot trickle of blood trailed down my taut skin. The pain, the blood, it gave me my release and I shattered into another orgasm. I fell back against him, his nail pushing deeper, further into my skin. I wanted his mouth. I needed his mouth.\n\n\"Take it,\" I whimpered breathlessly, \"Take it please.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said his voice shaking with dark need, \"I can't....I can't...\"\n\nI twisted in his hold until I could reach a hand up to his hair. I pulled hard on the silver mane, bringing his head down to my neck and forcing his mouth to the stream of blood.\n\n\"Take, taste,\" I commanded and I felt my arm glow hot with power where the symbols lay.\n\nHe did not suck, but his tongue came forth hot to lap at the trickle of blood. He groaned. The sound vibrated the room. The lamps on the walls flickered on and off again. The shelves rattled as he fed from the stream of blood.\n\nI held him there, willing him to suck but he did not. He pulled back, shoving me forward as he did. I hit the floor, sprawled on my knees. He looked down at me, his mouth smeared with my blood, his eyes glowing black rimmed with silver.\n\n\"What have I done?\" he whispered as he looked down at me with shock. He wiped his mouth with his hand and then looked down at the red stained skin.\n\n\"You did not bite,\" I said to him hoping to appease the horror in his eyes. \n\n\"I must go,\" he said.\n\n\"Please, wait, what should I read. What should I know? I have so many questions.\"\n\nHe did not answer me instead he pulled at the lamp opener and left me there, on the floor still on my knees. \n\nAfter he had gone I waited for him to return. I sat on the floor hoping that he would come back to me. But he didn't. I pulled myself up on shaky legs to sit in the chair that I had first found him in. On it lay a book. Black leather bound with a silver key embossed on the cover.\n\nFind the key.\n\nI should have been glad to find what I sought. But I did not. I felt bereft. Empty. I cried. Wept for what had happened. For what I did not understand. I looked down at the symbols on my arm. I wanted to scrub them clean. Wipe away what had happened but I did not. I had to still control my guards I needed and resented the symbols upon my skin. I cleaned myself up as best I could smoothing my hair and righting my clothes. I snuck past the elderly man and back to my chambers with great ease. My guards were as I left them with one simple command they let me enter and went back to their posts with no memory.\n\nHow I wished I could do the same. I scrubbed my arm until the skin looked red and raw. Erasing at least that. I threw the book under my bed. I heard it slide along the floor and hit the wall with a thump. I was on my bed weeping when the door opened. Hatha looked down at me and shook her head. \"Dry your eyes Mistress. He has returned.\n\nRoth. \n\nMy heart both sang and sank with that one word.\n\n----------------------------\n\nA big thanks has to go to Pacofear and Gatorhermit for their suggestions. That rat bastard Pacofear came up with better words than me. Twice. So here I offer the resentful thanks I promised.\n\nLet me know what you think and please click the stars, it makes me ever so happy when you do.\n\ndarcysweet "
