        "Hey, Everyone. You've noticed by now that posting my stories have become infrequent of late. I'm a college undergrad, so I don't get to post like I used to. But even though I get called away by classes and stuff, I will finish this story. I plan for this story to last probably for a good year. When I have time I will try to write more than one chapter a week. Check my Author's page for updates. If you email me also, I'll keep you updated about if I submitted the new chapter as well. This chapter is about how Lily looks because I didn't give much of a body description for her. Remember to comment/rate/message. Thanks -BlessingAndCurse \n\n***** \n\nQuestions. Questions. And more questions. When we think we have found the answer to this mind boggling question and believe without a doubt that we now fully understand, the query rises again as if resurrected from the deepest recesses of the mind to remind us that finding the answer is never so simple. That we have only made one little step on the path towards the answer. And an even longer road to understanding. It is only the beginning. \n\nThe moment when Nicholas breathed no louder than a whisper of the meaning of her name did Lily's whole foundation of understanding of Nicholas all reduced to rubble. Her whole body became rigid from the inner turmoil that was happening inside her. Her stiff, unmoving hands that she had not realized were wrapped around his back, gripped him in a tight hold in order to keep her supported. The pulse that had quickened in such excitement when laved with his hot tongue now raced with absolute fear of what she was. She was wrong \n\nThe question that she had thought she had put to rest emerged to the forefront of her mind. The simple question had now turned into the most foreboding question to consume her thoughts. \n\nWho was Nicholas Yates? \n\nLily continued to hold on to him. At this moment, she didn't know who she held in her hands. Neither did she want to find out. But there was no way to pull away from him without looking at his face. His body was lodged between her legs and his hands gripped her thighs. The only way for her to get out was if he moved first. \n\nBut he had no intention of moving. His head stayed near her ear, unwavering from that spot. As if he was demanding that she move her head back to look at him. One thing was for sure -he wasn't going to move. \n\nOnce Lily realized this, she hung even closer to his body. She didn't want to know who he was. Because if she looked, the rubble would then reduce to ashes reducing her mind to utter destruction. Nothing left could be salvaged. She would have to start all over to find the truth. \n\nShe felt his mouth pull into a grin against her ear and could hear the faintest chuckle. The utter turmoil of her mind must have amused him. She was prolonging the inevitable. \n\nLily closed her eyes and took a deep breath before she pressed against his chest to lean back and look at him. When she opened her eyes, she found that his curly black hair was blocking his eyes. 'Why must life play with me like this,' she thought exasperated and defeated. 'I just want it over with already.' \n\nShe raised her hands and divided the curtain of black hair out of his sight. Peering into her eyes with the same intensity were those red luminous eyes that commanded her into attention every night. But in present day light, their luminosity was no more than a glimmer. His lips were arranged in a sly smile, happy for some reason. \"Now you know.\" \n\nLily swallowed a large lump in her throat. She opened her mouth to speak, but all she let out was a ragged breath. Every part of her breathing system seemed like it did not want to work. Her tongue was paralyzed into silence. Her lungs felt as if there was not enough oxygen to breathe. Her very throat felt like it was closing up. \n\nHe guided his hand to her face and caressed the back of his hand against the side of her cheek which sent goose bumps down her body. The smile never left his face. \"Aren't you glad to see me?\" \n\nLily pressed her hand firmly into the center of her chest and looked away from his eyes as she fought to regain her breath. As she began to take increasingly more languid breaths, her voice was no more than a squeak as she said, \"Why are you here?\" \n\nHe leaned closer to her to a point where his lips were a breath away from kissing her. His red eyes captivating her in place as he said simply, \"I just wanted to show you that you are desired.\" \n\n\"I-I-I get that.\" Lily inhaled another shaky breath. \"I mean why are YOU here right now?! It's not night.\" \n\n\"You think that my comings and goings are dictated simply by the time of day?\" He pulled his head away and gave her a pitiful look. \"I come whenever I please. The mind is weak therefore the body is always willing to accept me. I just choose to make myself known at night. I make myself...a bit dramatic.\" \n\n\"So... I'm so confused. What does this all mean?\" \n\n\"What do you think it means?\" he countered. \n\nLily slumped back in the sink aggravated about this whole guessing game. What does this mean? What does that mean? She managed to answer one question while she was here, but that whole theory crumbled and burned up in flames in a week! Why couldn't someone just tell her what was going on?! She looked back at him and folded her arms, unwilling to play along with this game any further. She had made all these steps toward the truth. It was someone else's turn. \n\n\"Come on, Lily...\" he said. \"What does this all mean?\" When his only answer was a defiant stare, he looked at her in boredom. \"If you expect me to give you all the answers, you are sadly mistaken. You and I both know you're not stupid as you so often claim to be. What does me being here mean?\" \n\nLily looked at him as she mulled it over in her head. She knew the answer, but she knew good and well it wasn't the answer that would answer her main question. \"I know what it means...It just doesn't answer the question that I want.\" \n\n\"Sometimes, the answers to the questions that we want can be found by answering the smaller questions that we need. Now tell me.\" His hand reached up and held her chin in between his index finger and thumb. \"Tell me, and I will let you know if you are on the right track.\" \n\nLily stared at him hard with her lips pursed. \"It means you can take control of Nicholas's body whenever you want.\" \n\n\"Yes...\" he crooned with a satisfied smile. \"Like I've been doing ever since you've been here. Even during the day, without you knowing.\" \n\nLily's eyes popped open with shock. Since when?! This was the first time she ever noticed the Spirit during the day, and it was only because of the red eyes. All she remembered seeing was Nicholas's gray lazy eyes. \"Ho-\" \n\n\"Oh come now. Like it's really that hard to do it without your knowing.\" He rolled his eyes at her as if this was some common knowledge. \"I've possessed this body for the last twenty-three years. I know his mannerisms and such to go about impersonating him. I'm able to control him without other people knowing. But you've noticed when I'm in control and when I'm not. You said so yourself. Think about what you said when you visited Nicholas at work.\" \n\nLily frowned as she looked at him confused. She said it? She said nothing about the Spirit being in control. All she remembered was Nicholas getting into a hissy fit when she asked about the Spirit. And how he got pissed at her when she questioned his changing ...That was it. \n\n\"His moods change when you take control.\" \n\n\"Precisely.\" He said with a wide grin. \"I love watching your face while you're in deep thought, pure one. It's so cute.\" He caught her off guard as he leaned his face towards her and gave her a small kiss while gripping her thighs, pressing her body against his. \n\nUnlike other times, Lily was too weirded out to get any pleasure from it. She let out a muffled sound of protest while kicking her legs frantically but it came to no avail. It actually spurred him on to deepen the kiss further. \"Fighting.. .will do you...no good,\" he said in between kisses. \"All you're doing...is turning me on.\" To emphasize his point, he grabbed her hips tightly and pushed her body into his hardened member. When she made contact with her first touch of...it, Lily began making loud squeaking noises against his lips as she twisted her body furiously to get free. The further struggling only caused a low rumble of laughter to escape from his throat. \n\nNot being able to take anymore, he released his mouth from hers as he continued to laugh while clutching his middle. Lily dragged her forearm across her mouth to rub away all traces of the taste of his lips. Seeing her do this caused him only to laugh harder, making him double over. Lily's face burned with embarrassment and anger as she glared at him. \"You sadistic bastard!\" she gritted out through her teeth. \n\n\"You weren't calling me that earlier when I first kissed you,\" he said before wiping the tears from his eyes. \n\n\"That's because I thought that...\"Lily clamped her mouth shut before she said anything else. Whatever she told the Spirit, Nicholas would know as well. \n\n'Be careful, Lily. Think about what you say before you go running your mouth.' She tried searching for the correct words to say, but none of them were able to give an explanation without confessing her attraction to Nicholas. Confessing this nonsense was foolish anyway. It was best to just remain...well acquaintances, because they definitely weren't friends. \n\n\"You've become quiet,\" he said bringing her out of her thoughts. His face was back to the usual intense authoritative demeanor. He stared straight into her eyes, not breaking contact for a second \"You stopped right in the middle of your sentence at that. What were you about to say?\" \n\n\"I was about to say...that I thought that if I didn't comply...you would play more of your horrible tricks on me.\" Lily said. \"That's the only reason why I let you kiss me.\" \n\n\"If your definition of letting someone do something is kicking and screaming whilst there doing it, then I believe your definition is screwed. And what makes you think I was talking about this time? Or any kiss we had today?\" \n\nLily's eyes widened. \"But you did only kiss me today.\" The statement came out more as a question than a fact. The luminous red eyes only gazed back at her, giving no sign that this statement was either correct or not. The intensity of his eyes grew as he stepped closer towards her. He encircled his arms around her, and ever so lightly grazed his hands over her back. The touch sent shivers up her body. She looked away from his eyes and down at her lap. \"You only kissed me t-\" \n\n\"Think about it for a moment, Lily,\" he interrupted. His fingers grasped her chin and pulled her head up to gaze into those burning eyes. \"Think about every time you were in an intense physical circumstance with Nicholas. Think about the night he cornered you when you walked out of the bathroom. Think about the how he was so close to you that you couldn't escape his hold.\" Lily's mind began to drift as she recounted that night. His body was so hot and near that it felt like she was suffocating. She hadn't had much experience with boys so her body felt like it was in shock that she was feeling this powerful attraction. His hands were molded against her body as he maneuvered his hands wherever he liked. \n\n\"Think about that day when he had stolen your first kiss and how it had been so passionate and deep that it was almost the equivalency of making love. Both experiences giving you intense passion\" The last few words he uttered came out as a whisper that ghosted across her face, causing goose bumps to raise across her skin. This experience as well caused her body to grow warm as she thought of his talented tongue caressing hers. \n\n\"Now think of the intense encounters that we have had.\" He said putting all the stress in 'we'. Lily felt his hand underneath her chin once again. \"Open your eyes, pure one. I want you to look into my eyes when I say this.\" Lily felt her face grow hot as she opened her eyes. She had no recollection that they were even closed in the first place. A small smirk came across his face before he continued to paint further images into her head. \"Remember when you had angered me and I dragged you from your bed by your ankles as you screamed and begged for mercy. How about the time you swore that I was about to plunge my knife into your chest when-\" \n\n\"Please stop...\" Lily interrupted. \"I get it. Every time I've encountered you, you scare the crap out of me.\" \n\n\"Precisely. Believe it or not, the sexual encounters you've had with Nicholas share a similarity with the frightening encounters with me.\" \n\nLily looked at him as if he was insane. How the hell could experiencing attraction be linked with being scared nearly half to death by a sadistic spirit? And above all what does this all have to do with establishing when he kissed her first? Now that she thought of it, why the hell did it even matter? She had other things to worry about then thinking about when the spirit first kissed her. \n\nA knock on the bathroom door took her out of her thoughts. Lily tried to look around \"Nicholas\", but she couldn't see who it was. But when she actually thought about it, did she really want whoever it is to see her with her legs draped over this guy's hips? \n\n\"Um...Lily?\" \n\n'Oh...shit.' It was Vanessa! She forgot she promised to go shopping with her to get some clothes for the party tomorrow. \n\nAn awkward silence reverberated throughout the room. The longer it lasted, the more heat Lily felt emanating from her body. Even though she couldn't see Vanessa's face, she knew good and well that her friend was staring at her with her jaw on the floor. \n\n\"Um...you seem...busy. Do you want me to come back later?\" \n\nBefore she could say anything, he moved his body from in between her legs and gave Vanessa a devious smile. \"It's OK. We weren't doing nothing anyway. Even though cowgirl over here has been trying to ride my dick since day one.\" \n\n'NICHOLAS!'Lily screamed in her head. Lily lifted her hand and gave him a loud smack across the back of his head. Nicholas groaned as he turned around to glare at Lily while grabbing the back of his head. \n\n\"What the crap?! It's true!\" he yelled, glaring at her with his blazing gray eyes. \n\n'Yep, this is Nicholas. Only asshole I know who doesn't care about the shit that comes out of his mouth.' \n\n\"I checked his heart beat because compared to him, I might as well be a midget,\" Lily remarked as she tried to lift her body out of the sink. She strained her body forward, but her pants were snagged on the faucet. Lily silently cursed as she tried harder to get herself unhooked by leaning her body forward. Could this day get any more embarrassing? First she slit her finger, got caught checking out the knife by Nicholas, got caught by Vanessa with possessed Nicholas in between her legs, then real Nicholas chose to be an asshole, and now she can't get her ass out of the sink. Some day this turned out to be. \n\nShe felt a firm hand on her ass as she felt a tug on her pants. \"You are so accident prone. Who gets their ass stuck in a sink?\" \n\n\"Thick chicks,\" Vanessa said with her hands on her hips, daring Nicholas to say just one thing about thick girls. \n\n\"Well...she's definitely thick. In a good way.\" He hurriedly said the last part as he noticed Vanessa beginning to glare at him.\"Like...shit...she has curves in the right places like boobs, hips, and ass. She doesn't have the smallest waist-\" \n\n\"Excuse me?\" Lily said, turning around to glare at him. \n\n\"No! I mean you're not fat. You're in the middle. It's in between.\" Both girls silently glared at him. Nicholas let out a loud sigh as he continued to work Lily's pants from the faucet. \"It's small enough where it shows off your curves, but it's also soft and feminine and not all toned and hard, if that makes any sense.\" \n\nThe room filled again with an awkward silence as he continued to try and pull her pants off the faucet. After a few minutes, Nicholas let out an audible \"Thank God\" when he finally freed her pants. \n\nLily jumped off the sink and made a straight bee-line out the bathroom to go get her purse. With Vanessa right behind her, she turned to walk out the bedroom. But of course, Nicholas had to have the last smart ass remark. \"What? No \"you're welcome, Nicholas\"?\" she heard him yell behind her. \n\nLily stopped in her tracks to look back at him. He had that mischievous perverted smile he usually had on when he was about to say something really smart assed. Part of her wanted to walk right out the door, but the other part just had to ask. She rolled her eyes and said, \"Don't you mean \"thank you\".\" \n\n\"No.\" Nicholas crossed his arms and leaned his hips against the sink. \"You're welcome, Nicholas for giving you a peek at my ass,\" he s said, mocking Lily's voice before giving her his full blown shit eating grin. \n\n\"Screw you Nicholas!\" \n\n\"You came close to a few minutes ago!\" \n\nWith a frustrated groan, Lily slammed the door behind her and Vanessa. As she walked away, she swore she heard laughing behind the door. \n\n~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~ \n\n\"Well...that was...awkward.\" \n\nLily let out a sigh as she walked with Vanessa into the mall. 'Thanks, Vanessa, for stating the obvious.' \n\n\"Are you sure you aren't interested in him, hon? Because ya'll looked as if ya'll were about to go at it like rabbits.\" \n\n\"No. Not even close. I am TOTALLY sure that I don't want him.\" Lily turned to look at Vanessa to see that she was giving Lily a look that said she didn't believe any of that. \n\n\"Then how did you allow him to get so close?\" \n\n\"He was bandaging my finger.\" She held up her right hand and sported her bandage wrapped index finger. Vanessa still gave her a doubtful look. \n\n\"So...let me get this straight. In order for him to bandage your finger, he has to basically grind you. And when you check his heart beat, you have to straddle his lap like he's a bronco.\" Vanessa sucked her teeth as she continued to think about it. \"Sorry, cowgirl, but that don't make no sense.\" \n\n\"Not you too,\" Lily groaned as they went into the department store. \"Can we just not talk about him, please?\" \n\n\"OK... I'll let it fly this time.\" \n\n'Thannk God.' Lily looked over the store they entered into to see if she liked anything at first glance. The place definitely had a club kind of vibe to it. The walls were a darkish purple that were illuminated by various bright colored lights. In the background she heard Anaconda by Nicki Minaj playing as the shoppers looked around. She guessed that this would be played at a party. Lily didn't get out at all. She only went to three places, and that was home, work, and the grocery store. Even in high school, she refused to go to any social functions, dances or parties. Hell, she didn't even go to prom. She spent that night in her bed reading a romance novel. \n\nVanessa looked beyond excited to go shopping as she hurried over to the first rack of clothes. Lily walked over, completely at a loss to look for. The dress that Vanessa was looking at had to be the shortest dress Lily had ever seen in her whole entire life. It was a dress that looked like it barely came down past a person's hips, let alone their thighs. It had a sparkly gold bodice that looked like it could mold to any form, showing all of a woman's curves. \n\n\"Who are you getting dressed for at the party?\" Lily said quirking her eyebrow. Vanessa stuck her tongue out at Lily as she draped the dress over her arm. \n\n\"I just want to look cute.\" \n\n\"Vanessa, that dress is beyond just cute.\" Lily feigned interest in some other clothes nearby. ",
        "\"Uh huh. And what were you think of wearing, Ms. Cowgirl?\" \n\nLily shrugged. \"I don't know. A simple T-shirt and jeans.\" \n\n\"Dude...do not show up in that.\" \n\n\"What's wrong with that? It's simple. It's not too boring and it's not too extravagant. Plus ...I could never even imagine myself looking good in that.\" \n\nVanessa put her hands on her hip in her famous \"No-nonsense\" pose. \"Honey, you have whined and cried to me ever since I've known you about how you think you're ugly and how guys don't think you're attractive. I've seen you bring yourself down time after time. You need to stop doing that. Step out of your cramped little box and stop filling your mind with these lies that people have put into your head. Try something new. And it begins here.\" Vanessa broke out into a smile. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" Lily looked at her not convinced at all. \n\n\"Pick out an outfit that shows off your body. And don't you dare say 'what body?' like you don't have a clue what I'm talking about. You know what. Go inside the dressing room.\" \n\nBefore she could say anything else, Vanessa dragged her by the hand to a store employee to open a dressing room door for her. Vanessa put her in the dressing room, asked her size, and went back out to go searching for some clothes. \n\nLily sat in the changing room dumbfounded. The words Vanessa had said hadn't really sunk in yet. Then again when had Vanessa's encouraging words ever sunk into Lily's thick skulled stubbornness? But then again, Vanessa also never forced her into a changing room to make her think about what she just said. Had Lily been really that much of a downer for all these years? But all Lily was doing was stating facts. A day didn't go by in high school when she wasn't reminded by Brandon's words. At first, she didn't believe him, but then again she looked around her and noticed the way people would stare at her look st her and then whisper in the halls. Then there was the fact that she had never been flirted with by any guy, let alone ever had a boyfriend. Vanessa was her only friend. Except for Vanessa, no one would attempt to even talk to her. So what Brandon said about her had to be true. She was ugly and no one would want her. \n\nChanging clothes wouldn't change a thing. It would only be like changing the name of a cactus into a rose, but it wouldn't matter because no one would want it. \n\nJust as she came to that sad realization, Vanessa burst through the door and hung at least a dozen outfits on the hanger. \"I want you to put these on, and when you have one on, come out here and model it for me,\" Vanessa said, bouncing from excitement. \"If it doesn't fit, drape it over the door, so I can find another size.\" \n\nLily took a quick glance over the outfits. They were all short, short, and super short. \"Vanessa, I can't go out in this,\" Lily whined. \"People will stare.\" \n\n\"That's the point.\" With a look of finality, Vanessa closed the door behind her. \n\nLily looked over at the outfits and decided to just go in order. The first one was a simple short dress with black, read, and white stripes on the top and a solid black skirt with high red heels. Lily changed into it quickly before turning around to look at herself in the mirror. The dress fitted snugly against her. Actually, a little too snug in the bottom area. When she turned around, she noticed that the seams were straining to keep her butt inside the dress. \n\n\"Vanessa...\" Lily called. \n\n\"Yeah?\" \n\n\"I can't come out like this.\" \n\n\"Hon, we've been over this.\" Vanessa exasperated. \"Just let me look.\" \n\n\"Vanessa, if I move, I'm probably going to break the dress.\" Lily heard Vanessa walk over to her dressing room before she opened the door. \n\n\"Lily...you may be right,\" Vanessa said strongly but then tapered off as she saw Lily basically stuffed into the dress. She turned Lily around so she could see. \"I need to find you some bottoms that will stretch. Damn, you have a ghetto booty.\" \n\nLily rolled her eyes.\"Vanessa, you can be such a guy sometimes.\" \n\nVanessa stuck her tongue out at her. \"Only stating the obvious, hon. Just take that one off and try on the other ones.\" \n\nThe same result went on for all the clothes Vanessa brought her. It was either it was too form fitting that it threatened to burst out of the clothes or Lily couldn't even put the clothes on because it wouldn't go past her thighs or hips. The cycle became so tedious after awhile that Lily begged Vanessa to give up and just go to another store. But of course Vanessa being hell bent on finding Lily a dress, she refused. Finally after an hour later, Vanessa found the dress. \n\nIt was an apricot dress that had a stretchy black skirt attached. The top part of the dress was form fitted and had a hole in the middle where the navel should show through. The top wasn't too low, but was still low enough to show some cleavage. When Lily put it on, she could only gawk at herself. She looked...like a woman. She looked feminine. She looked beautiful. The dress showed off curves that she had no idea she had. The apricot color complimented her smooth dark chocolate skin as it brought attention to her small cleavage that led to a small waist. As her eyes slid further down, she noticed the hem of the dress rested at the bottom of her thick thighs.Thighs that she had kept hidden under unflattering clothes. She turned to the side and felt her body heat up as she noticed how her butt pushed out against the fabric, giving it a nice smooth rounded look. \n\n\"Would you c'mon out here, girl,\" Vanessa yelled, banging on the fitting room door. Lily opened the door and slowly came out of the dressing room. Vanessa looked at her with an accomplished smile. \"See, I told you I could find a dress that would make you look good. Now all we need are some shoes, makeup and accessories.\" \n\nLily nearly groaned out loud from hearing that. It took them nearly an hour just to find the dress alone. It would be a long day of shopping before she got to go home. \n\n~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~ \n\n'Thank the Lord, I'm finished.' Lily thought as she walked into the house. Lily had never been so glad in her whole entire life to be home. She trudged up the stairs slowly with her load of shopping bags. They went to so many stores that Lily could go the rest of her life without setting foot in another store. And all just to find one outfit that she was probably going to wear once at some party. \n\n'If I have to go through all this trouble just for one party, I'd rather stay home.' She slowly trudged up the stairs and into her room. She dropped all the bags near her bed and flopped onto her bed. Her nice sweet soft bed. She closed her eyes peacefully as she marveled in its softness. \n\n\"Hey cowgirl, what's in the bag?\" \n\n'Well it was nice to enjoy the relaxation while it lasted'. \n\n\"Not now, Nicholas,\" Lily groaned into her pillow. \n\nLily heard the flicks of Nicholas's lighter going off. She turned her body around to see him at the foot of her bed, lighting a blunt. He took a long drag before looking back at her. His eyes drooped to half mast as he looked back at her. \n\n\"Where have you been all day?\" he asked puffing on his blunt. \n\n\"Why do you care? \n\n\"I don't. Just wondering.\" \n\n\"I went shopping,\" \n\n\"For what?\" \n\n\"Clothes.\" \n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"Nicholas, you're being a pain!\" Lily exasperated, glaring straight into his eyes. He only looked back at her as if she hadn't just yelled at him. \n\nNicholas shrugged lazily as he let out a fog of smoke from his nose. \"Just trying to be friendly for once.\" \n\nFriendly? That word and Nicholas didn't go together unless he was being \"friendly\" with Anna Belle. Now that she thought about it, the friendliest thing he'd done so far is that he stayed true to his word and kept that chick away from the house. But other than that, Lily could never think of an instance where Nicholas tried to strike up a friendly conversation. \n\nLily looked at him suspiciously as searched his eyes. It was hard to read them since his eyes were full of purple haze and seemed to be swimming in smoke. 'Hmm...' \n\n\"Nicholas, what do you want?\" Lily said bluntly. \n\n\"Nothing. Well...actually I just want to go back to sense of normality.\" \n\n\"Nicholas, you've been possessed by a spirit every day. You work in a tattoo parlor. And you're a pervert...Your life wasn't normal in the first place.\" \n\n\"I'm a flirt. There's a difference. And it's my sense of normality that I'm talking about.\" He playfully stuck out his tongue while blowing smoke out of his mouth. \"I was just thinking about what you said yesterday about not being ...physical with you. I just thought, we don't have to treat each other like we both don't exist, let alone live in the same room. I promise not to touch you or anything. But don't go thinking I won't say something flirty and that I won't stop saying what's on my mind.\" \n\n'So basically you're still going to be an asshole...' But Lily took what she could get. At least Nicholas wouldn't be feeling all over her. \n\n\"But, I can't make any promises that HE won't touch you,\" Nicholas said, looking down at the ground as he continued to take a drag. All the hope that Lily had vanished instantly. \n\n\"Can't you just repress him? I mean it's your body.\" \n\nNicholas's eyes slowly darkened to an onyx color as his eyes gazed back up at her. Lily cringed as she shrunk away from him. His hands looked like they were beginning to twitch as he took the blunt away from his lips. \n\n\"It's my body, but it's not in my control. Let me tell you something.\" A pause of silence followed him as he walked towards Lily. Each step resounding with ominosity. \"This is not like one of those stupid possession movies or some Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde shit. You can't scrunch your face up really hard and concentrate then you can just -\" he made a random dramatic motion with his blunt to signify the preposterousness of the whole idea. \"Then you can just have complete control over your body. It doesn't work that way. I know because I have tried so many ways to be in control, but I fail time and time again. When your soul is locked in one body with someone else's...the dominant one has control.\" \n\n\"So what am I supposed to do about him when he takes over?\" \n\nA silence passed over them. \n\n\"Just do what you've always been doing.\" \n\nAnd with that, he walked out of the room, leaving her lying on the bed. What she had always been doing? Lily sat up and thought about it for some time. The Spirit said something similar today. The only thing she could make out of it was what the Spirit already told her. Today wasn't the first time he had taken over Nicholas's body without her knowing. \n\nNow Nicholas was repeating the same obscurities. She couldn't ignore it this time. Now what were the clues the Spirit gave her? He talked about the times Nicholas had touched her. And then he talked about the times he sadistically played his \"games\" with her. The only way she could tell that Nicholas was possessed was the glowing red eyes. She remembered distinctly how he had forced her to look into his eyes as he stroke fear into her heart, reducing her to a hysterical mess. \n\nBut that didn't happen when Nicholas had fondled and kissed her for the first time. It was intense and...well hot. Her whole body grew hot just from remembering. 'Stop thinking about it, you idiot. Focus!' What did these two have in common? And why was this all so important? \n\nShe scrolled down the mental list of things it could possibly be. The room? No, the kiss was in the kitchen unlike the other clues. Nicholas's slack of sobriety? No, he was sober when he was forced to do those sadistic games. After awhile, she began grasping at any possibility. The time of day. The mood he was in. The subject they were talking about. If he had changed moods. She even thought of the clothes he wore because she was running out of possibilities. Whatever it was, it was so small that it went without detection. \n\n\"What could it have been,\" she said to herself as she mentally replayed the scenes in her head. She analyzed every detail of her memory of these clues. There didn't seem to be any commonalities. \n\nBut then it hit her. \n\nAnalyze today's session with the Spirit. \n\nShe played back the scene in her head. She knew it was Nicholas who bandaged her hand. She knew that because of the enraged fiery gray glare he gave her when he caught her holding the knife. His tone and mood was serious and lacked any of his usual playfulness. Even when given multiple chances to make a flirtatious joke, he shot all of them down by giving a serious response. But then when he was finished, that's when his attitude suddenly changed. He had asked to kiss her finger. That's when the Spirit took over. \n\nBut Lily had simply passed it off as Nicholas disobeying her wishes and trying to test his limits. But changing moods didn't match up with the time he cornered her in the bathroom or when he kissed her for the first time. So there was something else she was missing. \n\nIf the Spirit took over when he kissed her finger, then why didn't she notice the red eyes? He was too close for her to see anything, but even when he raised his head away from hers, his head wad tipped downward and his hair was concealing his eyes. And all the times Nicholas had touched her...she could never remember seeing his eyes. \n\n'That can't be right...I remember looking at his eyes when he touched..' But when she tried to dredge up the memory of how his eyes looked when he first touched her, all she could see was his black hair covering where his eyes should have been. But it was so dark, the red eyes should have been a dead giveaway. But then she remembered the bathroom door had been open and that the light was on. His red eyes wouldn't have shown. \n\nThe time when he had kissed her, she also didn't remember seeing his eyes. She was so deep in thought that she didn't look into his eyes. He had just kissed her out of the blue. Yes, he had lifted her chin, but she never saw his eyes. \n\nLily clutched at her chest as she began hyperventilating. 'Oh...my...God! WHAT THE HELL!?' \n\nThe door closed. She looked up at the door, but all she could see was red. \"Took you long enough, Lily. I knew you'd figure it out.\" \n\n\"H-How long...-\" \n\n\"The whole time. Again you were so lost in your own thoughts and your own problems that you are negligent of what is happening in the world around you.\" He walked towards her bed and sat down beside her. \"But I will say...that it is also your...weakness. Your eyes are opened but closed to the truth that you are so blinded to.\" He tried to slip his hand up Lily's leg, but she scrambled her way to the other side of the bed. \n\n\"Why are you here?\" she said through clenched teeth. \n\n\"I was waiting till you finally got it,\" he said beginning to stalk up the bed towards her. His stance was predatory as he crawled on his arms and legs and his eyes narrowed keenly on her. The length of his body began to cover hers. Lily started to push against his chest, but it only encouraged him to get nearer. \"Now tell me... what is it that you figured it out? I want to hear it out loud.\" \n\n\"Nicholas...never...touched me. It was all you.\" A smirk crossed his lips. \n\n\"Yes...I took control of him when I knew your guard was down, like it was a few minutes ago. But now,...I see no reason to hide behind this body anymore.\" \n\n\"No...I refuse.\" \n\n\"Are you sure, Lily? You haven't even heard what I was going to say.\" \n\n\"I already know what you want from me. You want me to be your sex slave. And I refuse.\" She openly glared at him. \n\n\"Why do you think that?\" He looked back at her dumbfounded. For once his red eyes looked lost and confused. \n\n'If that isn't it, then why the hell are you making it sound like you're about to make me have sex with you! I mean you're on top of me and everything!' \n\n\"Even if I were to ask that of you, you signed the contract to appease me.\" He cracked a wolfish smile as he gazed at her. The smile sent a shiver down her back. \"But no, I just wish to have a companion. Someone to talk to.\" He lifted his body off of her and sat on the bed. \n\n\"You mean a girlfriend.\" \n\n\"No, a companion. As you would say, a friend.\" He got off her bed and walked towards his own. \"But as a reminder, just because I wish you to be my friend, does not mean I will not severely punish you.\" \n\n'Oh yeah, that makes me feel so much better.' She turned her body over as she fell asleep. \n\n~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~~ \n\n'Wow.' \n\nLily looked at the woman in front of her. Everything about her was flawless. The woman's skin was that of smooth sweet dark chocolate that had a natural warm glow about her. Her face was feminine with her full pouty lips and her dark eyes. The make-up she wore illuminated her face as golden stardust was sprinkled around her bright eyes and her lips shimmered with clear gloss, making them look all the more kissable. Her waist- length hair was cascaded in ringlets , which framed her face as if it was a halo. Lily always wanted to look like that kind of woman. The kind that was perfect in every way. To be a true woman. \n\nBang! Bang! Bang! \n\n\"Lily, get out of the bathroom!\" Nicholas yelled. \"I've been out here for two hours waiting to go to the bathroom while you've been playing dress up!\" \n\n\"Leave me alone, Nicholas!\" Lily yelled back. \n\n\"I'll leave you alone when you get out of the bathroom!\" \n\nLily let out a sigh as she did another once over of herself. Although she was new to the whole \"normal woman\" thing, she did pretty well with her makeup. It was very minimal. All she really put on was some light foundation, eye shadow, and lip gloss. \n\nShe stood back to look at the rest of herself. She wore the slightly revealing (who was she kidding, it revealed everything) dress that gave her small chest a full deep cleavage. To keep her boobs from being the main attraction of the whole dress, she bought a chained necklace with golden feathers that fell in the center of her chest. The dress led down to her small tight waist that revealed her navel. From there the bottom of the dress reached down to the bottom of her thigh. She still tugged at her dress, feeling like her dress would ride all the way up her butt at any moment. But when she turned her body to the side, it showcased her full butt snugly. Further down, her toned legs were newly waxed and soft to the touch due to the cocoa butter lotion. The golden high heels she bought finished the whole look and showed off her legs. \n\nContent with her appearance, she gave her hair one last fluff before turning around and opening the door. \n\n\"It's about fucking-\" Nicholas stopped short as he looked at Lily from head to toe. Lily felt her whole body heat up as he felt his gaze roam across her body. She looked down at her feet and crossed her arms over her chest as she waited for him to move. When she stood there for awhile, she raised her head and looked him in the eye. \n\n\"I thought you had to pee,\" she said. \n\n\"I did. Now, I don't feel like it,\" he said smiling. \n\nLily scoffed as she went around him to get her purse. \n\n\"What happened to your bookworm glasses?\" Nicholas asked. \n\n\"I got contacts.\" \n\n\"Oh. Well...you look nice.\" Lily looked back at him behind her shoulder, and she swore Nicholas was blushing. It made her smile a little that big, old, asshole Nick was blushing. \n\n\"I won't be back for awhile, so don't wait up for me,\" Lily said, placing the strap over her shoulder. \n\n\"Whatever. \" Nicholas moved towards the bathroom. \"And I'm not the one you should be concerned about waiting up for you.\" With that, he closed the door behind him. \n",
        "Lily rolled her eyes as she went down the stairs to wait for Vanessa to pick her up. Vanessa had mentioned something about a friend of hers picking her up in his car. Vanessa didn't tell her who, but she just went along with it anyway. It's not like it was anyone she would know. This night was about getting out of her shell anyway. So tonight, she was going to try something new for a change and not worry too much about what was going to happen. \n\nShe heard a loud honking at the front door as a yellow Chevrolet Camaro rolled up in front of the house. Whoa, this friend had it made. He had to have a pretty good job if he was rolling around in a sports car. This was going to be so exciting! Lily excitedly opened the door and clopped down the steps. Vanessa rolled down the tinted passenger window and waved at Lily. \"Hey, girl! You look so sexy!\" she called out. \n\nLily blushed as some of the people on the street looked her way. 'Oh, great. People are already staring.' \n\n\"Would you be quiet?\" Lily whispered. \n\n\"I'm only stating the truth,\" Vanessa laughed. Lily hurriedly rushed to the backseat and closed the door behind her. Tonight was going to be awesome! Lily was so excited that she was nearly bouncing out of her seat. \n\n\"Oh yeah, Lily,\" Vanessa shifted around in her seat. \"This is my friend that's going to be coming with us to the party.\" \n\nWhen Vanessa's friend turned around, Lily felt all the excitement leave her body. Tonight was not going to be different. It was going to be horrible like everything else in her life. Because In the driver's seat was Brandon Atreides."
