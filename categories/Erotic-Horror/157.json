        "PROLOGUE: THREE MONTHS BEFORE\n\nThe road was desert dusty; any driver would have known the end of it was off the paved path. The truck contributing to the dust had seen better years, and had a few worse ones yet to go. The driver was paying more attention to the bottle of beer the passenger was swilling than the road. \n\nThe driver and passenger's skin was darkened with the passage of days in the sun. Their happiness at a stolen hour with their patron's truck described life in simple pleasures: fucking, drinking, sleeping, driving, and combining any that a woman let them get away with. A perfect day be driving to a bar where the word 'Migra' was a curse, drinking the balls to talk to a pretty girl, a creaking motel bed, and sleep with no thoughts of yesterday or tomorrow.\n\nNeither noticed the dirty figure until it was too late, almost. The passenger screamed and reached for the steering wheel. The truck went off the road, coming to a stop inches from a tree that somehow thrived in the desiccation. The two men looked at each other for a second, afraid that they had failed to avoid the figure. They turned to the truck doors, and ran out to where they had jettisoned off the road.\n\nThe figure was lying on the ground.\n\nThe men looked at each other again. She was wearing a dirt-browned white t-shirt and baby-blue lace panties. They recognized hunger from their own village but to see a white person, a girl, with the look of days without a meal scared them.\n\nThis was 'El Norte'.\n\nThey worked jobs that gringos did not callous their hands on. Politicos made noise, but the two men were as much a part of the system as everyone who fought to push them back over the border. 'El Norte' did not include green-eyed blonde women looking at them with more fear than either had ever seen. Even covered in grime, the beauty of a tele-novela female lead was obvious in the girl.\n\nIt added to their fear. They recognized a scion of privilege in the thousand ways those without can. She reached out a hand to them. They watched as her eyes changed from fear to pleading hope. They turned to look at each other before committing themselves.\n\nThey could have abandoned her without anyone knowing. Many of the steps towards a better life had been taken for family and an INS ticket home was a blow to those family members as well. Neither looked at each other again as they picked the woman up and placed her in the truck cab. They did not need to say that going back to the patron was not an option. It was silent judgment of a man who lived well from other people's dreams.\n\nThey looked towards the end of the road that they could not see through what now seemed a protective dust. The passenger did not say anything when the driver turned the truck around.\n\nIt was a long drive to the city. They had both made the crossing before and managed few months before being caught. They knew where the woman would be helped and shrugged fatalistically at the thought of questions, accusations, and eventual deportation. The patron would be there to take their money for another attempt.\n\nThe passenger was comforted by the woman's sobs of relief against his chest. The driver was happy with knowing he had not given up the sleep that abandoning her would have cost him.\n\n-----\n\nPROLOGUE II: ONE MONTH BEFORE\n\n\"Senator,\" the quiet man said welcoming the last guest to walk into the tastefully expensive hotel room.\n\nThe Senator dressed with the elegance of being born with class, while the quiet man dressed as if it might be necessary to blend into the furniture. The last man in the room, standing by the window, wore the face of barely hidden guilt.\n\nThe Senator sat down and looked at his co-conspirators; it was a hard word to use for a politician with the money to buy himself.\n\n\"Emil,\" he said to the man by the window. The pain in Emil's eyes was not hidden when he turned and sat in the last available chair.\n\n\"How is your youngest daughter?\" the quiet man asked the Senator.\n\n\"Afraid!\" the Senator barked. The quiet man simply nodded and looked to Emil.\n\n\"Catherine Stewart was my lover,\" Emil said suddenly.\n\nThe quiet man nodded thoughtfully. The Senator looked at him realizing the content of Emil's outburst had not been a surprise.\n\n\"She was one of my best agents,\" Emil said quietly. \"I personally assigned her to the investigation of your daughters' kidnappings.\"\n\nThe Senator remembered thinking how much the agent Emil had sent out resembled his oldest daughter. It burned in his gut that it was in his own home state that their girls' lives had been taken. The burning raged whenever he remembered that he did not even have the comfort of a body to bury. He had chosen the silent path, and it had cost them another bodiless funeral.\n\n\"That county is a hellhole,\" Emil said to no one in particular. \"I've read Catherine's early reports. None of the residents will talk. They just about feed you to the wolves themselves. Considering your youngest daughter's mental state when she was found, we were right to make a quiet investigation instead of coming down on that town.\"\n\nThe Senator nodded angrily.\n\n\"Catherine wanted me to divorce my wife,\" Emil continued without thinking. \"I sent her out there because I wanted her to...\"\n\nThe other two men looked at each other but said nothing.\n\n\"I sent her down there, and they sent her back with only half her face. The doctors say it was definitely human teeth that did the damage. Whatever is down there cost me the life of a good agent. Her partner will keep quiet about the preliminary investigation, no matter what happens.\"\n\nEmil looked at the ceiling trying to hide the seconds of relief that he had felt when Catherine died. Those seconds were his guilt; that for a few instants, his thoughts had been for the things her death had preserved.\n\n\"Catherine was pregnant,\" Emil said. \"The doctors say she would have known, but she did her job anyway.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"What is this?\" the Senator asked rhetorically.\n\n\"A righteous evil,\" the quiet man said. He thought of it as murder, but that was only a legal definition and these men needed some comforting.\n\n\"This is righteous?\" Emil asked out loud.\n\n\"What about you, John? You haven't lost a child or a lover to these animals,\" the Senator said ignoring Emil.\n\nJohn, the quiet one, looked at the window to think of the best reply to that question. He shrugged internally, deciding both men were over the barrel enough that the truth could not improve their positions.\n\n\"You came to me, Senator,\" John said looking him. The Senator nodded his acceptance of the point.\n\n\"Chits from the Director of the FBI and the Senate Chair of the Intelligence Committee have a certain value when you run agencies that the public does not know about,\" John continued.\n\nThe two men nodded, understanding how far out they were from the Washington playbook.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the death of Catherine Stewart has repercussions that neither of you could possibly know about,\" John said as if each word were a step in a land-mined field. The Senator and Emil looked at each other with twin looks of surprise.\n\n\"I have hopes for her younger brother,\" John said. \"But I can make no attempts to keep the details of her death from him.\"\n\n\"I don't understand the problem?\" the Senator said looking from Emil to John.\n\n\"Catherine was an adult so Emil's life can be saved. After all, she chose to enter into that type of relationship with him,\" John said quietly. \"No one else involved will survive Catherine Stewart's death.\"\n\n\"One person isn't enough! Catherine had a partner, and it didn't help!\" the Senator said sitting forward. \"You're going to send someone else to die?\"\n\n\"It's okay, Richard.\" Emil said leaning forward. The Senator looked at Emil with a question in his eyes.\n\n\"John's and my agency share some of the same behind the scenes people,\" Emil said looking at John. \"I forgot he worked for you.\"\n\nEmil turned to look at the Senator.\n\n\"None of the psychologists will be alone in the same room with him after they interview him,\" he told the Senator.\n\n\"We fear what we don't understand?\" John said with a smile.\n\n\"You don't fear him?\" Emil asked harshly.\n\nJohn looked away.\n\n\"I didn't say I understood him,\" John replied finally.\n\n\"So what will point him in the right direction?\" Emil asked John.\n\n\"I'm going give him Catherine's last reports, her death certificate, and a copy of her autopsy tape.\" John said tonelessly.\n\n\"That's it?\" the Senator asked standing up and pacing around the room. \"Haven't you read the reports, dammit? No one is dangerous enough to take these people on alone.\"\n\nJohn's smile of amusement stopped the Senator.\n\n\"Catherine's baby brother isn't dangerous, Senator.\" John said, \"He's...\"\n\nJohn looked out the window for a couple of seconds and with the smile of having done the difficult word in a crossword puzzle first finished, \"Indiscriminate.\"\n\n-----\n\nBODY: THE MERCHANT MASSACRE\n\nI walked into Conception from the west with the red of the setting sun framing me. Eyes stared as I walked down the main street. Conception was a ghost town of two blocks that would have fit well in a post-nuclear apocalyptic movie. It was the kind of town that people fled, and everyone left behind hoped the runners were never heard from again. I looked around as people stared at me. Their fear was scarred into their faces; part of the tribute demanded for the continued gift of life.\n\nI walked into what passed for a hotel; the attempt to look like an old western saloon had not been successful.\n\n\"Can I get you something, darling?\" a voice of fake honey said as my eyes adjusted quickly to the change in lighting. The smell of fear-sweat had nothing to do with me yet, so giving off the careless signals of the weak served a purpose. I waited longer than it took for my eyes to adjust before looking at her.\n\nThe woman was middle-aged and not by the years. The fear came off her in waves and the stress of not having someone to run with had taken its toll on her face.\n\n\"A glass of ice water,\" I said to her and put my bag on a table. I had removed what might be necessary when I started my walk but doubted anyone would require its use soon.\n\nShe looked confused at the request. Drinking was the way the people of Conception got peaceful night's sleep. She served me the glass and looked as if she wanted to sit down and chat.\n\n\"I'd like a room also,\" I told her. \"Top floor in the back.\"\n\nThe building was the tallest in town at four stories and sat on something of a small hill. The back of the building was on a gentle slope downwards.\n\n\"Nobody stays in Conception,\" she said worriedly. It was as close as she would let herself get to saving my life.\n\nI looked at her.\n\nHer hair was blonde, but the dust of the area made it a dirtier color than it needed to be. Her eyes were blue, and her body had all the required padding. She smiled at my study and cocked her hip in an invitation that had to do with more than me.\n\nI smiled accepting her offer. It had been a long time since my last woman.\n\nI shrugged away her words and drank my water. She moved away from me having satisfied what little conscience was left. If I wanted the company of a warm bed, she would let me make the move.\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked her back.\n\n\"Sally, sugar,\" she said turning her head to me and twitching her full ass in suggestion of where the sugar really was.\n\n\"Get me another glass of ice water, Sally,\" I told her and looked to the door. The welcoming committee would be arriving soon and at least one of them I wanted words with.\n\nThey came in with the bait leading them; he was good at his job. Unlike Sally, his skin was not aged, and his blonde hair was not dirty. I nodded at the image he would present to a woman lost on a strip of road near a town that was not on most maps. A blonde, blue-eyed knight wearing the shield everyone believed a badge was when there was trouble.\n\nHe turned the chair across from me around and sat down heavily. The boys with him were sycophants who thought being closer to the beating heart of danger made them safer.\n\n\"Hello, stranger,\" the young blonde said to me. \"My name's Deputy Gus.\"\n\nHis smile was full of disarming Southern charm; a 'good ole boy', harmless as they came and just itching to help any way he could.\n\nBait has to be enticing.\n\nI put the identification I had been given in front of me. Deputy Gus smiled, amping up the charm and picked up the leather holder.\n\n\"FBI Agent Lyndell,\" he announced to the room. \"So what brings an agent of the F-B-I to Conception?\"\n\nHis voice had the natural curiosity the situation called for, but there was an undertone of darkness that would be felt at an instinctual level. The sycophants reacted to it by looking around the room. I looked with them, as if I were one of them.\n\nDeputy Gus relaxed.\n\n\"We have a missing agent,\" I said simply, seeming to recover from my confusion.\n\n\"Well, can I do anything to help?\" Deputy Gus said with the 'good ole boy' back in his voice.\n\n\"I'd like to visit some of the outlying ranches and farms,\" I told him.\n\nThere was a female gasp behind me, and I turned to look at Sally. She moved so that her fear-darkened eyes would be hidden by the greater darkness of the room. I turned around and looked at Deputy Gus questioningly.\n\n\"Women are a bit high-strung,\" he whispered to me with a nudge to the table telling me it was between us boys. I replied with a short laugh.\n\n\"Do you want to start your search now?\" Deputy Gus asked solicitously.\n\nI pretended to think about it for a moment.\n\n\"She's been missing six weeks, Deputy,\" I said after some consideration. \"Another night won't give her that much more of a lead on the F-B-I.\"\n\nIt seemed to satisfy him, and we spent another hour making him feel comfortable that the bait had hooked a new meal. The sycophants stayed after he left to intimidate Sally and other visitors to ensure that they did not scare the live one away.\n\nThere were two other women that were good possibilities for relieving months of buildup. The older one made her offer clear, but since they were all equal I decided on Sally first. I asked her for a serving of whatever passed for food and others followed suit. Strangers were rare in Conception, and one staying was worthy of a night out on the town. I entertained them with stories of the outside. The women paid special attention trying to believe there was a world outside their small sphere of terror where men more attractive than Deputy Gus did not intimidate women into sleeping with them by displaying the sickle.\n\nMy charm, like Deputy Gus's, had purpose; to the east lay the body of my first. I did not want the wrong person to find him; keeping the townsfolk in the hotel increased the odds of only the right people stumbling over it.\n\nI had seen the truck as I drove by and knew it would follow. I stopped my car a mile up the road and pulled out a map. The truck pulled up behind me; and six feet six, two hundred seventy pounds stepped out with intimidating presence. The stalking shadow was a sharp contrast to the lovely bait, in moments seeming like a safe haven of male size and in others a breathing brutality.\n\n\"Hello, stranger,\" his voice had none of the charm of his brother's, but he had chosen intimidation as a starting point. It was an understandable choice for someone who had two pairs when playing in his casino, his poker table and with his dealer. 'All in' was a reasonable bet when his was the only game in town.\n\nI had always been the kind to draw on the inside of a straight razor though. The blade sliced with surgical precision through denim, flesh, muscle and the femoral artery.\n\nThe unexpected pain confused him.\n\nI was smaller.\n\nI was not family.\n\nHe felt the pain of approaching death, which he caused to others but was unfamiliar with the personal side of. He looked up at me, lost as to how I could be standing above him while he lay on the packed dirt of the road. His eyes studied me as his body weakened but saw nothing that his victims did when he was the last vision of their death. His face would have shown glee or maybe the satisfaction of having bagged a good meal.\n\nMy eyes were a reflection; a man lying in a spreading pool of blood so red no artist could imitate the hue on canvas.\n\nIt took longer to find an adequate hiding spot for the car than for him to die. I left his body and truck on the road. I walked around town so that I could approach Conception from the opposite side of his body.\n\nSally was a fact of my immediate life. She did not like that I requested we shower first to remove the dirt on my body and the sweat from hers. I shrugged and got under the stream of water. She had no recourse but to leave or accept whatever insult her mind made of my words.\n\nFear is a source of calorie consumption so Sally was tight in the places a woman did not need to be soft. She gasped at the patience with which I cleaned her body. She learned to enjoy being on the receiving end of my touch. We moved to the bedroom after her first orgasm. She tried to touch me, but I held her in place and spread her legs with mine.\n\nThere was time for foreplay afterwards.\n\nMonths of an ignored physical need called me in the shape of a hard penis. She moved her legs up prepared by my touches in the shower to do what was necessary. I hooked her legs and opened her further. I pushed my hips towards her and her body opened to my entrance. Her hands tightened on my arms in acceptance of the momentary discomfort from the lack of use. I did not hesitate to move forward, regardless of her unvoiced protests. She was here for one thing, and I was there for another. Maybe she thought it was the condemned's last meal, but it was more satisfying than masturbation.\n\nI hit her bottom and pushed her legs down hard. I pulled back and fucked into her with the power that years of physical training lent me. She grunted as I plumbed depths her body had forgotten existed. The grunt got as much reaction as blood on packed dirt. I rested my weight on her hips to give her the pleasure of maintained pressure. She moved underneath me enticing me to fuck her but the way the head of my dick was rubbed by her body was enough. She moved harder as her clit found a spot she could rub against. She drove herself towards the little freedom she had in the prison they had built for the townspeople. Her movements wrapped my hard dick in velvet walls of pleasure so I did not take back control.\n\nShe came and her gyrations focused on her pussy in an instinctual grab for joint sensation. I shot my cum into her pussy filling her with myself as she screamed pleased curses into the stale air.\n\nLater, she lay on her stomach with a look that said she was about to ask questions. Two fingers seeking her g-spot forestalled her mouth opening for words and instead gasped out a small sigh of welcome.\n\nDeputy Gus called Sally the next morning leaving a message that he had business but would be available to guide me around in the late afternoon.\n\nSally and the other two women sat around most of the day trying to get information out of and into me. One of them had long straight brown hair and innocent seeming blue eyes. She was the youngest of the thirty-eight residents I had seen in town. She got the closest to inexpertly warning me of the dangers of Conception. I distracted her with questions she avoided about why she was not off to college. The other woman was obviously her mother but with black hair. She had the same innocent seeming blue eyes as her daughter.\n\nDeputy Gus picked me up in the afternoon and did his own version of information digging. He took me to different ranches and farms. All were either abandoned or populated by one or more of the thirty-eight residents I had counted. They treated Deputy Gus with fearful deference and answered all my questions only after looking at him. They had known Catherine Stewart but that was as much as I could get out of them. The afternoon turned to evening and the sky was dark when the Deputy drove us to the front of the last ranch house we were to visit. The lights were out but he told me that the family should be home since most of Conception's people did not go out at night. He turned the lights off on his truck and confidently walked in front of me.",
        "He rang the doorbell.\n\nHe looked back at me and smiled.\n\n\"Hot night!\" he said in a near sexual excitement as he took off his cowboy hat and wiped his forehead. \n\nHe turned back to the door and a hard flick backwards of my right wrist dropped the handles into my hand. A hard turn of the wrist loosened the wire wrapped around the leather wristband. I twirled my wrist so the wire dropped its loops past my hand and jerked my hand up to untangle the coils. The move took less than a practiced second, and I tossed one of the handles to my left hand. I passed the handles to the opposite hands crossing the wire. I stepped forward and flipped the noose over Deputy Gus's uncovered head. He felt the touch of a fly's legs as the wire wrapped around his neck. The force of my knee hitting his upper back stopped him from turning around. I tightened the noose by jerking my hands outward. He instinctively pushed back against me, and I shifted to the side to turn his body driving him to the ground. With Deputy Gus on his stomach, I had greater leverage. I settled my weight on the knee in the middle of his upper back and cinched the garrote. He struggled, but his death had started with the first hard pressure of the wire. It had cut into him immediately and by the time his death's throes were over he was part of the way to decapitation.\n\nI had a further use for the garrote so I untwined it from his neck with some difficulty and walked to the truck. I had a plastic bag for the purpose and deposited the wire and handles in it. Deputy Gus had not noticed my putting on the leather gloves in his excitement. Had he been more attentive the one shot silenced thirty-eight attached to my left wrist with the trigger wire on my belt would have blown his brains against the truck window.\n\nNo one in the house was aware of my actions, but I could hear the skittering of hungry rats.\n\nI walked back to town.\n\nEveryone was surprised to see me at the hotel. They watched as I walked past them to clean up. I was not marked by Deputy Gus's death, but I had to prepare for the most likely repercussions. I walked into the main area and sat down.\n\n\"Ice water, Sally,\" I said to her and sat down. \"And some dinner, I think.\"\n\n\"Didn't you go out with Deputy Gus?\" the mother, Melissa, asked sitting down across from me. I smiled at her; whatever the townswomen had going on she seemed to be the next volunteer in my sexual relief. I noticed the old man in uniform to my right.\n\nI turned to look at him.\n\nHe nodded uncomfortably, and I wondered why Deputy Gus had stayed a Deputy when the Sheriff had incompetence written all over him. I guessed that Deputy sounded less threatening than Sheriff and bait cannot afford to be intimidating. It must have also helped to have such a stark comparison of idiot and knight in shining armor when someone had escaped the stalking shadow that had been Deputy Gus's brother.\n\n\"He had a family emergency. He mentioned it at the last place we visited and I insisted on walking back to town so that I would not keep him,\" I said.\n\n\"And he let you go?\" Melissa's daughter asked, sitting down next to her mother. Her innocent blues had hope in them and I could almost taste her sexual inexperience.\n\n\"He didn't have a choice,\" I said to her seriously. \"Family emergencies ARE private things.\"\n\nThey asked me more questions, and I felt the hope in them dying slowly as their fear told them that Deputy Gus had probably let me go for sport. Karen, the daughter, was the only one who held on to the hope.\n\nSally outdid herself in the food department as the conflict of my words, Gus's past actions, and what her woman's instincts said about the man she had fucked fought a war with each other.\n\nGood food was something else I had been without for a few months.\n\nEveryone heard the violent gunning of the truck as it roared into town. They looked at me fearfully. They retreated to create room as a cry of pain was released outside.\n\nThe stalking shadow's older brother entered the saloon dragging two bodies behind him. He was in emotional pain; he did not understand the anger and frustration he felt. He was bigger than the man I had shaved outside of town. His purpose was obvious; just when someone thought they could deal with the stalking shadow's size someone bigger peered over a shoulder.\n\nHe was a wounded lion who instinctively knew I had cast the spear into his side. He let of go of the bodies and charged me. I pushed the table towards him, and he barreled through it.\n\nMy sister had called me a bulldog. I was five-foot-seven and just over two hundred pounds of hard muscle. The real similarity was in attitude. Bulldogs were bred for bull baiting, and their method of killing was to clamp down on the nose. The bulldog would hold the bite until the bull drowned in its blood. The focus that had been bred into them makes bulldogs very hard to dislodge when they see red. I did not see red, but the room grayed and the bull in front of me was my existence. He tossed the remains of the table aside and rushed me again. I ducked under his outstretched arm and straightened his knee by placing my foot on it. He tripped and slid a couple of feet. He stood up to be met by the chair I crashed into his back. He was strong, and it only took a shake of the head for him to recover.\n\nHe was quick as he turned towards me. The kick to his jaw was fluid and began when his shoulder had begun to turn. He put his hands down on the ground. The kick required more than a shake. I let him climb to the edge of recovery before kicking in the lower area of his ribcage. He was built like a house and only grunted in reaction to what would have broken ribs in a normal man.\n\nI thought about killing him with the drop dagger I had palmed when he walked into the room. He was unskilled though, and the townspeople needed to relearn the immediacy of fear.\n\nIt was a slow, brutal affair that left most of the saloon patrons blanched by the cold efficiency. The second time he was down his ribs did cave, which slowed him. It made breaking ribs on the other side easier. His roars gained the taint of fear and pain as he released them, more to brave himself than to express emotion.\n\nThe second time I hit him with a chair he collapsed into unconsciousness. I walked over to the Sheriff and removed the handcuffs from his belt. He took steps backwards as I approached, but the wall prevented him from escaping.\n\nI made a show of telling the unconscious body his rights and cuffing his arms behind him. I pointed to the sycophants who were the most fearful in the room now that their protection lay dead on the ground. I had them pick up the live one by the arms. I pointed to other people, even the women. Their job was to drag the bodies of the dead men. I took the Sheriff's building keys off the belt I had gotten the handcuffs from.\n\n\"You can't do this,\" he said not talking about the keys.\n\n\"He assaulted a federal agent,\" I told him with a smile. \"I believe those bodies are connected to my investigation into the disappearance of Agent Stewart.\"\n\nI waited for him to say something but all he could do was shake his head dumbly while trying to recover from having his world turned inside out. I patted his face in a gesture of comfort. I led the procession of people deadened by fear and dead bodies to the Sheriff's office. I pointed to one cell for the sycophants and another for the dead bodies.\n\n\"Are you just going to leave them there?\" Sally asked me as I locked the door of the cell with the bodies.\n\n\"They haven't ripened enough to be bait yet,\" I told her as I walked passed the people I had driven into stunned shock.\n\n\"No one goes in there.\" I said outside. They followed behind me to the hotel. I looked around the room until my eyes touched Melissa, the mother. I signaled her up the stairs and her eyes widened. She nearly shook her head but changed her mind when the sycophants started to straighten the mess I had made.\n\n\"Go home, Karen,\" she said behind her shoulder as she headed to my room. No one said anything and now they knew better than to try to stop me.\n\nMelissa started the shower water running. She stripped her clothing off unceremoniously and stepped into the stream. She turned towards me to watch as I undressed. Her eyes widened at the three pieces of hardware that I put on top of my clothing; she had missed the first two. She was softer and rounder than Sally's fear tightened curves but was exactly what a man hopes for after beating someone half to death.\n\nShe did not argue as I soaped her body quickly and had her do the same for me. I was hard in her hands and decided against waiting for the bed. I was still seeing gray and her ass felt good in my hands as she tried to push down her fears with fevered kisses on my neck and chest. I walked backwards into the stream of water and moved my hands on her body to wash the soap off. I grabbed her wrists and turned her to face the wall of the shower. She gasped in surprise but did not try to get away when I held her wrists in place on the wall with one hand. I trailed fingers down the center of her back, in between buttocks and around to her pussylips. She gasped as she felt me play with them gently to get an excited response to the fear beating with her heart. She could not combat the fight/flight/fuck instinct, and her body produced what it thought was necessary to convince me there were better things to do than harm. Her scent overpowered the air. I dipped down and placed myself at her entrance. I was ungentle with my penetration. The fight adrenaline was not gone from my body adding impetus to my first thrust.\n\nShe grunted and tried to escape the feel of my body opening her. She had nowhere to go with the wall in front of her and me behind. She struggled anyway so I let go of her wrists and grabbed a fistful of hair. I pulled her head back and pushed forwards with my hips. She let out a yelp of protest but stopped her movement. I pulled myself almost out of her slowly and fucked into her hard again. I grabbed her hip with my other hand to angle her body better. I held her in that position as I moved in and out of her.\n\nSlow strokes outward and powerful strokes in.\n\nShe was watching me with trepidation but soon after I forced her to be still her eyes glazed. She had been held up in fear response for too long, and her body wanted release. She came suddenly and tried to bring her head down. I held her back to watch as pleasure took her over. I fucked her with no control as her body orgasmed.\n\nShe had another orgasm when I thickened inside of her. I let go of her hair, pulled my hips back and forced her completely against the wall as my body released into her. She pushed back against me while trying to climb the wall as her second orgasm pounded into her body. I filled her with myself but had enough control to keep us from falling to the floor of the shower.\n\nShe was soundly asleep when I woke up in the dead of night. I dressed quickly in the clothes that had been prepared and climbed out the window to sit on the window ledge. It was the fourth floor, but I pushed my weight off the ledge. The downward slope off the ground helped as I absorbed the impact with a paratrooper's collapse. I relaxed like I had been trained and let gravity run its course. I rolled down the slope and felt the clothing protect me from tearing forces. I came to a rest at the bottom and made a mental inventory of body parts before standing up. I was sore and would need a couple of nights sleep to recover properly but was functional. I moved quietly around the hotel towards the Sheriff's office.\n\nThe brother was awake and had begun an effort to escape by breaking his cell door. He took a couple of steps back as he saw me enter. He roared in false courage and crashed his body into his cell door. I caught the faint step of hesitation he made as his body fought his mind to prevent more pain. I waited to see if the Sheriff had decided to keep his guest company.\n\nI walked over to the gun case and pulled down one of the shotguns. I approached the cell, and he took a couple more steps back. The firing of the shotgun was nearly a crushing sound in the silent confines of the office and the town. The cell door made a good brace for the gun as I emptied it into his body.\n\nI opened the door to the sheriff's office but no light had been turned on to investigate. I tossed the shotgun on the roof of a one-floor building. I wanted it out of sight for a couple of days, but it would make no difference if it were found.\n\nI went back to the hotel and climbed up the storm drain of the adjoining building. It was small jump from the roof of that building onto the stronger drain of the hotel. I climbed up to the roof as quickly as I could. I moved towards my window and looked down. The windows were built to last and they had passed my weight test. It was a short drop to the top of the window. I carefully stepped down to the ledge and let myself into the room. I took my clothes off, put them away and stepped into the cold stream of the shower.\n\nMelissa did not like my cold presence at her back and tried to move away. She woke up suddenly as I pulled her back. She groaned and looked at the clock. I had set it back an hour for that exact situation. My lips drowned her next protest out as I settled myself between her legs. There was no other protest as her body quickly heated up to the warming comfort of a half-asleep fuck. I turned the clock to the correct time before I fell asleep against her back.\n\nThe pounding of the door woke Melissa up. The approach to the door had set my sensor off, but I turned it off before the alarm became audible. The Sheriff was smart enough not to barge in which I almost thanked him for. I was sure that his blood would have caused Melissa to vomit that early in the morning.\n\n\"Agent Lyndell!\" he yelled through the door. Melissa looked at me frightened but I dressed slowly.\n\nI opened the door with my.45 held at the small of my back. He tried to walk into the room but was stopped by my hand on his chest.\n\n\"I have a guest,\" I said to him in a quiet voice. He was close to being rude, and therefore dead.\n\n\"I need to know where you were last night around 2 am,\" he said aggressively.\n\nIt was too far so I met his eyes with mine. He jumped back and broke the eye contact.\n\n\"I'll be downstairs in a couple of minutes,\" I told him closing the door in his face. Melissa covered herself in the blanket and nearly ran into the bathroom. I waited for her to finish and brushed my teeth. She left the room while I was shaving but she paused in the bathroom door to say goodbye.\n\nI prepared for the day's events and walked downstairs. They were waiting for me and Sally set down a plate of breakfast for me. The evening's excitement had relaxed her even more. It showed in the perfection of her eggs over easy and the evenness of the butter spread on the toast.\n\n\"Where were you last night?\" the Sheriff asked me abruptly.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked around the taste of fresh butter.\n\n\"The Merchant boy was killed in his cell,\" he said forcefully.\n\nI looked at him, and he got the message to moderate his voice.\n\n\"What time?\" I asked him. I did not expect him to have a medical report since the only doctor in town had hands that trembled from the alcoholic stupor he spent life in.\n\n\"People heard gunshots at the office around 2 am,\" the Sheriff said.\n\nMelissa looked at me confused remembering the time on the clock when I woke her up for some sex play. Everyone noticed the look on her face, but Sally speaking interrupted their thoughts.\n\n\"I was awake at the time, Sheriff,\" she said carefully. \"I could not sleep so was cleaning up down here and no one passed me by. I heard the shots and looked out the door but...\"\n\nShe did not want to admit she had been afraid to go outside. A part of her hoped that she knew what was happening but did not have the courage to voice the desire yet.\n\n\"We were also awake at that time, Sheriff,\" Melissa said. \"I guarantee he wasn't nowhere near that office.\"\n\nShe blushed after she finished saying it so everyone understood why we were too busy to hear shots. Karen blushed also, but there was jealousy in the way she looked at her mother.\n\n\"If you didn't kill that boy who did?\" the Sheriff asked as if the question would point the finger back at me. The room was silent since it was a question none of them could answer.\n\n\"The 'boy' had quite a few people in this town terrorized,\" I answered the Sheriff. He looked at me trying to make sense of my words.\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"A scared person can do scary things to a cornered rat,\" I told them.\n\nThey sat quietly watching me eat my breakfast.\n\n\"Aren't you going to do anything?\" the Sheriff asked finally.\n\n\"I'm here to find a missing FBI agent. You're the one with the pile of dead bodies,\" I said calmly.\n\n\"Don't you want to look at the body?\" he asked.\n\n\"You left them in the cells?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Well, you put them there!\" he nearly shouted.\n\n\"I didn't expect you to leave them there, Sheriff\" I said patiently.\n\nThe women in the room broke out into giggles. The Sheriff blushed angrily and leaned towards me threateningly. I put the business end of the.45 against his nose and pushed him back.\n\n\"I would reconsider the words you were about to say to me,\" I said in a toneless voice. \"I have an agent to locate and the lack of cooperation I have come across is not appreciated. Threats will NOT be tolerated.\"\n\n\"You can't... do that!\" he managed to stutter out.\n\n\"Why did you put your hand on your gun?\" I asked him gently. The occupants in the room recovered enough from my actions to gasp at my knowledge.\n\nThe Sheriff's eyed turned from fear to terror as he realized I would kill him if he gave me another reason. He looked at me, and his eyes begged for his life.\n\n\"Take your gun out and put it on the table,\" I ordered him. He complied quickly and I pulled it to me.\n\n\"I don't want you wearing a gun again until I leave,\" I told him.\n\n\"But that will leave me defenseless.\"\n\nI cocked the gun.\n\n\"I will protect you, Sheriff.\" I told him. He looked even more afraid at that.\n\n\"You wanted me to look at the bodies?\" I asked him while putting away the guns. He nodded dumbly and I got up. People looked like they were going to follow behind us so I started towards the door. I waited for my eyes to adjust to the sunlight and noticed the movement out of the corner of my eye.\n\nHe moved swiftly, but I had been expecting him. I turned my body away from him and raised the double-barreled shotgun pistol. The boy had given me enough warning to cock both barrels as I drew it. My arm was fully extended by the time he leaped at me with his knife stretched out. He took two loads of ball shot in the chest. I let the force of the gun spin me backwards so that the.45 was pointing towards him. It was unnecessary; he lay on his back dead.\n\nEveryone was stunned.\n\nI walked over to the boy and looked down at him. He was dirty; the next generation of madness was written all over his face. I heard a clear sigh of relief behind me and turned to look at Karen. There were tears in her eyes but they were for herself. I looked at the boy again. He was old enough to have discovered girls, and looking at Karen, who anyplace else would have been too old for the boy, I knew which one he wanted to discover.\n\nMelissa turned her daughter's face away.\n\n\"Who is this boy?\" I asked the Sheriff.\n\n\"That's the youngest Merchant,\" he said looking like he was seconds from getting sick. I waited for him to recover and smiled.\n\n\"I'm going to have to visit this Merchant family,\" I said loud enough for everyone to hear. \"Not today though, I think this is enough for today. It's tough killing a little one.\"\n\nI walked past the Sheriff and looked at him.\n\n\"You're going to want to tell the parents,\" I told him. \"Clean this mess up, too.\"",
        "No one followed me back inside. I sat down and thought about what came next. There was the oldest brother, the clan matriarch and patriarch left on the list. They had not been to town in years so I doubted they would come to me. The Sheriff would not dare go out there alone and none of the townspeople would go with him; the phone would be enough for him. It served my purposes but from the look of hope in the people outside staying overnight would serve a completely different purpose.\n\nThe townsfolk came inside eventually and sat down uncomfortably around me. The creatures that walked in their night were fearful, but they now thought they understood what the results of my visit would be. Their questions were obvious as they looked at each other.\n\nI sat in the same chair being watched by them for the morning and afternoon. Sally served me a late lunch and waited even longer for dinner. I kept myself busy by cleaning the guns.\n\nNight fell and the doctor came in. He grumbled about putting the bodies in cold storage until the FBI could take possession if I decided they were a part of my investigation. I nodded dismissing him back to the bottle he took his comfort from. Sally served him one and everyone else went back to the day's entertainment of watching me.\n\nI walked upstairs to my room. It would be a good drive to get what I needed and an early start would help.\n\nKaren was sitting naked on my bed. She had her hands on her knees with her head resting on them. Her head came up as I walked in and her hands moved to cover the important parts of her nudity. I closed the door behind me and stared into her blue eyes. She was afraid but more that I would walk out than that I would stay.\n\n\"Does your mother know you're here?\" I asked her.\n\n\"I'm a woman, legally even,\" she said with a shaky voice.\n\n\"So your mother doesn't know you're here,\" I said smiling.\n\nI took my clothing off and her nervousness ramped up. She was surprised when I walked into the shower. Killing the boy had put gunpowder residue on me. The faint smell of it had made people keep their distance, but Karen needed to be held close.\n\nShe was lying down looking at the ceiling when I walked back into the room naked. She looked at me in surprise having been lost in whatever dream she tried to convince herself she was in. I climbed onto the bed and knelt next to her. I was hard at the freshness that her body exuded. She was pale with none of the tan that country girls had. Her mother must have kept her inside as much as possible. She had tight B-cup breasts; her hips had more than a hint of her mother's curves. She looked at me, and her blues cried for me to wrap her in unfamiliar safety.\n\nI smiled at her and pulled her up to her knees. She did not know what to do with herself so I wrapped her arms around my waist. She held on tightly as I opened my mouth and invaded hers with my tongue. She tried to pull away, but I gripped her ass cheeks in my hands and pulled her back to me. My cock rode up her tummy and to the side. She pulled away from it but ended up on her back on the bed. I lay on top of her leaving only enough space that my cock could move on her flesh freely. The kissing got to her, distracting her from what was happening below.\n\nHer hands moved from my waist to around my neck, and she tried to draw me closer to her. I deepened the kiss, and she moaned as sensation swamped her. I moved to lie by her side and placed my leg between hers. It opened her for me, but she was paying attention to the fingers I was trailing on her stomach. I was moving them up and down. She was pushing herself against them trying to make me decide to go north or south as long as I added more fuel to the fire.\n\nI had decided what I wanted from her body so I went south. I touched her pussy lips, and she tried to wriggle away. She hesitated when I split her lips with two fingers and rubbed gently on her clit. She raised her hips as I circled her clit in gentle movements. She moaned as her body found an avenue of release. She opened her mouth, and her tongue extended into mine for the first time. The hunger in her loins was spreading outward, and it was driving her to mindless need. She turned into me and tightened her arms around my neck as pleasure exploded from her clit. She screamed into my mouth, and her tears burned my face with their heat. She gasped her way down from the clouds but did not release her tight grip on my neck.\n\nTrust shined out her eyes as she looked at me, and it was the first step.\n\nI pulled her back up to her knees and stepped off the bed. She held on to me, and we kissed some more. I took her arms from around my neck and put her hands on my hard cock. She studied it with her hands but hid from the knowledge she was gaining in my kisses. I cupped her face in my hands and looked at her. I took a step back and applied gentle pressure to make her drop her head.\n\nShe trusted me and wanted to give me anything that resembled what she had felt. She looked unsure but moved downwards until her breath was on my cock.\n\nShe looked up at me.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I whispered to her smiling.\n\nShe dropped her head so that she was breathing on me again. The first touch of her kiss made my cock surge at her. She giggled because she had to grip tightly to hold my cock still. She kissed me again and looked up. I let her see the pleasure I felt at the sight of her innocence being pushed back by my body. She stared at me and extended her tongue. She tasted me and giggled again at the strangeness. She pushed my cock up and looked at my ball sac. She was curious so she moved to lick me there also. I was sensitive so my cock jerked in her hand. She giggled against my skin as she tried to make me react to her touch. She got the same reaction every time her tongue touched my testicles and she settled down to enjoy the power she had. The long strokes of her tongue forced me to action. I took her head back in my hands and put my cock on her lips. She looked up at me, and I pushed forward taking her mouth. She brought her hands up to the inside of my hips but did not fight me. She had taken me to this point and the small loss of control was a reward.\n\nIt took only a couple of slow strokes in and out of her mouth as she learned how to give a man pleasure before I came. It was an appetizing orgasm, not complete as she choked a little in surprise. She did not know how to finish it correctly so it left a lot of the desire unfulfilled.\n\nShe looked up at me in disappointment knowing somehow that she could have exercised more power in those moments. I got off the bed and went into the bathroom. I grabbed a glass of water and a towel. Outside, I wiped the cum from where it had hit her body, and she drank the water to clear out the flavor that was left.\n\nShe handed me the glass and I put by the night side table. I grabbed her legs and pulled her to the edge of the bed. She gave a small yelp of surprise as she tumbled backwards. She gave another yelp and tried to push me away when I licked her for the first time.\n\nShe tasted of a remembered innocence.\n\nI did not bother with preliminaries and brought my tongue to her clit as soon as I recognized the flavor of her inexperience. I used long strokes like she had on my testicles. They affected her like I had been except she tried to pull away. I wrapped my arms around her thighs and kept her in place. She screamed as I concentrated on her clit exclusively. She fought even harder to get away until her body decided it actually wanted more contact. She pushed her pussy at me and tried to sit up at the same time. She let out a scream when her body caved under the pleasure I was flooding her with. She tried to get away again when I did not stop but I tightened my hold on her. She screamed again when I forced another crest of sensation.\n\nI stood up but she was in a maelstrom of physical sensation so did not react. I pushed down on her legs so that her knees were by her breasts exposing her pussy. She reacted to the warmth of my cockhead as I found her opening in my first thrust. She arched her back as I entered to her body resistance. She sat up and looked at our joining but did not react in fear. I pulled back and ripped aside what was left of her maidenhood. I thrust into her without remorse at her scream of surprised pain until I was fully inside her body. Her hands came up, and she clawed at my sides in reaction. I pushed her legs down harder and pulled back. I thrust into her taking the last reserves of depth her body had to give. The pain passed quickly until she felt only the discomfort and the mental side of knowing she was a woman in more than just years.\n\nI relaxed inside her and enjoyed the tight feel of her as she surrounded me. I felt her body fighting me, accepting me, and then caressing me in passionate curiousity. I waited for the experimental movement of her hips before I made her body mine. I pulled back and thrust completely into her again. She reacted with a small amount of trepidation but the discomfort was equal to the pleasure. She had been prepared by the pleasure of foreplay to want more, and she relaxed reaching for what was left for her to experience.\n\nI used long possessive thrusts out and into her. She brought her hands to my hips and stroked my flesh in a desire for more power without knowing what she was asking for. I gave in to her request and sped up my thrusts. She dug her nails into me in thanks and to spur me to harder thrusts. I toned the speed down but added force to my downward thrust into her.\n\nHer first orgasm with a man inside her surprised her in the difference. She thought she knew what it would be like, but her eyes opened wide as the orgasm centered inside of her body instead of her clit. I knew it felt more complete because her pussy squeezed me hard insisting I join her in pleasure. I thrust one more time into her and let the orgasmic pleasure of her body caress me deep inside. It took me from the edge and over as her body cradled me to take my seed. I pulled back and thrust again. Her mind rewarded her by releasing a smaller explosion of pleasure as I gave her more wet warmth to hold inside her.\n\nNo one questioned it when I announced that they should try to stay in town the next few days. The Sheriff looked like he was going to protest but his renewed courage only got me eye contact. I let him see again that he would die with everyone else if he got in my way. He waved at Sally for a drink.\n\nThe drive was long but it was one of the few storage facilities that had met my needs. The drive back was relaxing, and I arrived at the same location my sister had parked her car when she took pictures of the Merchant house. She had written everything down, as had been her organized way since I could remember. Her notes were all I needed as scouting and to plan for expected reactions.\n\nThe rest of the Merchants would be waiting in their den. It had been a deathtrap for anyone that had entered it, and they would feel safe waiting for me there. They knew I was coming; the deaths had been too specific. I knew the Sheriff at least would have given them details to keep himself alive even the littlest bit longer.\n\nI changed into the clothing I had prepared for the night. The parking site was about two hundred meters from the location that my sister had used for her pictures. I used the time getting to the second site to adjust to the light and sounds of the falling night. They were creatures of habit and I did not expect to wait long.\n\nI was only watching the house for an hour before the oldest son came out. He did not have the size of his stalking shadows or the looks of the bait but even from the scope I could tell he was the most dangerous.\n\nThe bullet from my rifle went through his left knee. His death would not have required a scope, but that was not my purpose. The bullet was solid ball and the powder was the most I could load in the shell safely. The lead went through bone and cartilage coming out the other side in almost the same shape it had entered. The exit wound would only be a little bigger than the entrance. His knee was not shattered so much as it now had a nearly perfect .308 hole through it.\n\nThe night echoed his scream and lights came on in the house. I had one shot at a shadow in a window but I had a life to save. I moved slowly watching the house. The lights went off but a bullet next to a still visible figure made it pull back into the darkness. Another bullet into the house from meters away from the now unconscious body left me secure enough to tie a tourniquet on the leg I had shot. I handcuffed his arms behind his back.\n\nI moved around the back of the house and shot the fleeing woman with the tranquilizer. She did not feel it and kept running. She dropped after about fifty more meters since I had used a gentle drug to make sure there were no accidents. I shot a couple of times into the house to get the old man's head down and handcuffed the woman.\n\nI gave the old man a half-hour to think about his fate before I broke an upstairs window and entered the house through the back door. The old man shot into the room the window had broken in placing his location for me. The house was unfamiliar inside, but his confusion at the empty room gave me time. He was turning out of the room when the dart hit him in the throat. His hands moved to his neck but a couple of shots rushed him backwards into the room. I heard his body collapse a minute later. I had to be careful because he was out of my sight but five minutes later I had him handcuffed also. I checked out the rest of the house. The basement had flanks of their latest victim hanging from hooks but my sister's head count had been correct.\n\nI dragged the old man beside his son and moved the old woman to the same location. I ran to the car and pulled it next to the bodies.\n\nIt was a long night setting up the crosses and stands for them. I drove in three cross setups into the ground. The setups were four planks wired together with an opening for the cross when I propped it up. I tranqued the Merchants again before I tied each to their cross. The crosses were as tall as I could make them and still be able to stand them up on my own.\n\nI did the oldest son first. I tied him securely to the cross but not enough so that it prevented blood flow. I stood the cross up on its side and slid it back into the gap between planks. I had run a rope through the cross but it was still a tough pull back to stand it up. I leaned it on the opposite side of the opening and tied the rope off to the car. I hammered long nails into the planks closing the gap. I closed the wire loops so that the planks could hold the cross up on their own.\n\nThe old woman and man were easier to do since they did not weigh as much as their son. I went into the house and brought a chair for my sister and I. The funeral home had done a good job with her face. I sat her gently in the chair so that she faced the Merchants.\n\nI placed the cooler of food next to my chair and waited.\n\nExposure and starvation take a long time compared to how much faster modern technology can bring death. The blood loss made the son the first to leave us. The ravens pecking at his flesh broke the parents. The son had threatened me but was too weak even from the beginning to make it meaningful. The old woman had harangued her words at me while the old man had threatened also. The first peck of the ravens at their live flesh made them plead for their life. The screaming made the ravens fly away for a couple of hours but the braver ones came back. They settled in to make a meal of the son, and it taught the father and mother fear.\n\nThey lived in horror for their extra day of wakefulness. Eventually their bodies gave in and unconscious took them. I decided not to wait and set their crosses on fire. The pain was enough to wake them from a near painless death as a fiery one embraced them instead. I set the son on fire only after their crosses collapsed. The house burned like it was made of tinder.\n\nIt was early afternoon so I found the burial spot for my sister without a problem. It was hot work digging the hole and lowering her casket into it. I buried the straight razor, garrote, sheriff's shotgun, shotgun pistol, rifle and pieces of the crosses with her.\n\nI walked back into the town and they were waiting for me. The fire was still burning in the horizon but no one asked me any questions. The Sheriff looked angry with me. I kicked him solidly in the groin as I passed him. The kick to the head knocked him out resolving any possible problems.\n\n\"Lock him in a cell,\" I told the sycophants. Their eyes were wide with fear even greater than the one they had felt around Deputy Gus. The townsfolk had taken a step back from me and it cleared the road to the hotel.\n\nSally put a glass of ice water by my hand before I sat down. Most of the townsfolk stayed outside wanting to make sure I left them alone. Melissa and Karen came inside. They helped Sally make a meal for me. It was the first real meal I had in a few days. They stood around me waiting to see what was next.\n\nI pointed all three of them towards my room. They gave each other surprised looks, but the Merchant home was like a burning bush reminding them what I was.\n\nIt was the first time in years I had been with more than one woman.\n\nSally getting out of the bed woke me up. I went back to sleep when the sensor marked her passage downstairs. I only slept an hour after that. I decided against having either of the two women left when I woke up. They were cuddled naked against each other; Karen was wrapped in her mother's arms, and they slept without fear for the first time in years. The night had given them security of being the pleasure of the only thing they feared now.\n\nSally put breakfast in front of me when I came downstairs and sat down. I smiled at her and used the throwaway cellphone I had been given. I ate while the hotel filled with people. They were watching me carefully afraid to make too many moves, which might make me decide that I had not fed enough yet.\n\nI walked outside and watched the purposeful cloud of dust that approached the town from the same west that I had entered it. The people put hands above their eyes and watched it with me.\n\nI turned east and started to walk out of town.\n\n\"Wait!\" Sally said reaching out an arm. I turned towards her.\n\n\"You're not Agent Lyndell,\" she stated. The townsfolk were looking at her, angry that she had forestalled their escape.\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked.\n\n\"Jason,\" I said. \"Jason Stewart.\"\n\nSally nodded to herself as her eyes blanked for a moment.\n\n\"Catherine said it would be okay,\" she told me. \"She said the worst that could happen was you would come.\"\n\nMy sister had said something similar to me once. We had been huddled in my room as our father had rampaged through the house looking for us. She had touched my face and turned to be the focus of his disappointments.\n\nI held on to her hand.\n\n\"The worst that will happen is you'll kill daddy someday,\" she whispered to me.\n\n\"She would say that,\" I said before turning and walking out of Conception.\n\n-----\n\nEPILOGUE: ONE MONTH LATER\n\nThe Senator was standing next to the tree that the Mexicans had almost crashed into avoiding his youngest daughter. One of the men was now their driver, and the other accompanied his daughter wherever she went. Their legal immigration had been pushed through the system at the Senator's request.\n\nHis youngest daughter stood staring at the words carved into the tree.\n\n<p align=center>R.I.S.\nCatherine Stewart\nLoving Sister</p>\n\n\"What does it mean?\" she asked her father.\n\n\"Rest In Silence,\" the Senator said the words he had been given.\n\n\"He did it for her?\" she asked looking at her father with only some of the fear that had lived there for four months.",
        "\"I don't know,\" he told her honestly. It was a question that had haunted him since the details of the Merchant massacre, the FBI's name for it, came out.\n\nThe FBI's interest had been focused on a body count of Merchant victims when the first non-family body had been found. The death of an FBI agent and a Senator's oldest daughter at the hands of the Merchants had also made its way to the public realm.\n\nThe FBI Director had insisted the investigation of the Merchant family deaths had to take a backseat to identifying as many of their victims as possible. The Senator had made a statement that families around the country had a right to know if this was the hole that had taken their children. Individual FBI agents when cornered had admitted that the Merchants had been professionally executed. As a group, they believed someone had followed a missing family member to the Merchants; the best way to find that person was to identify the victims, they explained to the media.\n\n\"How many people did they kill?\" she asked leaning down and taking a flower from the well-cared gravesite. The women in town had told her they did it as a tribute to their savior. She was as sure that they did not mean Catherine's brother, as she was that hers had been the only ears that would ever hear them say it. Their words had been unnecessary; her father had told her his version of the Merchant massacre.\n\n\"We've identified 55 remains,\" he told her.\n\n\"Only fifty-five?\" she asked surprised. He thought about lying, but she had seen enough truth in the death of her older sister.\n\n\"Those are the ones we're almost sure we'll have names for eventually,\" he whispered. \"Families with missing members around the country are taking DNA tests.\"\n\nShe nodded and looked at the grave.\n\n\"I'd like to meet him,\" she told her father with strength in her voice.\n\n\"That's not a good idea,\" he said to her but could not make it more than a suggestion. The Senator had read all the reports and had no interest in seeing his daughter and someone who could kill like that in the same room.\n\nShe turned her face towards Conception and listened for something out of her days of terror. She turned her back to the town and looked at her father.\n\n\"I'd rather be afraid of him.\" "
