        "Once I arrived in Mexico, I was asked to stay on the plane by one of the flight attendants. I sat in my seat until the whole plane cleared out, from there a gentleman in a black suit boarded the plane and said the key words only I would know, \"Captain America awaits for you in his car.\"\n\nMy biological father was known as Captain America because of his strikingly American facial features. \n\nI deplaned and walked to a black SUV that was sitting on the tarmac. It was here that I met my birth father for the first time. He was just like the picture, except he had aged about 30+ years. \n\n------------\n\nWhen I had first decided to run I thought maybe I could go to a place where no one would know me and I wouldn't stand out, then I realized I needed protection. A few years ago I started looking into my family background and I found nothing. For the first few months I searched and came up empty, and then it hit me after about a year that my birth father looked familiar. I thought to myself, I've looked at that picture for years, of course it looks familiar. Then one day over a cup of coffee and the newspaper I spit my coffee right onto his face. \n\nInside the LA Times was an article, the latest on what 'Victor Guadalupe Lopez' was up to. I couldn't believe it on top of trying to put the pieces together my only clue had coffee all over it. I tried asking my parents questions but the answers were always the same. They didn't know much. \n\nI used my resources and started looking and there it was, all this information on my biological father. Almost forty years of crime and they could not prove a thing, all allegations. If anyone found out can you imagine what that would mean for a Detective in the LAPD. \n\nI found a way to coerce my mother to call him once, with the excuse that I was sick, just so I could see if he wanted anything to do with me. He said if I really wanted him around he would be there for me. I panicked and decided I wasn't ready and I never called again. Not until I had no where to hide or run.\n\n\"Buenas Tardes.\" I had downloaded an app, and that was the best I could do with my spanish.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Tiffany, welcome to my country.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I'm glad you speak English, I don't speak spanish.\" It was fairly accented English but it was light years beyond my Spanish. \n\n\"Is not perfect but it will do for now. Come inside.\"\n\nWhy had I run here, well I knew no one would find me here, not Jane and not the U.S. government. My father, well he is a notorious Mexican drug-lord. 'Captain American', one of the most wanted men for his connections, to say the least. Did I mention he's filthy rich? No one knows where to find him or how, he finds you not the other way around. And here I am a detective for the LAPD on my way to his personal home, no chance of anybody finding me here. \n\n\"I hear you been attacked, someone try to kill you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was working a case and I got too close to the killer, and apparently my death was the easiest way for them to avoid getting caught. Does it bother you that I am a cop?\" He laughed a good laugh. We were sitting together in the back of his SUV.\n\n\"No my daughter, I think it is how your people say ironic. We both make a living doing what we do best that is all. I do this to make a living and once you are in there is no out, unless by death.\" Daughter only two other people called me that. I mean it is not as if I am ready to call him father or anyone else mother. \n\n\"I would appreciate it if I didn't see anything too illegal please, if they find out where I have come to hide they will try to get as much information from me and I rather not know anything.\"\n\n\"Of course not, that is why your mother and I gave you for adoption. So you would never have to be force into life of crime. Pero here you are a policia.\" \n\n\"Is that why you gave me up, for my protection. You don't have other kids?\"\n\n\"No you are my only daughter, my beautiful Rosita, you look just like your mother but with my eye color, skin and eyes. You are beautiful.\" He stroked my cheek it was unsettling and I winced, but he meant no harm. He immediately retracted his hand. I had been on edge for a while now. \n\n\"Can I meet her?\" Bad question because he broke eye contact. \n\n\"I am sorry she die a few years ago, she never was able to get over the pain of letting you go, I think she died of a broken heart, doctor says heart attack.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" \n\nIt's easy to talk to someone who is a total stranger. Upon arrival he wasn't my father, he wasn't anything. He was just someone who was helping me out. I didn't have all the questions I had as a kid, none of them mattered anymore because I was happy with what I had, a loving family. \n\nAs a child I always knew I was adopted, my sisters and I looked too different. My parents told me that my adoption had taken place before I was born and at birth my mother held me for two hours crying and then she handed me to my new mother. I had never seen her after that but my adoptive parents always sent them pictures of me. \n\nI had hopes of seeing them some day when I was ready, but I was told I could only call my father if it was a life or death emergency. So, I put it away along with the thoughts of who they were and why. I knew it was because they could have raised me and chose not to. I only knew that they were Mexican, I knew the basics. I didn't care because they had given me up, not the other way around and I had a family and sisters who loved me. \n\nI had stopped talking for a while. I thought I would get to see her at least once.\n\nI wanted to learn about my origins so I could someday tell my kids but now here I was with only my birth father. I didn't know what to do or say, but I knew I needed space to process everything.\n\nWhy had I run? I know that parts really clear to me. The woman I thought I loved told me I was insane when I told her that her soon to be ex-wife was a serial killer. I had all the proof but would need her help to get all the evidence together. \n\nWe weren't together officially, but we were dating and like an idiot I fell for her. She was getting a divorce and only waiting for Jane, her ex-wife to sign the papers. Then when I told her everything I knew about the killings and her ex-wife's involvement, she tells me that Jane is her wife and how dare I say those things. She might as well have shot me in the face because that might have hurt less than those damn words. \n\nI don't exactly have a plan as to what I'm going to do but Captain America says I can stay here as long as I want. He has even offered to set me up for life if I want, without any connections to him or my past. \n\nIf I didn't have a loving family I might have done it. I never want to see Jane or Solo again. I'm going to stay here for as long as it takes me to figure out a plan. I'm no longer on the case so I don't feel I'm a threat anymore as long as Santana keeps her big, luscious, juicy lips shut. Fuck, no I hate her, I hate her so much. \n\nI cut myself off from the world when I threw away my cell phone in Ft. Lauderdale. When I arrived at Miami I left the airport for Ft. Lauderdale making sure to leave a trail somewhere in between and had a different taxi drive me to West Palm Beach. As far as they knew I was in Miami headed God knows where. \n\nIn between all that I bought a few prepaid phones and had money cards for each of the different companies. I was determined to stay in hiding. \n\nCaptain America said he would find a safe way for me to contact my parents and have them tell the U.S. Marshals who are looking for me to not look for me since I had willingly left. I would later deal with the consequences of my actions, if I ever went back. \n\n------------\n\nI have been gone for 24 hours now. I haven't slept in a while, every time I sleep I relive the morning of the attack at my place and the killings and everything and I wake up in a cold sweat panting and sometimes screaming. This is how it was in the FBI house and now I know it'll be the same here in Mexico.\n\nI was able to contact my parents and they said that Agents Solo and Butler were looking for me because I was missing. I told them I was fine and that I was in Canada staying out of sight, I didn't want to be in protective custody living like a felon on the run. I also told them to stay away from Butler and keep and eye out for her. I needed time away from everyone and everything. I gave them a guess as to where I may be and there were people that worked for the Captain (my birth father) that would alert us if they were listening in and went looking for me, I had asked my parents to not say anything. \n\nTwo things would happen; Butler would go looking for me or send someone who was not FBI or the Marshals would go looking for me. \n\nMy sister Tori had come on the line. Tori was the next youngest with husband and a daughter Tiffany, named after me, to give me a message from Agent Solo. \n\n\"Hey baby sis what you running from?\" \n\n\"The government, my death, everyone, anyone.\" Just hearing my sisters voice made me tear up at the thought of never going back and seeing my namesake and my sisters, hiding for the rest of my life. \n\n\"Anyone in particular?\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Agent Solo, asked me to let you know she was sorry about the things she said. Did she hurt you, Tricia's more than happy to kick her ass.\" Tricia is the oldest and like me has two black belts. \n\n\"No one needs to hurt anyone.\" I had been trying to put her behind me and just move forward with my life. Sorry, that's all I get after being offended she was sorry, she could go suck Jane's boob for all I care. However my voice had broke and I missed her. I couldn't sleep without her close by. \n\n\"What's wrong baby sis?\" \n\n\"Nothing I have to go now, make sure you guys stay safe and never go anywhere alone ok sis, please.\"\n\n\"Ok hun, you too and I'm here for you. I love you.\"\n\n\"Bye.\"\n\nScrew Solo, screw her and Jane and they could screw themselves too. Sorry, fuck sorry, REALLY calls me a killer, insane and full of shit and she was sorry. I never want to see her again. I need to move on, fuck I'm in a foreign city and I can't even speak the language. So much for sleeping with someone, anyone I really don't even care now. I need to clear my mind. \n\nWhat's the point of all this melodramatic crap. I've known Solo what all of a month give or take and I'm letting it get me all worked up. Twice she has screwed me over and here I am dreaming of her and our time together. I'm here wondering how she feels about me about all this. What's the point If something were meant to happen for us it wouldn't be this hard. \n\nHow much more of a sign do I need that she and I are just not meant to be? Psycho ex-check, liar-check, asshole- check. She was definitely not on the top of my list of great people to date. \n\nAs the days went by, I was able to really get to know the Captain, that's what I had taken to calling him, using his name or father just didn't seem right to me. He had tried to teach me spanish and I spent some time in the kitchen with the ladies learning to make traditional Mexican plates and on one occasion made some of my food for everyone in the house. The captain was upset that I was working but he loved the meal so he stopped grumbling. \n\nI had taken a liking to him and he talked to me about my mother everyday. I fell in love with the country and I didn't have to see any real illegal activity. Yes there were guns, but the drugs and everything else was out of my sight. \n\nUltimately I realized I couldn't keep running and hiding. After only a week and a half I was feeling home sick. More than that I was ready to move forward no matter what that meant. If it meant no Santana then so be it, I was a big girl I could deal. \n\nThe Captain had created an account for me where he would be transferring money so I wouldn't have to work if I didn't want to and he felt, to make up for the lost years. I didn't need it but now without a car or house I would have to find a place, refurnish and everything that comes with a new place, not to mention shoes and clothes. My insurance wasn't going to cover everything, if anything, since it was on purpose and all the legalities, whatever none of that mattered anymore. All that mattered was that I got out alive and got to live my life, not filled with anyone else's drama.\n\nI had thought about Santana everyday and with each passing day I hated her and Jane a little more, how dare she. How dare she treat me like that, I didn't fucking deserve it but that's what happens when you're nice and try to live by the rules you always get screwed. I trusted her, I let her into my life all to have it blow up in my face.\n\nI had gained some muscle since I spent my days swimming, working out, riding horses on the ranch and cooking. I was eating more but working out twice as much. I had so much energy trying to work out all the extra food, and emotions. Emotions I didn't want to feel; not the loneliness, not the anger, not the pain. I took up boxing in my free time, nothing better to let out some frustration than a punching bag. I really took to it, the captain even brought in a sparring partner for me. She was a New Yorker who did business with him and was in town letting things die down for herself in her neck of the woods. \n\nShe was one hot piece of ass if I say so, and I do say so.\n\n\"You're American?\"\n\n\"Los Angeles to be exact.\" No one knows that I am his daughter some people do suspect, because of my resemblance to him and my birth mother, but no one dares question anything here.\n\n\"What you doing with Captain America?\" She was wrapping her wrists, I had been training for about an hour so I was set. She was slightly bent over and that gave me a bird's eye view of her nice chest, within her nike sports bra. Her stomach was tight but she had nothing on my Santa's abs and stars. Her shorts were tightly wrapped around her nice ass. \n\n\"Staying out of trouble, avoiding death believe it or not.\" That one got a good laugh.\n\n\"Most people stay away from him to avoid those things.\"\n\n\"Ha, I guess you and I are a piece of work then because from what I hear you're here for the same reason.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that and I heard this beautiful blonde was staying here.\" She looked me up and down admiring my physique. I was a little bit more conservative compared to her. Standing in Nike training capris and a tight cotton rib tank top. \n\n\"Is that right?\" She stood up came to me and tapped my gloves to start a friendly spar. \n\n\"Yup.\" As she swung a jab to the face.\n\n\"Missed.\" Jab/cross to the face but she moved out of my way. She's quick, damn her grin reminds me of Santana, fuck Santa. Jab/cross to the ribs, HIT.\n\n\"I see were playing rough. Good luck honey, I fight for pride where I'm from.\"\n\nJab/cross/jab. None landed. We went four rounds a few hits from both of us. Until I finally realized the thoughts of Santana were making me angry and unstable. I stopped and threw of my helmet and mouth piece, and jumped out of the ring.\n\n\"Hey, where you going?\" I turned to see her coming after me. \n\n\"You just brought up a memory of this bitch I once knew and now I'm mad and it's not your fault and I don't want to hurt you. I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe had taken of her gloves and grabbed my arm. \n\n\"Look sweetie I don't know who she is or what she did but I can promise you I'm not her. How about a swim in that huge pool and then a drink, what do you say? It'll help you relax a bit.\" \n\nSexy beautiful woman who wants to have some fun with me. \"Deal.\"\n\nWe left our gloves and went to the pool in the next wing where I was staying. The captain had given me the guest wing which included its own kitchen, bar and pool. \n\nI showed her to the bathroom and she said she would be out shortly. I took off my clothes and put on a 2 piece black bikini, tied up my hair and as I finished a sexy woman came out of my bathroom. She was wearing a one piece swimsuit that showed of her back, her stomach and her ass cheeks. It was one long string wrapped very intricately if you ask me.\n\n\"Damn your even hotter than I expected.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" I blushed. \"You're a piece of work yourself, my names Tiffany by the way and you are?\" I put out my hand.\n\n\"Anna, you kick my ass then give me your name.\" I laughed as she shook my hand. \n\n\"The bruise on my ribs, begs to differ.\"\n\n\"Come on, swimming and drinks remember.\"\n\nShe walked ahead of me as we walked out of my room. I swear she had a heart for an ass, I love my ass and it's hard for me to be unbiased, but her back side deserved to be spanked for being so naughtily hot. She was a curvaceous piece of work. The string was lost in her ass but who cares it was really just decoration, the real show was those globes. Her breasts were smaller at most a handful, begging to be sucked. \n\nI'm having you for dinner tonight.\n\nWe made it to the pool and I dived in on the deep end and did a few laps. When I came up she was sitting at the edge of the pool wet and watching me. \n\n\"You know you have great form.\"\n\n\"Thank you, aren't you gonna swim?\" \n\n\"No it was just to get you nice and wet.\"\n\n\"Oh I see.\" I walked over to her \"Not into foreplay.\" I stood up on one of the stairs an kissed her as she wrapped her legs around my backside. It felt good to have human contact again. Our bodies were both full of goosebumps and it wasn't from the cold.  \n\n\"I was ready when I saw you in the ring, boxing was the foreplay, swimming was just to get you naked.\"\n\nWe stood and started walking to my room. We're both grown women who knew where this was going. \n\nI kissed her with the lust I felt for her, she was sexy nothing more, nothing less. The exact opposite of Santana, feminine and bubbly. No voice to make me feel dreamy, no power over my heart just a wetness in my pussy begging to be taken care of. My heart needed to be set free, it needed to remember that life wasn't perfect and those who hurt you only do it because you allow them. When you love someone you chose to let them get close, enabling them to hurt you.\n\nAs we walked into my room I shut the door behind me and slipped her hands around my neck, pulling my head back allowing her ample room to devour my neck. Teeth grazing my skin made my pussy tingle. My hands searched for something to hold onto and a great ass is always a good resting place. \n\nI worked my hands down her back around her tight globes. \n\nMy hands roamed all around unimpeded. Her skin was cold from being naked but my heart was pounding and all the blood was going south. Pulling her close I felt her thigh right against my pussy, I needed to be taken for a good ride. \n\nI walked us back to my bed and sat down with her between my thighs. I kissed her flat stomach working my way downward to where my mouth knew it would find a source of juice. She was sexy and willing and I was, not ready. \n\nThere was no hurt here, just lust someone to sleep with. Fuck, that's not me, I don't just sleep with anyone. \n\nI stopped and just laid my head on her stomach. \n\n\"I can't.\" She pulled her hand away and stepped back.\n\n\"I hope she's worth it.\" She kissed the top of my head and walked away. \n\nIt's time to go home and stop running. I have to face this. I have to stop pretending. I just let one sexy ass bitch walk away from me half naked over some ...some....ugh... screw you Santana.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\nI'm headed home today or at least to the city where I grew up because I have no home. Saying good bye to everyone proved to be somewhat difficult, I had grown attached to the people with whom I had spent the last two weeks with. The ladies in the kitchen that taught me how to cook traditional dishes, women who had worked for my mother women who taught me about my mother, my heritage along with some spanish. The bodyguards that escorted me everywhere and knew that if something happened to me it would be there heads, metaphorically I hope. And the Captain, my father who hadn't been there a day in my life but who in the time I needed him most proved to be a great friend and protector.",
        "Upon arriving a car will pick me up and drop me off at my headquarters. Where I will surprise everyone with my arrival. The Captain has arranged for my transportation, so no one knows where I've been. \n\n\"Detective Prescott, thank you for gracing us with your presence to what do I owe this pleasure?\"\n\n\"Shawna, I need a friend to help me out of this mess. I know I've been gone and I don't know how to deal with it. If I still have a job I would love to drop the whole U.S. Marshall thing and never have to work with the FBI again and will give them everything that may be left in the lab. If not then I guess I should be leaving.\"\n\n\"Tiffany you know you're an idiot. What were you thinking running away?\" She stepped around her desk and gave me a hug. \"You scared the shit out of me honey, Canada really? I mean what happened one day your in Utah the next you're gone and all your girlfriend says is you didn't tell her about leaving.\"\n\n\"How bad is the situation?\"\n\n\"First tell me why you left.\"\n\n\"I can't, you wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"She pissed you off?\"\n\n\"If I was mad it would have been fine, but to be insulted and called a liar is a whole other ball game.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"You could have just asked for separate security detail.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't have been enough.\"\n\n\"Well you have friends in high places that kept it under control and we said it was for your safety that no one know where you were and that you were safe. So now that you're back you can resume your position and I'll take care of everything as long as next time I get a phone call before you go and make a mess of everything, understood?\"\n\n\"Loud and clear, thanks.\"\n\n\"I heard about that Agent Butler. I will have to assign you a partner when you're ready to come back because of safety reasons. I also need you to see the therapist a few times and she has to clear you for active duty. Where you staying, Is Solo out of the question?\" She wrapped an arm around my shoulder as we headed out of her office. \n\n\"I said no FBI remember, I want nothing to do with her or Butler.\"\n\n\"Wanna talk about it?\" She was looking at me straight in the eyes, trying to analyze my emotions.\n\n\"Nope, can you give me a ride to do some errands.\"\n\nFirst stop I went to get a new phone and as Lieutenant Edwards waited outside, I got it under my real name, Rosa Lopez, okay my birth name. I had gotten an American Passport, ID and Social Security under that name, don't ask me how but I had one. \n\nSecond stop another cell phone shop, I put the other one in my purse and said I wasn't able to get it there. This next one I got under my real Tiffany Prescott. This number would be used for work and family. Soon enough it would start ringing with everyone trying to check up on me. \n\nThen Shawna dropped me off at a dealership with my side arm and badge. I was back and ready for trouble, I dare it to come knocking. My sister met me at the Rusnak dealership, with my insurance money for the car. The Captain had an order put in for a bullet proof, wait for it, Mercedes G 550 SUV. I mean bullet proof! That thing must cost a fortune. \n\nApparently he had not kept his word that I would pay for part of it and all I had to do was sign on the lines. It was also under Rosa Lopez. I felt like a bit of a criminal, but what can I say I've been a good kid all my life and a little bit of rebellion never hurt anyone. Especially, when such a beautiful car is involved.\n\n\"So now that we aren't being listened in on or followed want to tell me about this Agent Solo and why she was apologizing.\" I told her everything from day one up until my time in Mexico where I couldn't sleep with a sexy long haired brunette because of her. \n\nBy the end we were headed to my parents house to check on them and show them I was still alive. \n\n\"What are you gonna do now Tiff, I mean you're obviously not over her and she calls me everyday asking if I've heard from you.\"\n\n\"She does?\" That threw me for a loop, Tori hadn't bothered to mention this little fact.\n\n\"Everyday like clockwork at 8:00 PM. I gave her my number she seemed so worried and she looked so sad when she came by the house that night. I asked her every call what she had done to you and finally last night she told me she had been a total asshole and hoped that one day you could forgive her. She said she knew you would probably want nothing to do with her but she at least wanted to be sure you were safe and out of harms way. She's so in love with you. What kind of a spell did you put on her? Baby sis why are you crying?\" Loved me, how does someone say those things if they love you. Damn I'm a cry baby I always have been. Since I had 3 sisters to torture me, crying was the only way they knew I was serious for them to stop.\n\n\"How could she say those things, when I had been good and tried to be respectful of her marriage situation and I had killed to make sure she was safe. I had done everything to get us out alive. I'm not a killer Tori I swear I'm not.\"\n\n\"I know honey I know.\" Thankfully we had pulled up to my parents house by then and I just sobbed onto her shoulder. I stayed there for almost ten minutes crying and was finally able to settle down with her rubbing my back and begging me to stop before mom came out and saw me like this. She would send my father and my brother in laws after her, the in laws are marine veterans, both of them. \n\nI got myself together and cleaned up as best as possible and walked into my parents place. We had said I was happy to be home and that was why I had been crying with Tori who had shed some tears. We were really close and she was always the one who could feel my pain. She could always sense when I was in trouble or needed a shoulder to cry on. \n\nI stayed the night and left for my hotel around noon. As always the Captain had payed for two months in advance and they would not take my credit card for deposit or anything necessary. They said everything was on file. What took me by surprise was the knock on the door as I was about to settle in for some much needed sleep. Grabbing my gun and a steak knife I had taken from my parents house I went to the bathroom, next to the door and asked who it was. Yes I'm paranoid, to my defense an attempt has already been made on my life and I kind of like living, for the most part. \n\n\"Me, please open up.\"\n\n\"I don't know a me, go away.\" \n\n\"Please.\" Damn that sexy voice, but today it wasn't sexy not even flirting it was sad, she deserved it. How had she found me? It had to have been my sister who told her where I was. No one but the captain knew.\n\n\"No! Go away Agent Solo.\"\n\n\"Baby please I need to see you, I just need to know you're ok, that you're safe, please.\" Baby how that one word could melt my heart, how that one word could change my world. How this one person could break my heart into a million pieces.\n\nI went to the door with knife and gun and leaned my head forward on it.\n\n\"I'm telling you I'm fine now please leave me alone.\" I was so sad still, I wanted to be angry but I was just too sad to be mad.\n\n\"Kitty, I need to see you please.\" My heart was shattering I could hear the pain in the voice I had longed to hear, the regret, the loss. I was crying, why won't these tears just run out. She doesn't deserve a tear shed for her.\n\n\"Fuck. I didn't deserve it Santana I trusted you and you broke my heart.\" I undid the lock and opened the door slightly as I walked away.\n\nI heard the door close and I felt her warmth behind me as she stroked my arm with her finger. I had the knife in my right hand and the gun in my left. She took both out of my hands and placed them on the table next to the TV. I walked away to the window, crossed my arms over my chest and just stared. \n\n\"I fucked up so bad that no matter what I say I won't be able to make it right. But I have to try, I need you to see how I feel.\"\n\nI turned around and slapped her. Don't ask me why, because I'm not really sure, but I think it was because that night when she said those things I hadn't done anything. I hadn't even bothered to argue I had just left and that is what was left over.\n\n\"I deserve that and more.\" She didn't even bother to rub it or touch it no shock, just sad eyes full of regret. Sorrow and pain, no sleep, tired and alone.\n\nI couldn't be this person, angry and spiteful. \n\n\"I gave myself to you.\" I stroked her red cheek, damn it that sounded like it hurt and looks like it stings. She kept her eyes on mine. \"I gave you all I had to offer, mind, body and soul.\" I cupped her face with both hands. \"You threw it all away for her.\" Tears were falling from her eyes, but she never took them off mine. \"I hope she was worth it. Please let yourself out, you have seen that I am safe.\" I kissed the cheek that I had slapped and went to my bathroom.\n\nI heard the door close a few minutes later and that is when I started sobbing, then crying, then full on ugly face crying. I cried myself to sleep on the tile floor of the bathroom and awoke the next morning around 3, cold as hell. I took a sleeping pill I had bought earlier, my fear hasn't let me sleep, and went to bed. I found a note on my pillow, I sat it next to me on the bed side table and crawled into bed. Tomorrow I will try to face the world again, tonight I conquer my sleep. \n\nThe next morning my body guard, payed for by the Captain, showed up around 7:30 AM. I was about to leave when I ran into him in the hallway. He had the belt buckle like the Captain's letting me know he was sent by him. He was twice my size at least and looked like he ate steroids for breakfast. His arms were the size of my waist and I'm not small. He was in a suit and buttoned the jacket once I had seen the black buckle. \n\n\"I will be following you from a distance and when you go to work I will be outside waiting. I have been instructed to protect you and keep you safe.\"\n\n\"If I ask you to go away will you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nI had learned after my time with the captain that no one answered to me they answered to him and he just wanted to protect me.\n\nOnce at work I packed up anything left over from the case and an Agent Celeste Young picked it up. My day was spent going over files from cases currently worked on and a few detectives came in to ask for my opinion on their cases. I have an eye for detail so a lot of people stopped hating me for it and just started working with me. \n\nI got one call from Solo but didn't bother answering, I sent it to voicemail. I hadn't even read the note she left yet. I really need to talk to Tori about giving out my information. The voicemail was basic and to the point, \"I'm sorry here's my number call me please, I need you.\" I wrote the number down in case of an 'emergency'. I had no intent of ever using it again. This case had almost cost me my life and now I just wanted a clean break. \n\nI made plans to have dinner with Jordan. She had been in contact with my sister throughout all this mess and my sister was nice enough to point out how mad she was that I hadn't called her directly. We were going to have dinner at the hotel restaurant to avoid driving and any drama. She was being escorted over by one of the Captain's men. Apparently I currently had 4 men watching me, so I asked the one who watches my door to send someone to get her. \n\n\"What happened, you look...different?\"\n\n\"It's good to see you too.\" I gave her a big hug, I had missed her. \n\n\"What's with the driver?\" I had been waiting in a booth and she sat right next to me even though the seat across from me was empty, all I wanted to do was hold her close. \n\n\"I don't want you to be in danger because of me.\"\n\n\"First things first, where were you and don't tell me Canada, that is not where you would run to.\"\n\n\"Mexico, I met my birth father. He goes by Captain America, and my birth mother died a few years ago. I think Jane wants to kill me and is the killer we were looking for and Santana and I are no longer involved. That basically covers everything for the past few weeks.\" There it was, all out and all in one long breath. Her mouth was hanging open, I closed it for her.\n\n\"Are you kidding me the Mexican mob, kingpin, leader, druglord, most wanted man is your father? I'm sorry about your mom.\" She went from surprised to sad she can be so strange.\n\n\"It's fine it's not like I knew her. How do you know him?\"\n\n\"I watch TV and read the newspaper. Jane is a killer, that's hardcore, and she wants to kill you. Girl you cops attract trouble like the Mexican Border, sorry was that to close to home for you. I heard about your car and your place, it really sucks. Oh and about Santana, Tricia, Tori and I are on the hunt for that bitch, we're gonna, well Tricia is gonna kick her ass. Tanya thinks you should just get over her and move on, but you know she's emotionally retarded. I mean seriously ever since she became a Doctor it's like she feels nothing sometimes.\"\n\n\"Thanks but I'm sure I can handle her, I rather never see her again. I get Tanya I mean show me a dead body and I'm fine, most people want to throw up, it comes with the territory.\"\n\nDamn the tears, she pulled me into her when she saw me crying.\n\n\"You have it bad kid.\"\n\n\"No, I just can't believe the things she said to me. I was protecting us, her, doing my job, now I have to live in hiding with round the clock security. You know in Vegas we slept together two weeks straight. Nothing happened but for two weeks we slept together how do you say those things if you don't mean it you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know honey, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Not to mention the fact that the day everything went down, we...we...fuck we made love Jordan, the amazing blow your mind kind, where I knew I wanted her for more than just sex you know.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, love.\"\n\nDinner was the furthest thing from my mind, so I had it sent to my room and we ate there, well Jordan ate I just picked at my food. She stayed the night with me to try to help me calm down but it wasn't like when I slept with Solo, with her it was different, it felt right.\n\nAs much as I had wanted to avoid Agent Solo like a plague everything came to a halt four days later on Christmas Eve. She had called once or twice a day everyday since she had acquired my new number. \n\nA call from Virginia came through on my phone. I love that feature that tells you exactly where the caller is. \n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Yes may I speak to a Detective Prescott.\" The voice sounds familiar. \n\n\"Speaking.\" \n\n\"Good Afternoon honey, I hope Im not interrupting. This is Misty Solo, Tana's mother.\"\n\n\"Oh yes is everything Okay?\"\n\n\"Well not quite, Tana has told me what an idiot she is and how she has made a fool of herself.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Yes and she is here moping around my house like some lovesick teenager.\"\n\n\"Mm hmm.\"\n\n\"Now I don't like to meddle or get involved in her life, Lord knows I barely understand it, but I think she really needs you.\"\n\n\" She did tell you what she said to me right? As well as how our last conversation went? Not to mention my reaction to her.\"\n\n\"Yes and believe me I am not the only one who has scolded her on it her sister was not as kind as I was. You see the reason I am calling is because I saw something in you that only a mother can see. I saw the way you look at each other and it breaks my heart that you are both going around like sad puppies.\"\n\n\"I just don't know how to take all the hurt. How do I know that all this trouble is worth it?\"\n\n\"Look honey I understand your conviction in this matter and I'm sure I would be just as upset. But she is my baby girl and all I want is to see her smile before leaving me again. I can't answer your question but I know that you two are miserable without each other.\"\n\n\"I miss her so much.\"\n\n\"Sweetie you don't have to forgive her or even forget it yet. Just do me a favor and talk to her I know it would mean the world to both of you to at least hear each others voices.\" \n\nShe was right I had missed Santana so much that I would call my voicemail just to hear her voice. \n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Thank you my dear, God will repay you. Tana there's a call for you.\"\n\n\"I really hope it isn't work.\" Even over the phone she sounded miserable.\n\n\"Yea.\" My heart was beating faster than a Chinese Day Parade drum. \n\n\"Is that how you always answer the phone?\"\n\n\"Kitty?\" She sounded like there was a smile on her face and that made me smile as well. \n\n\"Yea Santa it's me.\"\n\n\"How are you? I miss you. I wish I would've known you wanted to talk I would've stayed out there.\"\n\n\"I'm not ready for all that I just wanted to...to...\" My hold on sanity was faltering and the tears were forming. \"I can't do this...I'm sorry I have to go.\"\n\n\"NO! Please don't, baby, please just give me another minute. Even if you don't say anything just let me stay on the line with you even if it's just to hear you breath. Even if it's just to know you don't hate me. Please.\"\n\nEverything was hurting and I couldn't hold it in, I started crying and I just felt so alone. \n\n\"I was such a fool. I hurt you in more ways than one when all you did was trust me and give me everything. You put yourself out there for me and I hurt you in a way I promised I wouldn't. I begged you for a second chance when we hardly knew each other. I made love to you and I saw a future so beautiful that I knew I was losing control.\" \n\nI had promised I would be strong but something in me forced me to listen. Something within didn't allow me to just lose hope, throughout all the pain I had hope of making this work. \n\n\"Kitty you mean more to me than my own life. That morning when I woke up with you I had a second to enjoy true bliss. That moment was ripped from me and I will never get that back but I want to spend the rest of my life making it up to you.\"\n\nWhen all the alarms went off I didn't think of myself I thought of the gorgeous woman sleeping next to me. I wanted to protect her. In that moment it wasn't about me it was about her. \n\nA few seconds of silence passed with me sniffling on the phone. \n\n\"Why couldn't you pick me? Why did you protect her, why did you believe her innocence and proclaim my guilt?\"\n\n\"Because I was a fool blinded by the truth that I didn't want to believe. The truth that once upon a time I had married a killer. I didn't pick her, I picked me. I didn't think you were guilty, I merely said things out of pain.\" \n\nThat sounded plausible.\n\n\"I'm not ready to be your friend.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I'm not ready to forgive you.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"I'll see you, when I see you. Merry Christmas Santa.\"\n\n\"Merry Christmas Kitty.\"\n\nI drove to my sisters house looking like a hot mess. Well my bodyguard drove me. Once I got there I looked presentable for the most part and slept off the pain for most of the day. My sisters were well aware of my situation and didn't hassle me too much. Needless to say Christmas wasn't that great for me. Only Santa could give me what I wanted.\n\nThe next week went by and it was basically the same, Jordan or Tori would have dinner with me and stay the night and during the day I would get a call from Solo asking me to please give her a chance to talk to her.\n\nI had no idea where she was or what was going on with any of the cases. I missed her but I just wasn't ready to deal with her. \n\nLieutenant Edwards had been by several times to talk about the case involving Solo and I, but there were no solid leads on Jane. I didn't care I knew that if I let the other case go I would be safe, not to mention Solo. If I never saw her again Jane would be happy. \n\nThe day before New Year's Eve, she left a message saying that she realized that I didn't want to hear from her so she would stop calling and let me be. It broke my heart all over again that she was giving up. What a way to end the year right heart broken, sad and alone. \n\nI finally gave in and read the letter. \n\nKitty,\n\nNo matter how many times I say it, I can't take back what I said, but I'll keep saying it until you talk to me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I said and for how I reacted. I'm sorry that you felt you had to leave to be free of me. I never wanted for you to leave, but how could I expect you to stay after what I said. I fucked up so bad that I don't know how to fix it, but I'll try. I now know that what I felt for you was not just attraction. I can't sleep without you near me. I can't function knowing that you don't want me in your life. I'm scared to go to sleep and scared to wake up without you. You were right about Jane it is her and now she's in hiding and I can't protect you. I made this mess and now I have to make it right. I won't live in hiding she took everything from me once and she won't do it again. I need you to know one thing before you write me off and that is that I love you. It took me losing you to figure it out. I need you in my life kitty, I love you. ",
        "-Santa \n\nShe had written the note before getting here, and I could see the water marks from tears. It smelled like her, I felt her in that small note. But now I have to realize that it's not about my life and my happiness, it's about my safety, there is no time for love. Jane is running and will eliminate the two people who forced her to run. I'm a dead woman if I don't find her first. \n\nDamn she said she loved me. \n\nHow did the tables turn from chasing criminals to chasing cops. I need my father's help, I need to call the Captain. What do I do about Santana, she gave up, she stopped calling. What did I expect this is what I wanted, for her to back off. What if something happened, but I would have heard something. FUCK! Why is everything so hard.\n\nI need sleep, yes sleep. Half a pill and some water, good night world tomorrow morning I will deal. Not tonight, tonight I need sleep. How sad is it to not look forward to a new year. \n\n-----\n\nWhat the hell it's 3 in the morning why is someone at the door. \n\n\"I'm coming.\" I got up threw on a sweatshirt and some pants and went to the door. Bodyguards at my door make me feel okay, so that I can sleep naked like at my place. \"I'm coming.\" I had my gun in hand. \n\n\"Do you know what time......\" At my door was Shawna with Santana hanging of her arm. My bodyguard Miguel was standing in front of them.\n\n\"It's fine Miguel, thank you.\" He stepped aside to let them in. \"Shawna what the hell?\"\n\n\"She escaped her security detail and went bar hopping, an officer called after pulling her over for driving drunk. When they saw the badge and my card in her pocket, they called.\" I helped walk her to my bed, Santana was just looking at me looking like someone had killed her dog. She lifted her hand to stroke my cheek and I grabbed her to set her on the bed and Shawna walked away.\n\n\"I didn't know where she was staying and this was the only address she had on her, I didn't realize it was your place.\" She was smiling as she watched me and Solo just looking at each other as she stroked my cheek. \"She really likes you.\"\n\n\"I've missed you beautiful.\" She didn't even stutter as she whispered those sweet words to me. \n\n\"I've missed you too Santa,\" I answered, smiling at the woman of my dreams, once again sitting in front me. Who says you have to wait to get what you want. Shouldn't I be mad, but I don't want to be. She knows she was wrong so what do I do, just let her come back into my life. What's wrong with me?\n\n\"And... I should go.\" I looked up to see Shawna leaving. \n\n\"Thanks I'll take care of everything tomorrow when I get to work.\"\n\n\"Good I'm going back to bed with my girlfriend, she wasn't happy I had to leave.\"\n\n\"But I'm sure you'll make it up to her.\" I said smirking, Shawna had an appetite for sex.\n\n\"Oh yea.\" She closed the door behind her.\n\n\"Hey drunken monkey, I'm gonna go get you an aspirin for the hangover you're gonna have and some water, can you stay here for me?\" She was beautiful, I had missed her face, soft with big brown eyes, and smirk for a smile. She leaned in and kissed my cheek.\n\n\"I will do anything for you.\" Her low sexy voice sent a shiver up my spine and made me tingle all over. \n\nI walked to my bathroom got 2 aspirins and some water.\n\n\"Do you know that you look so hot in sweats, Kitty.\" Her eyes were half closed and yet she still looked sexy. She was looking at me sideways as she laid on my bed watching me walk to her. \n\n\"Sit up for me.\" She was so drowsy \"Why have you been drinking?\" She took the two pills and the water and some spilled from the sides of her her mouth. I wiped it away with my thumb and she turned and kissed my hand. \n\n\"I wanted to forget....what I did to you.\" Have I already forgiven her?\n\n\"Nevermind, how about you sleep with me tonight, I'll hold you all night.\" I slipped of her black shirt and took off her jeans as she fell back on the bed. I wondered do I take off my clothes or keep them on, I was sleeping naked. But what idea am I giving her if I do. It's not like we haven't slept together before and made love. \n\nI hate her remember, she was mean and spiteful and she tried to apologize. She's tried to apologize and she said she loved me. If I allow myself to admit the truth it is simple. I need her in my life because she makes me feel whole. \n\n\"Kitty, what are you thinking? I miss you.\" I have to admit I haven't had a decent nights rest since we were last together and I want to relive those moments of peace as often as possible. I miss her so why not sleep naked, I won't lose anything. Hell can you imagine the confusion when she wakes up, mind-fuck.\n\n\"Baby, I was sleeping naked should I keep the sweats on or take them off?\" She struggled but she sat up. I couldn't hep but giggle.\n\n\"You called me baby.\" She stroked my cheek, it was like she couldn't believe I was there, truth was I couldn't believe she was here. \"Naked.\"\n\n\"Promise to behave?\"\n\n\"Promise, can I sleep naked too?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" I helped her out of her bra and undies and I had to control myself and remember that she was kind of drunk. Then I took off mine. \n\nI laid down behind her and pulled the comforter over us as I wrapped my arms around her. God I had missed her. Here I am sleeping with the woman who makes me feel all tingly inside and out and I wonder how did we end up in bed naked, when I was supposed to be so mad at her. I wanted to hate her for her spiteful words and yell and scream. But here I was stroking her head and caressing her leg as she slept next to me. \n\nTruth was I needed this. I needed human contact. I needed Santana to make me feel safe again, to make me feel like no one else can. I know we have a lot to talk about but for now can I just pretend life is perfect? \n\nWhat will tomorrow hold for us when she wakes up and isn't drunk? Will she want to run away and pretend we didn't just do this? Will she get mad and say things that break me all over again? I don't know but I have 2 hours of sleep left before work. I think I'll have to call out. \n\n\"I'm guessing you and your guest need some time to figure things out.\"\n\n\"Yea and Friday please, I'll be back on Monday.\"\n\n\"You're lucky you're good and almost got killed. No one else gets away with the kind of shit you pull.\"\n\n\"Thanks Lieutenant I owe you...a lot.\"\n\n\"Yes you do. Have a good one.\"\n\nNow to deal with sleeping beauty. God she looks peaceful, the headache shouldn't be too bad. What am I supposed to say. 'Hey good to see your awake let's talk about you calling me a killer and insane because last night we slept together in bed naked'. It's 6 in the morning she won't be awake for another few hours, I'll pretend to be asleep until she wakes up then make her worry about it. mmmm, sleep.\n\n------\n\n\"What are you up to?\" I was lying on my stomach and could feel something on my back.\n\n\"Kissing you.\" I awoke to her kissing her way up my back from God knows where, but it felt good.\n\n\"And what makes you think it's okay to kiss me?\" She stopped at my neck and I realized she was laying next to me caressing my bare ass and now kissing my neck.\n\n\"The fact that were in bed together, naked.\" She worked her hand down my ass and was opening my legs and my legs were opening for her. What the hell, do I have any self-control?\n\n\"We need to talk before we go any further.\" That didn't even sound convincing, it sounded like I needed her to take me now, I sounded horny and yet I was just waking up.\n\n\"I know,\" she didn't stop.\n\n\"Aren't you hungover?\" I thought at least a headache, right? Her hand was going up and down my ass, damn this feels good.\n\n\"No, I wasn't that drunk.\" She quickly straddled my back putting her nice warm wet pussy right on my ass.\n\n\"Uggghhh Santana.\" I've missed this, I missed her body.\n\n\"I need to make love to you beautiful, I need you.\" Oh God, help me find some self-control. \n\n\"First explain why you were drinking and driving.\" She laid herself on my body while holding herself up with her hands, gently allowing her breast to touch my back, kissing my neck at the same time. \n\n\"I had drank but I wasn't driving. I met an officer friend of mine near my place, had him call your friend and then pretended that all I had was your address. Then she brought me here.\" That sexy voice will be the death of me. \n\n\"Why?\" She continued kissing and now nibbling my neck as she decided what to say. Then went right next to my ear.\n\n\"You wouldn't answer my calls, I got desperate.\"\n\n\"Uhhh...\" She was nibbling on my ear lobe. \"How did you know I would let you in and not send you to some cell to sober up?\"\n\n\"I didn't think about that, all I knew was I needed to see you and hoped you would want to see me.\" \n\n\"I haven't forgiven you. Damn it you said a lot of awful things.\" Finally self control because of pain. I rolled away and sat up pulling my legs into my chest. Now I could feel the tears. \"I barely know you, why do I care so much what you have to say, if you're just another cop.\" \n\nShe sat up next to me. Now I can see her nakedness not just feel it and I feel so wet. Oh God help me compose myself.\n\n\"I know you haven't forgiven me but I intend to make it up to you for as long as you'll let me. I'm not just another cop, I'm your Santa and you're my Kitty. I need you.\" She sat behind me and pulled me into her. \"I will apologize everyday and show you that you are more important than anyone else in my life. I panicked, got scared and said some stupid things that made no sense. I can't take back what I said, but I can say it was wrong.\" She was talking right into my ear, I had to bite my tongue to avoid moaning.\n\n\"You were doing your job Kitty.\"\n\n\"I can't go through that again, what are you going to do when you have to face her or worse she comes after us again?\" \n\n\"Fight like hell to stay alive and if she has to die in the process then she chose her fate when she tried to kill us.\"\n\n\"Do you still think I'm a killer and insane?\"\n\n\"NO you were doing your job and you were protecting me, which is more than I can say for her, that fucking bitch almost killed us. She tried to kill me and get me killed, but her biggest mistake was trying to kill you. I didn't react properly to what you said, but after I spent some time looking at what you said, you were right. I was out of line to have said the things I said.\" She held me tighter, she was mad but not at me at herself. I was almost sobbing. \n\n\"Do you still question my integrity?\"\n\n\"No, your paranoia saved us. Although I do wonder why you were so prepared for world war III.\"\n\n\"I'm a detective who has put away gang leaders, murderers and rapist you don't think that just one of those would want to come for me, if they got out. I know what I do for a living isn't safe and I prepare for the inevitable, but I just never thought I'd be running from a fellow cop.\"\n\n\"You're smarter than I could have ever been, you were prepared. We will find her I promise.\"\n\n\"Did you mean what you wrote?\"\n\n\"About?\" I turned around and had her stretch her legs resting my head on her chest, I traced her abs. \n\n\"That ...you...um ....loved me?\" I looked up into her big brown eyes. \n\nShe had the biggest smile and the rosiest cheeks, she was blushing. My Santa was blushing. \n\n\"You know when you would constantly call me a stalker.\" I nodded. \"Well I spent a lot of time researching anyone who had your position in the area, but something always brought me back to you. Yes you were the most qualified, but I had been wanting an excuse to come see you and nothing ever sounded good enough. Then when I saw you at the party I instantly knew who you were because I had been staring at your files for months.\" She was still blushing and I started gently tracing her facial features, her lips, her eyes, her nose.\n\n\"I was gonna ask you out, but then I got the call and I thought perfect. This route would enable me to be honest with you about why I knew so much about you. I hated that I was your stalker in a weird way, but the truth is I was falling for you because you were so beautiful and amazing at what you did. I admired your work and you.\" I sucked in her nipple into my mouth it was just so hard and in my face. \n\n\"Keep talking.\" I kept it held within my teeth.\n\n\"Then...then...then we started working together and...and...I was sooooo scared of what not to do and what I should do...you make it hard to concentrate.\" \n\nI worked my hand to her pussy and she was wet, she was wet for me.\n\n\"I'm still listening.\"\n\n\".......I couldn't seem to get it right ......... I was so scared and there was this attraction between us that scared me.........I felt a pull towards you the way .......I had never felt for anyone.\" I was now massaging her breast while sucking the other one, and working a finger in her pussy. \n\n\"uh huh.\"\n\n\"I fell for you Kitty..... I fell in love with you......You're everything I have ever wanted and I let you go......I won't make that mistake twice....I love you beautiful and I need you in my life.\"\n\nI worked another finger into her pussy.\n\n\"Damn Tiff.... I need you...\"\n\n\"What do you need from me?\" I was working my fingers in and out of her lips and near her clit but not on it. \n\n\"I need you to be with me ....... give me a another chance baby.......I need your touch and your .....forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Tell me you need me to love you, don't be afraid to ask if that's what you want. I need to know what you need and want from me.\" I bit her nipple and pulled. \n\n\"I want you to love me Tiffany but only if that's what you want to give me. I'll work hard for you to love me....Oh fuck what are you doing to me?\"\n\n\"Getting you nice and wet for me. Keep talking.\" \n\n\"I ...need you inside me baby. I need to taste you. I need you screaming my name, begging me to stop because you're so spent.\" She regained her composure and rolled me onto my back and I was smiling my wicked grin. I wanted her to take me and make me hers. I needed HER to want me to be hers, I needed HER to do it. I needed HER to be sure I was what she wanted.\n\nI pulled my fingers up to my lips.\n\n\"Damn I missed this taste.\" I missed Santana, all wasn't forgiven but I needed to be held and wanted, not just by anyone, by her. I needed to feel like life was worth living. \n\n\"When did you decide to give me a second chance?\"\n\n\"After I read your note the other night.\"\n\n\"Why'd you wait so long to read it?\" She started massaging my breast as I pulled her into me by her luscious backside, I had missed her body. \n\n\"I wasn't exactly in the mood to hear what you had to say,\" she took my breast into her mouth. \"UUHhhh.\"\n\n\"So why did you read it?\" She put her thigh between mine and pushed it forward into my pussy.\n\n\"I missed you, you had stopped calling and I thought you gave up.\" Wait, why am I being interrogated I haven't done anything wrong. \"Why are you asking the questions?\"\n\n\"Because you like it when I take charge. Now, did you want me to give up?\" She worked her hand down my body to my slick pussy lips and started putting pressure on my mound but never entering. \n\n\"Honestly I don't ....know. I was just so......fuck.... mad at you.....I wanted to pretend you didn't exist....I tried sleeping with someone, anyone, but you were the only one on my mind.\" She stopped everything and looked me in the eyes, those big brown eyes I had longed to see. She wanted me but she knew she had almost lost me.\n\nTaking my hand off her she brought it to her chest. \n\n\"I'm glad you didn't sleep with anyone else, but you would have been in all your right to do so. I want you to see that I'm worth it, but I have to prove it to you first.\" I took my hand to her face and felt the heat in her cheeks, the softness of her flesh and the tenderness of her skin on my hand. I pulled her into me by her neck.\n\n\"I didn't sleep with her because I didn't really know her and a part of me felt I should be faithful to you even though I had no reason. But I need to know before we go any further where your loyalty stands, is there a reason for me to be loyal to you?\"\n\n\"Let me show you where my loyalty lies, let me show you why I deserve your loyalty.\" \n\n\"I missed you Solo.\"\n\n\"I missed you too baby.\"\n\n\"I need you.\"\n\n\"I'm all yours.\"\n\n\"Promise?\"\n\n\"I promise beautiful, I'm all yours.\"\n\n\"Don't ever put Jane or anyone else before me again, I won't be able to forgive you.\"\n\n\"I promise you, from this day forward you are the only woman in my life.\"\n\nShe worked her way down my body leaving a trail of kisses behind. Stopping to fondle and taste my breast, sucking each nipple into her hot mouth and lavishing it with her tongue. Tender soft kisses to my stomach and some biting, damn her teeth were driving me crazy. Caressing every inch of skin that was unexposed. Finding that when she kissed my hips it made me moan a little more. Finally making it to my pussy she went down one leg and up the other she was not to be rushed. My hips were moving of their own accord, begging for my pussy to be touched but she was relentless I was going to be adored. \n\nOnce she had worked her way back up my leg she turned me over and her trek started at my neck. Kissing her way from one ear to the other down to my arms, across my back, down the other arm. Occasionally sucking in a whole finger in her mouth, making me wish it was my pussy between her lips. Down my legs and back up until she arrived at my ass. She kissed and bit her way up down and around finally lavishing my slit. \n\nShe grabbed a pillow and placed it underneath my stomach. Helping me lift myself onto my hands and knees, she started again, but this time I got the attention I needed. Licking from the top of my clit to the top my my ass. Working her way back and forth licking, nibbling and biting. I felt my orgasm starting to build slowly, but it felt unlike anything I had ever felt, smooth and creeping with a relentless insistent tingle building within. It felt just like what she was doing to me, amazing. It felt good to be wanted and appreciated, tender and soft in the tasting of my juices. \n\nFinally she settled on my clit and flicked it side to side and back and forth it ached to be touched, it was waiting to be played with and once there she never let it go until I came into her mouth never letting one drop of me fall. She sucked in my juices, until no more was available. \n\nThen as I tried to turn over and get to have my way with her she kept me still.\n\n\"I'm showing you that my loyalty is to your pussy baby, now lay still I'm gonna have my way with you.\" \n\nShe thrust one finger into my slick pussy I could feel her thighs on mine and my body ached to feel her heat. Then inserting a second, thrusting back and forth until she inserted a third finger, I felt full and she was making me feel good. Once she felt me thrusting back into her she held my hips with her other hand and worked her hips with the thrusting and this orgasm was coming much stronger and its effects were causing some tension in my stomach. When I came it was so hard it took everything in me to hold myself up. Oh God she hadn't even touched my clit and I was feeling weak in the knees. \n\nI'm not the type to just lay still and be fucked all day long but she could have whatever she wanted with how I was feeling. She laid her body on top of mine and whispered in my ear \"Pick your pleasure.\" \n\n\"Let me lay back and you can fuck me while I feel you on top of me.\" \n\n\"Your wish is my command.\" I didn't even stutter, what was she doing to me. In one swift motion she had me on my back and was between my legs. \n\nAutomatically I wrapped my legs around her waist and three fingers were inside of me faster than I ever thought possible. She held herself up on her elbow and her fingers were working their magic inside of me. She couldn't possibly know my body so well I thought. When she found my G-spot shortly after and began working that inside of me I was about to come and squirting wasn't a choice it was going to happen no matter what. She knew it because she held off until her mouth was at my pussy and started working her fingers inside of me again. \"FUCK!\" I was squirting into her mouth and squirming with pleasure. She had me grabbing her by her hair and pulling her into my pussy, I could feel her moaning and the vibrations only made my pussy twitch more. ",
        "\"SANTA FUCK!\" \n\nI was so sensitive when she continued licking me I had to pull away. \n\n\"Fuck baby you do that too well. I don't think I can go again.\"\n\n\"I promise you, you can and you will.\" Oh that wicked grin and that sultry voice had me begging for more in no time. \n\nShe left my bedside around 6 in the afternoon because she had to go back to her hiding place. A marshal picked her up. I had the rest of the afternoon to figure out what I wanted with this gorgeous woman. I knew I had already let her back in, but now Jane was on the run. More than likely she was looking to kill us. I have copies of all the evidence against her. No one knows that though and I'm sure whatever Solo has is enough to put her away not to mention that she ran. \n\nNow as for myself how do I stay safe, I'm living in a hotel where all sorts of people have access and I can't keep calling the Captain. I need another house, but no matter how careful I am she can track me, I go to work and live a daily life she's bound to catch up with me. \n\nAt least I don't have to worry about Santana, she has all sorts of people watching her. Although I have to worry when I'll get to see her again. When I'll be in her arms again. I feel safe with her and I haven't really slept since I was last with her. I wonder if she'd be up for staying with me for a while. Although how do we explain that to the Bureau and the Marshals. Damn it and where do we stand?\n\nIs she committed to me, why didn't I sleep with that other girl when I had no ties to Santana? Is she willing to sleep with anyone else besides me, does she want to sleep with any one else? These are the question I should have been asking instead of just sleeping with her. Damn, but she is just so sexy and I needed me a Santa fix. She's so addictive like a drug and I need another fix, yet she just left. \n\nI mean it's not like we didn't talk, because we did but I really should've asked where we stood or lay whatever as long as I know what she wants from me. I need to see her again, I need to feel her. Why am I so addicted to her and that voice, it brings chills up my spine. Damn I want her ass to be mine. I need her pussy so I can taste her, be inside her, feel her pleasure and see her body surrendering to my touch.\n\nWhen the hell did I turn into such a horny person. Fuck I'm wet just thinking of her. What the hell is this about. I don't think I have ever wanted anyone this bad. It was just a few minutes since I last touched her and now I need more. I barely know her and I can't sleep if she's not near me and I think about her all the time. Shit, I really do have it bad. \n\nThe truth is simple, I love her. When you fall for someone you make the decision to be with them. You make the decision that they will love you but they are human. This humanity will be the cause of a few mistakes that may hurt you. It is up to you to decide if working through these mistakes is worth that love. I love her and I'm willing to accept her faults and work through them. Damn I think I finally know what love is. \n\nI need to sleep, I need to go to sleep and when I wake up all this will make sense. Maybe I just need time to rest. \n\n***\n\nAfter weeks of living in the hotel I was moved to a higher floor and two adjoined rooms. I went in through one room and slept in the other in case anyone came looking they would get to Miguel first, I never used the other door. The Captain had made contact with me and let me know, didn't ask, he let me know that he had prepared a house for me to stay at, it would be ready in a few weeks. Also if I would have anyone over to allow for my bodyguards to pick them up and check them, he needed me to be safe. \n\nI weighed my options apparently he knew all to well how to be an overprotective, overbearing parent and arguing wasn't an option. How was I supposed to live in a house full of bodyguards by myself, so I thought I can have Santana stay with me since she has no place but how do I tell the Captain that. 'Hey, my friend/lover/fellow officer needs to be protected as well and it helps me sleep when she's next to me.' I didn't think that would work. \n\nJane hadn't reappeared so everyone had decided we would each, Solo and I, get partners for a while and go back to work as normal which was fine with both of us. We needed to feel like life wasn't being taken from us. My new partner's name was Matthew Aden Cornwall, nickname assigned by me MAC. Good thing for him he was an Apple enthusiast. \n\nHe was a few years older but acted as if he was 18, carefree and juvenile, I hoped he knew what he was doing I didn't need to have to watch out for both of us. I handle the forensics at a crime scene and then do my investigation with a Detective assigned to the case. I collect the evidence and with the assigned detective they do the investigation outside of the lab I do it in the lab. So I'm a detective and I don't get assigned my own personal cases because I work on most cases with other Detectives. However now Mac will be helping me do what I do, he comes highly recommended and I have come to find out he used to be a Navy Seal, I feel safer. \n\nHe reminds me of my body guards who still go everywhere with me at work they watch from a distance. \n\nSantana's partner is a female, Agent Celeste Young. She was working with her on several of the Jane cases. Solo was hesitant at first but since she had come to LA, Celeste had been key to her success. \n\n------\n\nI have decided to tell the Captain about my life with women, well one woman to be exact, Santana. Things are good between us we're dating and although it isn't official it is exclusive. She has to find a new apartment and my house will be ready in a week. Before I move in I need The Captain to know the truth, he'll be in the area tomorrow so I'll tell him over dinner. I want her to stay with me while she looks for a place and well with her near I feel safer. Truth is we work so much that it's hard to find time to be with each other and her staying with me allows for nights filled with love making, I'm a horny woman what can I say.\n\n\"Captain I have to tell you something and I don't care how you take it, you can accept it or not and that will determine whether or not you and I have a relationship.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me after I eat dinner.\"\n\n\"No I think it is better to get it out in the open now.\"\n\n\"Tiffany are you going to tell me that you're a lesbian?\"\n\n\"Well yes.\" How did he know?\n\n\"Good so now you know I know. Let's go back to eat in peace, I really love brazilian churasco.\" He was smiling.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I been keeping an eye on you from the day you were born. I knew from the way you would look at other women from pictures. I know you are seeing that FBI agent, and at first I want to have all your girl friends killed, then decided that would be bad for you. So I accept it, even if I don't understand it. There are many things in this world I do not understand but I accept, and I accept that this make you happy even if I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Thank You. So you keep a close eye on me?\"\n\n\"Yes and No. Every few month I check on you for a few days. Maybe twice a year and you're welcome. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life.\"\n\n\"Can she stay with me at the place you bought me?\"\n\n\"Whatever my daughter wants she gets.\"\n\n\"Thank you Captain.\" \n\nThe rest of the night was amazing. He took it a lot better than I had expected, but apparently he had had a long time to think about it. He and I talked and he told me of instances in my life he wished he would have been there for and not just had pictures. My sports games, my graduation from the Universities and even the Academy. He thought it was ironic that I had become a cop, but accepted it. \n\nI remember thinking as kid that my parents were idiots for giving up a beautiful kid like me. It sounds conceited but it was my way of coping with not being worth keeping for them. Now it seemed it had been to protect me and how can you not love a person that puts your safety before their happiness. For a cold blooded drug lord he has a lot of love for me when I looked into his eyes. \n\nNow to explain to Santana how I can afford whatever house the Captain has bought me and the car and the added protection. She's seen the Mexican American/Military bodyguards but I can tell she's unsure of what to say. I think its fun to just leave it up in the air. I've considered the honesty is the best policy thing but how do you tell an FBI agent that your biological father is on the FBI's list of most wanted people. \n\nNothing made sense because I couldn't be a liar, damn me and my guilty conscience. Only when I used to do undercover work did I ever do a good job at lying but that was more like acting than lying for me. \n\nFirst I had to ask how she felt about staying with me while she looked for a place. So when she picks me up tonight to take me home, I'll ask her. I get a ride to work from my bodyguards when I'm too lazy to drive, this whole having people work for me thing has made me lazy and snobby. I'm fighting myself on it but it's so easy. I mean I'm not rude or anything but they won't let me do anything or go anywhere without them so I decided to save the ecosystem and just take one car on most days. Then the hotel provides all my meals for me. They also do all my laundry and clean my room, a bitch can get used to this lifestyle. \n\n\"Hey Kitty, ready to go?\" Yum my lover looks delicious. She always wears her jeans kinda loose on her days off and it makes me wanna just rip them off and leave her in her boyshorts. The shirt is white and v-neck her breast are begging to be handled and fondled, not to mention that its almost see thru and her jacket barely covers that fact. \n\nShe was very casual compared to my work clothes slacks, dress shirt and blazer. I wasn't expecting to go out on a call today. It wasn't my turn at least. \n\n\"Why do you call her kitty?\" He is always listening and asks too many questions. \n\n\"Mac don't ask question to things you may not want to know the answers for.\"\n\n\"Uggh, she's so grumpy when you haven't been around, do you know that? If you guys have lunch she's fine, if not she gets cranky. Can you please take care of that.\" I slapped him right upside the head, co-worker or not that was just wrong and inappropriate and am I that obvious, she just laughed. \n\n\"Mac! Shut up you jerk.\"\n\nShe came up to me and hugged me right in front of him. I kept my hands at her shoulders. \"You miss me that much baby?\" Oh my God she had never been this open with me especially not with co-workers around. \n\n\"Babe, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Oh my God. It's obvious taking care of you, relax Kitty. I know she's your girlfriend you are so obvious. I could care less it makes sense why you've never even so much as checked me out. Let the girl show you some love.\"\n\n\"Listen to the man baby. He won't rat us out he knows better than to fuck with an Agent and a detective in line to be a Lieutenant. Oh and call her Kitty again and that slap she just gave you will be nothing to the ass whooping I'm gonna give you.\" Yup this woman makes me happy defending my honor. \n\n\"She's not my girlfriend weirdo she's my lover.\" I felt something in her react to my words, but I was serious we weren't exactly together. I had hated it but she never called me her girlfriend I was always a friend and I can't go on like this. I need some officiality, that's not a word but that's what I want. \n\n\"Oh I like affairs.\"\n\n\"Nevermind, I'll see you tomorrow morning.\" She grabbed my stuff and I went out the door in my lover's arms. That word does work for me though. We walked down to her car in silence until we got to her car and she was about to open the door. \n\n\"Lover huh?\"\n\n\"Yup that's what I always call you, my lover.\" I was standing in front of her leaning on the car but now she kept her distance. \n\n\"Why not girlfriend?\"\n\n\"You never asked.\" I got in the car, I figured this was coming but what better way to bring it up right?\n\n\"Your place or dinner?\" She seemed fine now, maybe it would be left alone. \n\n\"My place they're bringing Steak and baked potatoes tonight and the chef said he'd send up some of his tiramasu cake and espresso just for me and my friend.\" Ok that last friend part was a total accident he did say friend. But her facial reaction meant I was hitting a nerve. \n\nBut being her composed self she didn't say anything. The rest of the ride was in silence and I was on my phone the whole time which she hates. I was making this out to be a bad day but I was nervous. I didn't mean to sound hostile or anything it was just the truth. We got to my hotel with my bodyguards at a distance and they walked us up to my room. \n\n\"Tiffany can we talk for a second?\" I was about to call down for the food and had the phone in hand. When she says Tiffany I know its serious, I prefer Kitty although from everyone else its fine. \n\n\"Santana we don't have to talk about it, don't call me Tiffany.\"\n\n\"Obviously we do and Tiffany is your name. Is that what I am to you, just a friend or lover.\" She seemed a bit angry I hated seeing her like this but I'm not one to back down I'm too stubborn for that. \n\nOk so someone in all their senses would explain themselves first, not me. \n\n\"Both, a friend and a lover.\" \n\n\"I thought this was more than that. I mean seriously is that all it is for you friends with benefits.\" She was so mad, I better fix this if I ever want her to be my girlfriend. So I walked to her and forced her to stand close to me, grabbing her jacket and pulling her to me, forcing her to feel my body pressed up on her and know that she was the only woman I wanted. \n\n\"Santana I'm in love with you, you know that better than anyone but were exclusive yes but neither one of us has ever said that we're together officially, you never asked and neither have I. I just figured maybe you didn't want to with the whole Jane thing.\" She relaxed a little, her eyebrows unscrunched and she placed her hands on my hips. She has this way of killing me softly with her hands. She knows just how to rub, especially the skin on my hip bones, that is sensitive. \n\n\"What Jane thing,\" Her voice was just above a whisper my Night-time DJ was back. \"I'm getting divorced the lawyer said that with her being a criminal/fugitive it would be easier. Kitty I love you baby. I want more than just to be a lover and friend.\"\n\n\"Then ask me.\" I wanted her to ask this whole time, that's why I've been stubborn and not asked myself. She's married and well the last time she had kind of acted weird about the wife thing. I needed it to be her decision. \n\n\"Really, you won't ask me?\"\n\n\"No I can't. I told you I need you to tell me you need me to love you, don't be afraid to ask if that's what you want. I need to know what you need and want from me. I'm scared to push you, you said you wanted me and then the whole thing happened and I wasn't even important. I don't want to be just some girl for you, for anyone.\" I had tears running down my face and I was scared, I've never been insecure of myself and around her sometimes I felt insecure, I felt that I wasn't enough. She pulled me into her and I wrapped my arms around her, rested my head on her shoulders.\n\n\"I fucked up baby, and I scared you. I wish that you would be confident in my feelings for you, but I'm the only person to blame for that. I promise you I will show you that you are the only woman for me beautiful. You're not just some girl you are my woman, my lover, my friend, my everything.\"\n\nBut she didn't ask and now I realized maybe she just didn't want to have a commitment with anyone after Jane. We ate dinner together and she stayed the night watching TV but nothing happened. I was tired and insecure I just wanted to sleep. She seemed content to do the same. I held off on the question that had been on my mind I guess live alone it is. I'd ask Jordan but I really would hate to put her in any danger.\n\nThe days went by and I started drifting away, immersing myself in my work and taking more cases than I could handle. Mac kept me entertained through everything. He has been a great distraction in helping keep my mind off Solo. He always has this way of being able to bring up the most random conversations. A few days ago it was the why are there 10 wieners in a pack and only 8 buns, then it was how now male dogs can get fake testicles after they've had theirs clipped. He only brought up Santana once and from the book that was flung at his head he gave up on that train of thought. I hadn't seen her since that night, we had talked and texted but I think this thing we had because it wasn't a relationship is OVER!\n\nFinally I ran out of reasons not to see her when she showed up at the lab, after two weeks of being busy, on my last day of work. I was taking a week off to set up my new house I just needed to set up everything from my loft. My dad had bought a modern home in Silver Lake for me no more downtown, he said buildings were too insecure and allowed for too much traffic. The house was really modern looking. It had a three car garage in the front and that was all you could see from the street. The doors were that opaque looking material in the form of windows so it was deceiving. The outside walls were made of fiber cement shiplap siding, and cement walls between the interior walls and the outdoor walls.\n\nThe house was completely reinforced and had high-tech security and two guards on the property at all times, their quarters were in the guest house and they switched off with two other guys. It had a gym in the basement and entertainment to the max from surround sound in all rooms to a remote control for the house. \n\n\"Hey Mac is Tiffany around?\" I was in my office but out of view I hoped he'd cover for me.\n\n\"No!\" He knew I was avoiding her and he had to suffer my attitude. I stopped after only a day it wasn't his fault and he was a nice guy he didn't deserve my asinine ways. \n\n\"Detective Cornwall, I need to see Detective Prescott, can you let her know I'm here.\" Her tone was much more demanding a bit harsh not in the mood for games I see.\n\n\"Relax, he was under my orders to not have anyone bother me. What can I do for you Agent Solo?\" That felt...awkward. \n\n\"Can we talk Detective Prescott?\" Her tone never changed still...professional not warm or smooth just plain not the woman I missed.\n\n\"I have a lot of work Agent Solo, I'm off next week and need to leave everything set.\"\n\n\"In your office then, it'll only take a few minutes.\" She walked in before I could say no. I walked in and closed my door. I hadn't started the formalities, but I guess no pleasantries today.\n\n\"What can I do for you Agent Solo?\" She sat on the edge of my desk and pulled me to her between her legs. I was in black Louboutin heels and a black skirt. I had plans to go have dinner with Jordan tonight at this new restaurant in Hollywood, and had dressed to kill. I had thrown on a garter belt and stockings and black lace panties, along with a matching bra. My shirt was a long sleeve black blouse. I missed dressing up and I wanted to make myself feel good and have presence known to all. I had practically fallen into her, the skirt was so tight it made my hips sway because it was hard to walk. \n\n\"Baby why are you avoiding me?\" Oh that fucking voice again, why can't I resist her smoothness.\n\n\"Baby, not Detective Prescott?\" It was barely above a whisper her hands had worked their way to my ass and damn she knew how to grab me and make me feel wanted. \n\n\"Yes baby, my baby, my girl, two weeks you've avoided me and then you don't even tell me you're taking time off. I have to find out through the gossip of others. So I'm here and you can't avoid me anymore. I've missed you so much beautiful, I had to spend my days without my stubborn girl. What did I do wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing Santana you didn't do anything wrong.\" I was struggling to avoid wrapping my arms around her neck and just kissing her. So I placed them on her shoulders to keep distance between her juicy, luscious, plump, sexy lips. Control Tiffany, have some self-control. ",
        "\"Anything means something, tell me what I did so I can fix it, please baby I miss you I need you in my life. I need you're beautiful body next to mine all the time.\" She was looking into my eyes and they were working their way into my soul. Pleading with me to be honest. \n\n\"I just need some time away from work and to get my new place together and then we can get together. Okay?\" I tried pulling away but was leaning too far into her and was completely off balance. \n\n\"No, it's not ok. I've been asking you out for two weeks now and you won't give me the time of day and now I feel like your breaking up with me and we're not even officially together yet.\" She had pulled me in closer and our lips were only a few inches apart. \n\n\"Yet!\" Like it would ever happen now. \n\n\"I knew it, how am I supposed to ask you to be my girlfriend if you'll never go out with me Tiff?\"\n\n\"What?\" This caught me off guard, girlfriend, ask out, with her. \n\n\"Baby you know I love you right?\" I gave up with my hands they wrapped around that beautiful edible neck. \n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"Well I love you all the time and I had this special date planned so I could ask you to be with me and be my girlfriend, mine and only mine but then you stopped wanting to be with me. I thought you were really busy with work but you hadn't even wanted to see me when we used to barely be able to go without wanting to spend our nights together.\" She was really sad and her tears were forming so I grabbed her face and did what I should have done when my woman walked in through that door. \n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nI kissed her with all the ardor and passion that was inside me. The need to feel loved and be wanted was in my arms, on my body. She wanted me, she needed me like I needed her. My lips felt hers and the tenderness they held but the want that they possessed to be kissed. Her tongue searching for mine wanting to taste me, all of me. Taking me into her arms caressing my backside up to the small of my back. She stood up never parting from my lips turned me around and sat me on the edge of my desk. She started to undo the buttons on my shirt and I was not going to stop her I had locked the door out of habit. She worked her lips to my ear and then down to my neck and that was when she pushed up my skirt and I lifted my hips to help thank God this skirt stretched, wait what are we doing, this is my office.\n\n\"Baby what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Making up for lost time.\" She didn't stop for a second. \"Lay back, relax and enjoy.\"\n\n\"Why would I do that?\"\n\n\"Baby would you really deny me anything when you know how much pleasure I bring you. Now imagine me between your legs, enjoying your taste, your sweet juices flowing into my mouth, my fingers working you to the point of no return.\" Those simple words and that sultry voice sent a chill down my spine and up my pussy, I had goosebumps for days. The confidence in her words made me so much hornier. She was so fucking right, she could have me upside down right now if that's what she wanted. \n\n\"Fuck me!\" I was lying back on my desk, waiting for her to take me. \n\nShe pulled my panties aside and worked her magical fingers inside my slit to make it wet. \"Why is my girl so dressed up?\" My blouse was wide open revealing my lace encased breast. She was doing a marvelous job of massaging one while playing with her fingers inside of me. \n\n\"I'm going to dinner with a friend.\" She leaned over and sucked my nipple into her mouth keeping her fingers just teasing my entrance. \n\n\"What friend?\" I was having a difficult time of processing my own thoughts. She bit harder at my lack of response. \n\n\"UUUhhhhh.....fuck....Wonder woman?\" \n\n\"Are you asking me or telling me?\" Oh man I think I hear a power trip coming, this isn't my style and I hate playing games especially when I'm so wound up.\n\n\"Damn you, telling you, now fuck me or pull out. What's it gonna be Santa have I been naughty or nice?\"\n\n\"Both baby.\" I felt fingers inside and she waited for me to feel comfortable. Except if this was gonna happen she was taking my office fuck cherry. But this wasn't my fantasy well not like this exactly.\n\n\"Wait!\" I sat up and pushed her up by her shoulders.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" She kept her fingers inside me but stopped moving. \n\n\"Not like this.\" \n\n\"Um, you have a request?\" She looked puzzled and raised her eyebrow at me.\n\n\"Yes, please?\" Giving her my sweetest smile.\n\n\"Okay I'm game, anything you want baby.\"\n\n\"Okay you under my desk and me on my chair.\"\n\n\"So now I'm your slave?\"\n\n\"Yes, bitch on your knees.\" This is gonna be fun, I saw her blush, bite her lip and try to decide. It was the stubborn capricorns in us that had us here. But she knew I wasn't really asking her to submit to me. \n\nShe pulled her hand out of me and picked me up by my ass, God she's strong and walked me over to the chair. \n\n\"I'll eat your pussy while you sit in your chair but I'll do it because I'm so fucking in love with you and I love to please and eat your pussy but don't think for a second that we're gonna play this game, because neither one can truly submit.\" I smiled and let her know that I wanted anything she gave me. \n\n\"Fulfill my fantasy Santa, the way only you can.\" \n\nShe kissed me on her way to her knees and slipped under the desk as she pulled my chair in, took off my panties and lapped at my pussy. Holy Jesus in a taxi cab, I was in desperate need of attention and my woman was gonna make sure I was satisfied. \n\nShe started with her lips kissing my slit and slowly she worked her way up and down as I sat on the edge of my seat. One hand worked her way and softly stroked my stomach, as her other hand played with the straps on the garter belt, every so often pulling and releasing. \n\nShe took her hand from my stomach and worked it into my pussy. With two fingers in my pussy and her lips on my clit she had me moaning like a bitch in heat. Damn she worked my body like no one else ever had. She knew all my weaknesses already and I swear she found new ones every time we were together. Releasing my clit every time I was so close, biting my thigh when she knew it turned me on and pulling out before I could get to far into a state of bliss. \n\n\"You're being such a tease.\"\n\n\"No just showing you that next time you shouldn't jump to conclusions because your body starts to miss me baby.\" She pinched my nipple to prove her point it didn't hurt it made me arch my back even higher. \n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe thrust her fingers into my pussy and this time she did not let up when she sensed I was close, taking my clit into her mouth actually making me scream and climax. I felt every muscle in me tense around her fingers and she kept them working inside me pushing me further. Grabbing my thigh and settling me on the chair working her mouth on my clit sucking and nibbling. I looked down and she was showing me her wicked grin she knew I would ask her to let me rest. In this position it was a lost cause she had me right where she wanted me...begging for more.\n\n\"Damn you...yes....please....\"\n\n\"Please what?\"\n\n\"Make love to me.\" She started working her fingers inside again.\n\n\"Come home to me after dinner so I can show you how much you've missed me.\"\n\n\"Is that right and has Santa not missed her Kitty?\"\n\n\"Kitty I'm on my knees, in your office, after hunting you down for leaving me to my own demise for two weeks, eating your pussy under your desk fulfilling your fantasy and you would dare ask if I missed you.\" She took my clit right into her mouth as soon as she was done speaking. \n\n\"Uhhh......sometimes.....fuck....a girl just.....damn your good....needs to hear it.\" Now I was working my hips to the thrust of her fingers, gripping the armrest and pulling her head into me, I was in a zone of pleasure, bliss and ecstasy. I was sitting in my office, with the honorable Agent Solo under my desk eating me out and making love to me, how much better could life get.  \n\n\"Make me cum Agent Solo.\"\n\n\"Yes Detective,\" I felt the smile on her lips right on my pussy. \n\nA girl could get used to this kind of treatment. \n\nNo sooner had she responded when she had worked her magic once again making me climax on her delicious face. Everything inside me was being controlled because of the fingers inside me and the lips relaxing me down to a place of peace. Kissing me one last time, she took off my panties cleaned any excess liquid of me and came out. I was just laying back enjoying the happiness that had been waiting to be set free by this woman, my Santa. It was ridiculous to think I could live with out her, or that by pulling away she would stop wanting me or I would stop wanting her. I have to be insane to have believed that my body wouldn't miss her. \n\nI was still sitting with my skirt around my waist and now I was getting cold. I stood and opened my eyes and watched as she sat at the edge of my desk just looking at me. She held my hands at my waist. \n\n\"I prefer you like this.\" So I stepped to her, wrapping my arms around her neck, she worked her hands to squeeze those assets that were wrapped with my garter belt. \n\n\"And what is it that you are going to do with me like this?\" \n\n\"Let my hands enjoy the feel of your delicious skin. I've really missed you beautiful.\"\n\n\"I have a better idea..\" \n\nI fell to my knees kissed her pussy through her slacks, while looking at her. She was wearing a white long sleeve blouse that left nothing to the imagination, breast that made me want to suck, lick and bite to my hearts content. The abs that possessed the strength to wash clothes on, biceps that could pick me up and take me wherever she wanted. But those weren't the things I wanted or needed. I needed the heat radiating from that body pressed against my skin, allowing me to feel the love that was reciprocated for me. But not now, right now I wanted to make her feel the way I felt happy that I had my Santa back, and it was her kitty that was going to reap the benefits. \n\n\"You know I love you right.\"\n\n\"Yea.\"\n\n\"Now it's your turn to lay back relax and enjoy as I make love to you.\"\n\n\"You know I can wait till later.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you can because I can't.\" I undid the buttons on her slacks as she pushed her self up allowing me to slide them of her hips. Nothing else was said nothing needed to be said. I noticed I wasn't the only one who was dressed up lacey underwear meant she knew someone would be seeing it. You see in our profession no one dresses up if they know they're gonna be in the field. Meaning: she's not off because her gun, badge and cuffs are here, well on the floor with her pants, however the lace tells me she had planned to come see me. I guess word does spread quickly. \n\n\"Why is my girl all dressed up?\"\n\n\"I knew I was going to come see my beautiful princess.\" \n\nI then undid the buttons on her shirt beautiful, those gorgeous breast were incased in a see thru bra. I couldn't help but play with them as I worked my lips to the promised land. Kissing her through the fabric, licking and tasting that she had become oh so wet with what she had done to me. It feels good to know that you can turn on your lover without even touching them, that their arousal is due in part to what they have done to you. \n\nI let go of her breast to take her boy-shorts off, nothing was going to stand between me and that delicious extract that was pouring out of her. I was aware of two things at this moment: we were still in my office and now I was on my knees. None of that bothered me however, not even being on my knees surprisingly. You see I love women but I'm not gonna lie I do have a dominant streak in me its the alpha female thing, but see Santana is the first person who has ever called me out on it and it makes me want her that much more. \n\nI could smell her arousal and it only fueled the fire burning inside me to touch her, to taste her and feel her. I licked up one lip and down the other and I felt her slip of the table, I held her up with my hands on her thighs and she scooted back, resting her legs on my shoulders. If a simple lick to her lips caused that I am so ready to make this pussy squirm for me, so I dove in. \n\nLicking her lips and kissing her clit, never applying enough pressure to allow for anything close to release, she needed to know that she had to work hard to be with someone as stubborn as me. I was worth the fight. It's like she said, her body starts to miss me too. \n\nI felt her hips start to move with my tongue and I could hear her moaning, I knew she was close. Her body was growing stiff, she was waiting for sweet release. I licked my way up to her clit, sucking it in and she grabbed my head pulling me into her, but there was no where else to go my love. I flicked it up and down side to side feeling it get harder within my lips. Moments of silence, where all that was heard was the sucking of her clit, interrupted by her taking smaller and smaller breaths. \n\nI loved a woman who could scream, but she was quiet and it only intoxicated me more filling me with power that I controlled her body in this very instance. Only I had the power to give her what she needed. I was holding the key to her pleasure and all her reserve and composure were in my hands. Feeling that she was at the peak I pinched her nipple and sucked harder and that's when it started the squirming and the breathing and begging for me to stop, trying to pull away.\n\nThe huge smile on her face made me want to push her to new heights but later we would have a bed and maybe even some edible objects I could pour all over her, I was satisfied for now. Satisfied knowing that she was happy and believed me when I told her I wanted to show her my love for her. When I saw the clock above her I realized we had been at it for a lil over an hour and a half and was hoping to hell Mac had decided to leave and wasn't sitting out there. \n\nThat afternoon she kept my panties and I have no idea what she did with them. I was late for my dinner so had to do without for the rest of the night. I made sure to clean myself first as making love to her made so wet. We made love in my hotel room for hours straight that night and in the morning I asked her to stay with me at the house until she found a place and she loved the idea, even though she said it would take no longer than a month. I don't know what it was about this woman but I was in love and everyone who knew me, knew it. \n\nI felt a need and pull towards her like I had never felt before. A want to please her, to feel her, to have her with me, those last two weeks were torture not to mention that she wasn't with me during the holidays. It's scary to think that it had only been a few months and yet I was so attached to her being near me as often as possible. That month living together only cemented that idea even further into my mind. She did stay with me for no more than a month and found an apartment 15 minutes away in Los Feliz. We spent most nights together either at her apartment or at my house. \n\nMost people asked why we hadn't just decided to live together and honestly it didn't make sense to us or for us. We were two extremely independent people who were devotedly in love with other, but that was the problem neither one of us could deal with that truth. I was scared that I was so madly in love with someone when it barely had been a few months of even knowing each other. Then there was the ex-wife who was trying to kill us part, that should've been a good reason to stay close to each other for protection, right? Wrong, we figured separately she'd have to pick one of us to keep track of therefore to keep track of both of us it made it harder for her. \n\nWe thought that by moving in together permanently it would rush things and we were scared of losing a great relationship. I could tell that she loved me and that she really wanted to be with me but she had a bad experience under her belt. I wanted her to be comfortable with the idea of being happy with someone again. She loved me there was no doubt of that in my mind and the month together was completely perfect. \n\nArguments were few and far between but it helped our relationship grow, we were't always going to get along and agree on everything. I had fallen for her and I had to learn to accept that it was possible for happiness and love to be this simple and easy. I know we had to go through a lot but that was a part of our jobs. It was possible for someone to just come into your life and for you to fall completely in love with them because they were perfect in your eyes. Being with her was like being with myself it was comfortable we didn't pretend or hide who we were, she accepted my flaws as I accepted hers. \n\nDuring our work hours we rarely saw each other, only having worked together once in the span of a year for a month, that mission was a success. She had been offered a position elsewhere and much to my surprise, turned it down and every other after that. I had found out about them from a friend in the bureau and when I asked her it was simple, you aren't in those places this is where you are and this is where I want to be. This woman was my happiness. It took us a year to realize the simple truth we were meant to be together. \n\nThis year was not exactly easy but in all honesty is was the best I had ever had. Jane hadn't reappeared, we were safe, well as safe as our jobs allowed. I was working on my relationship with my biological father I had told Santana about him I just hand't mentioned her people wanted him in a cell. I had even found Jordan a girlfriend well I just allowed for them to meet they did the rest. She was Agent Celeste Young, a friend of my girlfriend's.\n\nI guess I missed the part where she asked me right, well it was simple and beautiful, the day after our love session in the office; those also happened a few times after that as well. She took me to a restaurant called Il Cielo in Beverly Hills. Very romantic and quiet and perfect. We had dinner and while we ate dessert she asked if I would do her the honor of being her girlfriend, her one and only Kitty and gave me a Tiffany & Co. necklace with the infinity symbol. She is my heart and soul at this point and I have no clue how to be without her anymore. \n\nI need nothing else in this world with my Santa next to me I am happy and content with my life. Content isn't right I am satisfied but that sounds like I'm settling and with her it isn't settling. I am a love sick fool and when she came into my life I lost my balance. The only way I know how to function is with her by my side. Its like she's a jail and I'm her prisoner, she is the warden and I am hers to do with as she wishes. I am hers and she is mine. \n\nI never thought of finding that person that makes you feel like you're finally where you are supposed to be, but with her it was where I belonged all along. All I could hope was for Jane to stay away forever, from my lips to God's ears. \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for all the support, feedback and comments. They are always appreciated and I enjoy hearing what you guys think. Thank you all for waiting for the third chapter in a four chapter series. The next part will be up sooner than later, I promise. --MonAmante"
