        "************************* CHAPTER NINE\n\nLife started to return back to normal. Mostly... more or less anyway. I was still feeling a bit 'off' with myself and had a hard time getting back into a normal routine and returning to business as usual. But I forced myself to return daily to my chambers office and tried to get back into the routine of making money.\n\nLooking out my office window onto Silver Avenue I could see a lovely familiar face pass by each day, usually even every hour or two. Flerrie la'Clerkes, junior patroller with the Riverside Vigiles station had seemingly earned a transfer here and a promotion to Constable-Patroller. The ever familiar Sergeant Wergan was now ever by her side, teaching her the new route and the routine of the neighborhood. She caught me looking down from my window watching her several times, but she always just smiled and kept moving on. I was careful to avoid her while out in the street and if I saw her distinctive vigiles cloak I was quick to hurry in the opposite direction.\n\nI couldn't offer any reason for my reluctance to have her close by my side once more. I yearned for this in fact, the pain of seeing her so close but yet unobtainable to me burned more with each day! I still possessed the fever for her, and I burned... but not to make her my pet. No, after enduring the touches of the witches' evil thoughts I could likely never again take pleasure by using my gift in that way!\n\nThat feeling of misery and foreboding that hung over me only became worse one fateful evening about two weeks later that finally cut away the last thread of my old and formerly pleasurable life.\n\n<p align=\"center\">*********************</p>\n\nIt was the first evening of summer and almost the first pleasant day of weather that I could remember. There was absolutely no wind or air movement from anywhere and the day had been warm but not hot and as evening cooled the streets of the city a great fog had arisen from the river and the great swamp that enclosed everything around us in a dark but not unpleasant gloom. The mist was cool but pleasantly so and I let the cab driver take me most of the way home, but I decided to walk the last few blocks on foot. When the wind returned it would probably be either from the southwest and be hot and bone dry, or else from the southeast and hot and miserably humid. The odds were about even... and both insufferable.\n\nI wasn't more than a minute from home, walking down the main sidewalk and just now passing a small alleyway, when the mist swirled up around me, nearly engulfing me in a near physical shroud. I drew my sword cane and swung it wildly around me, but it struck nothing but air and tendrils of mist. Then suddenly the figure of the dead old witch loomed before me, as real and tangible as any being of flesh and bone! I felt her will again touch mine, but in a less tangible manner, lighter of force, but my mental defensives could not repulse her will or deter it any way. My limbs were frozen and my sword dropped from my numb fingers as I heard her ghostly laugh which seemed to come from everywhere. Her voice echoed in the fog all around me and bound me tight in absolute fear and terror for my very soul.\n\n\"May yee loathe that which yee'd loved!\" The witch uttered, in a voice that froze me with dread, penetrating me right to my very core.\n\nWith that utterance, her final witch's curse, she was gone and the mists slowly faded their hold upon me and could now at last behold again the sight of my home doorway, which I lost no speed in racing towards, unlocking and then slamming and bolting the doors tightly behind me, but the damage had already been done.\n\nIt could have been worse. To my limited knowledge of the Sylvan Gypsies and their curses, the very worst curse by far that can be placed upon a person is that they might 'Live in interesting times'. To be cursed with that terrible fate was probably unnecessary and redundant. That meant nothing but really bad luck, usually in lingering and extremely unfortunate and wildly improbably ways. I seemed to possess that general sort of misfortune already!\n\nTo be effective, curses need to be short and extremely precise! Bad stage dramas are full of long winding poetic utterances that bind multiple degrees of acute misfortune even unto the days of their seventh generation upon their hapless victims, but that's all theatrical horseshit. Curses must be used like the tip of a rapier, and with equally specific end results. Rarely mortal, very finite, but with a definite specific outcome.\n\n\"May you hate what you love\" is the usual imperial interpretation of the Sylvan utterance, but the two languages don't really translate well or cleanly with each other and the exact terminology of the curse is open for some debate. Still, it's said to be one of their very worst, quite on the level with 'interesting times'.\n\nOnce safely home, I tried to convince myself that I'd just imagined the reappearance of the witch. I'd seen her throat cut and I'd even seen the flames from the cellar flowing like a stream into the taproom to ignite her cloth dress, before I'd at last left the inn to safety. There was no way that she could still be alive! But still she had found a way across the void of death to complete her curse against me? She had been a witch of fearsome power.\n\nI didn't sleep well that night or for some time thereafter. My dreams were hag ridden, involving terrible atrocities that both frightened and appalled me, and failed to go away or even decrease over time. It took some time, bribes and eventually a small bag of gold, but with effort I located a dream-witch that watched over my slumbers for three increasingly peaceful nights in a row until the dream hag had been permanently banished. The witch didn't seem to think much of me and didn't volunteer any of her wisdom or advice to me, and declined to point me into the direction of any other witch that was powerful enough to relieve the curse.\n\nFor the next month I consulted every witch or Sylvan gypsy woman I could find, and begged or bribed them with purses of gold to remove my curse. Some took the proffered coins and might perhaps have done their best, but the end result was the same. Nothing. Some of the wise-women insisted that I was under no curse whatsoever, that my nerves had overcome me. Other insisted with equal certainty that the curse was quite real but too powerful for all but the greatest of magic to remove, but with the investment of more coins that they would each do their best to find a cure for me, eventually. I paid a few of them, at first, but even with just a hint of my gift I tell that most of the witches and so called wise women were frauds, and merely after my gold.\n\nEventually I learned of another 'cunning woman' who lived far away outside of the city, and I located with great difficulty in a hut two days travel up the northern rapids of the Orm river, and hearing of my plight she just laughed at me.\n\n\"Aye, and yee'll now also love that too that once yee hated too as well, my Lord Bounder, and while a noble cad you'll ever remain, I soon think that you'll find your misfortune rather to be a bonnie blessing in return. Keep your gold as well, for I'll not take profit from a man that shall find fortune from within himself, where he sees only calamity and ruin instead.\"\n\nI didn't have the slightest idea about what she meant and she just laughed some more when I asked her about cunning folk who might be able to help me instead. Well, so much for that last desperate hope!\n\n****************************\n\nA few days later once I was back again in the city, and now becoming more of less resigned to my cursed fate, Sir Adrian sent me a polite note and tended an invitation for the following Friday for us to play cards together at The Crown and I accepted. As far as I was concerned the two of us were quits, any and all of my debt to him now fully discharged, and I hoped that he'd agree.\n\nHe won two out of three hands, but the fellowship was pleasurable and no business, past or present was discussed, other than a gentle hint that the Blackguards had tired of involving themselves with current vigiles activities and they had returned entirely to their normal duties, apparently without any further interest in me. The accidental fire at the inn was accepted as an accident, and their new Major-Captain, Sir Helmund, was a much stricter disciplinarian and had put an end to many of the side businesses that the black-cloaks had been involved in. The Lord Coroner was said to be 'amused' by all of the recent past events and while he was apparently quite aware of my active participation, he didn't seem to bear me any specific malice.\n\nAt least for now, the Blackguards were being rather thoroughly reined in and some of the worse bad apples were being either demoted, transferred or discharged for cause. Sir Adrian even thought that the Lord Coroner's office might be improving its recent communications with the vigiles, and this would allow more effective and legally proper joint investigations of future felonies in the near future. Excellent news, considering that much to my fears, the guild war within the thieves' guild was significantly increasing crime in the streets, which the vigiles were hard pressed to control.\n\nThumbs apparently controlled a slight controlling minority of numbers, but not a functional majority over his other two smaller rival competitors. The aggression of Thumb's followers in the early days of the civil war had been nearly overwhelming and currently his two primary rivals had declared a truce with other and formed a temporary partnership together to jointly oppose him. I had no doubt but what these two crime captains would likely backstab each other too, but only after Thumb's was dealt with. This situation created essentially a loud and rather ugly stalemate, with the two opposing armies of thieves a bit too evenly matched now, enough so that both sides were taking a breather from the constant street fighting to regroup and better marshal their forces.\n\nMost of this was my fault. I didn't want Thumbs as the next crime kingpin of the city, but a prolonged civil war lasting for months or even years wouldn't be good for the city either! I'd need to do something about this fairly soon, or it was going to be a long hot and very bloody summer!\n\nThe evening was pleasant enough that I accepted the return invitation to come again for cards and cheerful banter again the next Friday. And again the following week as well, until our continued company together became a welcome regular obligation!\n\n<p align=\"center\">********************</p>\n\nWhile business slowly began to return to normal around me, I kept pondering the fateful words of my curse. \"May yee loathe that which yee'd loved!\" This was very direct, yet annoyingly vague as well!\n\nFor the most part, I'd never actually loved anyone or anything in my entire life!\n\nBeing a bounder and a cad, it took me a while to discover the rather peculiar manner in which my curse had at last settled upon me. In truth, the only person I really actually loved was myself! I respected Mumford... and continued to do so without any apparent change in my attitude towards the old thief, or his young apprentice nephew either for that matter. Nor did the presence of Koch disturb or annoy me in any noticeable way now either. I continued to respect them, but I had never loved them.\n\nI had no girlfriends either, or even any whores that I was particularly partial to. I'd never allowed anyone to get that close to me. I certainly didn't have any fondness either for my far distant family!\n\nBut I was narcissistic enough to think rather highly of myself, in the past... but now at the moment, not so much so. I wasn't possessed now with self-loathing really either, but I certainly didn't think of myself in quite the same way as I had done before. I couldn't really put my finger on what the real difference, the actual change in me was now... but the old self-satisfied smirk was gone completely from my face when I looked in the mirror now. The arrogant spring in my step and the nose in the air was missing now as well, and everyone noticed it... even Sir Adrian, much to my continued misery!\n\nWorse, the real power of the curse now began to become apparent! For awhile, to my horror and dismay, my gift seemed to be entirely gone! I could feel it there, lurking deep within me, but it no longer had the same sort of effect when summoned. In fact, when I was enjoying myself at a brothel, sporting a little with a whore and attempting to induce her into a few additional formerly pleasurable acts that she had declined to perform even for extra coins, I found that my gift backfired completely upon me, inducing her livid anger rather than her meek compliance. Nor could my gift then sooth either her or the burly house guardian, and rather than calming his anger, I enraged him and if I had not fled immediately upon my feet, a severe beat down would certainly have occurred.\n\nI repeated my efforts to use my gift, in different ways and manners great and small, almost always with unfortunate undesired effects. Soon I realized that more than anything else in life, I had only truly loved using my gift, invariably for self-interest and personal gain and profit! In fact, nearly always for some dishonest or sordid purpose!\n\nI was still a rogue, and a cad, and perhaps even still a bounder, at heart... but my gift was now gone. I'd been effectively and nearly utterly defanged! Now even petty theft gave me no pleasure at all. I kept trying anyway, but instead of the joy I used to feel at connivery, I instead began to feel physically sick inside. Business, my real former business... blackmail, burglary, theft and fencing stolen loot started to suffer nearly at once. The slightest dishonesty now gave me intensive cramps of nausea and soon almost unendurable physical pain. The once delightful thought of a clever petty theft now nauseated me, physically and mentally and even giving simple instructions to my henchmen could now cause me uncontrollable agony and vomiting. Soon, I couldn't even manage the simplest trivial burglary anymore! The curse upon me had been complete!\n\n<p align=\"center\">************************</p>\n\nThe final straw had been trying to handle the last final details of a rather clever robbery we had indulged in right before the affair of dealing with the Weir family. We'd learned that a particularly valuable set of pearls would be on display at a high society function and I'd allowed the thieves' guild to spread some very carefully crafted rumors across the city of their interest in obtaining them. That rumor now heavy on the streets by the day before the grand ball, the lordship of the estate himself had sent for me to consult about how the threatened theft could be avoided. I inspected the household and told him that the matter was beyond my mortal abilities, that not only could the necklace be stolen, it undoubtedly would be taken... and by at least three different means that I could already divine, by just my casual examination. I refused his heavy pouch of silver and declaimed any further interest in the matter with a grand theatrical flourish that Mumsford the old actor would have applauded.\n\nOf course, I had already placed a charm upon the nobleman that while he would ensure that the necklace was under double guard at all times. After the ball was over he would take the pearls from his wife's hands and hide them into his own pockets, rather than the secure strongbox where they kept their other valuables. He then would pretend to place the empty necklace box into the locked box, leaving a guard there all night long, seeming undisturbed until morning. I had also charmed the night cook's helper into placing a sleeping draught into the weak watered ale for all of the guardsmen and the rest of the household staff that night.\n\nThe nobleman handed off the necklace as commanded in his trance to Mumford, who was in disguise as a footman serving at the party and one of the very last staff to leave after the domestic clean up. The lord would only remember falling fast into a few sound sleep that night and would recall nothing of his charmed activities in the morning. Such was the case. The disappearance of the necklace was a mystery to all, until I suggested (after being hired once more for an even richer fee) that the thief had served at the party, drugged the household staff and then made his escape across the garden and over a stone fence, where a small ladder was found nearby. The footprints suggested a tall thin man, much unlike Mumford who had left a helpful trail of false evidence for me to 'find' and report.\n\nWe'd all been rather clever and now had I had been consulted and hired to find and return the very same stolen necklace that we'd taken. For a remarkably large finder's fee that was nearly a third of their appraised value.\n\nNow, here in the lord's study once more, staring upon a sack of gold for my fee of a size that even I had rarely seen before, I found myself at once awash with a sense of nausea so extreme that I quite collapsed onto the floor and only just barely avoided soiling the noble lord's fine carpet. Fat reward fee or not, pissing on the lord's rug probably would have seriously annoyed him. A little pear brandy calmed me enough to regain enough control to choose my next words with extreme deliberation and caution.\n\n\"Sorry my lord, the generosity of your kindness quite overwhelmed me, or perhaps the eggs I enjoyed this morning were not quite fresh, but I'm afraid that you are in no such debt to me! I obtained your necklace from the very hands that took it, but the method of my seizure did not incur any outlay or even personal inconvenience upon my part. The thief has already been induced to never bother you, or likely anyone else ever again and was more than willing in return for our forbearance, to quit his claim. It pleases me to deliver them back to you now... and instead of your coin, I would instead prefer your good word.\"\n\nThese were very carefully chosen words. All technically true as well. My curse would not allow or tolerate me to profit by my crime, or even dishonest deceit, so there must now have never been any such crime committed at all!\n\nGetting this powerful lord's good will and praises might earn me considerable honest business, I hoped. My days as a confidence trickster and roguish scoundrel were apparently over! Most unhappily and lamentably so!\n\n<p align=\"center\">*********************</p>\n\nHonest business did come, but slowly, and certainly not to the former levels of prosperity that I had previous enjoyed as a rogue scoundrel and a thief. But with time, meditation and the application of appallingly sincere motives, I learned that my gift could still be used (carefully) for situations that did not directly (or profitably) benefit me. With practice, I was starting to learn just how far I could bend that rather flexible concept of 'self-interest', but if focused for an honest purpose, my gift still seemed to be there... ready for use.\n\nFor as much as I now loathed that which I had once loved, the reverse was now somewhat still attainable. Being 'good' and worst of all 'honorable' had irked me to my very core once, but if I carefully applied my gift to those wholesome aims, I could cautiously use it... and with pleasure. Sometimes, even with a very liberal definition of expenses, I could collect some reasonably exorbitant but 'honest' consulting fees.\n\nIt was still a living, but I wasn't going to be getting rich anymore or at least anytime at all soon!\n\nWorse, handling or even possessing most of my prior ill-gotten gains or other sources of treasure didn't give me any delight and pleasure at all. I had been something of a greedy bastard, but those days were apparently quite gone as well. I didn't feel a burning need to give away all of my plundered loot to worthy causes or charity, but I'd lost any pleasure at all at owning it or even spending it. The goal of being obscenely rich had little if any appeal for me any longer.",
        "The way my household income had now suddenly decreased, I was going to need that nest egg to keep my small but well-paid crew employed in the months and years ahead.\n\nOne last sudden source of income also gave me a bit of trouble now as well. Edwina had told me where their family treasure was kept hidden, a fortune obtained by smuggling, highway robbery and murder, which had been buried under that copse of trees near the inn. Business with the Blackguards had been good, as had been the profits of their innumerable crimes. The strong box I dug up was quite worth the time and effort to claim. While this was more than enough wealth to compensate me for my time and considerable inconvenience, the chest of gold and silver felt black and dirty in my hands, it's very touch almost burned me and it seemed to possess a thoroughly evil aura. It was a fortune to pass up, quite nearly more hard coined wealth than my own deposited accounts and strongboxes could claim to possess, but after a long minute of running a thick stream of the coins through my fingers I decided that the blood curse across this wealth was far too potent for me to keep. I pulled up the buried chest out of the ground nevertheless and loaded it up upon a small wagon I had rented and ported it back home, into the city, but not before I placed a heavy fistful of this tainted silver into Tywusa's offering bowl by the bridge crossroads. I considered it a late repayment for the apple I had taken.\n\nThe rest of the cursed money went into various church ward offertories and other private charities. Divided into dozens of fat purses that were placed into offertory boxes late at night. Very anonymously and gradually over time. I hoped the money would go to do good works, cleansing the evil taint of those coins, but I never dared to enquire to find out. I was cursed enough already and didn't keep a single one of the coins for myself.\n\n<p align=\"center\">****************************</p>\n\nWith my improved reputation on the street growing, even Sir Adrian couldn't kept but politely wonder as to my very real and obvious change of leaf. The word was getting around that I was a man whose word was his bond and that I could help people in trouble, and take payment only in accordance with their means. My expenses would keep Mumford and company in clothes and drink, and I let them handle the old company business almost entirely on their now, without my direct input... but under rather limited terms. Still, they looked to the future and found my dismay at being cursed to live a life of enforced honesty, honor and respectability highly amusing.\n\n\"D'Bounderby,\" Sir Adrian muttered one intolerably hot mid-summer evening, as we took a short break in our card game to enjoy a pair of cool drinks that didn't quite relieve our sweltering misery, even outside the club on an upstairs terrace, where we could catch what little breeze there was to at least dry away our sweat.\n\nThis was frightening... the first time the Commissioner of the Vigiles had ever called me properly by my given name, instead of just 'Bounder'!\n\n\"I have a proposition for you,\" He continued, \"and you'll decline it of course as beneath you, but the offer is genuine and sincere enough. I have an imperial charter, signed by the Governor himself granting you an appointment as an official Imperial Investigator. It conveys a considerable amount of civil authority with splendid potentials for abuses of power and fiduciary misconduct. Most Investigators find this position almost a license to coin money! I'm sure that thought will amuse you. Technically, the governor is your direct boss, but you'd work for me, reporting directly to me... and me only. Not even my Deputy Commanders of the Watch can order to you to do shit, if you're not inclined. The job comes with a decent salary, about that of a military captain, but you would not be required to give up your current employment and you can still work for yourself, as time permits. The position is also entitled to reasonable expenses and a small staff. I'm sure we'll have very different ideas about what reasonable is, though!\" He laughed.\n\nHe was serious... and worse, I was even thinking about accepting the job! I couldn't soak my clients anymore, let alone steal from them, and becoming a paid government official with regular paycheck just screamed honesty and forthrightness! My old inner self was horrified... which is why my curse made it even the more attractive to me! I hated, and thus loved the idea at once!\n\nStill, I wanted to play a little hard to get and not capitulate at once. There was only so much sickening honesty and loyalty that I could tolerate and retain something of my remaining self-respectability!\n\n\"I'm intrigued, but let me think on it. The position would have certain attractions to me, especially if I could be a little creative with my expense report, within acceptable agreed upon bounds, and if my boss didn't loom too heavily over my shoulders while I was doing my job. I'd be handling things too big or political for the vigiles to handle and too subtle to be trusted to the Blackguards, I assume. Stuff that annoys the big man in his castle treasury but not worth sending out the guards or the black-cloaks over?\"\n\n\"In a word, yes. Exactly! Usually problems involving too much missing tax money or anything to do with imperial politics. Also lots of young sons of the noblility enjoying too many privileges, but there's also plenty of the nastier sort of work involved too. Problems with people like the Weirs, or worse, friends and rivals of your acquaintance Thumbs. Problems best solved quietly in the night, with little or no questions raised afterwards. Nasty problems, stuff you probably won't like doing, but usually involving real justice, for other people just like Danelle and her sister Rochelle. Just like the way that you eventually handled Edwina. Very appropriately done and neat justice simply executed. Which reminds me, you must tell me how you arranged for Sir John to be relieved of his duties, albeit rather permanently. I've had a friend watching you, and you marched right into the Ormscraig that night as bold as a knight and come out again a few hours later looking like the cat that has just eaten the canary! A draught of madness perhaps that you'd doctored their wine with? Something like what you'd used to drug Edwina with before her unfortunate swim in the swamp? Very effective.\"\n\nI shrugged and he mercifully let the matter mostly drop, but he kept looking at me with an appraising eye until I felt some minor urge to confess.\n\n\"Something like that,\" I admitted, \"it was tricky and honestly extremely accidental the way it all worked out, but I'm glad that you agree that it was much for the best. Sir John did appear to have some rather unfortunate business interests that matched his unsavory more private amusements and I'm glad that his replacement appears to have less interest in vigiles affairs, and interfering with the activities of those assisting them. I suppose that is exactly the sort of assignments I can look forward to from now on?\"\n\n\"Exactly. In fact, if you had not already tended to our rather wicked Major-Captain, he might have been assigned as your very next assignment. You were very correct in your evaluation of that man and the dangers his interest posed to civic order in the city, and you reacted quickly and very appropriately. Another reason why I feel that you would make a most excellent Imperial Inspector! His replacement, the new Deputy Commander of the Blackguards appears to be a somewhat more honest and morally upright officer, and I'm anticipating few, if any difficulties in the future dealing with him. Overt ones anyway. He'll want revenge as well for our vigiles trouncing his black-cloak boys, eventually, but not before he's drilled them all half to death with exhaustion for another season or two first. Sir Helmut is just the sort of man that cannot abide failure... but I hope he learns to moderate his disappointments.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear that. Can you promise me that this is a job that needs to be done and that if I'm the man to do it that people will sleep happier and more soundly. That I'll be serving justice? I won't be your assassin!\"\n\n\"No, that's a different sort of trump Major card altogether in my playing hand, and not the job for you. Nor my Spymaster even, I already have one of those... a rather excessively sneaky sort of individual who admitted to me that you were perhaps the hardest person to follow that they'd ever before encountered. You can take that as a compliment. That individual has much more important things to do at present than follow up on your activities any further, so once you accept my job offer your privacy will again be assured. As for you, I'd say that you're closer to being my The Foole, both the weakest and yet the strongest of the major trumps, when played carefully at the right time and place. A card to be saved for necessity, hidden and private, but best used when the need is the greatest.\"\n\n\"A man of two distinct characters, both wise and foolish that can walk blithely along the razors edge of the cliff, skirting destruction but bringing hope. There are worse things.\"\n\n\"There are. Since I've soothed all of your concerns and worries, I take it that you'll now be accepting my offer?\"\n\n\"Do I really have any other choice in the matter?\"\n\n\"Of course you do. You may say, 'No', loudly and firmly and I'll reluctantly chose someone else for the position. I have no hold over you or your loyalties; you owe me no debts of obligation. Your past secrets remain mine to preserve, but they are in no way held over you. Our account is entirely balanced and leveled even. I ask this as a favor, to a comrade in duty... and perhaps now also friendship. Also, I must admit that the job does have several obvious imperial perks, such as your membership here would certainly be approved, should you apply. The better doors of society would also begin to open for you, which would undoubtedly improve your private consulting business. Also, a proper title of knighthood could easily be obtainable for you in the future, upon successful performance of your duties. Perhaps even eventually a minor title and lands of your very own, at the Emperor's pleasure. The job will be hard, make not mistake about that, but I'm certain that you will be up to the challenges, and as I've mentioned, the compensation would appear to be at least adequate. Will you accept?\"\n\nHow could I say no? I had to admit that being properly called Sir D'Bounderby would be a decent reward for my efforts, in partial replacement of other previously enjoyed amusements now lost to me. If I had to remain honorable and even respectable, I might as well have the other noble trappings that go along with it!\n\n\"Done. Assuming that I can select my own staff. I presume that I can have an old retired sergeant to shuffle the papers on my desk and perhaps another assistant or two?\"\n\n\"Certainly. In fact I can recommend to you at once the services of a retired Watch-Sergeant who has expressed an interest in continuing to assist us with some limited duties? He's now become rather bored with the notion of tending bar for the remainder of his years, not to mention the pains of digging lead shot from out of the walls, and he remembers a certain evening of mutual adversity with amusement, and perhaps even a bit of fondness.\"\n\n\"Ah, Sergeant Malcom. There's a scowl to strike terror with petty messengers and patrollers still! Are his wounds healed and is his health up to the challenge?\"\n\n\"He's much on the mend and quite hearty enough for limited desk duty, certainly for the present. I'll give him a promotion to Command-Sergeant and that will increase his retirement stipend nicely as well. You're allowed a small office with a desk at the Vigiles HQ, and I'll post him there to coordinate between us. I'll assume, for continued secrecy, that you'll keep your chambers on Silver?\"\n\n\"That would seem best. If you'd rather not have me paint 'Imperial Investigator' signs on both my office door and my forehead. I assume that my duties should require significant confidentiality. Who can you suggest for an aide? I assume that would require some sort of military officer, or perhaps at least a Watch-Lieutenant? Someone with sufficient rank to command respect if I send him anywhere officially, to ask overt questions.\"\n\n\"Yes, your official duties should remain as invisible from the public as possible. As for your assistant, I do know of just the right sort of officer that would be right for the position. A fairly young vigiles officer that has earned my complete trust and the title would actually be a Watch-Inspector, rather than Watch-Lieutenant. Same pay grade, but entirely different duties under imperial writ, and not merely civic. This will indeed give you some more actual imperial authority, rather than a senior plodder with just a mundane vigiles title. It's odd how many people don't like or respect the vigiles!\" He laughed.\n\nI agreed, I used to be one of those people!\n\n\"An officer then. Any chance I could also have a Constable-Patroller for the duty as well? I really don't require an officer to fluff my pillow and kiss my ass.\" I wanted Flerrie once again by my side, but wasn't sure how I could manage to obtain her once more.\n\n\"A Constable-Patroller? No, that wouldn't at all do. You'll need your sergeant and an officer, even a fairly raw and very junior one, and for anything else you can borrow temporarily a patroller. Besides, while I understand that Miss la'Clerkes is rather keen on again enjoying your companionship, I rather directly implied to her a few months ago, after the end of the Weir affair, that you've still been rather busy still upon my behalf and that your time, and personal inclinations, were rather presently not entirely your own. I do think, that if you are willing, there might be some sort of personal association worth pursuing there. That is, if pursued, and promptly I might add, that young lady might be rather willing to be caught! Anyway, look over my officer choice first before you fuss, and if it doesn't work out I'll find someone else that suits you better. Agreed?\" The old general even had the gall to wink at me!\n\nI agreed. We clasped hands together in the comrade's oath, and this time also in friendship.\n\n\"Now,\" he added as we refreshed our drinks and started to shuffle up the cards for another game, \"if you would before we start another round, would you kindly explain to your new boss just why you risked everything to exact justice for Miss Danelle in the first place? She wasn't your client... and you're a very different man in every regards since she was killed outside your very door.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I can't say.\" And this was very much the truth, not that my curse would allow me to ever lie anymore in any case. \"Her murder angered me and I was filled with rancor at her killer in a way that I had never felt before. Her killing became personal to me... if for no other reason at all but to salvage my overweening pride, or at least parts of it! I had refused a client only to have her killer thumb her nose at me and then attempt to murder me as well! My pride could allow no alternative outcome. I had to find her killer and avenge her... and her sister, and the others as well.\"\n\nThat too was entirely the truth, something before my curse that I could have never admitted to anyone, especially Sir Adrian.\n\n\"I think we now completely understand each other.\" The stern former general announced, and he once again grasped my forehand one more time in the greeting of comrades, but this time much more as friendly partners. And if the smile on his face and the hint of his surface thoughts was to be believed, there was even a measure (small but distinct) of genuine amity there as well.\n\nThis would not stop me of course from beating him at our next game! With the growth of experience, we were now too equally matched now at the card table, but I had the very real growing certainly that I would find him to be a demanding, but not unpleasant taskmaster to work for.\n\nHaving a regular paycheck might be nice indeed, but it was the terribly appalling and unconscionable idea of a rogue like me now fighting for justice as a honest salaried government employee that sent shivers down my spine in actual anticipation!  \n<p align=\"center\">*************************</p>\n\nMumford had stayed up late at the house waiting for, smirking as well with some hidden secret that delighted him, undoubtedly at my expense.\n\n\"You have a guest Sir, a young imperial officer wanting to make their immediate introduction to you, without any delay. I offered the use of the downstairs library, but there was some slight instance that the upstairs study might be a more suitable waiting location. Sir Adrian had stated that your arrival home this evening might be a late one.\"\n\nNow that was usual. I didn't entertain many guests and I'd never allowed any of them upstairs, and certainly never left alone there! The upstairs study was fairly small but it was comfortable and located directly attached to my bedchamber, and this was where I tended to spend my quiet evenings at home. Enjoying a good decanter of wine and choice of good books.\n\nI quite dashed up the stairs and even held my hand steady upon at the fold to my jacket, ready to draw and fire a pistol at the first hint of an ambush. I wasn't expecting trouble, certainly not from an officer that had arrived at Sir Adrian's very request, but I'd been anxious and confused enough lately to allow my nerves to quickly become overly excited.\n\nThe pistols in my nervous hands turned out to be quite entirely unnecessary as I hurried through my study door and found no threats awaiting me. Instead a rather colorful pair of women's light cotton hose was decoratively draped over the side of my usual reading chair. A fresh glass of wine was nearly full and waiting on a silver tray on a side table for me. A similar trail of other women's clothing articles led through the open doorway towards my bedchamber, where I found a naked and fairly sleepy, but extremely attractive young woman waiting eagerly for my arrival.\n\n\"An imperial officer, I was told, was here awaiting me. I supposed you have rather exhausted that poor gentleman and since he was unable to sate your appetites he has instead crept home in disgrace? Or perhaps should I examine your new writ-card, that once more we might avoid any unfortunate misunderstandings.\"\n\nFlerrie giggled with amusement and arose from under the sheets in her full naked glory and secured her new identify card for my eager inspection. Walking over to my side with a rather exaggerated swing to her hips and with a lovely slight bounce to her small but utterly perfect breasts.\n\n\"Sir, I'm sure you find this document to be entirely in order, but imperial officers bear official commission charters and not writs!\" She giggled, now pressing her breasts and hips against my body as her lips reached forward to gently meet mine.  \n\nThe charter was indeed entirely in order. Sir Adrian had promoted Flerrie to the rank of Watch-Inspector earlier this afternoon, certain that I would accept his job proposal. Then the old clever fiend had toyed with me, knowing of my interest in the former young patrolwoman. Knowing that I needed an aide, a young officer that I could trust implicitly, he had cleverly selected Flerrie, while hinting overly directly that a rather more personal relationship with her was also entirely possible. A guardian that could indeed protect me again in the future, both day and night.\n\n\"I used to hate the vigiles, and everything that they stood for.\" I casually remarked as we held each other and kissed with greater intensity, as Flerrie's long slender fingers unfastened my clothing as hastily as was practical. \"But now, I've rather seen things quite differently lately, and there are certain things... and certain individuals, that I rather love instead. Isn't that quite odd! A terrible curse to befall a scoundrel and a rather formerly dishonest rogue who has only recently seen the error of his wicked ways. I used to rather enjoy making sport of the guards, but now I'd entirely rather make some different sort of sport entirely now with you!\"",
        "Now naked, we fell into bed together and one of us, I'm not sure whom, blew most but not all of the bedside candles to leave us to our pleasures. I no longer had the slightest thought or desire, even as a regret, of making Flerrie my pet. She was instead already my lover... and that was something much more rare and precious!\n\n<p align=\"center\">**********************</p>\n\nThe old me would have laughed hysterically or pulled out all of my hair and even my eyeballs in madness at this implausible change of fate. The old wilderness cunning woman had been right after all... I'd come to hate the evil that I had once so loved, and now in return I felt nothing but love for that which I had scorned instead!\n\nPerhaps being cursed now wasn't entirely such an awful and dreadful thing after all!"
