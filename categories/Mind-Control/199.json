        "It was the smell of food that finally woke me. As usual I had only the haziest of memories of my training beyond the random word puzzles that were now etched permanently onto my mind. What came afterwards was considerably clearer, although still a bit fuzzy around the edges from pure exhaustion. \"Had Master really tucked me into bed instead of letting me suck his cock or bend me over the bed to fuck me?\" That particular thought giving me more than one nugget to chew on. As I mulled over the most important one, I came to a very comfortable conclusion. I really was his sex slave now- and he was wholly and truly my Master. I knew his given name, Benjamin, but every time I thought of him that label seemed secondary to his real title: my Master. \n\nAnd then there was the act itself. The gentle way he had pulled the covers up and over me, pushing in the corners around my shoulders to ensure I was all snuggly and warm. It was cute. Almost endearing. It told me he cared about me as more than just his personal whore. That I was more than just a pair of tits and holes for him to use. I would have gladly let him use me, of course, fighting through the fatigue as best I could. It was the least I could do. He was my Master. I belonged to him. He could use me in any way he wanted to, even after I passed out. \n\nIntellectually I know that admission should sound weird. As I considered it further I knew that I wouldn't say it about anyone else- the idea running squarely up against my own personal beliefs of autonomy and agency. Sure, I was willing to sell my body for sex- or usually the illusion of it. But that was still a matter of personal choice. So far I hadn't been forced to do anything I wouldn't have potentially done on my own if the circumstances had been right. And the experiences those choices afforded me provided opportunities that I might never have dreamed of and otherwise enjoyed without them. I had even played the submissive servant a time or two for the right price. Most of us in the escort business had- it was a common enough fantasy, after all. While those nights might have fed into a latent, and somewhat contradictory fetish of my own, they also proved just how unrealistic such relationships could be in the real world. But those had always been temporary. Just for a night- a few hours, really. \n\nSomehow Master, known simply as Benjamin to the rest of the world, had already slipped past all of those walls, divisions, and personal boundaries. All the instincts that revolted against this type of submission to others didn't so much as blink at accepting them for him. That was just how things worked. \n\n\"Or I'm just bat-shit crazy,\" I thought. Either way- I knew it wasn't magic. Somehow his delightful, wondrous, devious, evil little machine had done this to me. Just thinking about it sent another shiver of pleasure up my spine. It was just enough of a tease that I almost gave into the temptation to finish myself off right there- fantasizing about what Master would do to his oh so willing sex slave.\n\nAnd there was the real rub, of course. The problem with having Benjamin as my Master was that I had a very strong impression he didn't have much of an idea of what it actually meant to have a sex-slave. It could have been worse, of course. Part of the reason I had drawn so many hard boundaries as an escort was to avoid exactly the type of abusive asshole that would try and trap me into a relationship where I had little to no control over my own life. Sure, I had teased Master about it, trying to taunt him into giving me a good fuck. And it had obviously turned him on. Who wouldn't want to have someone like me begging to do anything they wanted. \n\nBut the Benjamin I had known in the past had always seemed so harmless and easy to please. His money had been just as good as anyone else's- even if he wasn't that great of a tipper. That's why I had always been willing to see him, even on short notice. Easy money for easy work. I almost felt bad for him at times. Hell- his first time he had almost lost the nerve just to kiss me. I had always known he wasn't the type of guy who had a lot of money to throw around. But who was I to argue with someone about how they blew their wad, so to speak.\n\nBut now, that timidness bordering on awkward shyness that I had taken so long to get around seemed less like an endearing quirk that only added to his charm- and a lot more like an anchor that was going to drag him down. And it would take my growing desire to please him and make him happy right along with him. \n\nOf course, at the time not all of that was clear to me at a fully conscious level. But just enough to cool me off and put a frown on my face as I took in a few more of the details around me. Like the smell of Chinese take-out that tickled my nose and forced an immediate decision between the need for more sleep, and the need for food. My stomach took that moment to remind me that I hadn't had anything since a very light dinner the night before. One does not have a heavy meal before a night on the town.\n\nIn the end hunger won out over sleep, but neither could prevent a quick trip to the bathroom to freshen up. It wouldn't do to walk out to greet him without straightening up a few things first. Bed-head is not appealing unless you are truly blinded by love. I had no illusions about that. Master didn't love me- not like he did Maggie. That much was painfully obvious to me after the events of the night before. But that didn't matter. He had turned me into his slave and as such I was going to do the best I could to make him happy.\n\nOnce I had scrubbed out my morning breath and was a bit more presentable I walked back into the bedroom and took a quick look around. My options were rather limited for clothing. Wearing someone's old t-shirt was always a fan favorite, but that smacked more of a relationship than a sex-slave. Plus, for all of his lack of tidiness before, my cursory inspection did not reveal any such option readily available. \"He must have cleaned up just in case he had gotten lucky with Maggie last night,\" I thought. \"Until I royally loused that up, that is.\" Further quick inspection revealed the discarded remnants of last night's outfit on the floor. I considered slipping on the panties and bra at least- but in the end I went with something classic and simple instead.\n\n\"More take out?\" I asked as I stepped out of the bedroom and threw just a little extra weight on one foot to present myself. \"You could ruin a girl's figure with that.\" I had tried to make the comments flirtatious, but something between a frown and a smirk crossed his face as he was setting the freshly warmed plates down on the counter. Not exactly what I had been shooting for, but I might have been off my game a bit.\n\nThen his expression seemed to melt into one of surprise and growing desire as his eyes roamed over me. I couldn't be sure from the distance, but it almost looked like he swallowed reflexively. \"What's the matter?\" I asked, my voice sounding considerably more pleasing the second go around. \"Not used to having a naked sex slave in your apartment?\"\n\n\"Uhm... Sorry,\" He sort of stammered. There was that bashfulness again. \"I suppose it'll take some getting used to.\"\n\n\"You could always tell me to put some clothes on,\" I mused as I did my best to saunter towards him, swaying my hips just so. \"But I'm afraid that might ruin the esthetic. I think I rather like the way your eyes seem to enjoy looking at me.\" I was bold enough to reach out and place his hand on my hip as I stood next to him. \"Not to mention how good it feels to have your hands on me.\"\n\nThe smell of the food was even more appealing this close. A part of me wanted to stop teasing him and just dig in. He had obviously warmed up more than enough for two. But a larger part was feeding off of the way he was looking at me- the hunger that was growing in his eyes. I had always enjoyed the power that being an escort had given me over the men I was \"with\". What was that famous phrase? \"Everything in life is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power.\" The power to grant pleasure, or withhold it, had always been a turn on for me. \n\nI smiled and tilted my head, my eyes flitting back and forth between his own as they drank me in. In that moment another realization crystallized for me. The pleasure I took from wielding that power over others was still true- for everyone else. But not for him. At some point during my training that had changed. It was his pleasure that I wanted more than anything else. Not out of a desire to control him- simply out a desire to please him. His smile. His moans. The way he twitched when he came in my mouth. The memory of those things from the recent past still pressed those buttons, but now they were laced with so much more. It was as if the motivations that had driven me to be so good at my chosen profession had been inverted and refocused outside of myself. And tied directly to giving this incredibly sexy man anything he desired.\n\nA part of me knew all of this wasn't real- that he had somehow made me feel that way about him. Everything about it was wrong. It was all warped and twisted in so many ways that I should have been screaming at him. Reaching for the first sharp thing I could find and stabbing him. Or just running away as fast as I my legs could carry me. But for reasons I had no way of understanding in that moment- I simply didn't care. In fact, I loved it. Each time I was reminded that he had the power to do that, specifically that power over me, it left me nearly dripping with desire. And now that feeling seemed even stronger. \n\nLast night, after turning me into a sex slave, he had tucked me in and made sure I had gotten enough sleep to recover from my training. That had been nice of him, but now it was time for me to show him what it meant to have a sex slave at your beck and call. I was already wet, horny, and nearly drunk off of the desire I could see reflected in his eyes. I would do anything he wanted- let him use me in any way he desired. That's what a sex-slave was for.\n\nI found it suddenly very easy to ignore the smell of the delicious food that had only moments before been taunting my senses. I'm sure you can understand why. The feel of my Master's hands running up and down my thighs was sending shivers up my spine. His desire and the promise of giving him pleasure was more potent than anything else in that moment. \n\nSlowly, without really thinking about it, my knees were guiding me to his kitchen floor even as a hand sought out his cock between his legs, rubbing it gently through the rough fabric. My knees immediately protested at the hardness of the floor as they arrived at their destination, but I ignored them. This had all been their idea in the first place.\n\n\"Please, Master,\" I begged in my most sultry voice. \"May this slave suck your cock?\"\n\n\"When, uhm...\" He stammered a bit again, but then found his footing, finally. \"How can I refuse when you ask so nicely, hm?\"\n\nWith a surplus of experience I easily undid his belt and pulled down his pants to expose his delicious cock, already quite hard from my teasing. Only a moment later my tongue was wrapped around it as I drew it into my mouth as deep as I could manage as if my life depended on it. \"God this feels so fucking good,\" I moaned around him wordlessly. It had the desired effect, eliciting a moan from him as his cock twitched in pleasure against my tongue. With the next bob of my head the sweet taste of his pre-cum blossomed from the tip as even more reward. Still- I didn't want him to cum too soon. This wasn't an hourly gig- I had nowhere I needed to be. I wanted to show him what a good little sex-slave I could be.\n\nUnfortunately all the motivation in the world couldn't completely drown out the effect of hard kitchen floors. The haze of my own desire had fought it off for a bit, but soon enough I found myself pushing him to a climax just to cease the growing complaints from my uncomfortable knees. \n\n\"Next time perhaps I should drag you to the couch.\" I mused aloud as I savored the lingering taste of his cum in my mouth. I had swallowed his load, of course, but only after swirling it around in my mouth and showing it to him. He definitely seemed to like that.\n\n\"Well, I appreciate the thought, but I suppose it's nice to christen the kitchen even so.\" He said, looking around his otherwise rather small apartment.\n\n\"It wouldn't take us long to christen the rest of it as well. We could start now, if you like?\" I offered, standing up even as the hand that had been playing with my own clit push my pussy open as invitation. \"My pussy is all yours if you want it, Master.\" I purred. I was still quite hungry, but the thought of offering myself for another fuck was too much to prevent me from tempting him with it. I stepped up between his legs, licking my own juices off of my fingers as my other hand ran through his hair awaiting his response. \n\nA flicker of possessiveness ran through me. But I knew how these thing worked. I belonged to him, not the other way around. That didn't mean I wouldn't share him with anyone else he wanted. But he was my Master, after all. No matter how many other women he wanted to twist or corrupt into whatever he desired, it wouldn't stop me from enjoying the pleasure of that truth deep down inside my core. \n\nIn fact, now that I had thought about it, I knew that I would be more than happy to help him do it. The twist of fate brought a fresh smile to my lips. Here I was, the first victim of his desires, a newly minted sex slave that had yet to even give her Master a good fuck. But already I was moaning as images of other women sitting down at his machine and being reborn as his willing sex-toys sent fresh chills up my spine and goosebumps down my skin.\n\n\"Fuck me, Master.\" I begged him, after finally coming up for a breath after a dizzying kiss. I didn't know who had started it- him or me, and it didn't matter. I needed to be used and he seemed up to the challenge once more.\n\n*****\n\nThe rest of Sunday went by relatively uneventfully. I may have been his first sex slave but as it turns out his stamina wasn't quite up to sex in every other room even in his admittedly small apartment. But it had been too soon after his blowjob for him to pop the cork even after nearly an hour of giving it the old college try in a myriad of positions.\n\nI brushed down any ruffled feathers from a bruised ego and promised to fuck him anywhere he wanted anytime he wanted to make up for it. After that he had all but dismissed me so he could take care of a few things before diving back into his vanilla work life the following morning.\n\nIt hadn't helped that at some point I had been forced to remind him that while I was his sex-slave, that it didn't exonerate me from the responsibilities the rest of my life required. I was still a full-time college student after all. He was okay with me continuing to be an escort as long as I kept my old rules of engagement for anyone he didn't personally approve. Why he thought I would start randomly fucking every client just because I was his sex-slave made no sense to me, but I assured him I would do as he wanted.\n\n\"What about... uhm... what's her name? Desirae?\" He had asked as I was packing up to leave. I had enjoyed teasing him with my naked flesh so much it seemed almost disappointing to cover it all up again.\n\n\"I told you I'd take care of her. I didn't say much that I can't just shrug off and explain away.\" I paused deliberately then, turning to him as if considering something for the first time. Don't get me wrong, I had already made my decision on what to do while we had been fucking on the couch, but I needed to find out if he even wanted her first. Everything would be a lot easier to explain if he did. \"You know, you two got off on the wrong foot- all my fault,\" I reminded him, forestalling his reflexive comment in self-defense. \"But come on, tell me you wouldn't fuck her if you could. I mean, she's tall, blonde, and stacked- they're even fake, you know. Real breasts aren't that god damned perky. Lucky bitch. Who could ask for more?\"\n\n\"She seemed hot enough, sure, but I didn't really get a good look at her.\" He admitted after a short bit of thought. \"But don't sell yourself short, Rachel. You are pretty fucking hot too.\" It was cute how he tried to defend my honor.\n\n\"No need to mince words on my account,\" I said as if only slightly offended. \"But I'm not trying to compare apples and oranges here. I'm already your sex-slave. Of course you're going to be biased.\" I winked at him as I slipped my purse over my shoulder. \"But think. It wouldn't take much for me to convince her we were just having a bit of a spat... Get her to give you another chance. That shouldn't be hard with the right motivation. And if you had her over, you could maybe convince her to try out your little machine...\"\n\nHe seemed to consider it honestly. The moment left me near flabbergasted. \"Are you serious?\" I thought. \"Dear god, tell me my suggestion is not the first time you've thought about doing that to her!\" I was glad he was so caught up in thought he wasn't looking at my face. I'm near certain my doubt would have been painted all over it.\n\n\"I don't know, I've made such a mess with everything so far.\" He said, still not looking me in the eyes.\n\n\"That wasn't a no,\" I thought- my faith in him partially restored. \"Just needs a little more nudging in the right direction.\" \n\n\"Train her or don't,\" I said. \"If I can convince her to come over and suck your cock, maybe even fuck you, then it defuses anything else I might have said and makes it all just another job. Trust me.\"\n\n\"Alright, we can do it your way.\" He said after another moment, before a fresh wave of doubt washed over him. \"But what about Maggie? Should I call her?\" His anxiety had suddenly spiked considerably. He stood up and started pacing around his small living room. \"If I wait for her to call me I might be waiting a very long time.\" He seemed to deflate a bit, and then suddenly his face scrunched up with concern. \"Fuck, her play!\"\n\n\"Her play?\" I asked, unable to follow that particular tangent. Evidently I should have remembered it, based on the face he suddenly shot at me from across the room.\n\n\"Yes, she had just gotten her first part in a professional production. The reason we were celebrating, remember?\"\n\nI sat my purse back down on the counter. It was obvious I wasn't going to be leaving for a bit yet. \"Right.\" I honestly didn't recall. I hadn't really cared that much about it when he had told me Saturday morning. He hadn't even been sure about, so I guess it just didn't seem important enough to make a note of it at the time. \"And she hasn't finished it?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"She only got through Act 2.\"\n\n\"He was using the play as an excuse to train her!\"I realized. \"So it would work for things other than just random number puzzles. Good to know.\"\n\n\"Tell you what.\" I said, trying to think fast. It was obvious he wanted this girl, and from what I had seen at the bar it was just as obvious she was into him too. If Master wanted her then he deserved to have her- and I would do whatever it took to get her for him. I started setting it all up in my head, adding her to the mental list I had already begun with Dez sitting at the top along with a little asterisk next to her name as a maybe.\n\nHe was looking at me expectantly- I had let my train of thought run too long without voicing any of it. \"Look, I made the mess. Why don't you let me clean it up?\"\n\nHe cocked his head at me. His anger wasn't gone, but at least now it was tempered with curiosity. \"And how do you plan on doing that?\" He asked, disbelief quite evident in his voice.",
        "\"Oh ye of little faith, Master,\" I teased him. \"If I called her and explained everything I bet I could convince her to at least talk with you.\"\n\nHis face was a sudden mixture of doubt and concern. \"I do not want you even hinting to her that you are my slave! I have no idea how-\" \n\nThere was more to his outburst but I didn't let him voice it. \"Of course not, all I have to do is bend the truth a bit to get her talking. She's mad at you but it won't take much at all to get her to redirect those feelings at me.\" He was considering it again, but he wasn't sold. I had to sweeten the deal.\n\n\"Then, once she is talking with you again, you could entice her over here for another training session and...\" A hand had travelled down and lifted my dress a bit to tease my clit as I nibbled on my lip with the thought. I hadn't donned the panties from last night when I had thrown last night's dress back on. Mainly for ease of access in case Master had changed his mind about wanting anything while I was there. Plus, I had been so wet most of the day that it would have made the point rather moot.  \n\nIt was his turn to cut me off. \"I'm not turning her into just another slave, Rachel! Maggie is... special.\" I tried to make a conscious decision to not take offense at the insult he probably didn't even realize he had just thrown me under. It was a glancing blow, but it still stung a bit. \n\n\"Okay, not a slave, got it,\" I thought, dropping that angle and immediately picking up another. \"Of course not. If you wanted to do that you would have already, right?\" He nodded absently, completely unaware of how much he was giving away. \"All I'm saying is you could adjust her a bit so she didn't mind sharing, is all. You might be surprised how much a woman could grow to accept if given a half reasonable excuse and the proper motivation. Give me a week. I'd say from how she stormed off you'd need to give her at least that long to cool off on your own anyway.\"\n\nHe had resumed his pacing of the room halfway through my explanation. I couldn't tell if I had him or not- and this was not something I was willing to leave up to chance. If I did this wrong, if I let him have too much rope he might end up hanging both of us with it. I left my purse on the counter, slipping out of my heels as I closed most of the distance between us before I kneeled directly in his return path. He would have to stop. \"Or just walk around me,\" I chided myself.\n\nHe stopped, though he kept silent long enough it was starting to make me nervous. \"What it is, Rachel?\"\n\n\"Master,\" I said, bending over just a bit more and keeping my eyes cast down at his feet in supplication. He might not know what it was like to be a Master yet, or to have a Slave- but I was sure he had to have seen enough movies to recognize this pose. \"Do you want her?\" I asked him softly, as submissively as I could manage without throwing up too many red flags about the sudden shift in my behavior.\n\nMy question gave him pause. I could feel the conflict within him as he fidgeted for a few moments before answering. \n\n\"Yes,\" He said finally. \"Yes, I want her.\" His voice sounded almost defeated. As if it was a desire he had already resigned himself to having lost. \n\n\"Of course you do,\" I thought. \"More than you're even willing to admit to yourself, I bet.\" \n\nI dipped into a just slightly deeper bow in response- Maggie had just moved to the top of my list of importance. Dez would be a considerably lower hanging fruit I could take care of first while taking much greater care with Maggie. \"Then I want you to have her. You deserve to have her, Master.\"\n\nHe seemed to almost flinch at that. Had I said something wrong? I had used that pose specifically to disarm him, but it had the distinct drawback of not being able to read him nearly as well as I would have liked. The lower legs were not known for their emotional expressions and were marginal at best for reading body language beyond simple anxiety.\n\nI decided to risk looking up to his face. He was still obviously conflicted- though I couldn't be sure as to the cause. \"I have a pretty good idea how women think, Master. Allow me to try? Please? For you?\" \n\n*****\n\nThe first order of business was figuring out how to use that machine Master had... \"Had he built it himself? Found it?\" I couldn't recall him ever really telling me the answer to that question. It didn't matter. He had it, and had slowly, over the course of a few days, turned me into his sex slave. And now I was fully intending on doing the same to a few other women. If, that is, I could get the damn thing working.\n\nThe thought of using the device on myself never really entered my mind, at least not specifically. It didn't really feel like my mind even belonged to me anymore. When he sat me down for training he was using the machine to twist me into something he wanted me to be. Using it on myself to change anything inside my own head seemed almost like a betrayal. I wanted him to do it- as a twisted expression of his desire for me. Otherwise it was like a vibrator with no batteries: you could still get off on it, if you tried hard or long enough. But it was nothing compared to what the ride was like with real power inside it.\n\nI suppose I never even considered using it on him for similar reasons. My kink was now firmly centered around serving him and making other women serve him just as I did. Training him would be breaking the rules somehow. More betrayal. That didn't mean there weren't a few things I wouldn't change about him if I could. Just not with the machine. I had other ways of getting what I wanted out of him, and then using it to give him pleasure.\n\nBut I couldn't even get started without making heads or tails of that prototype. I was quite certain he wouldn't be willing to tell me if I just asked him up front. There were times when it was better to beg forgiveness than ask permission. That would be especially true if Master would be distracted by a small harem of slaves I had acquired for him in the process.\n\n\"I'm doing this for your own good, Master,\" I told myself. \"And if you do it right girl, he won't even know to thank you for it... or punish you for it either.\"\n\nI had double checked to make sure his car hadn't been in the lot before I parked and went up the stairs to his place. I was fairly sure it was safe. He had mentioned heading into work today, and I had encouraged him to do so. Both because I needed the chance to sneak into his apartment and because a bit of normalcy would actually do him some good. A little time to center himself from all the power he had so quickly acquired.\n\nI didn't mention this conflict of interest to him. I wanted to make him happy and I had a pretty good idea how to do it. I was just afraid that he was too timid to do what needed to be done. This mess with Maggie was a perfect example. He didn't seem to have the courage to just take what he wanted. I was going to do my best to fix that.\n\nI smiled as I used my fresh copy of his spare key to unlock the door to Benjamin's apartment. I slipped in and replaced the one I had nicked from his place while he had been showering Saturday. I had considered slipping back into his apartment that night to do a little more digging. Only thing that stopped me was that I didn't want him walking in on me while I was distracted. I was pleased with that bit of precaution now, as I was quite certain that without my accidental intervention at the bar he would have ended up taking her home. I supposed I had a 50/50 shot that he would have gone to her place instead of his, but I didn't like bets unless it was a near sure thing. Needless to say, I didn't gamble much.\n\nSitting down at the training computer I wondered what type of security it would have while it booted up. The machine itself didn't seem to be a standard build so there could be just about anything. Like most of my generation I had some skills with computers but I would never have considered myself anything close to a hacker. I did have a few clients who leaned in that direction though. You might be surprised at the variety of people you run into when you're selling a fantasy built into at least 50% of the population, give or take. I wasn't looking forward to owing them any favors, but I needed to know what to ask for before I contacted them.\n\nI was almost disappointed when there didn't seem to be any defensive systems at all. Not even a simple password prompt on boot up. \"It's a good thing I'm such a loyal slave,\" I said, even as I shook my head slowly back and forth. \"Because you're not making this very hard on me, Master.\"\n\nEven so, it still took me a couple hours to figure everything thing out without trying anything on myself. There were quite a few training files, including a generic one with random puzzles I recognized instantly. There were also a few files that were fragments of some research journal articles and another set of three that seemed to be a single play with each act broken down into a single file.\n\n\"Well Maggie, it looks like Master has already prepared your next training file for you. How thoughtful of him.\" I resisted the urge to call her right then and offer to finish her training. I wasn't ready for that just yet. I had to make sure I was doing everything right first. \n\nThe only real challenge had been when I loaded up the machine for a dry run and was prompted for which fragment file I wanted to use. Finally there was something resembling protection, even if was only in the form of a single password prompt. I was about to try one at random when the obvious jumped out at me. There was one file entry named simply \"ESCORT\". I clicked on it, and hit enter. \n\nThen the password prompt popped up. \"Well, shit.\"\n\nI chewed my lip gently as I considered any number of things to try. I didn't want to just make completely random guesses in case he had put in some sort of lock down after too many incorrect attempts. With so little defense before that point it was almost a surprise to find it on just this single step. \n\nI should have known better though. \"The fragment files were the only ones protected,\" I thought. Everything else had seemed rather innocuous so far. The worst that could be said so far was that he was helping me with my math, and Maggie to memorize her lines. Perfectly innocent. \n\nI aborted the training program and searched for the fragment files on the hard drive itself. Then I found an editor and tried loading the ESCORT file again, almost certain that's what Master had been using for me. \n\n\"Damn,\" I said as another password prompt opened up on the screen. Once again I looked around the room, trying to think of what Master might have used. After circling once or twice, my eyes settled briefly on the small hanging mirror clinging to the back of his bedroom door. \n\nAt the moment it only gave me a good view of his bed. It was easy to picture how I would look if I stood in front of it- my reflection staring back at me just as intently. \"Oh Master,\" I sighed. \"Please tell me you didn't...\" Somehow my rational mind revolted against the idea that he would have made it that easy.\n\nBut he had. Typing my own name in as the password opened the file up immediately. The implications of what I read within it boggled my mind. Feelings, thoughts, needs, and desires were laid out before me as naked as a jaybird. Some I had all but taken for granted as my own thoughts. Others I had assumed the machine had somehow slipped in behind the scenes.\n\n\"He must have just added things as he went along,\" I realized as I read down the list. Everything from the first free blowjob I gave him, to being his personal whore, his fuck-toy, and finally his sex-slave. And everything else along the way of course.\n\nThose thoughts were only in my head because Benjamin had put them there. He had tricked me into using his machine and then slowly added more and more suggestions for my mind to suck up like a helpless little sponge. Everything I had felt for him the past week had been a lie.\n\nThere was the briefest flickering moment of doubt. An instant where I was forced to truly face the harsh reality of just how much I had been changed. How far I had been pushed. All those feelings that had been instilled in me. That they weren't really real. I knew that I would never have done those things to begin with if I had been given any choice in the matter.\n\nI heard myself hiss a ragged breath through gritted teeth as I sat there, reading and re-reading the instructions. They were simplistic, certainly. Each time I read them, more and more potential loop-holes in them started to appear. He hadn't really put that much thought into them, long term it seemed. I tried to trace those thoughts and motivations as I went over and over the events of the past week or so. \n\nHe wanted sex, certainly. And control. Compensation for the insecurities that had built up over his life. Then he must have- well, I still didn't know how he got the machine and it still didn't matter. Once he had it, he had used it on Maggie and I- but primarily on me. I remembered that first night when I gave him that first free blowjob. I could see it now- the way he had suddenly seemed considerably more interesting than before. Not just a client anymore- somebody special. Somebody I wouldn't mind teasing just for fun, instead of money. Then the way his cock had felt- how his cum had tasted. They still set my mouth on fire with pleasure every time I so much as licked his dick. But I knew that was the machine. I almost never swallowed cum, and still didn't for anyone other than Master.\n\nI couldn't help it. I kept reading the commands. I kept linking them to the events. I kept seeing the changes. I kept remembering the way it had affected me. I kept feeling how I had felt, how I had been altered. How I had been changed. How I had been twisted. He made me his personal whore, but that hadn't been enough for him. He had made me his fuck-toy. He had made it so I couldn't say no to him. Had wrapped me around his cock until it felt like it had been made for me so perfectly that just the feel of it sliding into me set of fireworks in my mind. He made me willing to fuck him anytime he wanted, in any way he wanted. But he hadn't stopped there. He had turned me into his sex-slave- hell, I had even suggested it to him! He had stolen my mind and my body from me like I they had never been mine in the first place! And he had made me want it. Love it. Even crave it!\n\nIt was monstrous. It was depraved. It was inhuman. It was... it was... It was too much. It was... too god damn hot!\n\n\"FUCK!\" I nearly screamed, grinding my pussy against the seat to shove three of my fingers as deep into my dripping pussy as I could manage while the orgasm ripped through me. My left hand was gripping my right breast, squeezing and twisting it to wring out every last drop of pleasure I could manage. \n\n\"God! What's wrong with me?! Soo good...\"\n\nIt took a moment for me to calm down enough to take stock of my current situation. My pants were unzipped and pulled open as far as I could have managed without standing up first. I needed to get a fresh pair of panties as well. On top of being soaked with my cum, they looked like I might have torn them a bit in my haste to shove more and more of my fist deeper into my snatch. My shirt had been pulled up, almost to my neck- held there by the awkward way my bra had been pushed up as well. \"Stupid fucking underwire bras!\" I cursed. \n\n\"Fuuuuuck me,\" I mumbled again as both a blessing and a curse as my mind started to clear most of the erotic haze it had been under. At least enough to think clearly again. Master had been sloppy. \"Very sloppy- and incredibly fucking lucky as well.\" I thought to myself. \n\nIt wasn't really all his fault though. Most people didn't have any reasonable excuse to think of the best ways to brainwash and enslave someone. It certainly didn't help that he was so new to the whole BDSM scene either. A smile crossed my face as the image of a vanilla cone with bevy of colorful flavors dutifully trailing behind it like a string of kittens crossed my mind. Then it turned into an even more devilish smirk as I couldn't place which one of those imaginary cones would have been me.\n\n\"Time to get to work...\" I pulled out the jump drive I had stashed in my purse, just in case this excursion had been successful, and made a copy of the file. \"Don't worry Master, I said I'd clean up the mess and give you what you wanted. That's exactly what I'm going to do.\" \n\nI could use my own script take care of Desirae- with a few improvements to fill in those holes Master had left behind of course. But that wasn't the only thing on my to-do list. I knew specifics on what Master had already done to Maggie could prove invaluable for my plans to twist her around his fingers as well. \n\nA quick scan of the file names didn't reveal one that had obviously been intended for Maggie like there had been for me. \"I guess I'm special after all, Master,\" I thought. But that meant I was out of options until I could think of how I to narrow down the list of files that might have been for her. Thankfully the operating system had a few clues for me. A directory listing told me that only two of the fragment files had been edited in years; mine and another one named \"myfragments\". \n\n\"That certainly narrows it down,\" I shrugged, and opened it in the editor. There they were- comments about trusting Benjamin, and not questioning any changes she might have noticed. And a couple about being open and honest with him about her feelings. \n\n\"Careful what you wish for.\" I quipped, but I kept reading.\n\nThen, a few lines further down I found what I needed. \"Yes! Thank you, Master!\" I had skipped all my morning classes for this, but it had been totally worth it. Suddenly I was thankful for those psychology electives I had been taking over the years.\n\n*****\n\n\"Why didn't you just tell me you were seeing him?\" Desirae asked me as I opened the door to let her into Master's apartment the following day.\n\nI sighed appropriately, letting her catch me with my hand in the cookie jar. \"You know what would happen if the agency found out I was dating one of my 'regulars'.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they would politely cut you off and leave you out in the cold- out of concerns for maintaining their reputation, of course.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Why risk being dumped from a side gig that was helping me finish my degree when what you didn't know wouldn't hurt you.\" I shrugged, hoping the act of seemingly coming clean with Dez would be enough to buy back her interest. \n\nDesirae's gaze took in the apartment so I allowed mine to do the same. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Master had cleaned up a bit more. I had texted him a gentle reminder the night before: \"first impressions are important, especially the ones right after a fight. If I can get Maggie to give you a chance you don't want to blow it with three day old pizza on the counter.\" The evidence, or lack thereof, surrounding us seemed to indicate he could take some constructive criticism. \"Or, I might get a nice spanking the next time I see him for being too presumptuous.\"\n\nDesirae turned back to face me. \"So why take the risk with me now? Far as I know you haven't graduated yet.\"\n\nI sighed, dropping my keys back into my purse and setting it down on the counter. I had to sell this just right. \"Because he needs my help. And that means I need your help. It's complicated.\"\n\n\"It usually is,\" She said as she took a seat on the couch. \"This isn't even your place, is it.\"\n\nI could tell from her tone the question was rhetorical. I answered it anyway. \"No, it's his. All part of the explanation I owe you. Along with the $200 I promised.\" I considered sitting on the floor to give her a false sense of superiority as if she were standing in judgement of me- but decided she would probably respect meeting on equal ground more from what I knew of her. I took a seat on the couch, with one leg tucked underneath me so I could face her easily.",
        "\"You mean like the little show Saturday night? Your new beau isn't cheating on you is he?\" I could tell from her voice she found the idea more humorous than anything else. A common enough irony in our line of work.\n\nI cocked my head at her. \"I said I was seeing him, I didn't say that we were exclusive. Otherwise I'd have to quit the side gig anyway, or lie to him about it and undermine any potential for something real.\"\n\n\"So, you aren't willing to lie to him, but pulling one over on me is perfectly fine?\"\n\nI raised my hands in defeat. \"It's not like that Dez. You know how it is. I wasn't trying to hook you up with him. I was just trying to show him a treat. Something special I could give him because of my work connections.\" I gave her my best incredulous look. \"Don't tell me you're upset that you didn't get 100% honesty from a client.\"\n\nThat got the shrug of agreement I was looking for. \"I spoze that's true,\" She said. \"If it had all gone down like you said, I wouldn't have had any idea otherwise and would have been happy for the money.\"\n\n\"Well, mostly true.\" I told her, glad to be back on familiar ground. Even if I was about to take another giant leap off of it. \"There was one other thing he was going to bring up once the fun was over. A uhm... favor, if you will.\"\n\n\"What kind of favor?\" She asked, her arms crossing over her chest defensively. I knew what she was thinking- we all got our fair share of last minute special requests from clients.\n\n\"Oh, nothing like that,\" I assured her, and was pleased as her arms slackened in front of her. \"I wouldn't let him to do that to you, Dez.\"\n\n\"Alright, but the question still stands.\" She reminded me.\n\n\"Too true. It has to do with his attempt to get accepted into the graduate program at the University.\"\n\n\"Isn't he a little old for college?\" Desirae asked, smirking at me but visibly relaxing into her seat on the couch.\n\n\"I said graduate program, Dez. You don't think I'd fall for a guy with no ambition or drive do you? He's an engineer who put together a machine that can... Well, it would be easier for him to explain it.\"\n\nDesirae made a show of looking around the room in a disappointedly dramatic fashion. \"Is this the part where he comes out of the bedroom to surprise us?\"\n\n\"No. I invited you over- just the two of us. I knew after how he acted that night you likely wouldn't agree to meet him again.\"\n\n\"You're right about that. I don't tend to give assholes second chances. I'm worth too much to risk it.\" She told me flatly. The judgement in the statement was self-evident.\n\n\"We all have bad days,\" I said, appropriately defensive. \"Even so, he didn't need to be here for this. I know enough about how it works to use it- if you'll agree to give it a try.\"\n\n\"Agree to give what a try?\" She asked, tipping her head just so as I piqued her curiosity in spite of her suspicion.\n\nNow it was time to set the hook. \"Follow me,\" I told her in an almost conspiratorial tone and started heading towards the machine in Master's bedroom.\n\n\"Into the bedroom? I thought you said this wasn't about that.\" She teased me.\n\n\"It's a small apartment, Dez. Where else is he going to keep it. You see any weird machine in the living room?\" I chided her in return.\n\n\"What type of weird machine- woah.\" All forward progress had stopped in the open door as she laid eyes on what could easily be described as a junior mad science experiment on the far side of the room.\n\n\"Yeah, I had a similar reaction when he asked me to try it.\"\n\n\"Wait, you've used this?\" She asked me, not even trying to hide the suspicion in her voice.\n\n\"A few times, yeah. It's for his project. A proof of concept thing.\" I closed the distance to the machine and picked up the helmet to explain it all to her. \"You wear this contraption, it picks up your brain waves like an EEG reader and gives the information to the computers here. You sit here,\" I pulled out the chair I had spent hours in already and turned it slightly towards her. \"And use this computer to do some simple puzzles. It's all for data he is trying to get about the attention span and ability to focus on simple tasks while distracted with other random things distracting you. Or something. I told you he'd do a better job of describing it.\" \n\nShe still wasn't quite sure about it- but she had taken a step or two into the room at least. \"And where do you and I come in? Why not just get students from the psych department?\"\n\n\"That's just it- he's trying to impress this professor and needs some sample data from multiple subjects to do it. He's not officially part of the department yet, so he can't use departmental resources like that. And for reasons that should be obvious,\" I said, holding up the wire-mesh helmet and waving my hands over it in my best impression of a model from the price is right. \"He can't just ask for volunteers off the street.\" \n\nDesirae tipped her head quizzically, raising an eyebrow as she spoke. \"I can see how that could be intimidating.\"\n\nI had her, but it never hurt to close the deal with a little bonus incentive. \"This is what we were going to ask you to do Saturday night. For an extra tip, of course.\" I tucked two hundred dollar bills into a couple of gaps in the helmet. \"Come on Dez, it's quick, easy, and painless. You'll probably have to comb your hair afterwards though. Tends to get tangled up a bit in this.\"\n\nI smiled at her and patted the chair. \"Time's a wastin. Care to earn an easy $200?\"\n\nDesirae considered it a few moments more before she relaxed. \"Technically I already earned that just by showing up, if I recall our agreement.\" She seemed to be sizing me up one last time. \"You really that into this guy?\"\n\nI gave her a defeated smile. I really was that into this guy, as she put it. And with every step she took closer to the machine my arousal had been rising as well. I needed no subterfuge or illusion to be convincing.\n\nShe sighed in defeat. \"Alright. What do I need to do?\" \n\nI had a hard time containing my excitement as I helped her get the helmet on and explained the rest of what she needed to know about the machine. \"Now, you're going to have some random problems to solve overlaid over a kind of radar screen. Your job will be to finish the puzzles by dragging the fragments around the screen. There will be other things on the screen too. Random fragments that have nothing to do with the problem, just drag them off to the side. They're meant to be as distracting as possible, I think. There's sort of a dot that lets you know how you're doing. The closer you get it to the center, the better. If you just focus on the puzzles and ignore the stuff that doesn't belong, no matter how crazy, then you'll do fine.\"\n\nA few more adjustments and she was ready to go. I moved quickly over to take my seat across from her and boot up the program. \n\n\"You seem particularly pleased at the moment. This isn't all just some over involved prank to shock me, right? Make my hair stand up straight?\"\n\nI guess I was letting a little more of my excitement shine through than I had thought. \"No, nothing like that. I'm just glad that I could help him out. He's important to me, you know?\"\n\nDesirae just smiled at me, shaking her head slightly. \"Ah, young love. Alright Ms. Mad Scientist. Let's do this.\" \n\nI grinned at the inside joke she didn't even know she was a part of- and started up the machine. \"Hit enter and away you go!\"\n\nA click and a pause and she was off and running. \"I see what you mean about the puzzles. Doesn't seem much to it. Ah. There's the dot. Bouncy little fucker isn't he.\" \n\n\"Less talk, more focus,\" I chided her. \"The first couple problems are easy. Then the random bits will start popping up to distract you. Remember, you job is to-\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor. I ignore them and keep solving the problems. I heard you the first time. And the second time as well.\"\n\n\"Smart ass.\" I said just loud enough to get one last smile even as I savored the faraway look that was already beginning to spread across her face. The computers and table were placed just right to hide the fact that I was already running a finger in and out of my pussy and up around my clit inside my jeans. \n\nI nearly came the first time I heard Desirae gasp, followed immediately by a soft moan through nearly quivering lips. A few of the fragments I had added to my training file had just finished their first pass on her screen. I had to give Master some credit- what he had put together had been a good start, but he hadn't gone far enough to ensure the loyalty and devotion of his slaves. The concept of Master and Slave were hardly something that needed to be re-invented whole-cloth. There was a considerable amount of writing on the subject, and I had been passingly familiar with it for years now. He and I would need to have a good long talk about that eventually- once I had everything ready for him.\n\nBut that was exactly why I had no intention of giving Desirae any chance to worm her way through a loophole that could threaten everything Master had started. The first thing I needed to do was inundate her mind with fragments to reset her view of reality. When I was through with her she was going to a very clear understanding of what it meant to be a slave with as little room for personal interpretation as possible. \n\nOnce she got past the first few harmless fragments, her dot would hopefully have wandered close enough to the center that she wouldn't consciously react when she starting seeing the new fragments. The repetitive ones that I had included to help reinforce what was to become her new identity as a slave. The first few of them would help to mold her self-image into something less of a person, and more as an object- not that far of a stretch in her case. We all had to accept a certain amount of objectification in our line of work. I was just pushing those views from a temporary fa\u00e7ade to a more permanent mindset. She would see herself not as a whole person with agency, but as a sexual object. A possession that was owned by someone else. And just like the toys in those movies, her happiness could only be found when her owner played with her- used her, in any way they desired.\n\nStill others would help to explain her newly ingrained need to submit and be completely obedient to her owner as the sole source of her sense of purpose in life. The next few tethered her own pleasure to loyally serving her owner's every need- always treating their desires and commands as if they were her own. I had gone over them a few times to ensure they would weave as tight of a net around her psyche as I could to ensure three things would be her core values: complete devotion, undying loyalty, and total obedience.\n\nThen I reinforced those suggestions with specifics suggestions linking them to me as her owner and Mistress. I was more than willing to share her with my Master, of course- what's mine was his by default. But on the off chance that I couldn't convince Master to \"enslave\" her as he had done to me, I would need to ensure that she was totally my own creature. \n\n\"My body is sexual object. It should be used to tease, arouse, and pleasure others whenever possible.\" \"I am a Slave to my Mistress, Rachel. I belong to her. She owns my body. She controls my mind.\" These were the phrases that had flashed on her screen in the moments before she had gasped in pleasure. And still more were flashing before her eyes, ignored by her conscious mind only to soak deep into her vulnerable and pliable subconscious to take root and twist everything they touched.\n\nI had kept more than a few of the fragments that Master had used for me, with a little editing of course. \"I love being a whore. A fuck-toy. A sex-slave. A servant. A pair of tits and holes to be used for pleasure.\" \"I love the way cock feels in my mouth.\" \"I love the taste of cum, and I enjoy swallowing it.\" \"I would be happy to fuck anyone my owner wanted, anytime they wanted, in any way they wanted.\"\n\nOf course, I added a few more for myself. \"Rachel is incredibly sexy.\" \"I love the taste of Rachel's pussy.\" \"Being a Slave is amazing. I owe Rachel everything for enslaving me.\" \"I would do anything to serve my Mistress in any way she desired.\"\n\nMaster had left me with the knowledge of my enslavement and I decided I rather liked the idea of having a few minions of my own. \"I know Benjamin's machine can brainwash people.\" \"I will accept and embrace any changes I notice after using the machine.\" \"I love the new me and would never want to go back to who I was before.\" \"My mind belongs to my Mistress, Rachel. I want her to change me in any way she desires.\" \"The power to brainwash and control someone's mind turns me on.\" \"I love the idea of helping to brainwash and enslave others just like my Mistress did to me.\" \n\nBut there was still the need to protect our growing little conspiracy. I greatly appreciated the freedom I had found within the otherwise loose boundaries of Master's training, but I wasn't willing to risk anyone else doing the same. Just the thought of someone trying to use the machine against me, or worse, against my Master... It was more than enough to keep me focused on doing my best to ensure such a thing could never come to pass. At least not because of me, anyway.\n\n\"Only Rachel or Benjamin can use the machine on other people.\" \"I will never use the machine on myself or others without specific permission from Rachel or Benjamin.\" \"I will submit to more training anytime Rachel wants.\" \"Rachel and the machine belong to Benjamin. Protecting them, the machine, and my fellow slaves is very important to me.\"\n\nAnd lastly there was the issue of jealousy. Master deserved to have any woman he wanted without having to worry about them fighting each other for his time or attention. I shuddered at the thought of what Maggie's near violent and hurtful reaction had done to what little self-confidence Master had been developing. The issue would get even worse with the addition of a handful or more of sex-slaves surrounding him. And Dez wasn't going to be just his, either- unless he wanted her that way of course. But I didn't want the green eyed monster getting in my way any more than I did his. This part took me almost as long to get to where I liked it as the initial enslavement phrases. \n\n\"Jealousy is an empty emotion for a slave- it has no power, serves no purpose, and brings no pleasure.\" \"I am always willing to share my affection with my owners and anyone else they desire.\" \"I am an object to be used by others. I am not entitled to anything more than what my owner desires to give me.\" \"I am happy and secure as a Slave to my owners. I am happy with whatever amount of attention they chose to give me.\" \"I want my owner to have everything that they desire.\" \"All that I am, and all that I have belongs to my owners- just as I do.\" \"I will gladly share my owners with others- their pleasure is all that matters.\"\n\nIt was a long list, I know. At least twice as long and probably considerably more extreme of a change than anything Master had done to me in one shot so far. I wasn't sure if it was going to be too much for her to take all at once or not. I was hedging that she wouldn't consciously remember the fragments even if she did resist them. I hadn't remembered any of mine after all, though I certainly recognized them once they were staring back at me in plain text. I had prepared another list- something much simpler- in case she didn't take to all of this at once and I had to resort to doing it the slow way. But thirty minutes later and Desirae was working on her 5th pass through the fragment list. It didn't look like I was going to need the back-up plan after all.\n\nI had already pushed myself over the edge twice while I was watching, but I was out of time to indulge for the moment. I reluctantly pulled my hand out of my pussy, licking the juices off of my fingers. I couldn't taste even a hint of Master's cum anymore. \"Need to fix that,\" I thought to myself.\n\nI stepped into the outer room to give Dez some privacy while she cooked. Reaching into my purse, I pulled out my phone and called Master at work. \"Hello, Master.\" Nearly purring over the line took nearly no effort at all given the heat still burning in my pussy. \n\n\"Hello, Rachel,\" He said, a little muffled as he tried to keep his voice down. \"Are you being a good slave for me, today?\"\n\n\"Mmm... Yes, Master,\" I hummed to him. \"I think I may have an angle on Dez. I'll let you know how it works out. I was going to take my first stab at... the other thing this afternoon.\" No need to kick a man while he was down, after all.\n\n\"Right,\" He said, the pain from my slip up tainting the moment. \"Are we still on for lunch then?\" He asked.\n\n\"Of course. I offered, didn't I? Would be terribly rude for me to back out now.\"\n\n\"I could always go home and grab something. No big deal,\" He said a little louder, evidently no longer trying to hide his conversation from his co-workers.\n\n\"No no no. No need for that. What's the point of having a sex slave if you can't get a little special delivery now and then? I'll could even bring grapes to feed you one... at... a time.\" \n\n\"Sounds delicious. I thought I was supposed to be trying to ground myself this week. That's going to be hard with you tempting me all the time.\" I could tell he was only half serious about it. I needed him to stay centered and not fly off the handle while I was getting things under control, but the last thing I wanted was for him to withdraw and become even more plain vanilla.\n\n\"We can talk more about that at lunch, if you want. Or, we could do... other things.\" I couldn't resist the thought of him finding a dark corner of his warehouse and filling my mouth or my pussy up with his cum. Either way I could almost taste it already.\n\n\"Let's stick with lunch for now. I'm not in a position where I could risk my job just yet.\"\n\nAnd that had given me all sorts of other things to think about. \"Right! Master shouldn't be working as a janitor- not anymore anyway.\" So much for loyal slave to do, so little time.\n\n\"I'll see you at noon then.\" I said, trying to keep it from getting any worse. The whole point was to keep him OUT of his apartment for the day.\n\n\"Noon it is.\" And the line went silent.\n\nJust before I left, I walked back into the bedroom to check on Dez. She had been on the machine for just over two hours by then and was still nailing her training- her little blip hovering just left of center. \n\n\"Be a good little slave,\" I whispered in her ear. \"Mistress will be back to check on you later after you've soaked up all of your lessons.\" \n\nHer not so soft moan as I left the room was particularly delicious."
