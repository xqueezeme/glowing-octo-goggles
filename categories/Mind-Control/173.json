        "The next week flew by rather quickly. During the day I was kept pretty busy at work- orders had come down from on high that we were to begin preparing for the next auction. That meant a lot of things had to be moved around, organized, and re-cataloged. Thankfully that order didn't include anything of 'questionable status'- such as the prototype that was currently missing for obvious reasons. This meant I had a lot of relatively mindless time to think about the modifications I was making to the machine- both software and hardware.\n\nRachel helped me break up the monotony a bit with repeated lunch breaks. \"All work and no play,\" She would whisper in my ear while her hand slipped into my jeans and wrapped around my cock. It seemed like all it took was the sound of her voice to get me hard lately. And she was always amped up and ready for anything I wanted. If only I had more time to take advantage of it.\n\n\"But I don't have to... I could always call and cancel- tell them no,\" She had complained Tuesday night. I had just recompiled all of the changes to the software and ran myself through a quick bit of training to make sure it was all working. It was time to celebrate! Only problem was, her agency had beaten me to the punch. \n\n\"No, no,\" I told her, trying to keep the disappointment out of my voice- and failing. \"I can have you anytime I want. You still have to pay the bills just like I do.\"\n\n\"I could swing by after I'm done,\" She offered, her voice heavy with the promise of what else she would do once she arrived.\n\n\"No, it's alright. You have classes on Wednesday, and I have to work. We can't stay up all night every night or neither of us will be worth anything.\" I was just looking after both of us. It's not like I was trying to punish her for not being available twenty-four-seven at the drop of a hat. Or, if I was, at least I was punishing the both of us for it at the same time.\n\nI couldn't even call Maggie and see if she wanted to hang out. She had made that abundantly clear when she had called me earlier the same day as I was getting off work.\n\n\"Please Benjamin,\" She had said almost immediately without giving me even an inch to work with edgewise. \"Don't talk. Just listen, okay? I spoke with Rachel- and I think I understand what happened the other night. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a little mad, but Rachel helped me to see how it was all, well mostly, just a big misunderstanding. So much has changed so fast, I think we all just need to sit back and do some thinking about what we really want and how we want things to look like moving forward.\"\n\nShe finally took a breath long enough for me to get my foot in the door, so to speak. I tried to take advantage of it. \"Look, Maggie. I think if you just-\" And then my window closed again.\n\n\"Rachel already told me how you were worried for me. I appreciate all your help, Benjamin. I really do. With the play- with everything. But I think I have to do this on my own. I need to prove to myself I can do this. I already have all my lines from Act 3 memorized so you don't need to worry about that.\" Her tone shifted then, adding in just a pinch of reconciliation on top of her preventive justification. \"I will give you an olive branch though. I get a few comp tickets to the dress rehearsal Thursday night. There's one at the door with your name on it. You'll come won't you?\"\n\n\"Maggie, of course I'll-\"\n\n\"Good. I'll talk to you after the show. Hopefully we'll all have done some thinking and calming down by then. I-\"\n\nThere was a break there. A pause. So pregnant that I didn't have the courage to break it. \"I- what? I love you? I've changed my mind and want you to come fuck me right now? I don't think we can be friends anymore? I feel like some tofu? What, woman, what?!\" If she had called just a few hours later, after I had finished my self-training, maybe things would have been different. \n\nBut she hadn't waited- she had called when I was still wobbly, uncertain, and entirely susceptible to her particular form of kryptonite. So there I stood, silent- a paltry shadow to anyone deserving of the allusion to superman. I tried to console myself with the fact that, as far as I knew, even Superman hadn't told Lois how he really felt until fairly recently. In most continuities, anyway.\n\nThe moment passed. She never finished the thought. \"See you then, Benjamin.\" Then she hung up. \n\nI considered trying to call her back. Especially after I got the machine running. But in the end I decided that time was on my side. She had already given me an opening that Thursday night. I could use that without looking desperate and take the opportunity to remove whatever obstacle was keeping us apart. \n\nWhich was why I had called Rachel. That was what she was for, after all. But, having told her to be responsible and not skip out on work just to scratch my itch, I was left with precious few options on how to spend the rest of my evening.\n\nWhich just about brings me back to where I started. \"I suppose you're right,\" Rachel's voice said over the phone. \"Still disappointing though. I'd enjoy an evening with you a lot more than some stupid special performance at the opera.\"\n\n\"That's my Rachel,\" I said, trying to force a smile into my voice. \"Such a 'cultured' sex-slave.\"\n\n\"You know it, Master! Try to not have too much fun without me.\" She made a couple of kissing noises into the phone before we both hung up.\n\nAnd that is how I ended up at a bar with Mike from work- talking about anything and everything I could think of other than my trouble with women. I couldn't exactly invite him over to my place given what was in the bedroom. Couldn't risk him recognizing it. To be honest, it was actually kind of a refreshing change of pace. Reminded me that if I was going to establish something resembling a normal life, with obvious points of exception of course, that I would need to cultivate a few regular friendships too. Or, at least as 'regular' as my developing paranoia over the machine would allow- I had to have some protections in place. I wasn't sure if Mike was going to be one of those, but I had to start somewhere.\n\nHe took a sip of his beer as a preamble to what I thought was going to be a comment about the college football game we had sort of been watching. I had been keeping up so far- I wasn't really into sports but I could fake it well enough to pass the time. \"So, were you serious about helping my sister with the LSAT?\" He asked, bringing the illusion of normalcy crashing down around me. \n\n\"Yeah, of course,\" I said, taking a good swig of my draft to cover the uncomfortable change of topic. I took a bit to go over my memory of Anna. She had certainly made an impression, both good and bad. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I thought she had given up on that dream. Guess I was wrong if one stray comment from a stranger, no offense-\"\n\nI shook my head in the universal bro-code gesture to indicate no offense was taken and he should continue his thought.\n\nHe nodded in understanding. \"It's just, well- I haven't seen her get this worked up about something in a long time. I'd hate to see her get her hopes up and have it all be for nothing.\"\n\nI smiled at him. \"I thought you were her little brother.\"\n\nHe half smiled back, giving me a non-committal shrug. \"Doesn't mean I can't still look out for her.\"\n\nI let the silence draw out a moment, figuratively speaking of course- we were in a sports bar after all. I finished off the draft as if needing a small shot of courage before I continued. \"Listen, Mike. I promise you I'm not pulling her leg. She gives me half a chance, and I'll guarantee she will ace that test.\"\n\nHe watched me for a few moments, as if trying to size me up. I didn't let it phase me. I had zero doubts of what my machine could do. Eventually he must have decided he liked what he saw. \"Alright. If you're full of shit, at least you hide it well enough. Don't see why you're not running some sort of test prep company instead of sweeping floors if your system is that good though.\"\n\n\"Maybe I should be,\" I admitted- waiving down the bartender to get another draft. \"Hard to patent or copyright a method though. If I tried to go big, some even bigger fish would just steal it and then I'd be back to sweeping floors.\"\n\n\"I guess,\" He admitted. There were obvious flaws in that argument, but he wasn't really looking to poke any holes in it. He just wanted to know I wasn't going to screw over his sister. \n\nOn that subject... \"So, tell me more about your sister. Anna, right?\"\n\n\"Why,\" He asked, grinning at me suspiciously. \"I thought you already had a not-girlfriend. Looking to trade her in for an older model?\"\n\n\"Rachel is a...\" I paused, suddenly grasping for the right words. \"Well, currently, she's a bit of a special case. Don't worry though- setting me up with your sister won't jeopardize your date with one of her friends.\" I smiled as I took another swig of my freshly filled beer. \n\nMike just grinned behind his drink. Evidently I had correctly judged his concern. \"I'll remind you of that once my sister chews you up and spits you out like a used wad of gum. God knows she's had plenty of practice.\"\n\nI didn't let his warning phase me. \"Like you said, we're about the same age. She seems to have a good head on her shoulders. How about you let me worry about what happens to the gum after she's done with it, eh?\"\n\n\"Right, you're only into her for her mind. Next you'll be telling me your interest is entirely altruistic. Then I'll know you're full of shit. She may be my sister, but I'm not blind. Hard to miss how many men have tripped over themselves trying to get her attention.\" He said, shaking his head before he waved over the bartender once more to get a refill of his own. The poor man hadn't gone very far, so it was a quick round trip. \"It's your funeral. And you're covering the tab too. Do that and I'll put in a good word for you- let her know you were serious.\"\n\n\"Michael, my man- you drive a hard bargain.\" I told him. \"It's a pleasure doing business with you.\"\n\n\"It's Mike,\" He corrected me. \"Only my mother and my sister call me Michael. And don't make it all weird once she's through with you. I'd hate to lose another friend to that big ball of angst.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, Mike.\" I said, honestly. \"I'll do my best.\" It wasn't hard to change the subject after that, but thoughts of Anna- and what I planned to do to her- were constantly rising up to distract me. I think he could tell I was a bit off, or maybe it was just getting late for him. I didn't know him well enough to say at the time. \n\nAs promised, I covered the tab and we parted ways. I heard from Anna the very next day.\n\n<hr></hr>\n\n\"Alright, I'm here. You have exactly one hour to prove I am not wasting my time.\" She had arrived at my apartment 'straight from work' and was straight to business, just as her text had warned me nearly an hour before. Even so, the combination of her sharp and tactless opening in juxtaposition to her incredible look had given me pause. She took advantage of the moment of silence to take a few chews on her gum before continuing. \"And do try to keep this professional. I get enough people leering at me while I'm at work as it is. I am not dressed like this for your pleasure.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, motioning for her to come. I took the opportunity to do a quick inspection as she passed by. Her pants were made of a long and sleek fabric that flowed down her legs in a manner that almost looked like a skirt. Were it not for the thigh gap between her legs, highlighting how good a shape she kept herself in, I might not have noticed the difference until she sat down. As she moved, a pair of shiny black high-heeled shoes played peek-abo from beneath the edge of her hem. Her top was cross between a polo and a simple white short sleeved dress shirt with a feminine cut, completely lacking in buttons on the front and a thin black folded-over collar for accent.\n\nHer sharp Italian features and dark brown eyes were framed by long dark brown hair, a color that reminded me of Rachel's. It curled gently as it flowed down well past her shoulders to rest on a pair of modestly size but very pert breasts. Not that I had long to consider them without risking my own air of professionalism.\n\nAll told it was a testament to the conservative dress code of a professional and successful law-office. It may not have had a plunging neckline, or any neckline to speak of really, but it still only barely hid what I was sure to be an incredible body beneath it. I could easily see why she would be so defensive. It must have been hard to dress professionally and not still seem provocative- no matter what she was wearing. \n\n\"An hour isn't much, but I think it will be enough to prove my system works.\" I told her as I shut the door behind me and followed her in. \"This way.\"\n\n\"I'll be the judge of that,\" She said, emitting a sharp crack as she popped another bubble inside her mouth and followed me into the bedroom. \"And I'll warn you that I have a friend from the office expecting a call from me in an hour with specific instructions to call the police if I fail to check in.\"\n\nI bristled a bit at the implication of her threat. I couldn't really blame her though. \"A perfectly reasonable precaution,\" I assured her. \"I am well aware that my apartment is not in that well-to-do of a neighborhood and-\" \n\n\"An impression not vastly improved by the fact that the first thing you do is lead me to your bedroom.\" She said curtly, snapping another bubble and sending shivers up my spine- not the good kind. Like the way the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard does for some, just shorter and sharper. The look of derision on her face only deepened when she got a good look at the machine. \"Is this... your foolproof learning method?\"\n\n\"I'll admit, it's not that much to look at. That's why I need a few successful applications of it in order to get the funding for-\"\n\n\"I knew this was a waste of my time,\" She said, waving off my excuse with a flick of her wrist as she turned to leave- striding purposefully towards the door.\n\n\"No, wait, I used it myself. I can prove it, at least provisionally.\" I called out to her, grasping the same research papers I had memorized and used to convince Maggie on that first night. Thankfully, my memory of them was still as sharp as ever- I had double checked just to make sure. It had been a few weeks since I had used the machine to memorize them. That was a good sign regarding the longevity of the rest of the trainings I had done. Constantly reinforcing any changes in each subject every few weeks would have severely limited its use moving forward. \"And I can back it up with a bit of cash as well to sweeten the deal.\" \n\nThis stopped her where my previous assertions had failed. Just as I had hoped. \n\nShe half turned, looking back at me over her shoulder. The look on her face casting doubt and declaring judgement simultaneously. \"Do you think I need your money?\" She asked, derision mixed with contempt in her voice- how lovely. Add that to the details Mike had mentioned and I was developing a recipe for this particular woman that was nowhere near 'sugar and spice' not to mention 'everything nice'. But that was part of the package- and why I had graciously accepted her willingness to give me a chance when she had called to 'provisionally' accept my offer.\n\nShe might have been hot- but I was more interested in how far, and how quickly I could push her than I was in her looks. Okay, if I'm being honest, her looks didn't hurt. Not in the slightest. I had already fantasized about what it would be like to watch her strip naked and wrap her lips around my cock. If what she was hiding underneath all of that professional office attire was anywhere near the reality then I would have little to complain about. Except maybe the size of her breasts, but if all went well I could use that to test another measure of my control as well.\n\nI held up three hundred-dollar bills, fanning them out so it would be easy to count them. I knew full well she didn't need the money. For all I knew that wouldn't even be enough to buy another pair of shoes. The point wasn't to tempt her with the cash, but to directly attack her pride. A very useful suggestion I had picked up when I spoke with Rachel about my plans earlier that afternoon before I even knew she was going to accept. Fortune favors the prepared, or so they say.\n\n\"She sounds almost perfect,\" Rachel had said over the phone. The subject hadn't come up over lunch- I guess I had been too distracted. \"Short term gains with a lot of long term potential. Look at you go, Master.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you approve,\" I said with only the smallest hint of wounded pride at her jab.\n\n\"I approve of anything that means you are able to live a long and happy life- especially if that means less time sweeping floors and more time fucking me and anyone else you decide to warp into another slave to serve beside me.\" She had said, smoothing down any ruffled feathers and teasing my cock with her voice at the same time before getting back to business. \"Are you sure it's worth the risk, though? What if she walks away- you don't have any leverage on her to keep her there until after she's already gone through the training. Even worse if she can't get in the zone and remembers the fragments.\"\n\n\"I know, that's why I wanted to talk to you about it,\" I assured her. \"As for the fragments, I've already made a few adjustments to the programing so that she won't see any of the dangerous ones until she's well inside the zone where she won't be able to notice them. I got the idea from you, actually.\"\n\n\"Aaah,\" Rachel had said with a little too much understanding in her voice- as if the comment had explained more than a simple upgrade. She moved on before I could pick up on it though, purring her pleasure at my compliment. \"You don't have to butter me up to get anything out of me, Master. But I do love that you try anyway.\"\n\n\"Just giving credit where credit is due. I'll be sure to let you suck my cock later as reward.\"\n\n\"You say the sweetest things. Maybe I could do that to celebrate once you've got her on the machine. But seriously. You need to be careful with this one.\" She had warned me again. \"I don't like anything that puts you at risk unless we're pretty sure of the outcome.\" \n\n\"You just want to watch her during her training. And I'll take any suggestions you could give that could help make sure things turnout in our favor.\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged, but as you wish. From what you've told me, she's willing to bite on a cold offer for help. That means she's desperate. The fact she's trying so hard as a paralegal after her repeated failures means she's too proud to just give up and pick a different career path. Why not use that against her.\"\n\n\"Pride goeth before a fall. Got it. Anything else?\" I asked, wanting as much help as I could get.\n\n\"That depends, Master. You said she had a nice car, right? So she has money. You need to have a more believable backstory for this one. You can't just be offering out of the goodness of your heart. That just means you're trying to get into her pants- she'll see right through that. You have to ask for money. Or offer to pay her for the reference.\"\n\n\"Why not both?\" I had said to Rachel. That was the reason I had told Anna over the phone that I would expect payment and a reference if it was successful. All to help build my 'business'. And also the reason I was now waving money she didn't need in Anna's face with one hand while holding out the research articles in the other. The implication of a bribe tickled her pride from both ends \n\n\"Take it, or don't. I'll earn it back, and then some- after you've tried my device. Here,\" I said, pushing the articles into her hands while keeping the cash in the other to prod her. \"It won't be definitive- you could always just say I memorized them before, so I'll give you three chances to stump me. Pick a paragraph and a line, from anywhere. I'll give it to you- verbatim.\"",
        "She raised an eyebrow. \"Stump you. With these.\" She said, flipping through the first few pages of the top one. \n\nI nodded, not answering what wasn't a question in the first place. I smiled as she flipped to the back one and started scanning. Rachel had predicted something like that as well. \"She won't use the top one. It would be like taking the card the dealer offered. Never trust the dealer.\"\n\n\"Alright...\" Anna said, getting down to business. \"Discussion. Fourth paragraph. Second line.\" \n\nAnd we were off. It took three quotes- \"From each paper,\" Anna had insisted. The tone of her voice carried assumed authority as well as just the right amount of condescension for any lawyer worth their salt. \"Any ambiguity in a contract is always ruled in favor of the party who did not write the contract. You should be more specific next time.\" \n\nI had allowed her the concession. It wouldn't matter how many lines she asked me to quote. I could all but recite the papers down to the figure and table legends. The other reason being the way it had made her face go through a complete transformation. For just the briefest of moments she had let her 'Queen Bitch' mask drop for the pure love of the argument. It had made me smile. \n\n\"Maybe she really will make a good lawyer. One completely loyal and devoted to me.\" I thought, somewhat malevolently. \n\n\"You're wrecking my hair, just stop. Let me do it!\" Anna said, swatting my hands away as I attempted to help her settle the wire-mesh helmet into place. I may have upgraded the software, but I hadn't incorporated the new less-mad-scientist-looking helmet as it hadn't arrive yet. Scientific equipment providers aren't known for being members of Amazon Prime with complimentary two day shipping to non-academic addresses. \n\n\"As you wish,\" I replied, stepping back and working on a tiny change to her fragment file in the meantime before loading up the program from the control station. \n\n\"Now- remember what I told you. You need to-\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm the one that at least managed to finish their degree, remember? I can take instruction,\" She said, all but proving herself a liar as well as insulting me in the same breath. \"Move the fragments around and discard anything that obviously doesn't fit. I'll know I'm doing well when the dot on the radar gets close to the center.\" \n\n\"Close enough,\" I thought, while giving her a nod to at least acknowledge her answer. I didn't bother to ask her how she knew I had never finished my degree. It didn't matter. One of us could be polite, at least. \"Ready when you are. Just hit enter and you'll be off.\"\n\n\"About damn time,\" She cursed under her breath while ensuring it was still loud enough for me to hear- as if it was my fault that we weren't getting started until nearly thirty minutes into the 'hour' I had to prove myself.\n\n\"I wonder if she was bluffing with that warning call.\" Still- better safe than sorry. Most of the small amount of lead time before she arrived had been used to trim down her fragment file: now appropriately named LAWYER-QUICK with password 'bitch'. \n\nI knew she wasn't going to get a full dose so I didn't want to push things too much- even if that was half the point of trying to bring her into the fold. I figured I could concentrate on a little attitude adjustment first, and then go full steam on a second go around where I had more time to work with her. Her first session, now lasting a little less than 30 minutes if I stopped it right at the hour mark, would be a good test for how much a few concentrated suggestions could do once someone was in the zone.\n\n\"When...\" Anna said, near on 10 minutes later and still nowhere near in the zone- her blip flitting around from one side to the other but never hovering near the center for more than a few seconds at a time. \"the LSAT.... questions...\" She managed a handful of seconds later.\n\n\"Interesting...\" I said aloud. \"It's like she's actively fighting it- trying to stay out of the zone.\" And what if she was? I had told her that this was just to prove the effectiveness of my method. I hadn't the time, nor would I have spent it even if I did, to actually get an LSAT prep course and modify it enough to make it work with the machine. There would be time enough for that after I knew that it was working on Anna herself and she had no choice but to train whenever I desired. \n\nEven so, the machine was obviously having an effect on her. She knew just enough about how the machine worked that she should be subconsciously attempting to get into the zone- hit the bulls-eye, as it were. She could just be bullheaded enough to be fighting it- all because she wasn't getting what she had been expecting. Something resembling an actual prep course. \"Just like all the other ones that had failed her.\"\n\nThat was it. I moved around the tables so I could be close enough to whisper and yet be confident her mind, even in its current state, could hear me. \"Anna, you have to trust me.\" I said, gently. \"Let it happen. This isn't like anything you've done before. All those methods failed you. These are standard questions. The same ones I used myself...\" \n\nAnd I suppose they were at that. Rachel, Maggie, or I could likely do them in our sleep at this point. If it isn't broke, don't fix it. Aside from Maggie's play, I had long gotten past using the machine for anything productive beyond warping the minds of the women I wanted to control. It just wasn't worth the effort when the standard puzzles would open the mind enough for what I was really after. Until Anna, that is. \n\nThe blip was moving- was it getting closer? I watched her carefully for another problem or two. It was working. She had flitted through the zone and out again, but this time she had hovered there for three heartbeats. Three or four times that long and it would trip the fail-safe to start feeding her the real fragments. \"Let it work, Anna. Trust me. This is new. With my help you are going to get into law school.\" \n\n\"Of course!\" I leaned in even closer, whispering into just a single ear. Just soft enough that she would have to spend a bit of effort to hear me- hopefully pulling enough of her attention away from resisting to let her subconscious could do the rest. \"Trust me, Anna. Let go. Let it happen. Let me guide you into Law School. With my help you'll be walking across the stage in no time. I can help you with your LSAT. I can help you study- memorize reams of legal precedents at a time. Trust me. Let go and let it happen. Let me give you what you need to succeed.\"\n\nI couldn't help but stare down at her chest as it slowly but surely settled into an even pace, just as her blip drifted closer and closer to the center. The rise and fall of her breasts beneath the silk blouse held most of my attention as moments later, with one final deep sigh- she slipped into the zone and stayed there.\n\n\"That's my girl, Anna,\" I whispered to her. I wasn't sure if she could hear me anymore but I was quite certain she wouldn't remember any of it even if she did. The first fragment from her real training file flashed up on the screen, only to be dragged off to the side a second later. \"That's it. Soak up all your training like a sponge.\" \n\nThis was her short file so I had to keep it simple. The most important aspect that I needed to concentrate on was closing the deal, as it were. In this case, turning her into a convert willing to continue training with me. \"Benjamin's training method works! I am a true believer.\" \"I will continue to train with Benjamin anytime he asks.\" \"I enjoy my time training with Benjamin.\" \"Training with Benjamin is the key to my success.\"\n\nThe next few phrases concentrated on a fractional change in her personality. Something small enough that few would notice the difference, but still patently obvious if you were looking for it. Plus- it would eliminate a habit of hers that I had already grown to loathe from only two brief exposures so far. \"I won't chew gum anymore. It's an awful, disgusting habit.\" \"Chewing gum is unprofessional and unattractive.\" \n\nThe last few were necessary, even in the short term, as insurance in case the training didn't stick as well as I would have hoped. If she did escape after just this one exposure- I needed to do everything I could to protect myself from the loose end that she would represent. \"I will keep Benjamin's machine a secret. I won't reveal to anyone how his training works.\" \"I owe Benjamin for trying to help me. I would never betray his trust.\" \"Any changes in my behavior after training are perfectly natural.\"\n\nAnd then there were the two phrases I had slipped in after she had slapped my hands repeatedly when I was only trying to help. I was going to wait for a longer session before trying anything like this, but her attitude had been fueling my temper just enough that I put them in anyway. \"Benjamin is an attractive man and deserves to be treated with respect.\" And last, but certainly not least, \"Benjamin can touch me anywhere he wants.\" I would like to say that it was entirely as a test of an obviously more extreme behavioral change- but I know you won't believe me. I certainly wouldn't after everything else I've done.\n\nI watched as all of those fragments flashed up on her screen. I watched as they were judged as outliers- unnecessary for completion of the word puzzles she knew she was supposed to be focused on. I imagined I could hear the gears turning in her head- both the conscious ones memorizing the puzzles, and the subconscious ones carefully etching the outliers into the core of who she was and what she believed. \n\nThe whole thing was making me hard as a rock. And so I sat there keeping Anna company during her training while I vented some of that sexual frustration as a long string of sweet nothings whispered in her ear. \n\n\"You've been a bad girl, Anna. In fact, you've been kind of a royal bitch. But after today, everything is going to be different. You are going to be different. And you're going to fucking love everything I have planned for you.\" I paused for a moment, watching the way her eyes twitched back and forth as they sorted through the fragments appearing here or there on the screen. I marveled at the near emptiness of that stare- as if the very spirit that animated her had fled the moment her conscious mind had zoned out. The thought of what that mind would do to that spirit upon its return- freshly primed with all fragments I was using to train her, only served to drive my arousal even higher.\n\n\"The moment you sat down at my machine, Anna- you were mine. I am going to own you- your heart, your mind, and especially your body. From now on, I am going to be the most important person in your life. You will be so deeply in love with me that you will gladly do anything that I ask- just for the chance to prove your loyalty and devotion. Which is why, my mind-fucked little spy, you are going to help me find a way to get the rest of your co-workers to try some training on my machine. Then I can warp and twist their soft and vulnerable little minds into slavishly obedient minions- just like I'm doing to you. You're going to love it. Love me for letting you do it.\"\n\nI was so close to her now- I could almost feel the warmth of her breath as I continued my little diatribe. \"Is she breathing faster? Is this turning her on?\" Her cheeks might have been flushed, I couldn't tell. Perhaps she wasn't much of a blusher. Her dammed conservative attire prevented me from easily gauging her arousal with hardened nipples or any other more obvious sign. \n\nEven knowing the risks I couldn't resist moving a lock of her hair away from her face- my own arousal overcoming my better judgement. By now, all of her fragments must have flashed by at least a few handful of times and if she had dropped out of the zone there would have been a soft tone from the control station as a warning- another little safety precaution I had thought to add. \"You don't mind if I touch you, do you Anna? No, of course not. You want me to touch you. You are going to love the feel of my hands on your skin. No more hiding that sexy body of yours, at least not any more than you absolutely have to. From now on you are going to enjoy showing off your body, especially for me.\" Throwing caution to the wind I lightly traced the line of her jaw with a finger, slowly traveling towards her lips. Her blip barely registered the contact. \n\n\"Let's see, what else... Oh yes! From now on the taste of my cum will be one of your favorite treats. You will relish any chance to use yourself as a tool for my pleasure- as more proof of your complete devotion. Anything I want. Any way I want.\" Yes- I know. I was letting my arousal feed my ego while my inner deviant ran around completely loose from his chains. \"Not like it matters- even if it is turning her on, it's not like any of this is slipping through.\" It was giving me ideas for what I needed to add to her original, longer training file, though.\n\n\"Of course, you understand that means I'm going to have lots of women just like you, Anna- loyal, obedient, fuckable women. Each of them willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy my desire. But that won't bother you. You'll be happy to share me with as many women as I want. Just the thought of turning me on will make you horny, Anna. Watching you kissing, fondling, and fucking other women would turn me on. You will love having sex with my other women almost as much as with me. But you would never let jealousy prevent me from enjoying what I wanted, would you Anna. Anytime a flare of jealousy threatens to rise up out of your mind, your loyalty and devotion will attack it. They will feed off of that jealousy until there is nothing left- making them both even stronger.\"\n\nThe silent flashing of my alarm warned me that I was out of time if I was going to wake her before her backup chaperone summoned the police. \"Time flies when you're fucking with other people's minds,\" I thought, trying and failing to stamp down my own arousal and need enough to bring her out of it.\n\nI couldn't resist just one more tease before leaving her and returning to my previous position at the control chair. \"You're going to be such a good girl for me, Anna. You will crave that praise from me so much that whenever I call you a 'Good Girl', you will feel such a rush of pleasure and arousal you could almost cum on the spot. That should help you learn exactly how you should be behaving from now on, won't it.\" \n\n\"I wonder if that would even work...\" I pondered the possibility while adjusting myself so that I could sit comfortably in the chair across from Anna. With a sigh full of bottled up frustration I hit the button to end the program and watched as she blinked in confusion and life slowly returned to her eyes.\n\n\"What- what happened?\" She asked, her voice unsteady as she tried to get a grip on her breathing. \n\n\"My hour is up.\"\n\nShe stared at me for a moment, her face a shifting mask of... well, she was obviously confused but beyond that there was too much for me to decipher. \"An hour? Already? It feels like I just started...\" A grimace of disgust quickly spread across her face- the expression only deepening as she extracted the spent wad of gum from her mouth and held it as if it were a hairball she could barely stand to look at. \"Ugh... Do you have a trash can, or somewhere I can put this? Please?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, already pleased at both the obvious results of her training and the distinct change in her tone of voice to something much less challenging- more submissive and respectful. There was a small waste bin under the bathroom sink, which I quickly acquired for her. \"Here you go. And to be precise, you were training on the machine for almost 26 minutes. Your phone call?\"\n\n\"Right, sorry,\" She said leaning down to grab her phone from her purse after handing the waste bin back to me. She was already talking to her 'friend' before I even had time to replace the bucket beneath the sink. As best I could tell, her eyes never left me- tracing my steps both there and back as I took a seat on the bed and waited for her call to end.\n\n\"I'm fine Priya,\" She said a second time. \"I was just being... overly cautious.\" A pause, her face lighting up with a smile that hinted at something naughty. \"It was amazing- you have to try it.\" Another pause- this one accompanied with her slowly wetting her lips. \"I'm serious! I feel really mellow and relaxed too. I bet it- yes, uh huh. Yeah- I bet it would be great just as a stress reliever. Even better than a massage.\" \n\nHer breathing was getting deeper again- and that look was still in her eyes as they started roaming around me as if trying to drink me in. Then she did something that honestly surprised me- her free hand rose up from her side and started massaging her breasts right in front of me- first one, then the other while her friend on the other line was saying who knows what. \"You know how hard it is to convince me of anything, Priya- consider me a true believer. Yes, I know...\"\n\nHearing her repeating her fragment out loud made my still rock hard cock twitch with frustrated need. It must have been more obvious than it felt, as her eyes were instantly drawn to it, locking onto the uncomfortable bulge in my crotch with laser like intensity.\n\n\"No I'm not going to give you any details. You're just going to have to try it.\" Her eyes flashed up to meet my own- then darted back and forth between them and my cock below. \"Tell you what. I'll do you a solid. I'll pay for your first session and then you can tell me if I'm full of shit. If you don't walk away feeling like a new woman our next girl's night is on me.\"\n\n\"Where was all this coming from?\" I wondered. There were only a couple of fragments that could have led to her getting this aroused when she looked at me. And certainly none that would have given her any reason to try and push her co-workers to try it as well. Something was off, but I still couldn't quite place what it was. There was no way the ice queen would have melted on her own after the show she put on before. \n\nWhile I might have been too dense to realize what had happened at the time, her interest in me and the invitation to show her more was becoming pathetically obvious. And, since my judgement was still more than a little clouded with the growing arousal in the air, I decided to test my limits. Reaching down, I started to unzip my pants. The way Anna's eyes seemed to expand to near saucers as she slowly sucked in a chest full of air told me I was pushing in the right direction.\n\n\"That's exactly what I'd like to see,\" She said into the phone and licking her lips hungrily as I continued to free my cock from the confines of my clothing . \"You can't stop me, Priya. I'm going to give it to him as soon as I'm off the phone... Ta-ta, Priya. I can't wait to hear how your session turns out.\" Then she hung up without even waiting to hear her friend's goodbye.\n\n\"So that was- oh!\" She flinched as she nearly yanked the headset out of its port as she tried to swiftly stand up out of her seat. \"I forgot this was still on- you were incredibly distracting just standing there staring at me like that.\" \n\n\"Here, let me help you,\" I said, quickly slipping out of my shoes and jeans before heading over to rescue my damsel in distress.\n\n\"My hero,\" She purred at me, wasting no time as she wrapped a hand around my cock the moment it was within reach of her. \"Is this for me?\"\n\nI smiled at her as I carefully removed the helmet and set it down, somewhat awkwardly, on top of the training monitor. \"That depends,\" I said, wrapping my arms around her. One hand flowed down her back to grab a handful of her ass and pulling her hard against me. The other rose up her back and into her thick dark hair, grasping it- and pulling. The effect thrust out her otherwise modest breasts against me and exposed her throat to me at the same time. I was really starting to like that pose. \"Where do you want it?\" I asked her after running my tongue up her neck nibbling on the lobe of her ear to get a good taste of her.",
        "\"Anywhere you want- as long as it's inside me,\" She gasped in response, her hand continuing to milk my cock with increasing speed. \n\n\"Good answer,\" I growled, turning her head down to pull her mouth into a warm and very welcoming kiss. My hands explored her lithe and muscular frame beneath the soft and luxurious cloth that was hiding it. The more I explored, the more excited she seem to get. \n\n\"Why do you wear such conservative cloths?\" I asked her once I had pulled far enough away from her to inspect the clothing that was still preventing me from seeing her naked.\n\n\"I work at a legal office- and I got tired of the way men would look at me.\"\n\n\"With a body like yours I can't imagine it really made that much of a difference.\" I told her honestly as I started untucking her blouse. \"I wanted you the moment I laid eyes on you the other day.\"\n\n\"Most men do,\" Came her arrogant reply. \"I used to hate it, but now- ungh...\"\n\nI interrupted her answer with a hand sliding beneath her top to grasp one of her breasts through her bra and give it a good squeeze. \"What about now?\"\n\n\"Now? All those men, undressing me with their eyes.\" She groaned against me as my other hand rose up and slipped back down to grab another mound of her flesh without the hindrance of her pants in the way. \"I think I might enjoy it- a reminder of... of how bad I want you. Of how good it feels when you look at me... like that.\"\n\n\"You like it when I undress you with my eyes,\" I asked her between another long and needy kiss. \"Would you like to undress for me now?\"\n\n\"Fuck yes!\" \n\n\"Get to it, then.\" I commanded, smacking her on the ass as I pushed her towards the bed. \"Strip!\"\n\n\"I was beginning to think you'd never ask and that cock was out just to torment me!\" \n\nI smiled at the zeal with which she removed her clothing to reveal the incredible body beneath. Her skin was tanned, though not as dark as Rachel, and it ran smoothly up a pair of incredibly well-defined legs that seemed to go on forever, especially after she slipped her high heels back on as the sole accent to her otherwise naked flesh. Her breasts were modest, larger than Maggie's but not even half of Rachel's- though they were certainly still perky enough to titillate.\n\nThe thought of Maggie and Rachel against the vision that lay before me summoned the tiniest of inner voices- begging me to reconsider. \"Rachel's enslavement had been almost an accident. How would Maggie feel if she knew I was taking yet another woman to bed instead of her? Would she feel betrayed, yet again?\" \n\nI let my desire and my growing relish for the power my machine was granting me loose to chase those doubts back into the abyss. Rachel loved being enslaved- she had told me so herself. As for Maggie, whatever it was that was keeping her from loving me could be removed the next time she sat at my machine. She would enjoy my growing collection of slaves right along with me- if for no other reason than because I wanted her to. \n\nAn impatient moan from my most recent victim drew me out of the dark spiral that had briefly captured my thoughts. \"You are a lot stronger than you look, aren't you.\" I said- a statement, not a question. Answered in a similar fashion as she ran her tight and toned arms up and down her well defined stomach. \n\n\"I have never had to try so hard to get a man to fuck me,\" She teased, reclining back onto the bed and shoving two fingers in and out of her pussy repeatedly, then raising them to her lips and making a show of licking off her own juices.\n\nI stepped up to the bed and crawled over her, taking one of her breasts in my mouth and sucking at it- circling the nipple with my tongue before threatening to bite down on it with my teeth. She only gasped beneath me, her hands reaching for my cock as she tried frantically to guide it into her-partially succeeding.\n\nI leaned up and replaced my teeth with a thumb and forefinger around her nipple instead- squeezing it hard enough until she was all but hissing at me with pain. \"That fucking hurts, dammit!\" She said, making furtive efforts to smack my hand away from her breasts. Which required her to stop trying for force my cock any further inside of her than it already was.\n\n\"Will you stick around tonight for some more training?\" I asked her with an evil grin on my face as I continued to inflict my tiny torture on her otherwise inflamed body. \"Stop fucking fighting me and answer the question!\"\n\nShe stopped trying to force my hand away but continued to squirm beneath me. \"Fuck! Alright. What? Training?\" I shifted my weight in order to pin her more effectively while still leaving my cock only barely parting the lips of her pussy. \"Yeah, sure,\" She hissed. \"Whatever you want. Fucking a-\"\n\n\"Whatever I want?\" I quoted her, pushing my cock just a little bit deeper until I could feel her react to my presence, subconsciously shifting her own weight to try and draw me in even further. I pulled out- nearly all the way out. \"You mean anything I want, right?\"\n\nAnna moaned between gritted teeth as she renewed her search for my cock, quickly finding it with one hand and ensuring that it did not leave her completely. \"Yesss, fuck! Anything- just- just...\"\n\nI leaned down closer to her, whispering in her ear. \"That's a Good Girl, Anna.\" I was pleasantly surprised at the way her voice immediately slurred and her body began to spasm beneath me.\n\n\"Oooooh... gawd-\" She started to moan, biting it off as she nearly screamed when I let go of her nipple and the pain from the blood pouring back into the starved flesh tore its way into her mind. \n\nThen I pushed myself inside her, as deep as I could go in one quick thrust- calling her a 'Good Girl' one more time. As I started pounding in and out of her I could see her eyes beginning to roll up into her head. It didn't take long after that for the level of her vocabulary to melt into words consisting of single syllables or less.\n\nShe had asked me to fuck her. She had even asked nicely. So I gave her what she asked for- enjoying myself immensely. \n\n<hr></hr>\n\nOnce again my inherent stamina, while improving quickly, was not quite able to keep up with the women I was collecting. Even Maggie was in better shape that I was- though if I had any chance of fucking someone under the table, as it were, it would have been her. I don't know why that should have surprised me- all three of them took much better care of themselves than I did. \n\nThe faint tickle of Rachel's suggestion earlier in the week reminded me that I had the ability to do something about that. And not just in the 'I should go to the gym more often' type of resolution. I could ensure that I would do it with just a few fragments and another short training session. \n\n\"Have to be a lot more careful about that, though.\" Anna's reaction when I had called her a 'Good Girl' had banished any doubts. \"When you are in the zone it's not just the text fragments that will affect you- anything you hear slips through as well.\" Even with my limited understanding of the brain it sort of made sense. If the fragments were passing through to the subconscious because the conscious mind was hyper-focused on solving the problems- then wouldn't spoken words be filtered out as just more useless noise? I would have to test it to be sure, but it seemed like spoken commands were at least as powerful as the repeated fragments - if not more so. \n\nIt was a new variable- greatly expanding the potential of the machine as well as its potential danger to anyone that used it. What would stray comments or bits of conversation do if you were to hear them while you were hooked up to the machine? And what of actual background noise like radio or television. The thought of commercial advertising running amuck in my subconscious gave me shivers. I resolved to make doubly sure the front door was locked and I was completely alone whenever I was training myself. Perhaps even get some earplugs.\n\nAnna shifted her weight just a bit as she basked in the afterglow of a good hard fuck- the moment drawing me out of hypotheticals and reminding me that I had a ready source of at least a few answers laying naked right beside me. I drew breath to ask her one of the many questions that were on the tip of my tongue, but she beat me to the punch.\n\n\"Everything is different now, isn't it.\" She asked, lifting her head just enough to look at me with those deep brown eyes. They seemed to be swimming with emotion so close to the surface I couldn't help but get drawn into them just a bit- more than enough to wash away most of my own thoughts, at least for the moment. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked her, waiting to see where this would lead.\n\nShe looked away, tracing a figure eight across my chest with her fingers absently. \"Yesterday I was angry at myself, and everyone else. All the abuse I had to endure every day at home, at the office- all because I was a failure.\" Her gaze turned back to me, her eyes brimming with fresh tears. \"But now, thanks to you and your machine, I'm going to be a lawyer someday. My dreams are finally going to come true... and it's all because of you.\"\n\n\"I don't know about all that,\" I half stammered- suddenly feeling slightly awkward at the outpouring of emotion. \"It's still going to take a lot of work. Law school takes years, and-\" \n\n\"I know that,\" She said, smiling gently with a grin that reached all the way to her eyes and seemed to make her face shine. \"But that's what I mean. I had given up on it all, and it was everyone's fault but my own.\" Her cheeks flushed a bit as her glance once again dropped to my chest, following her hand as it moved further and further down. \n\n\"I meant what I said- before,\" She said softly. \n\n\"Meant what?\" I asked, confused by the seemingly sudden change of topic. \n\n\"That I would do anything... to become a lawyer. It's been my dream since I was a child.\" She leaned up on one arm to kiss me even as her other hand finally reached low enough to wrap around my spent cock- though it was slowly beginning to show signs of life. \"Make me a lawyer with that machine of yours and I will do anything you want. I am yours in every way that matters for as long as you'll have me.\" \n\n\"That sounds pretty serious, Anna,\" I whispered, reaching up to move a few stray locks of hair from her face. My fingers were wet with freshly shed tears when I finally pulled my hand away from her. \"We just met a few days ago. I know we just fucked and all, but I already have a couple girls that I'm sort of-\"\n\nShe suddenly seemed so very fragile. \"I know it's sudden. And I don't- I mean I'm not trying to scare you. It's just that I- I mean... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said-\"\n\n\"Anna, calm down. Take a deep breath. I'm not going to run away screaming. What are you trying to tell me?\" It made it a lot easier to accept a little bit crazy when you were the one that made her that way. But I wasn't going to let her off the hook entirely. I wanted to hear it from her first.\n\nShe did as she was told, taking a deep breath, and then a second just for good measure as she worked to put her thoughts together. \"I've never fallen so hard for someone so fast before in my life,\" She whispered finally. \"I- I mean, I understand if you don't feel the same way. But that doesn't matter, not to me. I'm not trying to... I don't expect you to be exclusive. I mean, it makes total sense- a guy like you would... I mean, we've barely just met and I'm head over heels for you- crazy right? All I know... is that- Please, just don't send me away. All I know is that I don't know what I'd do without you. I need this. Now that I have it- I would do anything to keep it. Anything. Please let me have this? Please?\"\n\nI pretended to consider her argument for a while as she continued to slowly breathed life into my hardening cock with each gentle caress of her fingers. \"I help you achieve a life-long dream, and in return you swear from this day forward to serve me faithfully as my... I mean, if you're not expecting to be my girlfriend, then what would I even call you?\"\n\n\"I would be yours, in every sense of the word,\" She purred, evidently assuming my lack of refusal was tantamount to acceptance of her offer. \"That means you could call me whatever you wanted. I would be in no position to refuse.\"\n\n\"Servant. Maid. Minion... Whore? I can think of a quite a lot of things that would fall under 'anything', not all of which would be exactly legal.\" I attempted my best impression of Vulcan surprise. \"You're sure that's what you want?\"\n\n\"I've never been more sure of anything in my life. And as far as issues of dubious legality are concerned- I guess it's a good thing you're about to have such a devoted lawyer at your beck and call,\" She said, leaning down and slowly kissing her way down my chest. I noted absently that she was following the same trailing figure eight her hands had left not that long ago. \"Or, maybe even a whole office of them if I have my way...\" She murmured softly.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" I asked, feigning ignorance as I relaxed back into the bed beneath her delicate attentions.\n\n\"That machine of yours. Have you thought about what it could do other than just random puzzles or helping to memorize reams of legal precedents? Sneak in a few commands here or there, almost like a... a post hypnotic suggestion or something. Who knows what you could accomplish.\" She had closed the distance between my cock and her mouth. The warm touch of her tongue sliding up the length of my now hardening shaft sent fresh shivers up my spine. \n\n\"Have some experience with hypnosis, have you?\" I asked as her mouth wrapped itself around me and slowly sank down until it was half buried in her throat. \"God that feels good.\"\n\n\"MmHmm,\" She hummed against me before pulling back up for air. \"Tried some self-hypnosis tapes once or twice with varying degrees of success. God, your cock tastes fucking amazing! Is that your cum from before?\" A cheshire grin spread across her face as she slipped a hand between her legs- moaning with pleasure a moment later as she licked off what little cum she could recover. \"I can't wait to see what it tastes like when it's fresh.\" And with that she went back to sucking my cock with an almost wild abandon. \n\n\"Careful,\" I warned her. \"I may be hard again, but that doesn't mean I'm not still sensitive from before. And you may find getting another load out of me challenging tonight.\"\n\n\"Aaah. Fuck.\" Her disappointment was palpable as she sat up onto her legs beside me.\n\n\"I didn't say stop. A softer touch, is all. I believe sucking my cock would fall under 'anything', right?\"\n\nHer smile quickly returned. \"I believe it would at that. I was the one who offered the contract after all. Any ambiguity should therefore be ruled in your favor.\" \n\n\"Is that why you tried to convince your friend to have a session with my machine?\" I asked her, as she slowly worshiped me with her lips, mouth, and tongue. \"To give me an entire office under my control?\"\n\n\"Just because I couldn't pass a stupid standardized test,\" She said, while taking a break to rest her mouth and letting her well moistened hands keep me moaning in pleasure. \"Doesn't mean I'm not good at being a conniving bitch. I've just recently redirected those particular skills towards different ends.\"\n\n\"That I can believe,\" I said honestly, allowing her to concentrate on the use of her mouth for my pleasure for a time. She wasn't as skilled as Rachel- but I gave her props for her enthusiasm. She had given me a lot to think about though, and a lot of work to do as well. First off- I would need to change her training file to reinforce the new world view she seemed to have adopted so easily just from my accidental verbal indoctrination. I wasn't going to trust such a large change so fast from a new variable I hadn't even begun to test. Best to make sure to lock it in with a good four hour marathon with the updated software.\n\n\"I could give it a try- you know. Making some mental modifications with my machine? Care to be a guinea pig for an evil mind controlling villain-in-training? I feel it only fair to warn you, if you're right it could result in you becoming one of many devoted sex-slaves.\"\n\nAnna pulled her mouth off of my cock with an audible pop. \"I thought we already went over this. Let me try again. We have verbal, but binding agreement. Therefore, if you think of something, consider the following two caveats. Am I physically capable of doing it? Does it fall under the category of 'anything'? If so, then I am contractually obligated and very willing to carry out my end of the bargain- and do whatever the fuck you want. Understand?\"\n\nI attempted to raise an eyebrow at her. \"Should I be expecting a bill for this consultation?\"\n\n\"Anyone else, fuck yes. For you,\" She said, leaning back down to run her tongue along the length of my shaft. \"I will always offer my services pro bono.\"\n\nI couldn't resist. \"Good girl,\" I said aloud, smiling at the way she melted into a puddle of moans between my legs."
