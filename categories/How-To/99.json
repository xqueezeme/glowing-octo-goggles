        "When I was pregnant with my first baby, I didn\u2019t feel like having sex much during the first trimester\u2014I was nauseous and exhausted. During the second trimester, I felt back to my old self, in fact, I wanted sex more than ever, it seemed, but then my husband seemed suddenly disinterested in sex, which was very unusual for him. I thought it was because of my growing tummy, but when we talked, I discovered that he thought sex might harm the baby! That\u2019s just one of the many common misconceptions about sex during pregnancy. Having a baby doesn\u2019t mean the sex stops, (obviously, since people do have more than one baby!) it just means that you have to make a few adjustments as you grow as a couple, and a family.\n\nReasons Not to Have Intercourse\n\nThere are a few reasons to stop having sex during pregnancy, and your doctor will tell you about them, if they apply to you. If you are concerned, don\u2019t by shy about asking. Things like placenta previa (where the placenta implants over the cervix), premature labor, unexplained vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramping, cervical insufficiency, a dilated cervix, or ruptured membranes (your water has broken), might be reasons for you to stop having intercourse for part or all of the duration of pregnancy.\n\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean that the sexual energy can\u2019t keep flowing between you\u2014and there are plenty of alternatives to intercourse, including self-stimulation, mutual masturbation, oral sex and even anal sex, if you\u2019re into that. (You just have to be meticulous about hygiene, so as not to spread any possible bacteria to the vaginal area\u2014you want to really avoid infection during pregnancy.) If your doctor has said no orgasms (for her) this doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t work together to stimulate him!\n\nChanges\n\nThe majority of couples can continue to have sex throughout the entire pregnancy, but you still have to make adjustments as you go along. The female body goes through a lot of changes during those nine months, which aren\u2019t all bad, actually. Some women become aroused more easily, they climax more quickly (some even start having multiple orgasms for the first time during pregnancy!) and many men find the new curvy, ripe bodies of their partner even sexier. The opposite is true, too, of course\u2014some women experience a lag in their libido, and some men are turned off by the burgeoning shape of pregnancy, or they\u2019re afraid that sex might hurt the baby. Any of these feelings are normal. As a couple, if you know what to expect, you may be able to circumvent or deal with the changes better, and this may improve your sex life during pregnancy and beyond.\n\nFirst trimester\n\nIn the early months, you have to battle fatigue, sometimes along with nausea and fear of miscarriage. Breasts will be enlarged, and probably more tender, so care should be taken.\n\nSecond trimester\n\nHormonal surges level off. Fatigue and morning sickness usually lessen, the fear of miscarriage subsides as the statistical risk decreases, and many women show a surge in sexual desire. The heightened sensitivity of the erogenous zones is so thrilling to many women that they experience more enthusiasm for sex during the middle months of pregnancy than at any time in their lives. \n\nThe Final Months\n\nIn the final months, a woman may feel too large, too awkward, or too preoccupied with the coming birth. In the third trimester, as the ballooning abdomen literally comes between the woman and her partner, most women report that they focus more on becoming maternal rather than being sexual. Even if the body is willing, it is often clumsy. \n\nCommon Misconceptions\n\nThere are some common misconceptions about sex during pregnancy that we should get out of the way. Knowing that some of these are false may inhibit you less, and allow you both to enjoy sex more, which is always a good thing.\n\nSex Will Hurt the Baby\n\nNope. The baby is very well-protected in there. Men sometimes worry that penetration will hurt the baby, but a quick lesson in anatomy shows that, in fact, the penis isn\u2019t hitting the baby\u2019s head, like you may fear\u2014it is touching the mouth of the uterus, or the cervix, which is sealed with a thick mucous plug to guard against infection. The motion of sex may actually rock your baby to sleep! Sometimes the baby will be more active after a woman has an orgasm, not because it is feeling any pain or knows what\u2019s happening, but because it is responding to the mother\u2019s hormone level and heart rate changes. So don\u2019t let this myth hold back!\n\nSex Will Hurt The Mother\n\nThe engorgement of the vagina during this time and the ever softening cervix can be a source of discomfort at times, especially with very deep penetration, but this just requires an adjustment in terms of positions. With a little experimenting, you can find a position and technique that works for you both. Communication is key\u2014if it hurts, stop, and try a different position or another angle. There are lots of alternate positions that I\u2019ll talk about later that you can try. The good news is that the engorgement of the genitals and more sensitive nerve endings can also make the pleasure more intense! \n\nHaving Sex Will Cause Premature Labor\n\nHaving sex can cause contractions\u2014but these are the \u201cpractice\u201d contractions of labor, (called \u201cBraxton-Hicks\u201d) not the real deal. It\u2019s normal for a woman to experience some uterine contractions after an orgasm or after sex. This isn\u2019t premature labor. There is no medical evidence showing that the act of sex causes labor, although stimulation of the breasts and nipples can speed up the production of oxytocin, which can cause contractions as a woman nears her due date. As long as you\u2019re not at risk for preterm labor, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem. If the contractions continue longer than an hour, then call your doctor. \n\nOral Sex is Out\n\nI never did understand this myth. Why would oral sex be a no-no during pregnancy? Normal oral sex won\u2019t harm your baby at all, and it\u2019s actually the perfect solution if you\u2019re one of the couples who have been told not to have intercourse during pregnancy. The only risk is introducing air into the vagina, but this applies before pregnancy as well. Blowing air into the vagina could cause an air embolism (obstructing a blood vessel) which could potentially kill a woman, so that is definitely out\u2014but regular oral sex? It\u2019s perfectly safe!\n\nMaking it Enjoyable\n\nThere are ways to make this time in your life even better sexually than it was before. Here are a few tips and tricks to keep the fire alive during pregnancy.\n\n1. Act Sexy\n\nFor pregnant women, there often comes a point when they don\u2019t feel sexy anymore. Their bodies feel different, ungainly, everything feels \u201coff.\u201d The good news is, acting can effect feeling, so if you act sexy, you can actually start feeling sexy before you know it. This can start a wonderful cycle of acting and feeling sexy, a wave you can both ride.\n\n2. Accentuate the Positive\n\nAnother way to feel sexy is to get a sexy new look. Try a different hairstyle, experiment with make-up, buy some sexy accessories. So, you may not be able to fit into that corset, but you can still wear a sex nightgown, or buy yourself some sexy jewelry. \n\n3. Communicate\n\nTalk to each other about the way the pregnancy is effecting how you feel about sex. You may simply be under a false assumption, like I was during my first pregnancy, thinking my husband didn\u2019t want be because I was \u201cgetting fat,\u201d when it was really just that he was worried about hurting the baby. You never know what mountains you\u2019re making out of mole hills until you talk about it. \n\n4. The Power of Attraction\n\nWomen often worry that their burgeoning shape is unattractive to men, but research shows that this usually isn\u2019t the case. Men\u2019s eyes are actually drawn to soft curves, and you have a nice, big, soft curve up front now for him to feast his eyes on. Most men really do like the fleshy feel and look of a pregnant woman\u2019s body. If you have convinced yourself that your partner doesn\u2019t want you because you\u2019re \u201cfat,\u201d you are probably just feeding yourself a false belief. \n\n5. Don\u2019t Hide\n\nWomen often try to hide their bodies as they begin to change, but this is a mistake. Most men will be fascinated by the changes, and will love to watch them over time. Try to include your partner in your body\u2019s changes\u2014the darkening nipples, the enlarging breasts (some men love this part!), the growing tummy bulge. Let him feel the baby move inside of you\u2014this can be one of the most amazing, intimate moments in the world to share together.\n\n6. Dating Again\n\nIf this is your first baby, life is going to change considerably after your little bundle of joy arrives. Now is the time to really take advantage of your last few months of being just the two of you. Start \u201cdating\u201d each other again\u2014or take weekend trips away a few times, if you can. The second trimester is the best time to do this, because of increased sexual energy, and the fact that the belly hasn\u2019t gotten too big, yet. Make an effort to really connect and spend some romantic time together during the pregnancy.\n\n7. \u201cGift\u201d not \u201cService\u201d\n\nSometimes women really lose their desire to have sex during pregnancy, especially during the first few months, and in the last few weeks. Sex isn\u2019t an obligation or duty, and most men don\u2019t like to be \u201cserviced\u201d as if it is. If you are truly feeling ill, there is no reason to have sex\u2014but if it\u2019s just a laissez-faire kind of thing, where you\u2019re feeling listless or tired, give it a go anyway. You will often find that acting sexy, again, makes you start to feel sexy. Take advantage of the \u201cup\u201d times to gift your partner with your sexuality, rather than feeling it is a duty or an obligation.\n\nAlternative Sexual Positions\n\nComfort should come first. If she\u2019s not comfortable, you should stop and try something else. It may require a position change, or some other small adjustment. Again, communication is always key. Women shouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell their partner\u2019s when they\u2019re feeling uncomfortable. \n\nMissionary Position\n\nThis position still works, if you use pillows! It\u2019s amazing what a pillow or two can do! Try experimenting with raising her hips with a cushion under them. This keeps the tummy tilted away from him. Also, he can kneel between her legs, instead of being directly over her. This also works well with a few pillows under her hips. It reduces clitoral stimulation, but leaves him free stimulate her there with his hand. This position also works well if a woman can bring her bottom to the edge of the bed (or couch or chair) and he can stand or kneel, depending on the height of the furniture. You should also know that laying flat on your back in late pregnancy can sometimes make a woman dizzy, because the uterus presses on a main artery along the spine. If this happens, just change positions.\n\nWoman on Top\n\nThis one is a great position, because she has control of the amount of penetration, and sitting up on him leaves lots of room for her tummy. She can also turn around to face his feet, if their bellies get in each other\u2019s way (sometimes dads put on \u201csympathetic weight\u201d during pregnancy!) She can also try squatting over him, but towards the end of pregnancy, this requires more balance than she may have, and he may have to help, but it does provide lots of room for him to stimulate her clitoris.\n\nSide-Lying\n\nThis works better if the man is behind her, kind of spooning and entering her that way. She can reach down and stimulate her clitoris. Facing each other is more difficult, but it can be done, in a kind of \u201cscissoring\u201d posture. If you like this position, just keep experimenting until you get it right for both of you. \n\nDoggie-Style\n\nThis is a great third-trimester position. You can put a pillow under her tummy for support. If deep penetration is a problem, have her press her shoulders to the bed while she\u2019s on her knees, so she can reach under and wrap her thumb and forefinger around the base of his penis, to keep him from going in too far. She can have more control this way, and he doesn\u2019t have to gauge whether or not he\u2019s hurting her. You can try this position standing as well, just make sure you have a sturdy object for her to hang onto. \n\nOther Ideas\n\nIf you are one of those couples who has been told \u201cno intercourse\u201d\u2014or you\u2019re just finding it too difficult, no matter what position you try\u2014there are alternatives! \n\nMutual masturbation is fun, especially if you talk to each other throughout. Maybe this is a good time to share some hot fantasies! This may also be a good time to invest in a vibrator if you don\u2019t have one already. This can help, whatever positions you decide to be in, for manual stimulation of the clitoris. \n\nIf she\u2019s been advised not to have an orgasm, then oral sex for him, or a hand job, are the best ways for you to probably go, or he can stimulate himself while she whispers into his ear. If you are woman whose doctor has said orgasm is ok, just no penetration, then while you may not be able to do the traditional \u201c69\u201d position, you can do a modified version. The woman gets up on her hands and knees, and faces his genitals, just as she would for a 69 position, but instead of climbing onto him, she moves as close as she can, her knee against his shoulder. He can manually stimulate her clitoris from this position while she gives him oral. Oral sex should be fine right up until the end, and it\u2019s something you can both enjoy.\n\nAnal sex is something you probably won\u2019t read about in most \u201csex and pregnancy\u201d articles, but this is Literotica, and statistically speaking, there are probably more people here who have tried it than not. If anal sex was already part of your repertoire, you can continue doing this. The only issues are, as always, never go from anal to vaginal penetration, to avoid infection. You need to be even more vigilant during pregnancy about this rule. \n\nSex After Birth\n\nSo you\u2019ve made it through the pregnancy, and now you know what they meant when they said that life after baby is just never the same\u2014and that includes sex! It doesn\u2019t mean that your sex life will be worse, just keep in mind that things may bedifferent. In fact, some women say they experienced a shift for the better in their sex lives after baby was born. Here are some tips for postpartum sex that may help you make that adjustment:\n\n-- Have sex when you\u2019re ready, and not until then. Most health care providers ask that you wait 4-6 weeks postpartum (until bleeding has stopped) usually because of the risk of infection. Some women are ready very quickly (1 week postpartum!) and some need more time (4 months or more). The average time is about seven weeks. \n\n-- Lubrication! Make sure you and your partner take enough time to get into the mood and that you're feeling moist enough to handle it. If you think you need some more help than what mother nature is providing, be sure to use an over the counter lubricant rather than worry needlessly. If you're still concerned, talk to your practitioner. \n\n-- Experiment together! Side-lying positions or woman-on-top gives more control over penetration and allows a woman to gauge how much pressure is being put on parts that may still be healing. If you try intercourse and it\u2019s uncomfortable or painful, simply stop and try again another time. There\u2019s always cuddling and petting, oral sex, or mutual masturbation, which are all fun, too! The most important part is being close and feeling good. \n\n-- Contraception is a must, even for nursing mothers, if you don\u2019t want to get pregnant again quickly. Ask your health care provider\u2019s advice about the best contraception options for you.\n\n-- Healing from an episiotomy or even a cesarean birth can take a long time, much longer than the standard 4-6 weeks they say to abstain from intercourse, sometimes months, even up to a year. If pain persists after an episiotomy, you can ask your practitioner for an estrogen cream that may help. \n\n-- There may be several psychological issues that will make you hesitate to take the plunge back into your sex life. Fatigue, poor body image, a feeling that your body and breasts belong to the baby, jealousy (on your partner\u2019s side, of the baby and the time and attention he/she is receiving), fear of conception (another pregnancy), fear that things \u201cwon\u2019t be the same\u201d now that he has seen you give birth. Any and all of these may hold you back. The key here is communication. Talk about your feelings with your partner and ask him about his. \n\nJust because you have made the decision to have a child, doesn\u2019t mean that your sex life is shot. Children bring challenges to everything, and that includes sex\u2014but they also bring joy, and the changes you experience in everything will be an adjustment that you can and will make. Sex during or after pregnancy doesn\u2019t have to be a chore or a battle. The key is good communication, a sense of humor, and a great deal of love. Keep connecting with one another throughout the pregnancy, and after the birth, and you will find ways to enjoy sex during pregnancy and beyond!"
