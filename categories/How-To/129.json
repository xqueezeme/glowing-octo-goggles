        "How to Seduce a Cougar - Give Her Five Reasons To Pick You To Play\n\nDear Angel,\n\nIf Cougars are horny and want to have sex, why is it so hard to get one to connect with me?  I try to sext them and send sexy messages but nothing works.\n\nCurious Cub\n\nHi Curious, \n\nI feel for guys like you.  I get messages every single day from guys trying to get me to sext with them and I have the exact opposite reaction.\n\nThe irony?  Men are looking for a woman who likes sex.  I am a woman who loves sex.  But, if a man comes on with too much too fast, I don\u2019t even read the second sentence. You can\u2019t start with dessert when you haven\u2019t even set the table.\n\nMissed opportunity for sure.\n\nThere are lots of horny women out there. They are hanging out in the chat rooms and on the dating sites.  Do you know a single woman out there who doesn\u2019t love to text?  You have the answer in the palm of your hand.\n\nYou have to make a woman shiver before she will deliver.\n\nThere is an art to inviting a woman to sext with you.  Once you know the words to use, you win.  We women cannot resist a text. It is worth every bit of practice on your part to learn which words to text and when.\n\nCheck this out:\n\n\"I'd love to peel back that black shirt of yours and wrap my mouth around your boob.\"\n\nThis was sent to me as a first message. That might be hot for some but not for me. If it was part of a story much later, I may have liked it.  Timing is everything.\n\nHere are 5 things every Younger Guy (yes YOU) need to know about seducing older women: \n\n1. A Fountain of Youth: Whether she is 35, 45 or 65, there is a horny younger self hiding out deep inside this woman. Once you coax that part of her out to play it is like you are a fountain of youth for her.  Take all the time you need to awaken this part of your lady.  Your success depends on it.\n\n2. History Lesson:  The good side has a tough flip side.  She hasn\u2019t been a young horny thing for a very long time.  Her heart has been broken dozens of  times.  Men have used her and abused her. The working world has chewed her up.  She has a history.\n\nLucky for you, you don\u2019t have to undo her history, just respect it. Even though she might be ok with the age difference, the taboo view of family and friends needs to be eased. \n\n3. Insecurity Blanket:  Makeup and Spanx may be helping your Older Beauty look as spectacular as she does. She is hot and you want her. That means at some point Makeup and Spanx will be gone and she will be her fabulous naked self.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem?  There\u2019s a good chance that she is feeling badly about her body.  Sags, ripples and dimples, spots, dots and wrinkles have appeared and she is not thrilled. \n\nThis is a major area for you to enchant her.  Your Older may need reassurance. Whisper to her how soft her skin is, tell her how much you love to touch her and how attracted you are to her.\n\n4. Sleeping Beauty:  There is a strong chance that your Lady has not had a toe curling orgasm in years or even ever before.  Now I am a sexy sixty something who is having the best sex of my life.  The much younger man who helped me discover how fun sex is, will always be special to me.  Move delicately here and build trust so she can explain to you what she wants. And then, listen.\n\n5. Cyber Sex Secret:  You may just find out that your lady is easily pleased in chat.  Phone sex can be hot also but text sex has a nice advantage.  She can keep it and read it again, and again.  There is a good chance that she will feel safe and distant and that can open her up to major orgasmic activity. \n\n For some of us, there is nothing hotter than texting romantic actions back and forth with the right partner.  It is like being in a romance novel.  Delicious.\n\nThe bottom line is that your Cougar is a survivor of love, romance and sex gone wrong.  She has her history and she likes you because you have a shorter story than hers.  She loves attention and may be starving for exactly what you have to offer her. \n\nShe may also doubt your motives and not believe that you are truly attracted to her.   Let her control the pace. Show her you care about what is important to her.  Let her take the relationship to the next level when she is ready.  Flirt with her and remember\u2026..she needs to feel smitten.\n\nNotice I said SHE needs to feel smitten. You may be smitten but that doesn\u2019t mean she is.  If you are not sure if she is smitten, she is not. Read through the 5 tips above one more time. Give her time to see if she is smitten or not.  It is super flattering to have a younger man interested, she just needs to see, feel and know it is real.  Once she is smitten, the door opens.\n\nCougar romance is every bit as hot as you\u2019ve heard. Take your time, set your older up for success and enjoy the ride!\n\n[Bonus Turn On Tip: If you like exciting a woman, there are plenty of Cougars out there. Women saying no to you? Dial it back and flirt. We love that and if we like you, we will flirt right back. Once you make us shiver, it won't be long til we deliver.]"
