        "This is my follow up piece on how to receive anal sex. In this segment, I want to share more logistical ideas, tips, and experiences in receiving anal sex that can help the reader learn about potential unknown facts that I may not have shared in my first writing. As I try to think back on my sexual experiences, I have estimated to have had sex with probably 30-35 women, I have blown over 100 guys, and taken as many as 50-60 dicks in my ass. I have lots of experience and want to help you if you are thinking about allowing someone to put his cock in your ass. I may briefly touch upon something I covered in my first writing but I will not repeat myself in depth. \n\nWhy We Do It\n\nFeeling pleasure from receiving anal sex is first mental and then physical. I will first talk about the mental aspect of receiving anal sex. I explained in my \"How to give great blowjobs\" writing that swallowing a man's cum is great for people who like to be dominated or humiliated because it allows you to feel used or allows your lover to mark his territory with his sperm. That submissive mentality is what excites people like me who feel that way. Taking a man's erect penis in your ass has the same erotic effect. Then if you go a step further and take another man's cum in your ass, not only do you feel the physical pleasure from the warm sticky texture but the mental fantasy from allowing a man to breed you or use you as an object that pleasures his cock and accepts his seed. \n\nThat mental stimulation of being dominated is why so many women do not enjoy anal sex. They cannot get past that \"afraid it is going to hurt\" mentality because they can already get \"breeded\" naturally or be dominated vaginally. If your mentality is \"It's his birthday so I want to do something special for him no matter how much I don't want to do it,\" then you already will not enjoy it as the receiver. Men or women who love to be dominated or humiliated are those who enjoy anal sex and the more you are dominated, the better it is. This is why we love bigger cocks, black cocks, large men, being a \"bitch,\" calling someone daddy, etc. Those references show you are completely submitting. Submissives think, \"If I can take an 8 inch cock in my ass, then I will really be dominated if that cock is 12 inches and black.\" Mentally, this is why men like to get fucked in the ass. \n\nAnother mental aspect from receiving anal sex from a submissive's point of view is not only knowing your partner is using your ass for his pleasure but you have to ability to satisfy him. Just knowing you have that power is also an aphrodisiac. Your power also lies in the fact that not only you can accept his erect dick in your ass but you can do it well. That ability will keep him coming back for more. Nothing will be make him happier than if you can take all of his dick without hesitation. A well hung man usually cannot fit his entire penis in a vagina without pain, but he can put all of it inside a rectum. Your partner loves the power aspect of making you squirm a little or yell out when he pounds your hole but he will not like it if he can't fit all of himself in you or you keep pulling off of it because you cannot handle the pain. I have had 5 inch cocks in me as well as 12 inch. I allow him to put it all inside me and allow him to fuck his style until he has a strong finish. That is the key to being a good bottom. \n\nIf done properly, most of the time the person receiving anal sex, can be pleasured physically as well. I enjoy jacking off while getting screwed in the ass. I know how my body works and use the guy's cock to my advantage as a woman would do masturbating with a dildo. You just have to get lots of practice to get the right feel and get yourself off the way that gives you the most pleasure as your riding or getting pounded. It doesn't happen often, but I have shot my load from just being fucked without using my hands. I think the mood and his dick size has to be just right for that to happen. I think the perfect dick size for the receiver to gain pleasure is 8 to 9 inches in length and about 4-5 inches in girth with a slightly larger than average head. This size cock fits snug in you and the head messages your prostate just enough to give you that physical pleasure you need to get off. I have taken and enjoyed cocks of all sizes but to get your own pleasure, I feel those measurement criteria is what works best for me but it also depends on the size of the man receiving it. \n\nOverall Preparation\n\nOnce you have overcome the mental obstacle of anal sex, it is time to proceed. If you are a male, you need to think a little bit like a women in the traditional sense. You are keeping your ass prepared for him to enter at a moment's notice. You need to keep your body's digestive system regular, your ass clean, well groomed, and tight. Keeping true to these factors will allow you to accept his cock no matter the time of day and on a regular basis. Men love when you are always ready. \n\nStaying regular means keeping your digestive system in order. You need to eat small portions of protein and fiber which will keep your bowel movements regular. It is still a good idea to use enemas before you engage in anal sex but it is not always feasible if you engage spontaneously on occasion. Using enemas can also be used in foreplay by having your partner insert it and discharge its contents inside you. I do NOT get into the brown stuff so I like to clean up in private to get myself ready for cock. \n\nIf you're in a relationship where your man wants sex on a daily or every other daily basis, then there will be times where you cannot flush yourself out with an enema. During my junior year in college, I lived with a guy named Bob, and since he would only get to see his girlfriend every other weekend, he wanted to fuck, get a blowjob, or sometimes both, every day except the weekends she was visiting. I had my own room and there were many mornings he would wake up with that raging hard on or even come into my room in the middle of the night wanting to fuck my ass. I didn't always have time to use an enema, so he would lube up his rock hard, 9 inch, large headed dick and once he got it in me, he would pump away and usually it didn't take long before he unloaded his spunk up me. \n\nBecause I kept myself regular, most of the time, there were no issues but I always had a towel handy just in case. Never have anal sex without a towel. It can have many uses such as wiping the lubrication off your hands before you or your lover get started. The towel can be used for any santorum liquids expelled during anal sex. It can be used to wipe off your lover's cock in the middle of anal sex if you decided to suck it to finish him off (you really don't have time for that if he wants to pull out and cum in your mouth). Of course, the towel can be used to wipe the cum and lubrication out of your ass after you have finished. A towel has many functions and is always needed during anal sex. \n\nKeeping clean also refers to your outer asshole as well. I have discussed in length about enema use in my first writing and in this one, so keeping a clean inner rectum has been covered. A clean outer section is also a must. It is a good idea to always have handy/baby wipes around. You can carry a few around in a zip lock bag for emergencies. If you meet someone at a club or pub and you end up in the back seat of his car getting your ass fucked, you don't want to be caught \"dirty.\" \n\nKeeping your ass well groomed means keeping it groomed according to your man's taste. To me, it means keeping my ass muscular, shaved, and having a good complexion. I work out by doing many stair steps and elliptical machine running to keep my ass in good shape. I like to keep my ass hairless. I shave or have it waxed on a regular basis. A good complexion on your ass is important so you do not have zits or blemishes. I use special moisturizing cleaners to keep my ass blemish free. In my experiences, if a guy sees you have a muscular, smooth ass, he will more likely want to plunge his fat cock in it. You have to be willing to put in some maintenance. Keeping your ass in shape will also allow you to heighten your sensitive pleasure nerves and allow you the stamina to accept dick for longer periods of time. \n\nKeeping your ass tight not only refers to keeping your ass and legs in shape it also refers to your hole. There are some guys who enjoy having their ass dominated so much they are constantly pushing the envelope with larger things such as fisting and humongous dildos. A man's asshole is resilient and can recover from large cocks but eventually having gigantic objects shoved in there consistently will have ill effects, especially as you age. It is perfectly fine using dildos and butt plugs on yourself when you are in need of that anal sensation. Riding and bouncing on the occasional large, black, real feel, dildo while jacking off is fine and great but remember you want to keep your asshole warm and tight for your lover's hard dick and the way to do this is by using your ass sensibly. \n\nIf you keep your ass and legs in shape, it will provide you with benefits as well. For one, stronger legs will allow you to ride him longer. A guy loves when you are able to sit down on his hard dick, with your feet flat on the bed or floor, and bounce up and down in a smooth, consistent motion. It feels like you are milking his prick. Having your legs and ass in shape will also allow you to fuck him when he needs to rest his hips or is out of breath. There are times when he is on his knees behind you, and you can do the work by rocking back and forth. A guy loves when you are able to fuck him while he is resting. \n\nCondom Use\n\nIf you are using a condom, then the type and size are your major concerns. I discussed in my first writing about the mishaps that can happen if you choose the wrong size. If your partner has good stamina and fucks for a length of time, then size becomes even more of a concern. You want that rubber to perform as well as the cock wearing it. Most cocks are average in size and a standard condom works just fine. Out of all the cocks that I have serviced, only about 20 percent needed large sizes. Out of those 20 percent, about half of them, we went bareback. I always try to have some Magnum XLs on hand.\n\nType of condom is personal preference. If you are allergic to latex, then you can use lamb skin. The dilemma is what should be the thickness of the rubber? The answer can be a catch 22. Thinner condoms allow your lover to feel your rectum warmth which will coax him into cumming quicker but those obviously aren't as durable. Assholes are much rougher on condoms than vaginas. Now if your lover uses a thicker condom, then the chances are it will last throughout your sex session but it takes away some of the feeling which in turn causes him to fuck longer. In some ways this can be good, especially if you're jerking off while your ass is getting reamed, but it also can cause sex friction in your asshole and that eventually becomes painful. This is why I dedicated a lot of time discussing the importance of lubrication in my last writing and I will touch upon that again later.\n\nNovelty condoms are a matter of personal choice but actual benefits are minimal with the exception of the visual stimulation for one or both of you. For anal sex, you don't need ribbed condoms. As a recipient, you cannot feel the ribbed unless he is really thick but even then, I don't think it feels any better. You obviously do not need any spermicidal lubricant for anal sex and regular lubricated condoms do not supply near enough lubrication. The vagina offers natural lubrication and bareback offers a small amount of natural lubrication when he leaks precum but condoms will need outside lube to be effective. I will say, using colored condoms can be visually stimulating for some just because they are different. \n\nI was with this guy for a few weeks who loved the glow in the dark condoms. Have you seen these? They really glow in the dark if exposed to light first. I would estimate his cock to be about 7 inches and I would put the condom on him and he loved to turn off all the lights until the room was pitch black. All I could see was that glowing orange, green or whatever color sticking out and looking like it was floating in air. His bed was in the middle of the room with a large mirror on the wall to the right side. I would look through that mirror and see this glow in the dark cock disappear in my ass and reappear as he pumped in and out. I have to admit that it was also a turn on for me and I would jack off all over his bed while he was fucking me. After he would cum, he would pull out and I could see the tip filled up with spunk through the condom which is also erotic. \n\nBarebacking\n\nAs you know, this is the most common term used when there is anal sex without a condom. It feels much more natural. You both get to feel the warmth of each other. He will love the warmth of your rectum walls snug around his erection while you will get pleasure from feeling the heat coming off his dick inside your ass. This will allow him to get off quicker and it will make it more pleasurable for you to jerk off while he is pumping. At times it can be more pleasurable if your lover is uncircumcised because you can feel that thick foreskin moving as he slides his cock in and out. This is especially true if his dick is thick and has a constricted fit inside you. \n\nBarebacking also allows you to take cock longer without as much friction. In these days of erectile drugs, men last much longer than in the past. The myth is thinking that only older men who have trouble getting hard take erectile dysfunction drugs. In fact, many young men take them to strengthen and maintain their hard-ons. I have been with many young men who took Viagra or Cialis before we fucked and they ended up grunting and thrusting for a long time. For young men to energize their cocks with enhancing drugs can also allow them to cum more than once. I can think of at least 3 different instances where the guy fucked me, blew his load in my ass, then kept going until he came again without getting soft. The cum also helps with the lubrication in which I described in part one. \n\nBarebacking allows you to use varieties of lubrications. I discussed this in part one but with a condom, you are using that for safety so only use water soluble lubes but when you go bareback, you can get creative. When you get creative, don't go overboard and use them frequently but occasionally it feels great to use Vaseline, baby oil, cooking oil, or something without alcohol because alcohol based products will eventually burn. \n\nAnother benefit of barebacking is feeling the cock spurt inside you during ejaculation. The truth is you don't always feel the cum shooting out. Sometimes it depends on the cock size, depends on how numb your asshole has become from the friction and sometimes it is just the luck of the draw. When you actually feel that warm liquid hitting the inside of your rectum walls, it sends that extra sexual sensation through you. \n\nSpeaking of warm liquid, another variation in anal sex is called getting a \"golden enema.\" This is when after your lover has ejaculated in your ass, he then empties his bladder by peeing in it. He may have to wait for a minute or two because it is not easy to urinate with an erection but not impossible. Golden enemas are more common after an ejaculation because most of the time, the erection starts to semi deflate which makes it easier to piss. The first time it happened to me, I didn't even know he was going to do it. It was a guy who woke up with a morning hard on after a night of drinking. He woke me up and started pumping away. I remember we were in the doggie position with my legs closed and his were spread. He was sort of laying on top of me when he came but just stayed still inside me and I just thought he was taking his time finishing up. He was a bit of a shaker after he came. All of a sudden I feel my stomach start to bloat and filling up with a very warm liquid. As I began to pull off, he grabbed my hips to hold me still and that's when I realized what he was doing. This guy pissed what seemed like a gallon and I felt like I was going to blow up. It started running out all over the bed and when he pulled out, I clenched up and ran to the bathroom but not before there was a mess everywhere. It sounded like a woman pissing for about 2 minutes when I started expelling all his piss from my rectum. I have had other lovers do this but you never forget that first time. Urine is mostly water and ammonia. There is a debate over the health of this practice and it has risks just like semen or any other bodily fluids, but no more or no less. If that is your thing and he is healthy, let it rip. \n\nProblem Remedies\n\nThe first problem in receiving anal sex is fitting him inside you. I discussed at length about proper lubrication and repeated entry and removal until your sphincter gets acclimated to his size pain free is a great technique. Another way to help him fit his cock in you is the corkscrew technique. When his head is up against your asshole and it seems to be reluctant to slide in, sometimes the reason is the lube hasn't been spread evenly and there may be just a small area of skin on skin or rubber on skin that has a sticking effect. If he is controlling the entrance, have him rub this cock head up and down your hole a few times and twist his cock a little as he pushes. That corkscrew effect will help it go in smoother. If you are controlling the entrance by sitting on it, you can twist your hips as your sitting down and that will provide the same effect. \n\nAnother problem that may be keeping him from getting inside you or even staying inside you is dick angle. Dick angle refers the alignment of the erection in comparison to your asshole. If you are tall with long legs and you are on your knees and a shorter guys is on his knees behind you, his dick angle would be upward and therefore more difficult at the point of entry. A quick fix would be you could spread your legs further apart causing your ass to lower or your lover could get closer to you, get on his feet and off his knees, or he could even put some pillows under his knees to make him higher. If he is much higher than you, then the same entry problems could arise. \n\nDick angle could also be the problem if he keeps slipping out of you while he is fucking. Let's say you are riding him while he is laying on his back and his cock keeps slipping out of your ass. Excluding the fact you could be bouncing or riding too high every time you come up but your angle might be off. You more often than not are too far up toward his abs and a quick fix would be to scoot back a few inches and straighten your posture. This would improve your angle and allow the cock to have a straighter tunnel causing it to stay inside you throughout the session. Another example of poor dick angle is when in the missionary position and he either has trouble putting it in or keeping it in. To fix that, if you are flexible, you can put your legs back further by putting them over his shoulders or putting pillow underneath your ass if your legs are going to be more spread to the side. Improving this angle will allow the anal sex to be easier and your lover will be more comfortable without worrying he will slip out of your asshole half way through. \n\nThere are some other techniques that could help fit that cock inside your ass or at least help you mentally deal with the initial pain, especially if your lover is well hung. Rhythmic breathing can help which is the same concept as a pregnant woman breathing during childbirth. As your lover is pushing that fat dick inside your anus, you want to breathe quick and shallow until you have gotten acclimated to the size and the pain subsides. The stronger the pain the faster the breathing. Another technique is called self-stimulation. This is when you play with yourself by stroking your dong, rubbing your balls, or a combination of both, as your lover is trying to enter you. This physical stimulation can help take your mind off the cock entry pain. Finally, you can spread yourself open with your hands. Many times when your lover is trying to fit himself inside you, he may fumble around and he may not be completely at your asshole entrance. I sometimes, spread my ass cheeks apart for him and guide him to my hole using communication until his cock head is up against the exact spot. This will prevent any unnecessary friction or skin on skin resistance. ",
        "Earlier in this writing, I discussed asshole friction pain that can occur from longer sessions of anal sex and I want to give some tips on how to combat that problem. I have talked about lubrication in depth and of course that is your number one priority even if you have to continually re-lube every so often. However, if your lover is still wearing your asshole out to the point of friction pain, then one technique that I use is called alternative finish. This means you finish him with a hand or mouth but in a subtle way. You first offer some seductive or kinky talk that entices him to stop fucking and allow you to take over. If he is wearing a condom, take it off or if he his fucking you bareback, then use your towel to wipe off the lube. At that point, he will be out of his mind in lust and just wants to cum.\n\nHere is the example of how NOT to do it. He is fucking you and it starts hurting and you say while you grimace, \"Damn that hurts, why don't just let me jack you off or something.\" \n\nHere is an example of how to do it. The guy will be pounding me and I will say in a seductive voice while ending in a rhetorical question, \"You just take your time and unload your heavy balls in me. Ok? Oh my, I can feel your cock throb in my ass, I am really in the mood to taste it, would you mind if I finish you with a blowjob so you can cum in my mouth? Or let's say the guy is fucking me and has been working so hard, he is dripping with sweat, I might say something like this, \"Look at you, you are doing such a good job but I am really craving that dick of yours. I'm going to let you rest while I suck you off! You don't mind do you?\" You could also say, \"You are fucking my ass so good, do you want to fuck my mouth?\" Once you say something like that, then he will cum for you pretty quick after you start sucking his dick. \n\nIf your lover really wants to cum in your ass and the friction is wearing you down, then you can do the \"double take\" technique. If your barebacking, have him pull out, wipe it off, suck and jack him which will give you time to rest your ass, add more lubrication to his dong, and then switch positions before reinserting him for the big finish. If he is wearing a rubber, then always have an extra one, unwrapped and ready before starting. You can do all the same things I just mentioned, the only difference is put the new condom on him before lubing and reinserting. Never try to put the same condom back on him. It is unsanitary and it raises your chances of getting body fluids in you. \n\nThat look\n\nI call this next section \"that look\" because men are very visual and we get our mental stimulation from what we see more than any other sense. We call our visual stimulations fetishes, sexual quirks or just \"our thing.\" Fetishes have a wide range of items, roles, and senses. What is highly sexual powerful to one could be disgusting to another including anal sex. For those of us who enjoy anal sex, I will discuss some sexual fetishes among men that help energize the experience. \n\nThe personality of the man who is on top many times will determine the fetish setting. There is a wide range of desires from having the bottom be dressed very feminine to having him be very masculine. When I had my sex escapades in college especially with my roommate Bob and the black athletes, they wanted me more feminine. I have worn about everything for my lovers such as makeup, wigs, lipstick, women's clothing, pantyhose, stockings with garters, bras, etc. I have also had lovers who loved when I wore jock straps, mustaches or goatees, athletic clothing or socks, etc. I will break down a few of these just a bit later. \n\nMany men, gay or straight, usually have one of their top fetishes centered on feet. This foot fetish varies from men liking different socks, different shoes, and different ways to incorporate feet. The current guy I'm with likes when I wear thick, athletic, white socks scrunched down around my ankles. When he is getting close to cumming he likes to fuck in the missionary position. He holds my ankles with my legs straight up in the air. As he is about to shoot his load, he puts my socked feet together and mashes his face into the bottom of my soles. I can hear his muffled pleasure screams inside my socks as he fills my rectum up with his sperm. I was with another guy a few years back who liked to do the same thing but he wanted bare feet and he would suck on my big toe as he blasted his load. \n\nI personally think it is sexy for the guy fucking me to wear shoes. When Vinny would feed my ass his huge black anaconda, he sometimes would wear his light brown, high top, Timberland boots. I could barely see his black ankle socks inside those untied boots. It made me feel as though he was very masculine and in charge which is what most submissives like when getting fucked. \n\nAnother clothing item that men enjoy when having anal sex is athletic supporters or jock straps. This item is somewhat clich\u00e9 but visually and physically effective. It symbolizes masculinity and athleticism which is erotic for gay men. It has practicality uses as well. First, it has straps down the side but leaves the back open which means you can wear it while your are taking your lover's dick. Another practicality use for the jockstrap is that it prevents jiggling. When a man is fucking your ass and he gets thrusting in and out at a brisk pace, your own cock and balls can swing and smack yourself which can get painful. That jockstrap cups and contains your junk which keeps it safe. The drawback is that you obviously cannot jack off while you are using it. \n\nUsing role play with clothing can also be sexually stimulating. You might have your partner dress up in suit and tie like a business man and stick his dick out of his dress pants to fuck you. You can have him keep his shirt, tie, dress socks with the men's garters on while his pants are off while fucking your asshole. I like when a man's necktie is dragging against my back as he pumps. You can also use different occupations such as cowboy, policeman, soldier, construction worker, fireman, etc. If you use any those themes, you want to make sure it is subtle and serious so that it doesn't turn corny or too much \"village people.\" \n\nPositions\n\nThis is my last section and I will share some anal sex positions with you other than just the typical ones that are commonly used and the positions I shared in my first writing post. When deciding on a position or positions, you need to know the reason you're fucking. Is it a long love session? Is it a quickie? Is it in the back of a pickup truck and you need to be discreet? Are you incorporating a fetish? Does he have a huge cock that potentially can be painful? These are just a few questions that need to be answered that will help you decide on proper anal sex positioning.\n\nThe first position is the one I described when I got my first golden enema. It is a variation of the doggie position only with the receiver having his legs closed and the giver has his legs spread wider. In this position, he is able to insert his cock a little further than the traditional doggie style because his thighs no longer block the entrance. He can fuck while on his feet rather than his knees. You can also lay down on your stomach which will allow him to lay on top of you, have his knees on the bed, and use your lower back, your shoulders or even the bed as a place to brace his hands and arms. I have even taken this position a step further and laid flat on my stomach with my legs spread wide while hanging my bottom half over the side of the bed. My lovers have stood between my legs as they fucked. \n\nAnother variation from doggie style is ass cheek fucking. This is similar to titty fucking a girl. Your lover puts his hard dick between your ass cheeks with is head pointing toward your back (no penetration). He then uses his hands to squeeze your ass cheeks around his dong and he fucks them until he blasts all over your back and ass. It is different and some men love this on occasion. \n\nCrab fucking is also a variation of doggie style. Instead of getting on your hands and knees, stay on your feet, and put your hands on the floor. If it is physically difficult, it may be easier to put your hands on a stool or coffee table. If your ass is too high in this position, just walk your hands out further from your body. This gives your lover great access to your ass while he grabs your hips and thrusts away.\n\nThe next position can be great for both of you. Your lover should sit on the edge of the couch. You need to sit on his dick/lap facing him. He should help you lay your shoulders and head on the floor while your ass is still on the couch and his dick is still buried inside you. Your lower body is now dangling over your head and he should stand up with his legs spread and fuck you in a downward motion. Your dick is overtop your face and he can jack you off while he fucks and eventually he can give you a facial with your own dick. I've had lovers who preferred me to jack myself off while they fucked and I tried to cum in my own mouth. This was a turn on for them and they would pull out and jack off in my mouth or on my face as well. It is a little messy because the distance between his or your dick to your face is far, but well worth it. \n\nAnother unique position is side saddle ridding. We have all rode a dick either facing our lover or facing away but not many fuck while facing the side. Have him lay by the headboard of the bed. It's ok for his legs and feet to dangle over the side. Sit on his cock sideways while you hold the headboard for leverage. It is a slightly different feel for both of you and you can ride him for longer periods of time before tiring. He will be squirting in no time. \n\nThere are many slight variations to the missionary position. Most of them depend on your leg and feet placement. If you're flexible, you can let him put your legs behind your head as he pumps, or you can put your legs over his shoulders, spread your legs out to the side, put your feet in his face, or put your feet on his chest. Putting your feet on his chest allows you to do a couple of things. First, it helps keep his entire weight off you while he fucks and secondly, that angle helps spread your ass apart better which initially makes accepting his cock easier. \n\nSometimes, your man is in a hurry and just needs a quickie. The standing position is great for quickies. I used to go camping with some buddies and my boyfriend and I would go out into the woods and I would lean against a tree while he fucked my ass. I would just pull my pants down around my knees and he would slip it in me and be finished in 5 minutes. There would be no dirty or messed up clothes except the occasional wet spot on the back of my pants from his sperm leaking out of me. \n\nAnother great quickie position starts with him sitting on the couch or chair watching television. Pull his shorts to the side or pull his cock out through the slit in his underwear. Face away, sit down on this prick, and ride quick and smooth. This not only stimulates yourself, but it tells him that you really needed his cock and this power will make him cum quickly. Through the whole process, don't say a word. When he is finished, you manually put his cock back in his pants and make sure they fixed just like they were before you started. Then walk away without saying anything and act casual like nothing happened. \n\nThere are many ways to enjoy anal sex and gathering as much information about it can do nothing but help you. Be safe and responsible while you engage. Good luck."
