        "Note: When I talk about internet romance, I\u2019m not referring to pay sites of any kind. I\u2019m talking about consenting adults who \"meet\" on the internet, communicate on the internet and perhaps ultimately by phone or in person, and have an entire cyber relationship on the internet not for money, but for the pure pleasure and excitement of it.\n\n\n\n\"Are you hot?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you wet?\"\n\n\"God, yes.\"\n\n\"Do you want me?\"\n\n\"More than anything in the world right now\u2026\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"I want you to lick my pussy. I want to feel your tongue dancing along my clit, pushing in and out of my pussy. I want to feel it on my thighs and on my ass. All over\u2026\"\n\n\"Do you want to taste my cock in between your lips? Do you want to feel it throbbing as I push it far down your throat?\"\n\n\"I do baby\u2026I do.\"\n\n\"Do you want to get on all fours as I enter you from behind, my cock pushing into you slowly\u2026inch by inch\u2026until it fills you up and makes you shiver?\"\n\n\"Yes, God yes. You\u2019re gonna make me cum\u2026\"\n\n\"Yes I am darling. I\u2019ve got your long your hair in my grip, pulling it as I pound my hard cock into you. I\u2019m pulling my hard cock way out then\u2026slamming it back into you. Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Yes\u2026mmmm\u2026please spank me\u2026I\u2019ve been so bad and I\u2026deserve to be spanked\u2026\"\n\n\"OK baby, I want you to spank yourself for me. Hard\u2026again\u2026again\u2026\"\n\n\"Oh God that feels\u2026so good\u2026I\u2019m getting close\u2026it feels so good\u2026\"\n\n\"I\u2019m holding your hips while I smash my cock in and out of your wet pussy. It\u2019s so tight\u2026so warm\u2026my cock loves being inside of you\u2026watching your tits sway underneath you while I pound you\u2026shaking your body\u2026shaking the bed\u2026\"\n\n\"I\u2019m gonna\u2026cum\u2026you\u2019re making me\u2026it feels so goooo\u2026I\u2019m gonna cum\u2026gonna cum\u2026\"\n\n\"Yes, that\u2019s it baby, I want you to\u2026I want you to cum, dreaming of my cock filling you up. I want to cum all over you\u2026see my cock twitching as ropy strands of cum splash onto you\u2026onto your back\u2026your tits as you turn over\u2026your face. I want my cum all over you. I want you to rub it off onto your fingers and lick it all off\u2026\"\n\n\"God, I\u2019m cumming so hard\u2026I can\u2019t stand it\u2026ooooooohhhhhh\u2026\"\n\nWhat you\u2019ve just read is not the dialog from a mid-day soap opera or the next Reese Witherspoon romance comedy. It is the words being typed by a guy holding his cock, stroking it gently in between his fingers while his eyes water from what he\u2019s reading and writing.\n\nIt\u2019s cybersex \u2013 internet romance.\n\nNever mind that he\u2019s in Florida and she\u2019s in Arizona, or Nebraska, or England. These two people are having sex the new, modern way, over the computer screen. There\u2019s no real sex, no real swapping of fluids. You can\u2019t hear the sound of his balls slapping against her ass as he gives her the doggie style pounding that her husband won\u2019t, or the true feel of his tongue lapping her juices until she tightens up and her eyes roll back in her head \u2013 just the thing her real lover would never do. He can\u2019t look into her eyes while she sticks her tongue out further, further, until it reaches his throbbing cock head, or watch her face as she masturbates just for him \u2013 activities his \"proper\" wife would never allow him to even consider. But here, on the internet, they can have it all. For free.\n\nSound good?\n\nWell\u2026it can be. As long as you know what you\u2019re in for from the beginning. And, aren\u2019t you the lucky reader, I\u2019m just the writer to tell you! That\u2019s right, you\u2019ve got questions and I\u2019ve got answers. Of course the big one is:\n\n What exactly is an internet romance?\n\nInternet romance is different things to different people. This is not a cop out, it\u2019s just my perspective. To one person an internet romance may be a high tech pen-pal, someone to share feelings and poems, describe sunsets and dinners out. A little extra something away from the real world of bills and traffic. Beautiful. For others, internet romance is a suggestive word here and there to spice things up. A few double entendre\u2019s in an otherwise fairly conventional exchange with a friend, coworker, etc. In a word \u2013 flirting. Harmless but fun. Next step on the boner scale is the kind of letters that make a man strain his boxers and a women squirm in her seat. The kind of letters that clearly spell out what you\u2019d like to do and how you\u2019d like to do it, complete with descriptions of hard, throbbing cocks and moist, swollen pussies. Now we\u2019re getting somewhere.\n\nStage four is serious internet romance \u2013 cybersex. This is where in email or real-time instant messaging, two people are having nearly real sex. Touching themselves, stroking and rubbing, perhaps even dressed for the occasion like a real date, they can nearly feel the person breathing, smell their passion and feel their warmth as they describe what they are doing and feeling. Hot? Hell yes! The kicker is that some of these people are individuals who in real life would never dream of acting this way. But isn\u2019t that the beauty of it? A button-down executive describing how he\u2019d like to be tied up and dominated. A librarian-type gal confessing her love for anal sex, double penetration and threesomes. It may be your next door neighbor. It could be your spouse. Or it could be someone on another continent. Global cybersex.\n\nStage five, sometimes interspersed with stage four is when you take the sexplay to the phone. When she begs you, \"Please\u2026call me\u2026let me hear your voice\u2026make me cum baby, please\u2026I need you to hear me cum\u2026\" The only thing more real than this is actual sex, which is another article entirely. This brings me to your next logical question:\n\nWow! Where do I find someone to do this?\n\nGood question. I\u2019m sure there are far more avenues than I\u2019m aware of, excluding of course someone from work or college. There are personals in many places on the iternet, but I\u2019m not sure how many are for cybersex seekers alone, and therefore my best suggestion is, shocking discovery here \u2013 literotica. After all, who visits this site \u2013 bible students? (My apologies to any and all bible students reading this article, glad to have you). Literotica readers are adults who enjoy hearing about and writing about sexual escapades and is therefore an outstanding venue for finding those who do the same. Look at the bulletin board and sign up for live chat. They should get your motor running.\n\nThere\u2019s another way, too.\n\nWhen you read a story that lets you connect somehow with the author, drop them a line and let them know. It may be something as simple as \"liked your story, thanks,\" or can include half your life story. We like reading them, believe me. It\u2019s not that difficult to get a dialog going with the some authors, and who knows what can happen. No guarantees, but who knows? You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the letters of feedback I get. Really. Some of these people write better than I do. Some of them like sex more than I do. OK, I take that one back. Don\u2019t be so gullible. The only time I don\u2019t take the time to answer feedback is when it\u2019s from someone underage. I don\u2019t want to get myself or the site in trouble. They\u2019ll find their answer eventually anyway, I hope. But these are some of the places to begin internet relationships, just be careful because:\n\nInternet romance can be addicting!\n\nReal life has a way of taking a back seat to fantasy. I suspect it\u2019s always been that way. When you\u2019ve got someone on line who likes sex as much as you do, loves the things you say, describes things that blow your mind and make you want to cum over and over while you uncontrollably rub your\u2026oh excuse me, did it again. What I mean is that it\u2019s hard to get back in bed with your snoring husband or flannel pajama-clad wife and not feel incredibly frustrated. You\u2019d do anything to get back on line with your pal and talk about wet blowjobs and how you\u2019d like to bend her over the kitchen sink and pound her like a B-52 bomber. Real life just can\u2019t compare, can it? But real life is where you\u2019re living my friends, so you have to temper your enthusiasm. Before you know it, you can be giving up dinners out with your friends to be on the computer. Violating company policies by logging on again and again to see what your \"friend\" has written. Putting off some very important things just to \"be with them\" online. Again, reality is faint competition for a computer screen that says \"I\u2019m wet.\" So have fun, sure, but be aware that:\n\nYou can fall in love over the internet\n\nOh yes you can! Whether or not you send photos or ever hear that person\u2019s voice, you can fall in love with the person on the other end of that keyboard out there somewhere. You don\u2019t doubt it, do you? How do you think romance writers make a living? Their readers fall in love with the characters they\u2019re writing about. \n\nThe person you\u2019re having cybersex with is just as much a fictional character, though you may swear with complete conviction that you know them. They\u2019re a fantasy partly created by themselves and partly by what they sense you love and need them to be. In truth, anyone can create a characterization of themselves that\u2019s totally plausible yet completely false. This is at once the danger as well as the excitement. He may be 28 years old, 6\u20192\" with blue eyes and a muscular build, or he may be 60 years old with gray hair and a hearing aid. Do you know? Oh, you\u2019ve got a photo? Well, that must be real. And the photo of her in the bikini is gorgeous. It may also be 20 years old.\n\nThat fact is that it really doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re getting off on it. But when it becomes more than that, when it takes over your thinking until this relationship becomes as important or more than your flesh and blood ones, you\u2019re going to find out that:\n\nYou can get your heart broken\n\nThe reasons are too many to enumerate but I will tell you this with almost complete certainty: It\u2019s going to end. No matter how great it is, I promise you that it\u2019s going to end. Yes, sooner or later the sex talk will die down and that\u2019s when the husbands and wives, bills and jobs, health and work start to enter into the conversations. This is the beginning of the end because fantasies don\u2019t contain these elements. It may end all at once, with a definite cut in communications. They change their screen name and you have no way to get in touch with them ever again, or it peters out, from 20 times a day to 10 to 5 to every week or two, down to nothing. Chances are, they found another internet love and a new honeymoon is taking place. Long term internet relationships are very rare. My advice, as you may have guessed, it not to invest too much of your heart in an online relationship. It just doesn\u2019t have the \"legs\" that a real one does. And since relationships don\u2019t always end mutually, whatever you do:\n\nDon\u2019t reveal too much personal information\n\nThis really applies to married men and women. If you\u2019re single, and especially if you\u2019re not in a dedicated relationship, it doesn\u2019t matter as much unless you have a career that you truly must guard, Congressman. School principal. Police officer. Rabbi. But if you\u2019re married, you don\u2019t want a knock on your door one afternoon, that when your child answers it, the person on the other side of the door says, \"Hi, is your daddy home? I\u2019m his friend Kyla from Milwaukee.\" Oh yeah, I can see you cringing at the thought. Broken hearts and overwhelming desire can lead to some pretty desperate acts. Do yourself a favor, a BIG one. Don\u2019t give your real last name to anyone at any time. Don\u2019t give the city you live in, or the name of your employer. Keep the names of your wife and kids out of conversations. Never call from your home phone or any phone without first dialing *67 to disable caller ID. Do you think I\u2019m being overly cautious? Then you have no idea how much information you can get about someone on the internet with just a name and town, or just a phone number. You\u2019re Cindy from New York \u2013 there must be hundreds or thousands. But how many have a husband named Greg? How many have a husband named Greg and a son named Tommy? How many have a husband named Greg, A son named Tommy, a golden retriever and drive a silver Dodge Durango? And the noose tightens. If you\u2019re not careful, you can be found. Easily.\n\nLet\u2019s take a break a moment. I\u2019ve been giving you a head full of warnings and caveats, but that\u2019s only part of the story, consider this:\n\n\"I made love to her last night\u2026want to hear about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, please\u2026tell me about it.\"\n\n\"\u2018Please baby, make me cum\u2019\u2026she begged me\u2026\u2019I need to cum so bad\u2026\u2019 So I held her wrists above her head and kissed her lips softy\u2026working my tongue inside until our tongues met and dueled first in her mouth, then in mine\u2026\"\n\n\"That\u2019s so hot\u2026please go on.\"\n\n\"I kissed down her neck, my hands moved over her tits to cup them and rub her nipples. They got so hard and stiff. I moved my mouth down and placed it over her nipple, then ran my tongue around her aureole, stopping to lightly bite on her nipple. Then I switched tits, as she began to shake\u2026her legs starting to quiver and her breathing uneven.\"\n\n\"Oh God\u2026more\u2026\"\n\n\"She moaned to me, \u2018mmm\u2026feels so good\u2026mmm,\u2019 as I kissed my way down her stomach. She rolled over on her side and I licked her lower back\u2026it\u2019s such an erogenous zone. I kissed it as I lightly ran my fingers along her tummy. Her legs were twitching and I could smell the sex juices beginning to seep from her\u2026Then I held her ass cheeks apart and licked from the top of the crack all the way to her pussy, getting it soaking wet\u2026\"\n\n\"Her asshole\u2026\"\n\n\"Was all wet for me. She was moaning louder now, \u2018lick my cunt honey\u2026eat me\u2026please eat me\u2026\u2019 So I rolled her over and lapped at her sweet pussy. Her hands were on her breasts, her fingers pinching her nipples and tugging on them\u2026I spread her swollen pussy lips with my thumbs and stuck my tongue in her hot, open hole\u2026\"\n\n\"Oh my God\u2026you\u2019re making me so\u2026I have to touch myself\u2026\"\n\n\"I sucked her pussy lips, rubbing around her clit in small circles. Then I moved my tongue to it and made figure eights around it. Her clit was as hard as a marble\u2026Her hips were nearly coming off the bed. I took one finger out and put it in her mouth. She sucked it hard, like a baby with a pacifier, and gasped as she tasted her own juices\u2026\"\n\n\"Uhh\u2026mmm\u2026gggg\u2026\"\n\n\"I knew that she was close. I began to rub the outside of her asshole now, as she drove her pussy into my face harder and harder. As she neared cumming, I took that one finger and eased in into her asshole, which opened up as if to swallow it. I sank my finger in about an inch\u2026her eyes just rolled back in her head as her climax hit her hard. Her hips were bucking and she was jabbering something I could not understand \u2013 orgasm talk\u2026Her body stiffened like a board and she came and came\u2026\"\n\n\"Ohhhhhh\u2026..\"\n\nYeah, it can be like that, too. And it\u2019s so hot, so enticing that you may find yourself asking,\n\nCan it go from internet to real life?\n\nWell of course it can, if you want. This is the most mobile age known to man. If you want to go somewhere, you can find a way to get there \u2013 period. I\u2019ll take it one step further.\n\nI think that in all likelihood, the possibility - just the chance - that the relationship can go from computer screen to bedroom or motel room is what drives the fantasy. Think about it. If you know for a fact that the sex can never under any circumstances become a reality, it may have a sobering effect on the parties involved. Not always, of course. For some people, this safety of anonymity may release even more inhibitions, since no danger of being caught, getting an STD or ruining a marriage or relationship exists.\n\nBut for others, the opportunity to meet and actually have the wild sex you\u2019ve been engaging in over the internet and perhaps phone \u2013 no matter how small the actual chance \u2013 fuels the fire even more. Should you do it? It\u2019s not for me to say, not knowing your particular situation. But you should consider this:\n\nYou know this person \u2013 intimately. It\u2019s going to be weird at first; prepare for that fact. Will you like the way they look and sound? Will you be able to act natural. Will your mutually strong sexuality translate to real life? You\u2019ll never know until you try. Some people may say, \"why risk it?\" if you\u2019re really enjoying the cybersex. Others may say that unless you do try, you\u2019ll be sorry later. The cybersex will end eventually and you\u2019ll never have known how great it could have been. One time or regularly.\n\nThese are the issues that are purely personal. If you are single, sexually motivated and computer savy, you can have yourself one hell of a time. And it can, if you both want and the situation allows, become a real life experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re married and want to stay that way, internet romance \u2013 which may take the form of light flirting all the way to the heavy cybersex we discussed, can be a guilty pleasure and frustration reliever. Or frustration enhancer, depending on you. In other words, it can help take the place and relieve the stress of the satisfying sex you\u2019re not getting at home, which is good. Or it can just underscore that there are people out there just like you, who love sex and sexuality in all its permutations. They love to talk about sex, to talk dirty about what they want, to look at porn, read stories, use sex toys, everything you\u2019d like to do and more. In short, they are the furthest thing in the world from your spouse. Ouch. Reality can surely suck. \n\n\nIf you let it get out of hand though, or make it real, then there are going to be consequences, unless you\u2019re married to Hillary Clinton. And oh yes, if you get \"caught\" in your cybersex relationship, perhaps with an un-deleted email, an unplanned intrusion into your computer area, maybe even suspicious behavior - your spouse will most likely NOT consider it to be harmless fun.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you, my friends. I would love to hear about your adventures and experiences in cybersex. It may make for a good follow up article. More important, it may make me hot. And if you have any questions or want an opinion, Email me. Thanks as always for reading, it\u2019s been fun.\n\nBatsandGlamour"
