There are larger condoms for those who need them, as well as smaller.\n\nFor convenience, use a lubricated condom with a reservoir tip to hold the semen.  Non-lubricated may be preferred for oral sex.\n\nUse only water-soluble lubricants.\nDO NOT USE OIL OR PETROLEUM JELLY.\n\n<center><img src=\"/images/illustratedstories/2004/2004_01/shale_condoms02.gif\" width=\"438\" height=\"586\"> </center>\n\n<center>Open the package carefully.</center>\n<center>Tearing or long or jagged fingernails can damage the condom. </center>\n \n<center>If Uncircumcised (uncut)\n<img src=\"/images/illustratedstories/2004/2004_01/shale_condoms03.gif\" width=\"265\" height=\"349\">\n\t\t\nPull the foreskin back, before rolling on the condom.\n<img src=\"/images/illustratedstories/2004/2004_01/shale_condoms04.gif\" width=\"297\" height=\"446\">\n\n\nHold the tip of the condom to squeeze out any air.
