        "After writing my first \u2018Blowjobs for Dummies\u2019 piece, I though I was through with the subject. I had intended it to be enjoyed and perhaps used for purposes of comparison, improvement and even reference. \n\nThe feedback I asked for and received was simply overwhelming, and I mean this in the most positive of respects. When I received an email address to respond to, I always answered questions as best I could, and thanked the respondent for taking the time to write. One lady in particular, and you know who you are, has been very, very kind to me. I\u2019d also like to thank the kind gentlemen of cell-block C at Trenton State Prison for their invitation to spend the weekend. \n\nInterestingly, though most of the encouraging feedback was from women, some were from men thanking me for putting in writing what they could not verbalize, and promising me they\u2019d show it to their significant others. Any feedback from that?\n\nOne of the reasons I asked for comments and feedback was to find out techniques that I didn\u2019t know or hadn\u2019t had done to me. I mean hey, who am I, Gene Simmons? I\u2019ve had my share of nice BJs, but I\u2019m not a rock star. Certainly not a porn star. Had God only given me the plumbing for that\u2026\n\nNo matter, I haven\u2019t read any stories by rock stars who\u2019ve had more head than I\u2019ve had headaches, or by porn stars who\u2019s endowment makes my penis look like a cocktail frank. Where are these people when you need advice?\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019d like to share with you some of the recommendations I\u2019ve received that I thought were darn good. \n\nDo run your fingernails lightly along the lucky guy\u2019s shaft, balls, perineum, etc, while you\u2019re gobbling his knob. It\u2019s just a little added sensation that, along with the other sensations he\u2019s getting, goes a long way towards driving him over the edge, or keeping him home, whichever you\u2019d prefer to think.\n\nDo, and it\u2019s a big do, lightly skim your teeth along his swollen cock head, especially the frenulum, that spot where the head joins the shaft, as well as the rest of the shaft. Now, before the guys in our audience start sweating, I said lightly.  Sucking is great, oh boy is it, but as wet and wonderful as it is, there\u2019s not a lot of contact there. Some guys need just a little more stimulation, and the teeth can help.\n\nOne feedback writer told me I\u2019ve never experienced anything until I\u2019ve had head from a girl with a pierced tongue. She may be right! I don\u2019t know from personal experience. But I\u2019ll surmise this; it would be for the same reason as skimming her teeth along my grateful cock, the added sensation and contact. \n\nAnother lady added that when she\u2019s deep-throating her husband, she runs his cock head along the ridges on the roof of her mouth, and that he \"responds positively\" to this type of sensation. Really? Likes to stick his cock all the way down your throat does he? I sure as hell hope so, my dear! I would \"respond positively\" too, like with flowers and a weekend on an island. She also mentions that this seems to be easier for her to do in the 69 position. It lets her get his cock further down her throat without gagging. Let me just adjust my pants here a minute. There. So yes, do rub his head against the roof of your mouth when you deep throat him. And baby \u2013 you\u2019re my hero.\n\nBy the way, I have to mention the nice girl who told me that her husband appreciates her wanting to give him head, but says her respects her too much to let her do it. Note to her husband: \"Hey mister, are you fucking nuts? She wants to suck your cock, she\u2019s aching to suck your cock. If you win the lottery, are you going to keep only what you need? Do me a favor, respect her just a little less and give her the goods.\" When this guy goes to heaven, which I\u2019m sure he will, they\u2019ll get a giggle out of him. \u2018We wanted you to be good \u2013 but this good nobody asked for.\u2019 So do not respect your lady so much that you refuse head. Having her lovely lips on your cock is a good thing, a really, really good thing. If God had not intended it to be, her never would have put the thought in our heads, would he?\n\nI\u2019ve also been advised by a reader that she twists her head from side to side while she moves her mouth up her man\u2019s shaft. This again falls under the category of giving added stimulation, which in this case comes from his cock hitting the insides of her mouth. It may also fall under the category of \"reasons my chiropractor claims I have neck problems,\" by I personally feel it\u2019s worth it.\n\nMy next comment concerns a woman who tells me that after she lets her lover drop his load in her mouth, he refuses to kiss her. Who, may I ask, does he think he is \u2013 King George? Guys, when she sucks your cock and swallows your cum, then wants a kiss, do kiss her. Hold her, thank her, bless her with holy water. If you\u2019re not man enough to kiss her, you\u2019re not man enough to have her suck your cock. What do you do after you go down on her, use mouthwash? What\u2019s that, you don\u2019t go down on her? Get out of the bed, I\u2019m coming over. Nothing personal.\n\nA dear, sweet Irish lass made some wonderful suggestions, which I\u2019ll relay to you now, since I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to write her own article, though she certainly could.\n\nOne thing she suggests, do hold a lady\u2019s hair out of her face while she\u2019s down on you. First, this sounds like a really tender thing to do, so I\u2019m all for it. Second, it may help you gently guide her head where you want it. Warning: don\u2019t push her head down further then she wants, or it may be the last BJ you ever get from her. Also, you can pull her hair a little this way of she\u2019s into it. Stroke her hair, stroke her neck, it\u2019s very nice. This technique also helps her from getting mouthful of her own hair, which is no great pleasure I assume.\n\nSecond, she suggests, do tell her what you like in short, simple phrases. Even William Shakespeare probably could not wax eloquent with his cock in a fair maiden\u2019s throat. But simple statements like, \"yeah, just like that\u2026\" or \"that feels so good right there,\" or even, \"you\u2019re making me feel like fat man at an all-you-can-eat bakery\" will do the trick. If you want her to repeat it just he way she\u2019s doing it, respond with encouragement. If you want her to try something else, tell her softly right now. Any encouragement is a big do in my view. She\u2019s making you feel oh so good in the most intimate of ways \u2013 show her that you love it or I\u2026er, someone else will.\n\nLastly, she mentions, tell her when you\u2019re going to cum, but not in words that evoke a car about to hit her. Do not yell at the top of your lungs, \"I\u2019M GONNA CUM!,\" \"HERE SHE BLOWS!\" or even, \u2018LOCK THE DOORS, DADDY\u2019S HOME!\" although that last one has some possibilities. You don\u2019t want to scare her, throw her off the pace or do anything that stops her. But it\u2019s a good idea to alert her that she\u2019s about to receive your creamy gift. \"Ohh baby, I\u2019m gonna cum now\" or any variation of that simple theme will do just fine. In fact, as the redhead correctly asserts, if she\u2019s new to the game, it might not be a bad idea to say, \"Here I cum baby, don\u2019t stop\u2026it feels so good.\"\n\nThank you for sharing, beautiful lady.\n\nIf I may just add to that last point, since it was the subject of so many feedback letters, none of which my mother has seen. Getting a guy to cum is the natural culmination of your efforts, and feels better than anything else in the world, as you know. Please do let your man know it\u2019s OK to cum. That it doesn\u2019t frighten, intimidate or bother you. Tell him that you want him to cum. As his breathing quickens and you feel his balls begin to contract against his body, which means that he\u2019s about to cum or you just opened the window in winter, look him right in the eyes and say \"Cum for me baby\u2026cum right in my mouth\u2026let me taste you.\" Man that\u2019s hot \u2013 and I wrote it! \n\nLet him cum in your mouth or even on your face if you\u2019re a nasty girl \u2013 and I like nasty girls, which is another story entirely. Just don\u2019t stop, whatever you do. If you just can\u2019t stomach the idea of swallowing, pardon the pun, hold it in your mouth and when it\u2019s over, let it drip out into a tissue or napkin. Let me be clearer, do not spit it out like it\u2019s a foul poison. Just wipe it out or off. You\u2019ve still done well.\n\nOnce again, your feedback is tremendous. Fun, encouraging, insightful and filled with enthusiastic energy. I\u2019d love some more of it. I would especially like any of your thoughts on what gets women aroused \u2013 what is your aphrodisiac? What words turn you on? And are there any special methods you use that get your man aroused. Hello usually works on me\u2026but that\u2019s something else.\n\nLastly, if you like my other stories, I\u2019d like to tell you that I write under the screen name FitofJealousy as well \u2013 don\u2019t ask why. But if you read the Aphrodisiac Transformation or Payback stories, I think you\u2019ll be very pleased. Thanks for reading and good luck!"
