        "Ironically, it is usually the male partner who brings up the topic of erotic male tease and denial. If you are not familiar, Erotic Tease and Denial is when one partner, usually the female, does not allow the other partner to orgasm during sexual intimacy. \n\n________\n\nSo your husband asked you to deny him. What is wrong with him?\n\nFirst off, you need to know that this is not uncommon and there is nothing wrong with him. It does not mean he doesn't like sex anymore. It does not mean that he doesn't like orgasms anymore. It definitely DOES NOT mean that he doesn't love you anymore or that he isn't sexually attracted to you anymore.\n\n________\n\nWhy does he want you to deny him orgasm?\n\nThere are many reasons a man may desire tease and denial. This is a list of the common reasons. Your man may be responding to one or more of these reasons, or some other reasons not in this list. \n\n-He desires to give up control. \n\n-He craves the hormones produced by the intense arousal of denial.\n\n-He is excited by giving control of his sexuality to his partner (you). \n\n-He is excited by humiliation.\n\n-His sex drive is increased. \n\n-His orgasms will be better when denial is over. \n\n-He wants a constant feeling of sexual arousal. \n\n________\n\nAre there benefits for me? \n\nBelieve it or not, most women don't want to deny the man they love an orgasm. So this is a common question. The answer is YES. Here are a few benefits most women experience. \n\nExtended foreplay. When you both understand you won't be allowing him to orgasm, he will not be in a rush to speed up any phase of the sexual experience. Foreplay will continue as long as you wish. If you make it clear his chance of being allowed an orgasm depends on your satisfaction, he will be especially eager to please. \n\nOrgasms. Lots more orgasms for you. When a male is denied, he never finishes. He will be an eager participant until you are completely satisfied and ask him to stop. If you want three or four orgasms, he will have the energy to give them to you. No more minute man two pump chump. He will have the lasting power you need. He can deliver these orgasms with his fingers, tongue, or toys; preferably a combination of all three. \n\nOral Sex. A man who is sexually denied will be eager to give you frequent oral sex. In fact, he is likely to become a pussy connoisseur. His pent up arousal will keep him eager for any sexual contact with you. You can focus this need however you like, including oral pleasure. If you give him some basic instructions while he is going down on you, you will find his skills improve rapidly. \n\nSnuggling. Once the main event is over, when you are sexually satisfied, there is nothing better than your man holding you while you gently drift off to sleep. So often a man just finishes, then rolls over and passes out. When you deny him his orgasm, he will desire continued connection. Expect your denied man to want to hold you after having sex. Remember his arousal is still at 90%.\n\nMore intimacy. This seems counter-intuitive, but you will experience more intimacy in your relationship when he is denied sexual release. He'll be more attentive and interested in physical contact, but since there's no pressure to make him cum, it can be of the relationship building variety.\n\nSecrets. Having your little secret will bring you closer together. Many couples love knowing that he has been denied and is extremely horny. Going out in public or with friends can be exciting. It can be fun watching him try to hide an erection when you tease him in public.\n\nSpark. If you have been together for several years, you may notice that your sex life is a little less exciting than when you were first together. Practicing tease and denial will help keep an incredibly strong spark in your sex life, and hopefully also in your relationship in general. \n\nStress. If one of you has physical sexual problems, male denial can take the stress of sex away. If you experience pain during intercourse or an inability to orgasm from penetrative sex, knowing that he won't be cumming removes the expectation of penetration. If he suffers from erectile dysfunction (ED), lowering the pressure he feels to perform can save him stress. Since ED is usually at least 50% mental and exacerbated by stress, this can often even result in relief from the symptoms of ED. (If either partner is experiencing sexual problems like these, seek medical attention.)\n\nFeel like a teenager. You will find you both crave sex play like when you were a teenager. Denying him at the end of a sexual encounter will leave him in a state of arousal just like when he was a teen after a long make out session. \n\n________\n\nHow do I do Tease and Deny correctly? \n\nThere is no right way or wrong way to Tease and Deny a man. Every couple is different and will do it differently. As long as both partners are having fun, you're doing it right. Here are some tips; you may find all or some of them helpful.\n\nYour man likely wants you to 'force' him to not orgasm. This means that if during sex he begs and pleads with you to let him cum, he actually want you to be strict about his denial. Don't feel guilty; remember that it was him who asked you to play tease and denial. Try 'forcing' him to give you orgasms however you like them best. You may find this to be a real turn on for both of you. \n\nDon't forget about the tease part of this. During sex, stimulate him. Bring him as close to orgasm as you can without letting him climax. After sex, you can keep him on edge simply by holding his hard cock while you recover from your multiple orgasms. You can amuse yourself the next day by bring his cock to full attention with simple teases; a look or touch.\n\nYou can deny him for one intimate session, or several. Some extreme couples may even continue denial for weeks or months. When you first try tease and denial, don't try to go too long. One or two intimate sessions is likely as long as is recommended. But once you have a little experience, don't be afraid to deny him for several consecutive intimate encounters. And again, don't feel guilty; remember that he asked you for tease and denial. He likely wants you to deny him longer than you suspect. \n\nEvery couple is different. Some like to schedule their tease and denial. Other couples enjoy it better if he doesn't know when he's going to be allowed to cum. This uncertainty can add to the excitement of the experience for both of you. You can even make his orgasm dependent on his performance, or even a game of chance (dice or coin flip). \n\nHow often you engage in Tease and Denial will depend on your preference. Every couple is different. You may enjoy having a Tease and Denial session every month or two. Maybe less. Some couples make Tease and Denial a permanent part of their sexual dynamic only allowing the male to orgasm infrequently or, for extreme couples, never. \n\nIf you are one of those ladies who love to feel your man climax inside of you, denying your partner may seem like a punishment for you. Just remember that if he worked up the courage to ask you for this, he likely thought this through for weeks or months. This is probably something he desires a lot. You can still let him penetrate you, just make sure he pulls out before climaxing. And don't worry; you can have him finish inside you next time. Make sure you get something you love in exchange for your 'sacrifice'. This could be a sexual favour, or you could even have him perform a chore the next day. \n\nIf you make a mistake and accidentally push him too far, that's ok. It happens. But you can still salvage the denial fantasy by promptly removing stimulation to his genitals. Watching his cock pulse while he ejaculates without contact can be fun and a real turn on, all while still leaving him sexually charged.\n\nThis one is important. He is not allowed to masturbate during a period of denial. Make sure he understands and is in agreement on this. There is no point playing out a tease and denial fantasy if he is going to cum on his own between sex with you. He needs to know the game will end if he fails. \n\n________\n\nDo I need any equipment?\n\nThere is no need for any 'equipment'. Some couples may use tools to have fun, adding some extra spice to the scene. Bondage restraints can be fun and add to the fantasy that you are forcing his denial. A chastity devise to lock up his cock can add to the fun all throughout the day during the period of denial. It can also help insure he doesn't masturbate. You may both find that using your favourite vibrator to bring yourself to orgasm while denying him is a huge tease. Consider buying a new one you save for use only while denying him. \n\nThe most important thing to remember it to have fun."
