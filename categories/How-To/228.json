        "1. Overcoming Your Goofiness\n2. The Great Transition\n3. On The Bed, and Other Furniture\n4. The Wow Level \n\nHey you! Nerd! Yes, you with the Krispy Kreme t-shirt and broken heels on your Doc Martens. What\u2019s the problem, my geeky friend? Wait, I bet I can guess. You either just found out that Blink 182 cancelled their concert in your city, or you haven\u2019t seen non-Internet pussy since you peeped your sister in grade school. And that was last week. Perv. \n\nListen, it\u2019s alright. I know you\u2019re hungry for sloppy sweat-dripping sex this weekend, if only a good friend would take the time to explain what the fuck women are thinking. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Sometime women themselves don\u2019t know! And here\u2019s another secret you can write in your journal with the needlepoint R2D2 on the cover: That guy at work with the $30 haircut and bright red necktie from Neiman Marcus ain\u2019t getting any better sex than you are. His days of trial-and-error are hitting a second decade, and he\u2019s seriously considering one of those damn Fleshlights. (They work TOO good, my tempted friend.) \n\nIT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. You could be having sex with an actual girl right now! And more importantly, she WANTS you to give it to her. There\u2019s no denying that the fairer sex requires more maintenance than Rush Limbaugh\u2019s hammock, but at the end of the date, she\u2019s just as horny as you are. She may think you\u2019re a loser with bad taste in music, but that hole between her legs isn\u2019t there for looks. She\u2019s lonely too, and she\u2019s seriously considering one of those damn Dynamic Duos. (Two holes at once, she\u2019ll never be seen in public again. We lost her so young\u2026)\n\nSEDUCTION is the solution. SEDUCTION is fun, for you and for her. Nothing forced, nothing illegal, nothing clumsy. Just good ol\u2019 fashioned charm. In other words, SEDUCTION. Visualize what you want, have a plan for getting it. Be the man for once in your life, for christ\u2019s sake. Take your nuts out of the jar, strap them on, and hit the bricks. Once you\u2019ve discovered life as a man, you\u2019ll never take unstrap them again. Might I suggest how to begin? \n\n1. Overcoming Your Goofiness\n\nThe path to the bedroom lies in self-confidence. HEY! Pay attention, you stunted adolescent. I know you don\u2019t think you have it in you to seduce a woman, but even YOU have an anti-cowardly core deep within you just waiting to burst to the surface and shout, \u201cHey world, I\u2019m a male! I\u2019m good in the sack! There\u2019s more to me than RPGs and Vanilla Coke and my mom\u2019s hand lotion!\u201d But how to find that core? And more importantly, how to keep it in place during a date? You must find your self-confidence before you\u2019ll be ready for the SEDUCTION in Part 2. \n\nA. ASK GIRLS TO GO ON DATES\n\nNews flash, Peter Pan -- the girl won\u2019t ask you. It sucks to get rejected, but it sucks worse tugging your wiener alone in your basement throughout the new decade. Ask a girl, get slammed, ask a girl, get slammed\u2026 Yes it\u2019s a pattern, but IT WILL END. One girl will say yes, eventually. I promise! (NOTE: Don\u2019t keep asking the same girl. Trust me, okay? She\u2019s not interested. But someone else is.) \n\nB. PRACTICE NOT-SUCKING\n\nNot-Sucking is your first step toward having a girl say \u201cYes\u201d to a date. As a former nerd, I truly believe every social outcast knows what behaviors are geeky and which are slightly cool. Social acceptance requires one skill and one skill only: Acting. Cool guys act like other cool guys. They look in the mirror and teach themselves how to smile without any buckteeth protruding. When they see a cool haircut, they try it out when they visit the stylist (NOT barber, Cletus). Eventually, the nerd learns to ACT less nerdy. You\u2019ll master the intricacies of one pick-up line, then two, and eventually you\u2019re making up your own. Not overnight, but you\u2019ve got to start somewhere. Remember that awesome Enterprise model you built with all the fiber optics? That\u2019s the feeling of accomplishment I\u2019m talking about. Set a goal! \n\nC. CREATE A PERSONA, BUT DON\u2019T LIE TO YOURSELF\n\nGirls are a demonic paradox in that they love being lied to, as long as they KNOW they\u2019re being lied to. This is known as the \u201cBad Boy Syndrome,\u201d wherein bikers tell college coeds that they\u2019re looking for a commitment, and the girl believes him because she wants to see just how big that bulge in his Levi\u2019s will get. If you\u2019re a nerd, start thinking like a biker. What I mean is this: Think about what women want to hear, then practice making it sound believable. But DON\u2019T GO TOO FAR. You can drop a few roguish Bad-Boy elements into your bag of tricks, but you are NOT a biker. You are a nerd. Take it slow. Later, when you\u2019re bored with sex, you can buy a hog. Or a chopper. (I wouldn\u2019t know. I still love sex.)\n\nD. LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE \n\nOnce you get the girl on the date, what to do? For starters, all that gentlemanly bullshit they make fun of in the movies? It works. Open her car door, compliment her shoes, ask her where she got her necklace. She might just have an orgasm right there -- that\u2019s how important this stuff is to her. And not because she\u2019s a Barbie-wannabe, but because she needs to know that you\u2019re paying attention to her. Convince her that you aren\u2019t the self-absorbed, non-listening advertising specialist she dated last week. Remember, she\u2019s not a Playstation game! You\u2019re interactive now, my spectacled friend. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. If her mouth is moving, be prepared to compliment her eloquence when the movement stops. \n\nE. SAVE UP SOME MONEY, THEN SPEND IT\n\nSome girls think it\u2019s sweet to share a coney at Nathan\u2019s on the first date, but those aren\u2019t the kinds of girls who put out; you\u2019re more likely to swap stories about how both sets of parents messed you up emotionally, and that\u2019s the opposite of sloppy sweat-dripping sex. NO NO NO. What you need is a couple hundred dollars to drop on a bottle of merlot and the most expensive dessert on the menu. She will REEL with ecstasy. And don\u2019t worry about what kind of car you drive (for now); this is about how much you spent on HER, not on yourself. As long as you dress the part and order her a third martini, she\u2019ll be able to tell her girlfriends what you thought she was worth. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. (NOTE: This is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some girls are actually more interested in your car than your cock. If you sense this is the case, you\u2019ve made a wrong turn. Skip the dessert, cut your loses, head back for Go and collect yet another 200 dollars.) \n\nF. DINNER, NO MOVIE\n\nThe perfect after-dinner outing is clubbing or dancing, where you and your date-mate touch each other and get worked up. But you\u2019re a nerd. You want to do something you\u2019re comfortable with, and that means movies. MISTAKE, like a those-rhinestones-you-applied-to-your-Doctor-\nWho-t-shirt-in-junior-high-sized mistake. She may enjoy the movie, but she won\u2019t want to have sex with you afterward. If you can\u2019t brave the clubs, consider an extended talk at the restaurant table. You\u2019re still listening to her, right? She loves it! No other scenario is better suited to making her want to invite you inside her apartment later for coffee. (NOTE: She doesn\u2019t want \u201ccoffee.\u201d She wants sex. But say, \u201cSure, I\u2019d love some coffee,\u201d instead of \u201cThanks, I\u2019d love sex.\u201d)\n\n2. The Great Transition\n\nThe date went well? Good for you! All it took was the courage to overcome numerous rejections, and the ability to listen more than you talk. I\u2019m so proud of you. (Back off, dude -- no hugs from anyone in THIS locker room.) And now it\u2019s time for the SEDUCTION. Hopefully you\u2019re in HER apartment, where the curtains match the furniture, instead of your room where a Pink Floyd subway poster covers the ceiling. But if you\u2019re at your place, that\u2019s cool, because she won\u2019t leave right away. What she CAN do is pretend she didn\u2019t want to come back for sex, but only coffee. You must convince her that she wants sex! \n\n(IMPORTANT NOTE: Don\u2019t forget the condoms. Don\u2019t forget the condoms. Don\u2019t forget the condoms. Hey idiot, listen up! Don\u2019t forget the condoms. Your car\u2019s glove box is a good storage place. Do NOT slip one into your wallet -- that didn\u2019t even work in the Fifties.)\n\nA. TAKE YOUR TIME, MR. PREMATURE\n\nOnly when a girl feels safe will she want to have sex with another person. Read that sentence again. A woman seeks an emotional connection, even if she isn\u2019t interested in a commitment. That means, once you\u2019re in her apartment, you must continue to listen to her and compliment her. And you thought the hard part was over! Say p-whipped things like, \u201cI\u2019m impressed that your curtains match your furniture.\u201d Then turn around quickly so you glimpse her trying to hide another orgasm. This is also a good time to put on some music. At her apartment, look at her CDs and pick one you genuinely like; at your place, show her what you have. Nothing sucks like making out to music you don\u2019t dig. If she offers coffee, take it. If she offers food, politely decline. \n\nMost important, when you sit down in the living room to continue your gal-pal-style discussion (continued from dinner and the car ride), MAKE CERTAIN you sit on the opposite end of the couch from her. This is where you both start to admit that you\u2019re looking forward to all the sex. If she doesn\u2019t sit on the couch, wander around the living room looking at her framed photos. Make her get up and point out her uncle, then sit down before she can. If you pick the far end of the couch, she\u2019ll feel awkward sitting so far away in the same room. Do not proceed until she\u2019s on the same sofa. (VITAL NOTE: Never take a dump in her bathroom. If you can\u2019t hold it, get out of there quickly but charmingly. The exit line, \u201cI\u2019d hate to ruin a perfect night like this,\u201d is always a sure bet. Remember, keep hope alive for Date No. 2)\n\nB. TAKE A FEW LIBERTIES\n\nOnce on the couch, you\u2019re golden. It\u2019s that important. You can watch TV or talk or flip through photos\u2026 doesn\u2019t matter. Just don\u2019t leave the couch, because it\u2019s time to INCH. Simply put but laboriously executed, you must find ways to reduce the distance between you and your date on the couch. Shift your body, especially the legs, and lean forward then back then forward again. DON\u2019T GIVE UP! Pay special attention to the girl\u2019s body language. You\u2019ll be surprised how easily you can tell if she\u2019s moving toward you. (To clarify: If she immediately sits beside you on the couch, you just bowled a strike. Proceed quickly.)\n\nC. TAKE CONTROL\n\nOh boy, Charlie, your moment of truth has arrived. You\u2019ve gotten away with innuendo and body language for a few hours, but the time for pussy-footing is past. You must now INFORM her that you are physically attracted to her and would like to make out. No, don\u2019t repeat that word-for-word! God, you really are a stroke-monkey, ainch\u2019ya? Start with a devilish grin, a coy denial, a wringing of the hands. Draw her in --make her interested. But eventually, you must verbalize your intentions. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to kiss you all night, actually.\u201d Or perhaps try, \u201cI\u2019m seriously considering leaning in to kiss you right now. The decision really isn\u2019t mine, it\u2019s something inside me.\u201d And wow, here\u2019s a classic that can have surprisingly strong success: \u201cMay I have your permission to kiss you?\u201d \n\nWhat\u2019s that? You\u2019re not comfortable saying silly shit like that? Well tell me then, how comfortable are you jerking off to a fantasy starring the girl you just dropped off at 8:30? Get it together! I\u2019m not telling you to come across as a weepy puss or a manipulative line-regurgitator. You\u2019re simply looking for a good transition from Friendly to Frisky, and a verbal declaration can do a lot to dissipate the ambiguity. But try what feels best. If she leans in, you lean in. If you\u2019re dancing to the CD she put in, then stop, lean back, look deep into her eyes, and move in slowly for a soft brushing of the lips. See what I mean? TRANSITION. It\u2019s all about paying attention to the girl, and after that long-ass dinner, you\u2019re an expert. \n\nD. TAKE THE DIVE\n\nOnce your lips are on hers, make it last. Let her hands go where they want, then mirror her hands. This way, you only cross over the unspoken barriers after she does it first. The alternative is you pawing an uninterested girl with the nerdy moves you learned from Internet porn. Dig deep, find your resolve! You got this far, nerd\u2026 keep running for the finish line! Stay classy, stay respectful. In this phase, you\u2019re still making her feel safe. There are a number of ways you can screw-up a simple make-out session, but the best way to avoid disaster is just to keep your focus on First Base. Kiss her, hold her, caress her arms and back (maybe the butt). Breathe on her neck, nibble her earlobes. (These techniques are very hard to get wrong. Trust your instincts, unless they\u2019re telling you to lick her forehead.) And most important: SHUT THE FUCK UP. Now that you declared your intentions to kiss her, nothing more need be said. Examples of regrettable phrases include: \u201cGod, you taste so good.\u201d \u201cWow, you\u2019re the best kisser ever.\u201d \u201cOh yeah, keep licking my tongue with yours.\u201d In addition to being utterly nerdy, these observations are redundant. Speak with your flesh, not your words. \n\nE. THE GENIUS MASSAGE (for information purposes only)\n\nI hesitate to mention the following piece of the SEDUCTION module, but I\u2019d hate to see you let such a magic opportunity pass you by: If you should be lucky enough to find yourself massaging the girl\u2019s neck and shoulders, you have found a short cut to Second Base. The great thing about a massage is that it makes a girl feel safe (relaxed and appreciative of your role in the relaxation) at the same time it makes her completely vulnerable to your advances. Your hands are all over her! Once you\u2019re even moderately certain that she wants to play around a bit, you\u2019re virtually free to cop a feel of those fun fluffies bobbing around on her chest (i.e. boobies). It\u2019s smooth sailing from there. BUT since this set of circumstances rarely happens on a date between people older than 17, you probably won\u2019t get to try this. Which sucks, because I have, and it\u2019s awesome.\n\n3. On The Bed, and Other Furniture\n\nGoddamn, you\u2019re kidding a girl! Believe it or not, you are already in the FOREPLAY stage. (Nerd Glossary: foreplay (n); the playing around before the sex; a necessary component to ensuring sex, the absence of which may lead to the absence of sex.) Can you believe it? You\u2019re sustaining First Base with an actual woman! And as any baseball fan knows, the only reason a runner visits first is on his way home. What? You don\u2019t watch baseball? What a fucking nerd. But hey, you\u2019re doing great, I take it back. \n\nA. SECOND BASE (EXTENDED MAKE-OUT)\n\nI know what you want to ask: \u201cWhen is the right time to get a handful of boob?\u201d It\u2019s hard to say, but I can safely assure you that you WILL get to fondle boobs. There are no guarantees in life, but in my experience, any girl who will French kiss you for more than twenty minutes is looking forward to letting off the steam you\u2019ve built inside her. (That\u2019s another euphemism for having sex.) Second Base, or the exploration of the chest, is solidly in Part 3 of the SEDUCTION plan; only rarely does one find himself playing with tits (above or below the blouse) and not face the eventual opportunity to take off the girl\u2019s pants as well. (This frustrating anomaly is common among teenagers, but How-To article is on a less legal website.) \n\nIt\u2019s vital that you continue to be patient. I know Mr. HotHead is ready to pop out and say hello, but the moment you get ahead of yourself is the moment you destroy the environment of safety that you worked so hard to create. One common occurrence is that a girl will let you feel her up through the bra but then gently push your hands away when you try to get UNDER the bra. Do not be discouraged. Continue to tunnel under, always at a slow, unthreatening pace. You won\u2019t get better at it, but SHE will get hornier, and she\u2019ll change her mind. Her nipples are hard, and she wants to do something about it without having to stop kissing you. BE ON THE LOOKOUT for the \u201cDry Hump Window;\u201d once she\u2019s sitting on your lap, grinding against your hard cock through both your pants, then you\u2019ve found another shortcut, and this one is much more likely than the Genius Massage shortcut. Do your best to get her into position, because it\u2019s very simple to remove her shirt and bra. Don\u2019t force it, but watch for it. (A similar situation is when you lie on top of her and grind between her legs. This is a lot less presumptuous than you might think.)\n\nB. GETTING NAKED\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to go from Making Out to Getting Naked, you have three options (see next). Before you start any of the three, make sure you\u2019ve collected the following components like those gold coins in \u201cThe Legend of Zelda.\u201d They are: 1) Her shirt open or removed. 2) Her hands tugging at your skin (shoulders, back, arms). 3) Enough kissing to make her want more; pay close attention to body language to find the cut-off point. 4) Her legs open with you grinding her crotch with yours. \n\nAbove all else, be on the look out for her to take off YOUR clothes. Everything stated up to this point is academic dribble once the girl starts coming on to you. This doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still have work to do, but it does mean you have less signs to wait for before you start undressing her. \n\nHow to undress her? Again, TAKE YOUR TIME. The bra clasp is not that difficult, especially for someone who plays six hours a day of online Doom. Go slow, don\u2019t get nervous. The main point is to avoid pinching her skin or giving her any friction burns. (Save those for latter\u2026 grrrr.) Now I know what Penthouse told you -- it\u2019s fun to tease a girl, and she\u2019ll enjoy it. That\u2019s a lie. Once she\u2019s ready to get her pussy rubbed, you need to pull those panties off with haste. Once you\u2019re naked, it\u2019s all a matter of sticking it in. \n\n(IMPORTANT NOTE: Don\u2019t forget the condoms. Did I say this already? At your place, have several on hand. At her place, ask if she has protection. If she doesn\u2019t, excuse yourself while you slip your pants on and go back out to your car. If you\u2019re done your job right, she won\u2019t mind at all. Don\u2019t bother to apologize\u2026 just hurry!)\n\nOPTION 1: THE COUCH -- Stay on the couch if you like the girl being on top. She definitely likes it on top, because she can aim your cock at her G-spot. (If you want to hit it for her, go Google the subject.) Also, you can stretch out with either one on top, missionary style, provided the couch is long enough. \n\nOPTION 2: COUCH-TO-FLOOR -- If she\u2019s too horny to make it to the bedroom, oblige her. Put her on her back beside the couch, then slip inside her. Down on the floor, you\u2019ll have a lot more room to roll around and switch who\u2019s on top. Be careful not to crush her, especially if you\u2019re an overweight nerd as most are. Hey, don\u2019t worry about your weight now\u2026 you\u2019re fucking an actual girl! (Avoid doggie-style for now. We\u2019ll get to that in Part 4.)\n\nOPTION 3: COUCH-TO-BED -- It\u2019s best to get her on the bed, but there\u2019s a devious drawback to immediately moving the action to the bedroom: You increase the odds that you\u2019ll only get to have sex one time. Why? Well Stevie, because you\u2019re a lifelong masturbator, and that means you\u2019ll come quickly the first time. On the couch or the floor, your premature ejaculation is actual a great time to transition to the bedroom and continue to fuck until she gets hers. But in the bedroom, you may inadvertently give the impression that you\u2019re done. She\u2019ll be pissed, and she may even get up and put on her bathrobe. That would suck. In a nutshell, feel free to move straight to the bed if you can hold your climax until she\u2019s had her first one. \n\nC. THE ART OF COMING\n\nOh nerd, my nerd, we both know you\u2019re single greatest fear. You can\u2019t help wondering if you\u2019ll come before she does, leaving her dissatisfied and wondering if she made a mistake by letting you fuck her. This is where all the other advice comes into play. Have you made her feel safe? Have you listened to her inane chatter? If you have, she\u2019s more likely to believe you want her to orgasm, and she\u2019ll give your wiener a second chance to drill the hole. Don\u2019t be nervous -- just stay classy, be forthcoming, and have fun. If you have to put on a second replacement condom, do it quickly, then get back in the ring. ",
        "4. The Wow Level \n\nLook at you now, thumping a girl\u2019s love pocket at the end of a beautiful date in which you barely spilled any marinara on the only tie you own. Now you have a story to tell your nerd friends, but could there possibly be another level you could take this thing to? Maybe she doesn\u2019t have to believe you were a one-night stand with average kissing technique and a larger penis than she\u2019d first imagined. No, maybe you\u2019re the boy who will give her the freedom to fulfill her most wanton, slutty, orgasmic desires, maybe for more than one night. What can we say -- you really DID make her feel appreciated and safe throughout the evening, even when you were ejaculating inside her. Perhaps a second round of naughtiness is in order\u2026 or even more?\n\nA. CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE\n\nKeep up the good work sending and receiving signals with your date. Tell her you\u2019d love to have sex again, if she\u2019s up for it. She\u2019s a chick, so of course she is, and she\u2019ll be impressed that you\u2019re still such a goddamn gentleman. Once you\u2019re touching her body again, switch from verbal communication back to body language. \n\nB. FIND OUT WHAT SHE WANTS\n\nListen, listen, listen, listen, listen\u2026 either with your hands or your ears. If she responds well when you pinch her nipples, that means you need to keep paying attention to her breasts. Even when she asks what you want, try to figure out what she wants to hear, and say that. (I know it\u2019s dishonest, but she really just wants another orgasm, so give her one.) Don\u2019t ever try any of that kinky shit without finding out whether it\u2019s okay or not. And that doesn\u2019t mean you can just ask her out of the clear black sky, \u201cHey, you like anal?\u201d Keep making her feel safe with questions like, \u201cSo what do you want to do next?\u201d or even, \u201cI\u2019m game for any position you need.\u201d \n\nC. LEARN THE BASICS, THEN GO BEYOND\n\nWhat do nerds do better than anyone? They become obsessed with one subject and become an expert in it. The time has come for you to become an expert on the female sexual process. You MUST BELIEVE that no man within a fifty-mile radius knows more about how to suck a clitoris, or how to sustain a girl\u2019s multiple orgasms. I mean, all you have to do is type \u201cfemale orgasm\u201d in the web browser\u2019s search window to find out what you need to do. Think of this successful date as a field test to find out what works and what doesn\u2019t. (Just because a webpage says a certain technique is sure-fire doesn\u2019t mean you keep trying it even when you aren\u2019t seeing any results from it.) IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT, you could be having sloppy sweat-dripping sex for hours and hours. Don\u2019t forget to give your dick a rest and just finger or eat her when you need to. She won\u2019t mind, trust me. \n\nD. KEEP SOME THINGS TO YOURSELF, YOU TWISTED GEEK\n\nIt may seem as though you\u2019ve finally found someone you can share everything with, simply because you\u2019re having so much good sex in one night, but that illusion is deadly. You, my nerdy friend, do not think like the rest of society, and that means some of the sex fantasies going on in your head are a little\u2026 well, creepy. When in doubt, stay silent. Just because she says she likes anal sex doesn\u2019t mean you can offer your own ass up for her strap-on. It can be very tricky figuring out what will turn OFF a girl, even though so many of them are turned ON by the same things. Like I said\u2026 if it\u2019s something you\u2019ve hidden from the world for years, it won\u2019t hurt to keep it hidden a bit longer. \n\nE. DON\u2019T RUN OFF\n\nWhat the fuck? You scheduled time at your place to watch \u201cDie Hard\u201d with some buddies when you got home from the date? What a dumbass. Once you finish having sex with the girl, stick around and hold her until she falls asleep, then stay in the bed and fall asleep yourself. You want a second date, don\u2019t you??? Then don\u2019t ask why, nerd, just do it. \n\nConclusion\n\nI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve come so far in such a short period of time. Yes, I said \u201ccome,\u201d now stop giggling. Deep down in your heart of hearts, you\u2019re still a big nerd. And deep down, so is that business-guy with the perfect hair. Hey, who doesn\u2019t like a good game of X-Box shoot-\u2019em-up every once in a while? But there\u2019s no reason you should let your nerdy pursuits stand in the way of dating and sex. If you follow each step in this process, you\u2019ll greatly increase your odds of \u201cgetting some.\u201d You may even be less of a hopeless loser in lots of other social contexts. We can only hope! \n\nWrite and tell me how the date went, okay? Glad I could help. "
