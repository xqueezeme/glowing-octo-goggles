        "Gloryholes. Are they real? How do I find one? What's it like to visit one? Is there an etiquette to follow? Are they safe?\n\nAre they real? Yes! I've visited several of them. How many? I didn't keep count. Ten? Fifteen? I don't know. I've visited them from Philly to St. Louis to Florida and lots of places in between. Deploy the power of the internet to search around for one near you. There are several sites that will help. Or, look for sex shops that advertise \"Video Preview Booths\" and check for yourself.\n\nLet's get the controversial part out of the way: Are they safe? Gloryholes are as safe (and unsafe) as any one-night-stand or most other anonymous hook-ups. Look, we all know the safest sex is either abstinence, masturbation or limiting yourself to one, well-tested, completely faithful partner. Setting that aside, oral sex among healthy adults is (relatively) very safe. It's even safer if you don't have any open cuts or sores in your mouth. Even safer if you take a look at the big dick you're about to put into your mouth and inspect it for sores or cuts. Safer still if you consider the typical clientele of most gloryholes: married, middled-aged white guys. Still, sex is never without risk and if you're a hypochondriac, have too much OCD or just a worry wart - then stay the fuck away, okay?\n\nWhat about the dangers of sticking your dick into a hole in the wall? Dude (and you're definitely mostly a dude if you have a dick), if the other guy didn't want your dick, he wouldn't have ASKED for it, you know? We're not talking about sticking your dick inside a random hole out in the world. We're talking about sticking your dick inside the adjoining walls of two booths showing sex movies. \n\nWhere do you find the booths? The ones I've visited are about the same. Booths are typically found inside sex shops that sell X-rated DVDs and adult toys. Look for sex shops that advertise \"Video Preview Booths\" or \"Peep Shows.\" Many require a purchase of tokens before you visit the booth area. There will be a sign. A few have an admission fee for heading in the booth area and you're expected to have a pocket of singles for the video machines. The clerk behind the counter ain't gonna judge you. Mumble that you want some tokens, hand them some money and you're on your way! Not all sex shops with preview booths have gloryholes! Some only have a few gloryholes tucked at one end or other of the row of booths. Do your research, it's why Google exists!\n\nWhat's it like in the booth area? With few exceptions, most of the booth areas I've encountered are dark hallways with very poor lighting. There are usually several guys milling around in the booth area (more about that in a minute). I have visited a few where the booth area is as well lit as the store, but that's definitely the exception. \n\nWhat's with the guys hanging out in the hallway? Who knows?! I don't ever get why some places seem to have lots of guys hanging out in the hallway. Some of these same places will have \"No loitering\" signs posted and STILL have guys hanging out in the hallway. Maybe they're waiting for a chick to visit a booth. Maybe they're hoping Prince Charming will visit. In general, though, most are waiting to see who goes into a booth with a gloryhole. Hey, if you have a chance to check out the person sucking your dick, wouldn't you take it? Maybe they're waiting for a black guy to go into a booth or a white guy or a pirate. \n\nThere's another way to visit the booth area that doesn't involve gloryholes. It's waiting for someone to invite you into their booth. You make a bit of eye contact with one of the guys, enter the booth near them, leave your door ajar and hope they follow you. If they don't, they aren't interested. If they do, well, start sucking!\n\nWhat are the booths like? Most of them are small, very small. Think about it, it's a retail space and the more booths they can fit into a small space, the better the owner's chances at making some money! So, how small? I've been inside some that were no more than three or four feet wide and nearly as deep. Meaning, you have enough room to step inside the booth, turn around and close the door. Some have a bench built into the wall. Some will include a chair. Sometimes the chair inside looks like something the thrift store would reject. I've seen some with wastebaskets and towels available, too. Depending on the place, the booths might be exceptionally clean or really nasty and dirty. Peek inside a few booths. Take a look! If you don't like what you see, head somewhere else.\n\nOtherwise, the booths will have a TV, typically behind a piece of glass or Plexiglass and a machine for your dollars or tokens. The doors typically have a lock and, unless you want unexpected company, lock your door. Above the door will be a light that signifies if the person inside is spending money or not. Maybe the light changes from green to red or just lights up. Remember, the owner of your local sex shop is there to make money. FEED THE MACHINE! Some places require their help to check for occupied booths where no one is spending money. \n\nHow big are the gloryholes? Usually, there's nothing more between the booths than a piece of plywood. I've seen gloryholes big enough for someone to climb through them (though only once in a real dive of a place). I've seen some that feature a door or panel, where you can decide if you want the gloryhole open or closed. Some holes are crude, as if other people spent hours digging away at the wall with their pen knife. Some have been professionally cut between the booths. I've seen them vary in size from about as big around as a fist to being the size of a dinner plate. A few have been too low for me (I'm rather tall). I've read complaints about some places where guys thought the holes were too tall for short guys.\n\nOkay, inside, the door is locked, a movie is playing, now what? If you're a guy hoping to suck some dick, whip it out! I know, that seems counterintuitive. If you're there to suck dick, why do you need to pull out YOUR dick? Simple answer. The guy getting into the booth next to you will probably take a peek to see what you're doing. If they see you with your dick out, then they know you mean business. \n\nMostly, you get inside your booth, pay your money, find a channel you like (most booths have a channel selector) and wait for someone to get into the booth next to you. Remember those guys standing in the hallway? Most of them saw you go into a booth. If they're interested, they'll get into the booth next to you. If they're not interested, then fuck'em. Wait until someone else shows up. Maybe you'll spend twenty minutes sitting in there; ready, willing and able. Maybe you'll do nothing more than close the door and you'll have a buddy next door.\n\nHow do I let the other guy know I want to suck his dick? Stick a couple fingers into the hole and wiggling them around. Sometimes, a guy might try shoving his tongue through a hole, but seriously, just a couple fingers will do. If the other guy is interested, he'll get the point. \n\nWhat if I want to do more? Dude, that's on you. I go to suck and be sucked. If you want it up the ass, then I hope you brought condoms and lube. \n\nHe wants to suck me, too! Maybe. Some guys do, some guys don't. Up to you, champ. Some guys enjoy getting half a blowjob and leaving. Don't ask me why. I've been told (multiple times) that I'm very accomplished sucking dick, but maybe my style doesn't please everyone, I don't know. \n\nI'm a chick, can I visit one? Hell yes! Have I seen it? Yes, but not very often. However, it DOES happen. Expect the most of the guys to be shocked seeing a woman in the hallway. They'll be curious and I'm willing to bet, very nice to you, too. \n\nWho goes to gloryholes? Mostly, middled aged guys and mostly white guys (though that can vary depending on where you are). \n\nWhen is the best time to go? I've found that lunch time is a great time to go. Mid-afternoons can be good. Right after work is alright, too. Think about it, most of the guys are married and sneaking away for a bit of a thrill that no one is ever going to know about. Most of the day Saturday can be good, too.\n\nAnything else? Yes, buck up and go! Check one out. See what's happening. Maybe you'll just look around and not do anything and that's okay. Maybe you'll find a new hobby and that's okay, too. Mostly, though, use your common sense and have fun!"
