        "A bottle of water based lube and a pair of gloves. These are the basic tools that you need for a lot of different endeavors. Medical Play, anal play, putting new grips on your golf clubs, and replacing the washers on that leaky faucet are just some of the wonderful uses for these two tools. The one that we are going to discuss today is fisting, specifically vaginal fisting.\n\nThe art of vaginal fisting is one that is quite gratifying for the fistee in most cases. There are a lot of women out there that love the feeling of a well-stuffed pussy. \n\nYes Virginia, a whole hand will fit in your pussy with a little relaxation and time. Even if you're tighter than I am at tax time. For the women that are \"size queens\" this will be a most fulfilling walk in the park for you, although I don't suggest you try walking anywhere with a cunt full of fist.\n\nAs far as fisting goes, there is not a lot of experience involved with vaginal fisting. Anal fisting is a whole other ballgame. It is quite important to take your time, start slow, and work into things so to speak. \n\nSo where do we start? It helps to have a comfortable spot with lots of room for the fistee to be able to stretch out and relax. You want the fistee to be as relaxed as possible. I was recently involved in a situation that a friend of mine coined as a \"fist-fest\". There were several couples in the room with a number of fists in use. This was a truly hot experience. One thing that I think we lacked was plenty of room to stretch out and relax. Be sure that you can do this as it will make things a lot more pleasurable for both of you.\n\nNext to relaxation is arousal. In order for the vagina to open well, the fistee needs to be aroused. If she has a favorite vibrator, tongue, or other type of stimulation that really rocks her world, it would be in your best interest to make use of whatever means necessary to get her juices flowing. I know that there are a lot of us Domly types out here that love to be in control and do as you please. Fisting is one of those areas where you are a lot better off listening to the fistee and letting them control the speed and depth. This will keep from having to explain to the Dr. later why you have tearing of the vagina.\n\nNow to the juicy stuff: You should use lots of lubricant and wear gloves. I cannot stress enough that you cannot use too much lube. The lube should be water based. Guys, if you're going to fist your woman, trim your nails. You don't want to damage that delicate tissue that you so love to play with. (Just remember you can't play with your toys if you break them). Coat your entire hand with lube, lots of it. You can also add more as you go. \n\nStart out using a finger or two and take it slow. As she relaxes, you can increase the number of fingers. You need to make your hand as small as you can. Tuck your thumb and make all of your fingers group so that your hand is as skinny as it can get. I have very large hands and have fisted a number of women successfully the first time they tried. When you have four fingers in and she is ready for you to proceed, then slowly push in, starting with your knuckles towards her ass. Slowly rotate your hand as you are gently, slowly pushing. The most difficult part of the whole process is getting past the knuckles of your hand. Lube, lube, and more lube. Have the fistee take slow, deep breaths and remind her that she should try to relax. If this is too much for her, then you should stop or back off a bit.\n\nIf she is ready to proceed, then you should be able to turn your wrist a little bit to get past the pubic bone. Once you do this, you are in like Flynn. Once inside, the hand will curl up on its own naturally. There are several things you can do once inside.\n\nYou should hold still for a moment while you both adjust from the sensation of what has occurred. Then you can move slowly in a rotating motion or move slowly in and out. Do not just start ramming it home once you're inside. Slow and easy till you know what she can handle. As you are fisting, she might start to contract. If she gets cunt contractions from hell, hang on for all you're worth but do not, DO NOT, pull out suddenly, you can damage muscle and tissue and make it bad for her.\n\nDuring the Death Grip of the Cunt Monster, it can become quite uncomfortable for you as you feel like a vise is closing around your hand. If she is cumming, then this can feel like you're driving over your hand with a dump truck full of gravel. Trust me, I was not sure that I would have a hand when I pulled out of a couple of fistees.\n\nWhen she cums........and she will cum, be prepared for the pussy grip of death, because it will happen. She might even flood the room. I have had fistees that had never squirted before in their life all of a sudden become Niagara falls with a bit of fist play. While she is cumming, let her push you out. This is the best way to disengage from the beast within. If you cannot handle the pain of your hand crushing anymore, let her know so that she can assist you in retrieving your hand from the digit destroyer.\n\nLast but not least. Fisting can be quite an emotional ordeal for the fistee. The trust and closeness that is shared during the fisting is something that should carry over into aftercare. Be aware of your fistee and her feelings, which can run the whole scale from elation to depression and everything in between.\n\nProvide a warm blanket and a quiet, safe, place for her to rest with you close by. Re-assure the fistee!!! Even if she is unable to take a fist the first, second, or any time at all you should make sure that she is aware that it is ok, and not her fault. Anatomy does not always give you a choice in the matter. Holding her, talking to her, allowing time to regroup are all ways to assure adequate aftercare. Make sure there is food and drink on hand as well. This should all be a part of most any scene in our lifestyle. \n\nFisters of the world, UNITE, FIST, and Conquer, One Cunt (and Ass) at a time!"
