        "Hello-\n\nIt seems there is a new fascination with submission in light of the new film and various books. As a Master, I thought I'd help a few of you learn how it actually works. After all, when you think about it, I'm here to help. \n\nMany who already enjoy this deviance are treating the film with disdain; I do not.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, if it has got you thinking, so much the better. If you now feel encouraged -and more importantly, empowered- to explore some of these themes, that's excellent. \n\nHowever, it is imperative that I correct some mistakes. Because if you are truly interested in doing this, do it properly or not at all. Others have their methods. These are mine:\n\nFirst and foremost, you must be a feminist or I can't accept you. \n\nIn case you don't know, all proper subs are feminists. Just not necessarily the political kind. \n\nMost properly submissive girls are independent and defiant women by nature. All of you are bright, often fiercely so. Many highly successful. You have strong opinions about politics and culture and the world around you. You give a damn.\n\nBe honest about what you want to do. You have a strong sexual longing to be controlled and it's confusing. Despite everything else you think of in your life, this has always been the case and it has always turned you on. If asked to explain it, you couldn't. \n\nThe problem is that you have lovers who either do not know how take control correctly or who pretend and then screw it up just when you need it most. \n\nYou need a teacher. And let the two of us be frank. You crave being given permission to come, hard and often, the way you do when you are alone, imagining this. Equally importantly for you, you need to give pleasure and be rewarded. You covet that attention. \n\nAnd yet you love the idea of being punished. If you are submissive, you always have, by definition. This thrills you like little else. \n\nWhich means submission is the same as exploration. You have a need to learn why. A compulsion. This requires intelligence. Only an intelligent woman would even bother to explore these areas of the female psyche. In other words, an intelligent feminist. Which is the same thing.\n\nBut you need a partner. Someone who understands what you need to learn and why. This is not something you can work out on your own. But you need the right kind of guide. \n\nIn the way that I work, I do not mix with others. I will not take you to sex clubs or ghastly parties. I will not share photos of you with anyone else. I do not participate in any euphamism involving 'lifestyle'. \n\nIf I take you on, the focus is on you. And we will be realistic. Eventually, as in all things in life, you will move on. Think of what we're about to do as the most erotic education of your life. It is going to be. \n\nSome other things:\n\nPlease don't waste my time with talk of nipple clamps.\n\nMany people like these kinds of sex toys. I do not. I consider them vulgar. Do not confuse submission with fetish. \n\nIf you do get turned on by being bound and gagged, you needn't worry. I will teach you everything you need. Your dark and scary fantasies will all be brought to the surface in time. \n\nI find that a blindfold, riding crop and a glass of wine are all I need when training most girls.\n\nNext, I won't control you 24 hours a day. That is impossible. And I don't want to. I've got things to do. \n\nI will control you for certain periods of time and as I train you the lengths of time will increase. I will also set challenges for you. Dares, if you like. You will need to meet each one to continue.\n\nBut when it is our time, I am in complete control of you. No debate. You must understand this before we begin. \n\nYou are the kind of woman who revels in having secrets. It thrills you to imagine the people at work who would have heart attacks if they knew what you like. \n\nAnd you do love walking down the street still feeling the sting of your spanked bottom as the rest of the world passes by oblivious. \n\nNow read carefully. I am going to ask you a question and I want you to take some time considering it. This is your first test. \n\nWho is the person in your life you secretly want to tell? Confessing your submission to this person would humiliate you, no question. But it would also secretly excite you, too. \n\nFor many women the answer is a best friend, for some it is a sister. Your answer may be entirely different. But the experience is the same.\n\nImagine the shock in their eyes when you admit what you like. Watch them stunned as you describe what we do, what you ask me to do to you, willingly. And feel your body become aroused at the thought that this person now carries your secret around with them, too. Whoever it is will go home and think about it. It will be impossible not to. That person will become aroused thinking of you. Imagining you. \n\nConsider who this is in your life. When the time is right I will instruct you to tell them your secret. But not for quite some time. That will come but not until much later.\n\nNevertheless, for us to begin, you need to tell me who it is and why it both scares and excites you. \n\nFinally, I must tell you about collars because it is essential for what we're about to start.\n\nYou will be required to wear a collar, yes. But your collar might be a ribbon. It might be a simple gold band or an antique necklace we find in a dusty old shop. \n\nIt violates every one of my principles to consider putting a dog collar around a woman's neck. Yours will very clearly mark you and your body as mine. To do with as I wish. But your collar will be our choice.\n\nIt will remain with me at all times. And when it is time for you to submit wholly and entirely to me, you will come to me and beg your Master for permission to wear your collar and be a good girl. \n\nThis is how it's done correctly."
