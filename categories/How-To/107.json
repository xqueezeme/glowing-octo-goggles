        "I think it an exercise in futility for me to think I can tell you or teach you (well, with words only) how to eat pussy. I can share with you my experience and what I have found works for me, and you are free to adopt any of my techniques or experiment and see what works. But I cannot write the definitive \"''how to eat pussy like a champ by following these simple steps.\"\n\nThe only general guideline I offer is that there is no right or wrong way to eat pussy. It is my experience that each woman is very different in her preferences and anatomy, and the effort you put into oral sex for your lady is really the time and diligence you put into it to find out what works\u2014and what does not.\n\nBeing able to openly talk to your woman before, during and after the grand event is very helpful, but sometimes they are not your best guide either from shyness or inexperience. \n\nI think the right attitude is the best skill you can possess in eating pussy. First, see this as a selfless act designed to bring pleasure to your woman. Do your job right, and the payback can be pleasure of untold proportions. Remember, this is not just a warm up for you to fuck her (except when it is) or something that you do because it is expected. You need to have the mindset that you are going to do whatever it takes to provide her a high quality orgasm using only your mouth, tongue and maybe fingers. And you do this because...well... it is just fucking hot for you, too.\n\nIn short, I believe the right mindset is something along the lines of \"Eating pussy is its own reward.\"\n\nSecond, you have to really love the pussy in its entirety. The way it looks, smells and tastes as well as feels when you are fucking. Each woman has a different smell and taste. Some have a heavy scent and taste, others are light. It doesn't matter as they have as much control over this as you do the size of your cock. The point is you need to \"take it as it comes\" (to pardon the pun) and remember that ALL pussy is amazing. Amazing not only for the pleasure it can afford you as a means of intercourse, but in its very existence. The pussy is the center of a woman's sexuality, but not the single place where it resides. However, each woman's pussy is a marvel to behold and something to treasure and that attitude makes it easy to become acknowledged as a master of your skill.\n\nWe all have a preference in the smell and taste. But again, other than simple hygiene, your woman has zero control over any of that. Let her know you adore how she smells, how she tastes and how beautiful you think her pussy looks. Hopefully a genuine sense of awe is your mindset. I let her know I want her to \"mark\" me with her juices, that I want her smell on my face, fingers, neck and cock. I will tell her I really need her to abandon herself to my mouth and dance on the tip of my tongue in her erotic dance of pleasure. To use the common vernacular, I urge you to let her know you \"get it.\"\n\nAs for the mechanics, there really is no right or wrong way\u2014there is just what works for her. There is no one secret, special technique that, once understood and mastered, will make you THE pussy eating champ for all women. However, there are techniques that work for her and that can make you HER world champion pussy eater. And the joy is in the journey and discovery. Truly, a labor love.\n\nOk, here is how I do it, and take from it what ever you wish. I begin by whispering in her ear that I simply must taste her\u2014that my need to go down on her is strong. Then I take a bit of time to see what I have to work with. Is she dripping wet in urgent need of release? Is she not wet at all and needing the proper time and attention to coax an orgasm out of her? \n\nI begin by just lightly licking the entire pussy. I explore lightly with my tongue, and savior her taste. I take a few very deep breaths to let her know I like what I have found\u2014that simple act alone, letting her hear you breathing her in deeply and robustly, is a great way to set the stage. Then I pay attention to her clit. Does she have a huge clit that is readily exposed? Does she have small clit that is hidden deeply behind the folds of her hood? I find the location and condition of her clit, but leave it alone for the time being. I lick her pussy from stem to stern repeatedly, gently suck her pussy into my mouth, and trace the lines of her pussy lips with the tip of my tongue. I pay attention to how she reacts, and if find something that is really working, I keep doing that until it is time to move on to something else.\n\nThat something else is usually the beginning stages of eating her. I never directly stimulate her clit, unless I know this is what works for her. Some women need direct and continual clit stimulation at the outset, but my experience is that most do not. Using the first third of my tongue, I lap the top third of her pussy and alternate in sort of lightly tracing her clit or the hood and her pussy lips.\n\nI also make a point to gently use the tip of my finger to trace and rub the lips, usually taking the time to tell her something hot and nasty, or sweet and loving. But I will for sure tell her that I love the way she smells and tastes\u2014and I tell her that every time. \n\nA note; some women are super sensitive at first and cannot tolerate any firm stimulation of the clit\u2014these are women who, in my mind, I need to \"work up\" to the point of tolerating/needing firm clit stimulation. Other women want a firm tongue lashing of their clit, and from the beginning are in desperate need of rapid and hard attention from my tongue. Pay attention because you want to get this right.\n\nOnce she is good and wet from her own juices and my saliva, I will pick up the pace of my lapping and licking and increase the pressure on her clit\u2014one way to look at this is taking the intensity of my actions up a notch while paying close attention that I am not over or under stimulating. \n\nThen I stick one of my own fingers in my mouth and wet it in preparation of inserting it into her pussy. It is my experience that nothing can be more of a momentary \"buzz kill\" for a woman than the sudden introduction of a dry finger. Another good way to do this is to let her suck and wet a finger or two for you. Then I go back to actively eating her and gently slip a finger inside her.\n\nMy experience also tells me that finger fucking is not the best use of my digit. Rather, I crook my finger and find the ridged area just inside her on the top. Now, find a rhythm with your tongue on her clit and gently tap and rub that ridged area\u2014which I believe is commonly called the \"g spot.\" Then slip a second finger into her and use both finger tips to tap and rub the ridges. And another note, some women's ridges are big and pronounced, other are small and delicate. But notice they all seem to swell and become more pronounced as they build towards orgasm. The swelling and pronouncement of her ridges will happen in direct proportion to her wetness. And it is just hot to feel it happen on your fingertips.\n\nAt this point I know I need to be focused but flexible. She might buck and thrash with increasing intensity as she builds. She might push my face into her pussy, or hold my head and grind her hips into my face, or wrap her feet around my upper torso. But then she might also simply lay very passively, opening her legs wide to give you all the access I could hope for and wail and scream...or whisper and make her small noises of pleasure. I just roll with what happens, but when I since she is getting close I will urge her to cum on my tongue. \n\nI find a rhythm and a place on or near her clit that is working and keep going. The time has passed for changing it up or exploration. This is what I call the \"active pussy eating stage.\" At this point I am working towards completion, using my tongue and fingers and staying focused. I try to position my nose such that I can breathe; another big buzz killer is breaking the rhythm to gasp for breath.\n\nA woman once told me that when she came with me licking her clit AND rubbing her g spot it felt like an \"internal and external orgasm, while it just feels external and more intense when you use only your tongue.\" She did not place a value judgment on one method or type of orgasm over the other. But she did best vocalize the difference in a way I could grasp. By the way, she had this really nice, full natural blond bush. She barely had any taste or smell, and she gushed wetness even when slightly aroused. She also had a g spot that was impossible to miss. She was a wailing, screaming, head-thumping, grind-and-thrash-hard-into-your-face woman that would literally scream \"Fuck, you ROCK\" right before I sent her over the edged by eating her. Her blond pussy was tight, hot...\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAnyway, discuss it with your woman. Give her both types and see what thinks of each climax and if she feels a difference. \n\nMy orgasm comes in one flavor. I cum hard. I do not think men, or at least most men, can say one cum feels much different from the other. At least physically, anyway. However, I will be the first to admit I might be wrong, and I have not discussed this with other men. But the male orgasm, I think, differs only by very slight degrees of pleasure either way of \"great.\" \n\nBut my experience is that this is not the case for women. They can have any number of different types of orgasms; hard to the point of violent, or soft and sweet. They can arrive as mind blowing climaxes that leave 'em limp or a little shudder from one that is just sufficient to take the edge off. I have found I cannot control the type or the intensity of her climax as there are many other factors that come into play that are usually outside my abilities. The point is, I can make a woman cum (99 times out of a 100) by eating her pussy, but the quality of her climax is not a sure thing I can replicate for her time and time again. However, I do like the sense of power that comes with a challenge wherein I am have to coax an orgasm out of a lady when I eat her, and succeed. \n\nThat said, I do know I can ruin it for her at the end with bad mechanics. There is providing too much stimulation or licking/fingering \"too hard\" that can fuck up a climax. Or breaking the rhythm by losing her sweet spot (clit) just as she goes over the edge and the resulting orgasm is one of less intensity. Or losing the rhythm too many times and turning her into a frustrated, overly sensitized woman who can't go over the edge. Yep, check the box, I have done all of that. At times I have been the worst pussy eater known to woman. And those failures have made me much, much better at the job.\n\nPerhaps one technique to experiment with is the \"Butterfly.\" In this, you eat her pussy and use the index and middle finger to tap her g-spot. The ring finger has no job, so you keep it curled in. Use the tip of your little finger to gently probe her anal opening. You need not penetrate her ass (unless she grooves on such a thing) but rather just toy with her little rosebud and give her ass a little play. You might be amazed at the reaction you get. My experience is I at least get a shy little admission that \"how you did that was hot.\"\n\nI believe the cool down is important to the entire experience. I pay attention and let her body will tell me when to stop licking her clit. I will keep eating pussy until I receive some sign of \"enough!\" It can be the words \"stop,\" or a tightened body that goes slack, legs and arms unclenching my head and hips not being wildly pounded into my face. It can be having your head pushed away. When it is over, I will very gently kiss the area around her pussy, her inner thighs, her tummy...just light little kisses, while taking an occasional deep breath to let her know I continue to adore her scent. I once had a lover whose every nerve was on edge after she came that even a little kiss on her inner thigh made her jerk with little jolts of pain. But I linger in the area until they come back down...come back to me. \n\nAnd for me, the greatest reward of being a good pussy eater when she whispers in my ear an urgent plea; \"Baby, I need you to do that thing you do.\" Or something more direct.\n\nSo those are my thoughts on eating pussy. I appreciate your reading this. "
