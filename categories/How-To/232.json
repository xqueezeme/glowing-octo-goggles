        "Is there anything more erotic, more satisfying, more \u2013 mere words fail me \u2013 than going down on a woman, eating hair pie, giving her head, having a box lunch, performing oral sex, eating her out, etc.?  I think not.\n\nWhat is more the essence of sex than a woman\u2019s vagina?   The source of her pleasure, home of the clitoris, center of her sexual universe?  Nothing, in my opinion.  \n\nAll roads lead to the vagina, do they not?  Look at a lovely woman.  On the street, in the mall, at work \u2013 anywhere. Her abundant hair, alluring eyes, soft full lips.  Follow down the curve of her neck, the swell of her breasts, the strength of her stomach.  When you hit the center of her body, right between her beautiful legs, you\u2019ve hit the center of her being.\n\nOr start with her delicate feet.  Strong enough to carry her for a lifetime, yet supple enough to massage and fondle.  Also, by the way, often cold enough to freeze whatever they touch under the blankets!  Move your eyes up those shapely calves to the curve of her thighs and roundness of her tush, and there it is again, the Bermuda Triangle, mysterious and unknown.\n\nWell yes, as you may have noticed, I\u2019m a man who loves vagina.  Loves the way it looks, the way it smells and tastes, and most especially when treated right, the joy it gives a woman.  Naturally, you don\u2019t have to be a man to feel this way and that\u2019s cool, too \u2013 very cool, judging by the adult video and film industry.\n\nWhen you hold a woman\u2019s legs apart and use your tongue and talents correctly, you may become a very popular lover indeed.  Songs may be written about you.  Statues erected of your likeness.  College dorms named after you.  At the very least, you\u2019ll have very few lonely nights.  As one of the lovely gals in \"Sex and the City\u2019 once opined, \"If a man can do that well, he doesn\u2019t need to do anything else.\"  How true it is.\n\nIf there\u2019s a girl who doesn\u2019t love having her pussy showered with affection, I haven\u2019t met her.  And if you\u2019re new to this form of intense pleasure, if you want to be a better lover and realize there\u2019s no manual, I believe I can help.\n\nNow, for those of you of don\u2019t know a vulva from a Volvo, a clitoral hood from an oven hood, let\u2019s start with a quick and simple anatomy lesson, so we\u2019re all on the same page when it comes to descriptions.  By the way, I prefer to call the area the pussy, as I do in my stories.  It\u2019s kind of erotic, I think, where cunt is too harsh and vagina is too clinical.  Plus, gash, slit, love tunnel, etc. are too cute and can get confusing.\n\nThe entire outside of the vagina is called the vulva.   The large, soft outside lips are the labia majora, while the inside, thinner and more delicate lips are called the labia minora.  High up on top, inside the inner lips is the clitoral hood, which when lifted reveals the clitoris itself, which can actually swell and become somewhat erect when stimulated.  The small opening right below the clitoris is the urethra, where urine comes out.  Below the urethra of course is the larger opening of the vagina.  Between the vagina and the anus is the perineum, called the \u2018taint\u2019 in slang (\u2018taint the asshole, taint the vagina.\u2019)  Got all that?  Good, let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThere are many forms which can work with this type of article; Q &amp; A, Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts,Pros and Cons. I\u2019ve ruled out Q &amp; A because I\u2019m not sure which Qs you\u2019d A.  As for pros and cons, there are no cons to oral sex, so that\u2019s out.  Let\u2019s try Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts.  If you do, however, have any Qs, just email me, I\u2019ll be happy to A to the best of my knowledge.\n\nAlso I must advise you, I\u2019m not a doctor or sex practitioner.  If you happen to meet a doctor that loves licking pussy as much as I do, and has done as much of it, feel free to listen to their advice instead of mine.  Of course, it may cost you $100 for every 15 minutes, while I\u2019m free (And here I was thinking that I was just cheap.)  Plus, I\u2019ve been to the doctor many times, never discussed eating pussy \u2013 not once.  What do we pay them for, anyway?  And with that, away we go\u2026\n\nDo understand, please, that every person on the planet is different.  One woman\u2019s honey may be another\u2019s poison, or something like that.   Instructions are fine, but we\u2019re not assembling a bicycle here.  There\u2019s more than one way to do it.  In fact, there are many, many ways, some of which I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not aware of yet (though I do try so hard to stay current.) As they say, communication is the key, baby.  If she likes what you\u2019re doing, or even loves it, keep it up.  If she doesn\u2019t like your technique, all is not lost.  Just dial it down a notch perhaps, begin with the basics as I will explain them.  If the challenge, however, is that she wants you to be wilder, crazier, more intense, please call me immediately, I\u2019ll be right over to help. **\n** 24 hour service only available in New Jersey \u2013 sorry.\n\nDon\u2019t rush to the vagina as soon as you\u2019re both aroused enough to undress.  Take your time, oh impatient one, it will be worth the wait and increase her arousal tenfold.  Start with her neck and shoulders.  Caress, kiss and lick your way down her chest, lingering on her breasts.  I can not overstate how sensitive a woman\u2019s nipples are.  When you circle her aureoles with your lips or fingers, then lightly (or not so lightly, depending on her) squeeze her nipples, she\u2019ll likely feel the vibration right down to her buzzing pussy.\n\nNot too long on those nipples, though \u2013 she may get sensitive quickly and you don\u2019t want to make her squirm -yet.   Kiss the soft insides of her thighs, her calves, even her feet. By the time you get down to the vagina itself, she should be primed and aching for your tongue. \n\nDo take your time and by all means, enjoy yourself down there.  It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been dreaming about, right?  Savor the sight, the smell, and the glory of it all.  Kiss it, caress it, rub your thumbs all over the soft folds of beautiful flesh.  Are you getting the picture?  This is no time to rush, you\u2019re not eating an ice pop here.  It\u2019s not going to melt.  Be slow and thorough.  Trust me - she\u2019ll appreciate it.\n\nDon\u2019t go right for the kill by starting off licking her clit.  Men are results oriented, I know, and want to make her cum fast.  But it\u2019s not all about the orgasm, it\u2019s about the journey. So slow down.  Lick her outside and inside pussy lips first, with broad, flat strokes of your tongue.  Lick around the inside of her vagina and, if you like, use your stiffened tongue like a mini penis, sticking it in and out of the hole.  Lick around the bottom of her pussy and her perineum.  If she\u2019s comfortable having her asshole licked, (bless her heart) which is called rimming, then by all means do so as long as you\u2019re comfortable as well.  Many men and women find this highly erotic, and I\u2019m one of them.  Even if she\u2019s never had it done before, ask her if she\u2019ll just give it a try.  Hopefully she\u2019s open-minded and will let you.  You may send her to heaven this way.  Now, when all this prep work (you call this work?) is done, move your tongue up to the clit and even when you get there, toy with it.  Lick around the clit in circles, lick over the top, around the bottom \u2013 all before you really get down to business, which is sucking her clit into you mouth and licking it fast with the tip of your tongue until she cums.\n\nDo play with her anus \u2013 again, providing she\u2019s cool with it, which hopefully she is.  It works like this: While your tongue is dancing on her clit, rub some of her juices around her little hole (cute name, huh?) This double stimulation is very arousing to her, and she\u2019s concentrating on your tongue so much that your finger doesn\u2019t matter, it just feels good. As she gets closer to climax, continue to rub around it until she\u2019s breathing heavily\u2026getting very close.  Now \u2013 stick your finger in the little hole just a bit, as far as the first digit perhaps, no more.  In my experience, there\u2019s a very good chance that this will set her orgasm off like a time bomb, bucking her hips like they were on fire.  Yes, the feeling of your finger in her ass will make her cum much harder \u2013 you\u2019ll see.\n\nDon\u2019t neglect her nipples either.  With your tongue on her clit, reach up, over, whatever, and gently hold her breasts.  As she gets closer, circle her aureoles lightly, as I mentioned earlier.  But this time, as her breathing and body language announce her impending orgasm, squeeze her nipples.  Believe me, some ladies will save you the trouble and do it themselves.  They know the secret, that this extra stimulation will break the bank, sending them crashing into climax at warp speed.  Her moans and cries will prove me right.\n\nDo try different positions.  They keep things from getting stale as a result of repetition.  If you, as a lover, always keep her guessing what\u2019s next, what\u2019s new and what\u2019s different, you\u2019ll always be at the top of her hit list.  She\u2019ll always look forward to making love to you.  If you like the standard position, on your stomach while she lies on her back with legs spread, that\u2019s fine.  I like it too.  I had a girlfriend who lived for this position.  She tensed her legs so tight when she came she nearly cracked my head like a walnut.  And I loved every minute of it.  But try this: You\u2019re lying on your back while she straddles your face, essentially the \"sit on my face\" position.  It enables her to grind her pussy into your face as hard as she likes, which is always a treat.  It also lets you easily reach up and play with her breasts.  Holding hands is nice and tender, too, if you\u2019re into that.  Another favorite of mine is eating her from behind while she\u2019s on all fours in the doggie position.  And here\u2019s a great one: she\u2019s sitting in a chair while you kneel in front of her, happily lapping her juices.  She can keep her legs spread with her feet on the floor, or place them over your shoulders.  Standing up works, too, with you under her spread legs.  Careful, she may go wobbly in the knees when she comes.\n\nDon\u2019t think I forgot about the 69 position.  I think it\u2019s fabulous, with one drawback. Certainly, the more aroused you get, the more feeling and passion you\u2019ll put into your end of the bargain.  But the closer you get to orgasm, either you or she will lose your concentration while you focus on how good it feels to you.  Not always, I\u2019ve known at least one girl who would keep giving me outrageous head right through her orgasm.  And you can be sure I\u2019m licking like a madman when I\u2019m cumming.  It\u2019s just great to put all your energy into pleasing her, isn\u2019t it?\n\nDo hum.  It means more than you enjoying your efforts.  When you hold her clit in your lips and hum, it works like a small vibrator, which is exactly what it is.  The vibrations will spread from her clit to all areas, and make her tingle like a tuning fork.  It may seem odd at first, but not when she feels it.  You hum, she\u2019ll sing.\n\nWhen she\u2019s about to cum, you know you\u2019re doing the right thing.  So don\u2019t change your approach just as she\u2019s gonna blow.  If you\u2019re sucking on her clit and she\u2019s squirming and shaking, her breath coming in gasps, don\u2019t suddenly switch to licking her clit with broad strokes.  You\u2019ll kill the flow.  If she\u2019s just about there\u2026just keep doing what you\u2019re doing until she cums.  Variety is great, but when you\u2019re about to score a touchdown, don\u2019t change the play.  Gee, you think they discuss this in locker room pep talks?\n\nHer clit, which you know by now is like a mini penis, is the center of her universe.  So make sure that you do get the best access you can to it.  How?  By pulling the clitoral hood out of the way.  To some degree, the clitoral hood, which protects her clit like an umbrella protects you from the rain, will move out of the way on its own.  But not all the way.  Therefore, take your thumb and from the top of the hood, pull up so that her lovely little clit is fully exposed.  Do it in the light at first, so you can see what its like when you\u2019re in a dark bedroom, closet, prison cell, basement\u2026you know, the usual places.\n\nAbove all, do go for it!  If you remember just one thing, it\u2019s to lick, fondle and suck your way to her heart.  There\u2019s no downside to giving her oral sex.  No taboo, no mystery.  If you want to be considered a good lover, it\u2019s got to be in your repertoire.  You\u2019ll love it, believe me, just love it.\n\nLastly, since I largely have only my own experiences to draw from, I\u2019d truly appreciate any feedback about different methods or stories of your own.  Especially from women.  I\u2019ve often said, if I can do what I do  just a little better, or try one new way that works, I\u2019m thrilled.\n\nI sincerely hoped you\u2019ve gained something from my article.  I write only for the love of giving others enjoyment.  Please read my other stories on the site, too.  Good luck!"
