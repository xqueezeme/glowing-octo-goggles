        "This is my Christmas Gift to all my fellow editors :)\n\n\nIn my time as an editor I\u2019ve received stories from people of several continents, male and female.  The stories have all been varied and of different lengths (who says size doesn\u2019t matter!!!!!!!), some good, some bad, some totally awful and some absolutely awesome!\n\nWhen I first sat down to do this, all I was doing was making a list to myself about all the things a writer does that really pisses me off.  I found many more irritations than I initially expected and I wondered if I should make an essay of this.  The more I was writing, the more I thought that other editors would recognize the same faults in writers they have worked with or are now working with.  Then I really thought and realized that I could make it into a how-to list for writers so they know what not to do when comes the time to work with an editor; whether they realize it or not.\n\nSo here is my list, in no particular order, of what YOU, as a writer, should consider never EVER doing before engaging with an editor.\n\nI hope this also raises a laugh or two among my fellow editors.  As you can see I resisted the temptation to name those erring writers who were the inspiration behind my list.\n\n\n\u2022\tHave an inability to accept criticism and comments;\n(Why do they ask us if they don\u2019t want to hear it???)\n\n\u2022\tThink that you\u2019re story is so good that you\u2019re doing a favour to the editor in sending it to them;\n(Not all writers can be \u201cRGJOHN\u201d or \u201cMASTER_VASSAGO\u201d)\n\n\u2022\tAsk for advice but don\u2019t take any;\n(Self explanatory)\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t do the correction(s) suggested by the editor;\n(They post their story anyway and then complain to us that they don\u2019t get good reviews)\n\n\u2022\tComplain when the editor tells you what is wrong with your story or what its lacking;\n(Even the contest winners are not right every time)\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t re-read what you have written before sending it to the editor; Make him/her double his/her work load correcting minor mistakes that could have been easily done by you;\n(What else is the \u201cgrammar and spelling\u201d function in Word good for?)\n\n\u2022\tWrite a story so poorly written that it\u2019s a total waste of time for the editor to go through it;\n(Did our education system really let people down so badly:(?)\n\n\u2022\tHave no depth of characters or interaction between said characters;\n(I know it\u2019s primarily a sex story site but really\u2026!!!)\n\n\u2022\tBelieve that the editor is your \u201cslave\u201d and will do everything for you;\n(You wouldn\u2019t believe what one of them wanted me to do :O!)\n\n\u2022\tThink the editor is only a proof-reader and won\u2019t accept that he/she has things to say;\n(Yeah sure we are puppets and only there for them to use when the need arise!!!)\n\n\u2022\tExpect the editor to do a total rewrite of your work and don\u2019t even say thank you when the final product is done;\n(Has anyone else had to change ENTIRE paragraphs?)\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t read the editor profile correctly and send them a story that they have no interest in editing;\n(Don\u2019t you just hate receiving a story in a category your profile specifically excluded?)\n\n\u2022\tBe careless how you dress and undress your character;\n(They put a hand up her skirt and into her panties but take her jeans down and discover she\u2019s sans panty :-\\)\n\n\u2022\tSend the wrong type of file even though the editor clearly mentioned the type of files he wants to receive;\n(Self explanatory)\n\n\u2022\t Ask for recommendations of what the editor thinks is GOOD writing and then go and trash those writers just because the editor said they were better then you (YOU know who you are don\u2019t you?);\n(It\u2019s funny how writers I\u2019ve recommended suddenly get \u201canonymous\u201d negative feedback when previously they only had praise from everyone)\n\n\u2022\tAsk the editor for storylines and/or ideas and pass them as your own;\n(One of my \u201cformer\u201d writers changed a whole scene in one of his stories using the idea I gave him and his book was published without an appropriate acknowledgement)\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t appreciate and acknowledge the work the editor did for you;\n(A simple thank you does good doesn\u2019t it \uf04a?)\n\n\u2022\tChange the name of your character halfway through the story;\n(One minute she\u2019s Julie and the next she\u2019s Suzy??????  But at least Dave hasn\u2019t become Sheila without a sex-change operation :O)\n\n\u2022\tFail to recognize that some words just aren\u2019t sexy;\n(Apologies to British readers but \u201ctrousers\u201d just isn\u2019t sexy.  We all have our pet peeves so I won\u2019t name them but can anybody REALLY like \u201cpoop chute?\u201d)\n\n\u2022\tBe inconsistent in the way you describe your character;\n(How can their character be a total slut on one page and yet the next is all sweet and innocent; pushing the envelope so far as depicting her as a virgin is totally beyond my understanding!!!)\n\n\u2022\tMake derogatory comments about the editor in retaliation to the aforementioned  editor\u2019s comments/criticisms about your story;\n(Funny how some writers regress to childhood when they don\u2019t like what you have to say!)\n\n\n\nThis list could go on and on like that.  But after all I\u2019m an editor and I\u2019ve edited it! :P"
