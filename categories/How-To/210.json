        "It is a totally natural masculine desire to watch the feminine unveil herself. How do you think those strip clubs keep in business? If you've never been into one (I haven't either, although I admit, I'm curious\u2014one of these days!) it doesn't matter, because you already know how to unveil your feminine mystery to your lover! You don't need to know how to dance, and you don't need a video to teach you, and you don't need to watch a woman strip in order to know how to do it for your lover. It is an innate, unique gift that the feminine can give, and with just a few simple ideas, and more importantly, a bolster to your culturally-shaken self-confidence, I know you will be off and running, and your lover will be hot and panting!\n\nOur society has taught us that scarcity is the norm, that we never have enough, that we never are enough. This is a false belief that we have been fed, and that we continue to feed ourselves. The truth is that we are abundantly, naturally beautiful, sexy and sensual! The scary part is believing it, you say? Well, I have scarier news\u2014you have to act on it first, before you start believing. In other words, you have to face whatever fears and issues about your body or your feminine nature that may have been imparted onto you, release them, and let yourself go\u2014you may really surprise yourself, and your lover, if you do!\n\nThe Masculine Perspective\n\nTo him, you are already a goddess. The feminine is pure light, drawing his eye, making his heart race. The masculine loves to be tempted (remember Eve and that apple?) and believe it or not, he doesn't necessarily want to walk in and see you naked and splayed out for him (although sometimes that isn't a bad thing)\u2014a deeper part of him wants to see you unveil yourself. He wants to watch you opening, like a flower. \n\nThe feminine likes the straightforward direction of the masculine, and so often doesn't understand what the draw of the \"tease\" is, in \"striptease.\" Believe me when I tell you that the masculine doesn't only like it\u2014he needs it, and he absolutely thrives on it. If you want your man to respond, lead him into temptation. (And you won't leave him dangling there\u2014but we'll get to that later!)\n\nUnveiling yourself to him is a process. This isn't a quick trip, it's a long and lingering journey. You don't want to just drop all the veils all at once\u2014figuratively (or literally) speaking. You are going to lead him along, tempt him with luscious curves a bit at a time, and then cover them back up. Whatever you choose to wear, (and we'll talk about costuming and clothes later, too) you will want to offer peeks, hints, a little bit at a time, working up to a fuller view.\n\nIf you want to add another dimension to the tease, create the ground rules just like they have in the strip clubs\u2014he doesn't get to touch you. That \"rule\" isn't just for legalities' sake, or just for the safety of the girls in the clubs. It also creates an air of mystery and temptation, when you can touch him, but he can't touch you!\n\nPreparation\n\nFirst, you have to concern yourself about what to wear. You will probably want to spend some time in advance thinking about it, and most definitely cater to his tastes. There are men who love fishnets but hate whalenets. There are men who adore white cotton panties, and men who think they're for old grannies. There are men who love latex, and men who can't stand it. If this is your first time doing this, then try to tap into what flavors of the feminine he has a natural affinity for (you can experiment with other flavors of the feminine later!) You can play into his fantasies, if he has them\u2014a school girl, a secretary, a teacher, a prostitute. \n\nAs you choose your clothes, remember that you are going to be unveiling yourself a little at a time. Layers are very important, and you may want to choose fabric that is mesh or sheer, or tight, or go with something like crotchless panties, which have natural openings. You're pretty safe with black, in terms of colors, or even red. If he doesn't like things on the \"slutty\" side, you might want to go with white. Mixing the \"whore\" and the \"angel\" dynamic is often popular, dark outer garments with white undergarments. Some men even like it the other way around, especially if your \"naughty\" black bra is showing through your sheer \"virginal\" white blouse. Some men even like the mixture of a sexy black bra, and white cotton panties. Remember to cater to his tastes. \n\nYou want clothing with lots and lots of buttons, or very looooong zippers. You want openings that take longer to get undone, to prolong the tease. Boots with long zippers are very sexy to take off, but they should have high heels. If you have a problem with high heels in general, try platforms, with wide heels. They give the same illusion but are easier to move in! \n\nDon't wear pants, or even shorts\u2014skirts are the way to go, but nothing below the knee. Mini skirts are great, if he likes the slutty look, because you can bend over and show off without having to lift your skirt. You should wear a front-hook bra, because it doesn't leave you awkwardly reaching back, trying to get yourself unhooked, and it offers so many more opportunities to tease him. Besides, there is nothing like breasts finally spilling out of a front-hook bra for devouring masculine eyes! \n\nSexy panties are a must, of course, that goes without saying, and something sheer or mesh is fine, but even if he likes thongs (and some men don't!) don't wear them for this\u2014they are too immediately revealing. Stockings are very sexy, but unless he has a serious pantyhose fetish, I'd stay away from them. They are hard to remove in a very revealing way, and just don't look as sexy as thigh-highs, or garters and stockings. \n\nYour last accessories should be jewelry and make-up. You shouldn't go overboard in the make-up department, but definitely do something to make your eyes stand out, to make your lips a little darker, your cheeks a little more rosy. Use a perfume that you know he likes and apply it liberally\u2014you want to tempt all his senses. Jewelry shouldn't be big and clunky, but rather sparkly and shining. Anything that catches the light when it moves is a plus! Some of the sexiest jewelry are things like belly chains, anklets, arm bands, and nipple rings (you can buy ones that aren't pierced). \n\nSetting the Mood\n\nYou don't want to strip in a dark room (even though part of you may think you should!) This is about revealing yourself to him, so you want to give him the best possible view. That means good lighting, so he can see every part of you as you unveil it. You don't need to shine a police-style spotlight on yourself or anything, just make sure you have enough lighting to see the details. \n\nNow, stop hyperventilating! It doesn't matter what you think about yourself, what size you are, how old you are, none of that matters, because your lover is attracted to your body, and he won't be looking for all of the flaws that you see\u2014he will be reveling in the perfection of your feminine form. Trust me on this\u2014he thinks you're hot, and he wants to see you naked. This is your leap of faith, remember?\n\nYou are going to want to use a chair for him to sit in. A kitchen chair works great for this. Make sure you leave enough space so you can walk all the way around the chair he is sitting in (you don't want it back against a wall.) You will also want another chair (or a stool of some kind) for you to use, as well. \n\nYou want to choose good music, something sexy, with a beat. Something that you can dance to! Belly dancing music is actually good for this, but any rock/pop music with a good beat will work. Instrumental stuff is preferable, because it's less distracting. It all depends on the mood you're setting, of course, so choose accordingly. You can even burn your own CD of songs to strip to, or, if you can, program your CD player to play just the songs you want, if it gives you that option. \n\nNow, when you're ready to do this, you should tell him, maybe over dinner, that you have something planned for later. But don't tell him what. Leave him hanging. Just give him a coy smile when he presses you about it. \n\nWhen it's time, still in your every day clothes, tell him that you want him to go into the other room and strip down to his underwear or boxers or maybe just a pair of shorts, his choice. When he comes back, ask him to sit in the chair, and run down the rules with him. \n\nThe rules are up to you, but as I said, it can be more of a tease if he isn't allowed to touch you, so you can tell him that he should keep his hands at his sides unless you tell him differently, and that he can turn his head, but his back needs to stay against the chair. You can add the rule that he isn't allowed to talk, if you feel it will create more tension, or you might want to let him respond to you. Feel into your lover and decide what is best. Also remember that his responses may ignite you, or they may make you feel more self-conscious, so take that into account as well! \n\nThen leave him there, telling him you'll be back in a minute, and go get dressed. \n\nThe Unveiling\n\nNow is the moment of truth. Whatever you believe about your body, however ridiculous or self-conscious you may feel, you need to remember that you are a beautiful, feminine form, and to him, you are a goddess. If you relax into that thought, it will be easier to do this. Remember that this is a gift for him. He is excited by you, and he thinks you are incredibly sexy. Don't doubt that. You'll see it in his eyes when you come into the room, you just have to take that leap. Ready? Now, it's time to drive him crazy!\n\nWhen you come into the room, walk like you know you're beautiful\u2014because you are. Slow, sensuous, sexy, slinky, that's you. Start the music and circle his chair, and let him get a good look at your outfit, whatever it is you've chosen. Look into his eyes, see what you're doing to him. It will give you courage. \n\nWhen you move behind his chair, lean over and brush up against him, let your hair fall over him, if it's long, and tell him that you are going to unveil yourself to him. Or tell him that you're going to dance for him. Or tell him you're going to strip for him. Go with what you know he wants to hear. \n\nCome around to the front of his chair and turn around so your back is to him. Put your hands on your hips and give him a pouty, sultry look over your shoulder. Or blow him a kiss. Turn around to face him and bend over with your hands on your knees and let him get a glimpse down the V of your shirt. \n\nYou want to keep moving\u2014it keeps his eyes drawn to you. They don't have to be large, grand movements, just make sure some part of you is moving, your hips swaying, your hands moving over your body. You can tease him by straddling one of his legs and rubbing yourself over his thigh for a moment. Don't stay too long, though, and if he touches you or reaches to touch you, remind him of the rules. \n\nYou want to give him visual access to every inch of you, so don't stay in one position long. Once in a while, switch it up and move behind him. Your heart will skip a beat when you see your lover straining his head to see what you're doing back there. Run a hand through his hair. Whisper something in his ear. \"Do you like what you see?\" Then move out in front of him again, still moving your hips to the music. \n\nRemember that the whole world swings on a woman's hips. It is the seat and soul of your power. Rock your hips, roll them, sway them, shimmy them. You want to move as if you are the most graceful, sexiest woman in the world\u2014and to him, you are! You may want to dance for him a while, moving back and forth, closer to him so you can touch him\u2014and not with your hands, this time. Now, you want to work on touching him with different parts of your body\u2014your crotch, your breasts, your ass. Rub up against him, wiggle, squirm, make soft sighs and noises when you do. You can touch his cock, too (it's fun to find out just how he's responding!) but remember to only do it briefly, just to tease him. \n\nWhen you are ready to start unveiling yourself, begin slowly. Draw everything out. Don't just undo your entire button-down, tied-at-the-waist school girl blouse in one fell swoop! Unbutton a button, and then pull your shirt over a little, to let him see the swell of your breast. Do that on the other side, too. You little tease! That's just how to do it. Unbutton another button, and show him a little more flesh. And then a little more. Then move to another part of the body, change it up. \n\nYou can use the second chair or stool to put your leg up on, to bend over, to straddle. You can go all \"Flashdance\" on the chair (without all the water, of course.) You can sit on the chair and pretend to ride it. You can sit sideways and kick your legs up (make sure you have a good hold on the chair\u2014falling during an unveiling is a bit embarrassing) and turn toward him to straddle it. Show him those panties under your skirt. Then bend forward and let him glimpse your breasts again. Lick your lips, wink at him, purse your mouth like you want to kiss him. If you think it's dramatic and over-the-top, do it anyway. It's what works! \n\nYou want to touch all those parts of yourself that you are slowly revealing, and you want to do it before they're unclothed, too. Cup your breasts and press them together, if you have enough flesh there to do that. If not, then just pinch your nipples through your bra, make them stand up for him. Rub your hands over the swell of your ass. Put your leg up on the chair, and slide one hand up, from ankle to thigh. You can pull up your skirt, and rub yourself through your panties, too. Show him all those places you like to be touched that feels good\u2014and let him see and hear it on your face. Really give him a show!\n\nKeep tempting him, giving him peeks. You can remove stockings and boots or shoes with your leg up on the chair for effect. When you have your shirt undone, don't just open it wide\u2014turn around, and slip it off a shoulder at a time, looking back at him. Then, turn his way again, but hold your shirt over your bra and tease him some more before you toss it aside. \n\nRemember to rub and touch any part of your body that you've just revealed. Unzip your skirt while you're facing him (side zippers are perfect) and wiggle it down, then turn and bend over as you slip it off. You can slip your panties down a little to show him your ass, but pull them back up again before turning around and facing him to tease him some more. \n\nYou should touch him, too, after each reveal, so remember to move in and rub this newly exposed flesh against him\u2014your breasts still in your bra or your ass still covered by your panties. When you do finally remove your bra, shimmy your shoulders, and shake your breasts. Come close to him and do it, don't be shy, but keep them just out of his reach.\n\nWhen you are down to just your panties, straddle his leg again, and rub your crotch up and down, back and forth. When you finally do remove your panties, let him wait a while before you turn around and bend over so he can see you. (And you have remembered to trim or shave, right?) You may want to put your hands back there and spread everything open for a moment so he has a good peek, but don't stay too long. You can move anywhere you want, crawl on the floor, kneel in front of him, lay down and scissor your legs in the air, and then spread them wide, just for a moment, before bringing them back together again. \n\nPose for him. Dance for him. And talk to him. When you touch yourself, moan out loud. Ask him if he likes what you're doing. Slip your hand into your panties and tell him, \"I'm getting so wet.\" Tweak your nipples, and cup your breasts, offer them to him just out of his reach and ask, \"Do you like them?\" You can even ask him what he wants to see next, but never give him exactly what he wants. Remember, this is about teasing him! \n\nNow, when you have worked him into a fevered pitch, and his eyes are bright with lust and he is breathing hard, now is the time to let him watch you touch yourself and make yourself cum for him. You can lay on the floor and spread your legs, put your feet up on his knees if you want. You can bend over, if he likes that view, and finger yourself from behind. You can use his bare thigh, if you like, and make a sloppy, wet mess all over. He'll love it, trust me. \n\nAnd finally, you get to give him what he wants\u2014whatever he wants. Offer it to him. If he wants a blowjob there in the chair, give it to him. If he wants to fuck you doggie-style on the floor, go for it. If you wants to take you to bed, you can do that, too. He will probably be very aroused at this point, and whatever happens will be very passionate. You will probably be feeling extremely sexy and willing at this point, too, after seeing his response to your unveiling.\n\nThis is your gift to him\u2014and to yourself. Remember that it is about revealing not just your body, but your heart as well. Put all of your love and devotion, all of your passion and desire, into your eyes. Give him your heart while you are revealing yourself to him\u2014worship him like a god. Unveiling isn't just about the physical, especially when it takes place between lovers. It is also a symbolic act, stripping away your layers and making yourself vulnerable to him. That's one reason it requires such a leap of faith. But once you do it, and you see and feel his response, you'll love how it changes you. It will make you want to do it again and again\u2014just think of the possibilities! "
