        "Thanks to everyone who has commented and offered suggestions for corrections and additions. \n\nSSW\n\n*****\n\nI have been a fan of Literotica for over a decade, most of the time as a contributing writer. I even joined the Volunteer Editor program to share my skills with other authors. Not even getting into the issues with POV, punctuation, plot, character development, continuity, sentence structure, verb tense, or if a story even makes sense, I find myself saddened every time I read a submission where the wrong word is used. Whether it is from actual ignorance of the correct word or just a lack of proofreading, these types of errors tend to stand out more to the reader than any other grammatical mistake.\n\nFrom my experience, many claim they do not care about bad grammar on Lit. Writing or reading it. They are here for one thing and one thing only, and they can overlook when a wrong word is used...even multiple times by the same author. That's great for some. But I'm sure there are others who share my opinion that a little extra time spent proofreading can only improve the story and potentially draw more readers who will become your fans. Likewise, bad grammar can do the reverse.\n\nThe \"list\" started as a way to vent on my Bio page. It was short (less than 10 words), and is actually prevalent on the Internet in various memes (usually depicting \"There, Their, They're\"). A few have gone the way of adding the word \"fucking\" to the correct usage, which I found was abso-fucking-lutely brilliant. I added a few more commonly misused words after reading a story where the author had the lead character constantly \"wander\" about things in her head, and another where a character was always \"loosing\" something. The more I read, the more I edited, and the more my readers submitted their own suggestions, the longer the list grew until I had to modify the rest of my Bio to fit the character requirements. Now that it's become the length of a short submission, it's earned the right to be promoted to my list of works.\n\nSpellcheck can't find incorrect word usage, only misspellings. And even having your document-writing program check grammar isn't infallible. When in doubt, ask someone else with a fresh pair of eyes to review your story. That's why there is the Volunteer Editor program and the Literotica Forum. We're here to help.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is \"A Fucking English Lesson\" for the grammatically impaired. Due to space constraints, only the basic or most common definitions are provided.\n\n*I'm into anal...when it comes to being grammatically correct!*\n\n\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab \u00a7 \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n#
