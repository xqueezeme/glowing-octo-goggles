        "It may seem strange to hear a girl and a young one at that, post anything about foot sex. Now, I am not claiming to be an expert on the subject but thanks to an encounter I had with a teacher when I was in high school, I have developed a strong foot fetish or at least a strong appreciation for the foot fetish. I have also had input from guys and foot sex experiences which have helped raise my interest and excitement. My foot fetish isn't that I like guys' feet or even girls' feet, but I am aroused by guys or girls liking and wanting my feet. Technically, I guess you would call it a \"reverse foot fetish.\" I think that control and maybe dominance is where my excitement lies. After taking thorough mental notes from that experience and from dating some foot loving guys, I am going to share with you what I think guys like and the types of sex involving the feet from a girl's point of view. If you are not aroused by feet, then this post is probably not for you. If you have anything to add or suggest, feel free to email me. \n\n*****\n\nWhy the feet? \n\nI believe foot fetish guys enjoy the total submission of a nice cute or sexy pair of feet because, first, I believe the feet represent the \"lowest\" part of a female yet have a very distinctive feminine quality. That feminine quality separates our feet from guys' feet. We are the ones who have the smaller more dainty features, we are the only ones who wear toe nail polish, we are the only ones who wear nylons or heels, and so forth. When I say lowest, I am referring to the closest to the ground by proximity. Just by anatomical location alone, feet get the \"dirtiest\" quicker than any other part of the female anatomy. A girl could walk across the yard barefoot or wear a pair of heels in the heat for 5 minutes and her feet would already be dirty or sweaty. The fact that a guy could feel himself completely committed to that submission, is what I believe heightens his arousal to it. If females walked on their hands, we might be discussing why so many guys have a \"hand fetish.\" \n\nAs I just stated, guys who are aroused by feet, are sexually excited by the submission they feel in themselves for being aroused in the first place. I also believe the proverbial \"worship at someone's feet\" or \"kneeling at someone's feet\" show that total submission as in the traditional \"master vs. slave\" relationship. Subconsciously, guys that have a foot fetish, want to be dominated by a girl's feet. They want to be close to them and will do anything they can to please them. This is why most foot guys love to \"worship\" a pair of cute feet. Using all their senses, whether its sight, smell, touch, taste, or even hearing heels clicking across a hard floor, they can't help but relate that to their sexual impulses. This is why, I believe that guys get really kinky when it comes to feet and some even go over the top. \n\nWe girls also need to remove the stigma that a guy who likes feet is weird or a pervert. Nothing could be further from the truth. If he loves feet, is that any different that if he loved your breasts, or vagina, or ass? Sure it's not a traditional \"sexual\" body part but that just means it's not traditional to us. We girls might not think like that, so therefore we might think it's strange. Is it any stranger than if we liked big cocks, or nice smiles, or big thighs, or tight asses, or muscular bodies? Absolutely not. If a guy likes your feet, then flaunt them. A guy's number one sexual sense is sight. He likes what he sees. We wear tight pants, low cut tops, wear makeup, show skin along with many other visual apparel, so let's show off our sexy feet as well and don't discriminate against a guy who might find them sexually appealing. \n\nIf our feet can intensify his sexual gratification and his orgasm, he will be a much happier mate and at what price to us? He will in turn intensify our sexual gratification. I have watched television in bed and had a boyfriend, fuck my feet and have a powerful orgasm and I really didn't have to do anything but let it happen. I even made him get his own lotion and a towel. Here is my point, he wants to do that stuff! He wants to be totally submissive to your feet! You could tell him to go clean the kitchen before he is allowed to fuck your feet and it will be done in a matter of minutes. I am not suggesting, if he is totally selfish and wants no connection with you or isn't interested in pleasing you sexually, then we should give into his fetish. I am saying, using your feet can be a win/win situation with pleasing your man and help satisfy that sexual craving along with us keeping some control. \n\nYou have to start by keeping those feet looking good\n\nThe first step in using your feet as part of your sex life is cleanliness. You need to keep your feet clean and bathed. Now, I know some guys like \"dirty\" feet but there are two types of dirty feet and the type that foot fetish guys enjoy are the ones that have some wear or dirt on the bottoms not the kind that are unclean. \"Unclean\" is if you haven't showered in two days and \"dirty\" is if you have some dark wear from your flip flops or they are sweaty from wearing your boots at work. Cleanliness also keeps your feet sanitary and that is important because if he is a licker or sucker, he will stay healthy and we can get more into that later. \n\nThe second step in preparing to use your feet as part of your sex life is grooming. You must have well-groomed and presentable feet. The toenails need to be prepared and they need to be sexy with toenail polish, French tips, or just naturally shown. Your toenails should be trimmed neatly and without fungus or discoloration. Your feet need to be smooth and without blemishes such as callouses or bumps. Girls, we need to make our feet just as desirable as our body and faces and to do this we need to put time in our feet with pedicures and products just as we would with anything else. A guy really appreciates and is aroused by the effort we make in keeping our feet in good shape.\n\nThe third step in using your feet as part of your sex life is flexibility. No, I'm not referring to the ability to stretch but I'm talking about adapting your feet to your guy's taste. For your lover to truly enjoy your feet, you need to simply, adapt your feet to \"what he likes.\" I do know that guys with a foot fetish are very specific in their \"likes.\" Those specifics can range from particular colors of nail polish, to certain shoes, heels, socks, nylons, etc. I will discuss more on the specific of each one later in this writing. \n\nTo summarize, girls, you should keep your feet clean, groomed, and flexible. Yes, we will always mimic the latest styles and fashions. That is what we do but we can always make time to please our man with our feet. It is a small gesture and will make him so happy and sexually satisfied. The nice aspect about feet is there is such a variety of things that can be done to spice up your \"foot sex life.\" Hopefully, I can help you realize some of those. \n\nA little bit of teasing goes a looooong way\n\nWhen I use the word \"teasing\" I am not just referring to flaunting your feet without deliverance. I am referring to a girl's ability to start, continue, or enhance her lover's interest and arousal in using her feet as part of her sexual persona. The key to good teasing has three components. The first, is it needs to be sincere. There is nothing a guy hates worse than if he feels you are teasing but your heart and sincerity aren't in it and you are just doing it for his purposes. The second component needs to be the element of surprise. If he has to tell you when and what to say, then that destroys the spontaneity and excitement. The last component to good teasing is variety. Don't get caught doing the same thing over and over. Mix it up and sometimes just be flat out kinky and off the wall. He will absolutely go nuts. He needs to reciprocate those components back to us in our desires. \n\nThere are several ways to tease your man and like I mentioned before, use all his senses, but because his number one sense is vision, never stop showing him what he is missing and his reward. Not only does your \"foot man\" want to be teased, he also likes to hear you talk about your feet, shoes, socks, hose, or situations that involve any or all of them. Treat your feet like they are their own person with feelings just like a guy treats his cock. I have the \"Jeopardy\" teasing philosophy which means I like to phrase much of my teasing in a form of a question. I am going to discuss several examples, that I have personally used, of how you could tease your man with your feet. \n\n1.You are sitting there wincing and rubbing your own feet when you ask, \"Honey, I'm not used to my heels yet (any shoe that you wore that day) and my feet are so sore and tense, do you think you can give me one of your slow foot massages that you are so good at?\" Then you point your foot at him. \n\n2.You come home for the evening wearing your leather boots or heels and you have your guy, unzip them for you, take them off and you ask, \"Do my feet smell ok? That cool air feels so good, my feet were so cramped and sweaty.\" You offer your feet up to his face where he doesn't have a choice but to inhale them. \n\n3.You and your lover are eating and conversing at a table while facing each other. You slyly remove your shoe and slowly take your foot and first, play \"footsie\" with his foot, proceed up his leg, and eventually ending up on his crotch through his pants. You then proceed to give him a \"cock massage\" with your foot. I have had a guy actually cum in his pants from this. You can also do that while you are sitting together on the couch, bed, or floor together. \n\n4.You want your man to go shopping with you and he is whining around and generally doesn't want to go. You bargain with him, \"If you go, you can pick out some leggings, or hose or shoes for me. I will let you try them on me.\" When you get there, you look at those things together and let him give his opinions on what he likes and try on several pairs for him.\n\n5.When you are putting on your socks or hose, lift your leg skyward, point your toe, and slide them on real slow while he watches. You won't have to say a word, his eyes and mouth will speak for you. Remember, a lot of toe pointing is a good thing to a guy who likes feet. \n\n6.You say, \"Baby, my feet are cold. Would you suck on my toes and warm them up, pleeease?\"\n\n7.You arrive home from getting your pedicure and continually ask your guy how it looks with lots of holding your feet in positions he can see them. Say things like, \"Honey, lookie at this. Are you sure they look good?\"\n\n8.Your man is in bed sleeping and quietly walk in and lay next to him head to toe. You get his cock out and either start sucking or stroking it while you put your feet in his face to wake him up! He won't mind. \n\n9.Just out of the blue, you point your foot at your guy and ask, \"Honey, would you jack off on my feet? That is so sexy\" or \"Honey, go get the lube and fuck my feet. That is so hot and I love watching you do it.\"\n\n10.Your man is fucking you in the missionary position and without asking, you mash your feet in his face and demand him, \"Kiss my feet while you shoot your load in me\" or \"Suck on my toes while you cum in me\" or \"Baby, will you pull out and cum all over my toes when you're ready?\" \n\n11.While you're jacking him off, whip off one of your shoes and command, \"I want you to cum in or on my shoe.\"\n\n12.Allow him to get his phone out and conduct a little photo shoot of your feet, dressed and posed as he wishes. This is a great way to tease him. \n\nThese are just 12 out of hundreds of ways you can initiate or tease your foot loving guy and enhance his sexual arousal. If your man loves feet, then use that as your weapon. Be creative and kinky. He will also be more cognizant of your own needs as well. \n\nPaying attention to the details\n\nEarlier in this writing, I mentioned that foot fetish guys have very specific tastes in what they like about feet. The easiest way to find out is simply, ask. When he tells you, don't ridicule or act as if anything your guy likes is strange or weird. Of course we girls love to have the latest fad or fashion and we will wear that in public. However, you can make your guy feel special if you allow him to pick out your footwear for an evening once in a while. Of course you may have to limit the choices so it will match your outfit. Now, let's discuss the details to each type of foot fetish. \n\nThe most common foot fetish is bare feet. I have known many guys who love a girl's bare feet. Now there are many parts to a girl's foot. Some of the specifics to a guy's taste that I have witnessed, are the toes or the valley under the toes before you get to the pads. Other specific areas are the pads, arches, heels, ankles (I know they aren't really the feet but I knew a guy who was obsessed with girl's ankles while wearing ankle socks), top of the foot, the sole of the foot and many types of angles for each. Some examples are, a guy may like to see a girl's foot while it is up over her head while she lies on her stomach, or a girl's foot lying on the ground, upside down so he can see the soles, or a guy who likes to see the toes spread out or scrunched up. Many guys love to see the side angle of the foot with the heels upward as you would see in a pair of high heels. There are many more and that is why you should ask your man what he desires and for him to be very specific. \n\nToenail display also would technically fit into the bare feet category but because there are so many ways you can prepare them, I am giving them their separate section. It all starts with length of nails. Some guys love longer toenails whereas some love them to be very short. I prefer to keep mine short to average. Foot fetish guys who love toenail polish are usually particular about color. I have known those guys who love the dark colors that represent rebellion, Emo, or Goth such as black, navy blue, or hunter green. I have known guys who love the neon or \"carefree\" light colors such as lime green, yellow, sky blue or hot pink. Other colors include the traditional mature feminine cherry red, maroon, purple, or dark pink to the modern polishes like glitter, bling, or combo colors. You name the type or color, it is out there. A popular polish currently is picture painting or picture addition. Some of the salons can do just about anything and everything and the more different and feminine, the more foot guys love it! It truly is art and my salon girl is amazing. Some guys like no polish. They enjoy the natural look of a foot with plain toenails. That is why we girls need to keep them well-groomed because polish can hide lots of flaws. Finally, there are French tips or press-on nails. French tips have become popular and accentuate femininity because of the white tips and the glossy enamel. We will always prefer the top fashion and what promotes our personality or maybe even what matches our weekend outfit but it doesn't hurt to allow your man to choose how you wear your nails from time to time. \n\nI call the next section \"blinging those feet out.\" Bling is anything that spices up a look, usually with something that sparkles, glitters, or dresses it up. There are foot guys who love the jewelry like toe rings, chains, and anklets. They can be silver, gold, black or any type of personal preference as long as it blings out the foot. I have had a couple guys love my sterling silver S swirl toe ring. Tattoos are another form of expression and bling that can dress up an ankle or foot. There are some foot guys who go really crazy for tattoos whether they are in color or black and white. \n\nThe next foot fetish element is socks. Some guys just love the different types of socks that girls wear. The first difference is the length which range from knee socks to calf length to ankle to no-show. The sock encases and protects the foot which guys associate with his sex property and from my experience, it seems as though the knee high sock is the top preference. If you want to get your man's attention, wear a pair of knee high tube socks with stripes at the top, panties, with a full length football jersey and nothing else. He will be putty in your hands. The next specific quality about socks are the material. This makes a difference to a foot fetish guy. Sock material can range from the traditional thicker cotton athletic sock to thick furry or fuzzy types to dress socks that include argyle and finally the thinner ones made from lycra, nylon, or spandex like you would find in trouser socks. Guys love that tight, slick feel and you can rub your feet on your guy's face as you jack him off or order him to jack himself off. There are now toe socks where each individual toe is separated like a glove and toe fetish guys like these. Color can also excite your man. Many guys like the snow white socks because white represents purity and innocence like you would find in a school girls outfit or a low cut white sock with a pair of canvas tennis shoes. Some guys get off on the different colors just like girls wear on their nails. There are also socks with many different designs such as stripes, polka dots, zig zags, flowers, along with many additional varieties. Socks house your feet and your feet turn your man on and therefore your socks can turn your man on. \n\nLet's discuss nylon or hose. From my experience, foot guys either love them or hate them without much in the middle. Foot guys who are pro hose, once again love the material, encasement and the ability to see the foot through the fiber. Foot guys also have their preference with hose. Color is the number one difference because hose have multiple varieties such as skin colors like tan and nude along with traditional colors like black, white with a variance of shades in each such as off black, jet black, antique white, off white, etc. After those, there is any color you could imagine. As like socks, there are different lengths that make a difference to a foot fetish guy. Nylon comes in 4 basic lengths and those are pantyhose that cover the entire crotch and legs along with the feet, stockings which are thigh high and can be held up with elastic or garters, knee highs which are held up with elastic, and finally ankle hose which are also labeled as socks but also can be made with thin nylon. \n\nNow, length really doesn't change the look of a hose covered foot but the overall sexual presentation makes a difference to guys. The next variety in hose is material or fiber. Some guys favor thicker hose like you would find in spandex or lycra tights or leggings while others prefer the thinner material like nylon and silk. Fishnet and similar looks have also become very popular in which some foot guys favor. Another difference in hose is an additional layer across the toes or heels called reinforced. These are made to prevent against wear in the overused areas of the foot and cause the toes or heels to be darker in color. The final variance in hose are additions like seams running up the back, or bows tied on the top, and so forth. I have known foot guys to be so particular in their tastes so that is why we girls should always be taking good mental notes. \n\nI'm going to have to limit my next foot accessory because I would have about ten pages and that accessory is shoes. Foot loving guys get so excited over our shoes because nothing really accentuates and showcases our feet more than the type of shoes we wear. Just to list a few are tennis shoes, boots, heels, slides, wedges, slip ons like Vans or Toms, pumps, crocs, stilettos, flip flops, and the list goes on. Foot guys also are particular in their tastes of color, style, open or closed toe, length of heel, thickness of bottoms, strappy vs. no straps, what part of the foot is showing, representation of the shoe which means who predominantly wears it, and that list goes on. He will act like your shoes are no big deal but to him, they are a big deal. Yes you will wear the shoes that match your outfit or fit the occasion but you can sometimes treat your lovemaking for that evening when you get home, separately, and he can choose your shoes for \"that occasion\" and truly appreciate it. ",
        "Use his senses to work for you\n\nI will break down the five senses that can be used to stimulate and magnify a foot lover's sexual arousal. I also hope to share ideas or examples of actual situations and positions that you may have or can use when incorporating feet into your sex life. As I've discussed, a foot lover's and a guy's, in general, number one sense is sight. They are more stimulated visually than any other sense. Now touch is a close second but whenever you involve your feet into your sex life, make sure he can see what is happening. \n\nMost of the topics I have discussed in this post have already incorporated visual application. The visual piece of foot sex also overlaps into other foot sex senses. If you are paying attention to the details and you effectively tease him, you obviously are allowing him to see your feet, or socks, or hose, or shoes. For example, your man is a bare feet guy who loves bling and flip flops so as you go out for your picnic, you surprise him by wearing your sexy flip flops and have your toes decked out with his favorite type of toe rings. You have just visually intensified his foot fetish arousal for the day. When you get home, you wear that to bed and during your lovemaking, spice it up by letting him enjoy those feet in the same way he has seen all day. I had a boyfriend who loved flowers on my heeled sandal/flip flops and when I would wear those with neon nail polish, we would have powerful sex that evening because I would wear them to bed and he would cum very quickly but he could do it a second time immediately afterward with no problem. \n\nAnother visual stimulation is shoe dangling. I could have put this into my teasing category because basically that is what you are doing. When I had my affair with my teacher Mr. Clark, it was the first tactic I used to grab his attention. I can't pretend to assume I completely understand why this is so erotic to foot fetish guys but I believe it's because the allure of partially exposing your foot as you would in trying to \"tempt\" or \"bait\" him sexually. As you sit in church, or the office, or in my case, class or the library, let those sexy shoes dangle off the end of your toes and \"Oops, one fell on the floor.\" Believe me, any foot guys around will notice. \n\nI'm going to share some other visual tactics you can use in your foot sex life which may be some things you have already tried or they might give you a great idea. I already discussed toe pointing as being a great visual for your man but don't forget other foot maneuvers that also work like lifting your toes to enhance your arch into an S shape, toe wiggling, and spreading your toes out especially if you are wearing hose. You may not be a tattoo girl like me but one day come home with a real sexy temporary tattoo strategically placed on your lover's favorite part of your foot. Flaunt it and make him notice it over and over while screwing. You are at the mall and make your man go watch you get a pedicure or make him get one with you. He will act like he is all macho and resistant but if he is a foot guy, he will succumb. \n\nIf he is an artist, have him draw or paint your feet. If you are videotaping your lovemaking, position yourself where he can get a great visual of your feet. For example, if you are riding him in the reverse cowgirl position, put your feet up on his thighs so the camera can capture your piggies pressed against his flesh or if he is pounding you in the missionary position, press your feet against his chest. If your lover is over top of you while you are rimming him or sucking his balls, put your feet together and point your toes so he has that visual in addition to the oral stimulation you are providing. While you are masturbating for him, put your legs up so he can get a great visual of your feet suspended in the air. While you are giving him a blowie, lay between his legs on your stomach and have your feet up over your head so he can see them while you're sucking. These are just a few visual enhancements you can provide and hopefully they might help you create some of your own which are specific to your man. \n\nThe next sense I will discuss is \"touch\" which I have already stated is a close second to vision for foot fetish guys. Your guy loves seeing your feet but he also loves touching them. My first discussion focus that involves touching is rubbing or massaging. If you are like me and love having your feet massaged, then find a foot lover and he will take care of that desire often. I love having my arches and in the middle of my pads massaged with the thumbs especially in a circular motion. Direct your man into the type of massage you like. The next type I like is a two handed massages where your foot is the \"meat\" in his hand sandwich because he has one palm under your foot and the other palm on top of the foot so both hands are working both sides of your foot simultaneously. Have him also work the toes including in-between them. You may not realize it but while he is screwing you doggie style, he can hold your ankles, lift your feet and rub the bottoms with this thumbs. Direct him in paying attention to each foot equally. You can get creative and have a stop watch or a sand glass timer and give him a directive on how long your foot massage needs to last. When it comes to feet, he is very submissive and will listen to your time \"demands.\"\n\nThe second focus in the touching category is kissing. Have your guy kiss your feet frequently. I found that spontaneous request for kissing your feet works best. Choose a time and place where it might be completely unexpected and even slightly inappropriate. I have been at an amusement park and told my ex that we needed to go off to the bushes because I needed my \"feet kissed right now.\" I had on a sexy pair of open toed slides and he was very excited to fulfil my request. You can do this many places such as a library, classroom, church, club, restaurant, amusement park, etc. If he is kissing your feet as part of your foreplay or lovemaking, encourage him to go slow and kiss very sensually. Make sure you direct him to kiss every inch and each foot equally. You can actually be jacking him off or even riding his cock while he kisses your feet. We like our lovers to caress and kiss us so make sure your foot loving man does that to your feet as well. \n\nProbably the most common \"feel or touching\" sense stimulation for a foot lover is the footjob. I think the two most powerful aspects of the footjob are the visual stimulation it provides and the fact that the very fetish he desires is actually performing the manipulation on his cock to orgasm. Don't confuse footjobs with him fucking your feet or even jacking off with your feet. The footjob is jerking his cock with your feet with the giver doing the work. Foot guys love this and honestly so do I. You can sit to his side, facing him, behind him with your legs wrapped around his waist, or over top of him while he lies down flat, as long as he can see your feet while they perform, he will be happy. There are a few ways to provide that pocket of flesh. I like to use my toes like fingers. Grab hold of his cock and slide your feet up and down, using your toes to wrap around as much of the shaft as possible. Of course if you have a larger space between your big and second toe, there are instances where you can put his cock inside that space and jerk it but he gets much less skin coverage and that might take him longer to cum. \n\nOther footjob techniques include putting your feet together side by side which also covers less skin but gives him a great view of your sexy toes on both feet, simultaneously. If you are flexible, the best method is to press the bottoms of your feet together and use your combined arches for his \"pussy pocket.\" He can also use his hands to help your feet jerk his cock while using this method. The next technique is using what I call the \"over and under.\" I take the top of my foot and press it under the dick while using the bottom of my other foot on top of it. It is a good feel for both of you but more difficult to sustain without your legs tiring quicker. This is why I believe I use the over top body position a large percentage of the time when I give a footjob. I usually get a chair and sit it beside or sometimes even overtop the guy so to give my legs more stamina. I have friends that are always worried about their legs not looking good and I advise them that giving a footjob is a great leg work out! Also when you are more overtop the dick, you can use the \"press\" technique. That is when you use the bottom of your foot to mash or press his cock against his belly and \"stroke\" it by rubbing it back and forth. The friction will make him spurt in no time. \n\nSome guys' love the barefoot footjob and I would advise to use lubrication unless he is uncircumcised because then you can use his foreskin as your lube. Lotions, oils, and greasy agents work best with footjobs because water based lubes like KY Jelly and Astroglide just get tacky when they mix with precum and not only do they get sticky, you end up having to reapply multiple times. The exception to this rule is if you are planning to have intercourse, then go with the water based lubrications. \n\nIf he likes hose or sock covered footjobs, then you have to be careful not to wear his cock out with too much friction. I like to use smaller, slower strokes if I'm wearing these coverings. I was dating this guy who loved for me to wear black reinforced toe stockings when I gave him footjobs so I would use the \"flat foot\" technique most often to prevent friction. Try giving your guy a hosed covered footjob while in the tub. The wet nylon is sexy and will increase his arousal even if the footjob you give him is underwater. There are actually guys that prefer you wear shoes when you give them a footjob and I have only done this with one guy and it was difficult but hey, he loved it. I ended up lifting my foot heel in a pair of high heels and pressing down, trapping his cock between my foot and the shoe until he came about 3 feet! I will discuss him cumming on your feet a little later. \n\nAnother great position for a footjob is with him sitting, legs spread, facing you. Not only can he see your toes, your body, and your face, if you're flexible, you can bend over and suck his cock while your feet are jerking it. This combination of sucking along with using your feet not only adds to his visual excitement, it also enhances the physical pleasure. You can have him put his legs together and sit on his thighs while you do this also. Because of the extra height, it is easier on the legs but harder to blow him. I have also sat on a lover's abdomen, facing the opposite direction while I jerked his cock with my feet but he cannot see what you are doing and this is a hindrance to his stimulation. Another thing you can do is make him jack off while he watches you give a footjob to a dildo or penis shaped food like a cucumber or banana. \n\nFoot fucking is in the footjob family only your lover is doing the work. If you are tired or just not completely in the mood but your lover insists he cannot help himself, then foot fucking is a great solution. Not only does this prevent your leg exhaustion, he can control his pace and skin coverage. If he wants tighter, he can press your feet firmer together around his shaft or he can pumper as fast as he needs to get off. There are several positions in addition to the traditional footjob positions that I have just described. The first one that I have used is with me laying on my side on the edge of the bed. I just put my feet together and let him pump away but just make sure you have a towel for the mess. Another one is with you on the floor, lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet up in the air. Have him stand and fuck your feet while you get an added bonus when he cums on your body (at least I like that). Put your feet bottoms together, point your toes outward, and have him stick his cock in the end, long ways, where your toes are located. This gives him a deeper pocket for tighter feel. Lay on your stomach and have him fuck your feet in reverse. He can be standing overtop you with your legs bent and up in the air or you can have your legs straight with him down on his knees. Either way, he will love it.\n\nAnother \"touch\" category is foot rubbing. Rub your feet on different parts of his body in addition to his cock or crotch. Places like his tight ass, chest, or face are great areas to get him really excited especially while you are making love. I suggest not to rub your feet on him while having sex until you are ready for him to cum because from my experience, he will not last long. He is pumping along and has satisfied you, then stick your feet in his face and make him cum so hard while he is screaming his muffled scream into the soles of your feet. I also like to have him lay down on his back while I sit down beside him. I will put my feet in his face and rub it while I jack him off. He will love this and I know this can overlap into other senses like taste if he sucks your toes or smell if he inhales your scent but I will mention those in this category because your job is to provide the feet in his face and he can switch back and forth. \n\nAdditional \"touching\" ideas that I will share are you can have him wash your feet while you are showering or bathing together. Make him go real slow so he can get them \"extra clean.\" Have your man paint your toenails for you or even give you a pedicure. Have him make a mold of your foot with clay so he can rub it all over. He can also make just a footprint of your pretty soles and he can keep that as a souvenir. There are just so many ways to incorporate touching into your foot sex life and with a little creativity and spice, you can increase both of your sexual bliss. \n\nTaste is the next sense I will focus upon. Obviously he will not technically eat your foot so taste is relegated to the various things placed on your foot. Some guys get into the food scene. They like to lick things off your feet such as whip cream and liquid type foods. I personally like warm foods such as heated chocolate or warmed up honey. I had an ex who loved to pour champagne off my foot and drink it out of my high heel. I cannot pretend to understand this but he loved it and it made him fuck that much better. Place the food on you lover's favorite part of the foot, have him lick it off while he jerks his cock until he explodes. Food can obviously get sticky and messy so I suggest you bathe or shower together right after you finish. \n\nLicking can also just be on your foot in general. He might like the taste of your skin whether it's perfectly clean or sweaty. He may just like to lick the crevices like your arches or between your toes. I personally don't mind the licking but I prefer it not be really wet in the end. I just don't like a ton of saliva unless I am going to finish him off with a footjob. Sometimes he gets so excited, he prefers to suck on your feet or toes. This can be erotic for both of you. I like to make my guy suck my big toe, slow and sensual to show me how he likes to receive his blowjobs. I have also had guys want to suck on my heel or even have me see how far I could put my whole foot in their mouth. I one time got all five toes and almost half my entire foot down an ex's throat! Girls, he wants you to deepthroat him so how about turning the tables. \n\nIf you plan on letting him suck or lick your feet while you're either jacking him off or while he's fucking you, I suggest you use them intermittently. My point is that if you use them from the beginning it can first make him cum too quickly like I have previously mentioned, without building him up or get him numb to the excitement. If you do something too much, it has the reverse effect. Stick those feet in his face or mouth midway through sex, pull them away, and then add them again with verbal stimulation. For example, your jerking him off while he is sucking your toes, pull your feet away and encourage him, \"Ooo baby, you like those feet don't you? You're not getting them because you have been bad. If your good, then you can suck on em some more.\" Then you keep jerking him until you feel he is getting closer and you put your feet back in his face and command, \"Ok, baby. Suck my toes. Do it. Suck em like I suck your dick. That's it. Keep going...keep going...oh yes, that feels good. Suck em while you shoot your cum. Take your time and shoot it high in the air.\" That surprise verbal addition will get him over the top in no time. Taste can also mean the accessories that are connected with your feet. I will discuss this more in-depth in my humiliation section.\n\nThe next sense is smell. Smell is probably what I understand the least but again I believe it only enhances the submission of a foot fetishist. The various scents a guy might like on a girl's foot can range from pleasant fragrances like soapy cleanliness, perfume, powder, or lotions to more pungent aromas like sweat, a day's wear, and musky skin or hose. I have a guy emailing me right now who craves smelling musky tan hosed feet that have been in leather boots all day while getting jerked off. Coincidently, I have done this exact thing in the past with a couple of guys. I will give the same advice in smelling as I did with kissing and licking. The sit beside, sit in front facing him or even on your belly sucking him while he smells your reversed feet are great positions. \n\nAnother suggestion is to spread your toes and stick them right up under his nose, then pinch them together. I also like to force him to smell by sitting on top of him pressing his face down with the bottom of my feet or use one foot on his face while taking the other foot and hooking it around the back of the head and forming a \"clamp\" to not allow him to move. I will advise that if you forcefully make him smell to roughly, then he cannot actually smell your foot's aroma and that is what helps him get off. Don't forget, you can make him smell your feet accessories also but I will, once again, wait until the humiliation section. \n\nThe final sense is sound. There are limited ways you can hear feet. I already mentioned hard sole shoes, heels, or boots clacking down a hard floor. Other sounds that can turn your foot guy on would be the rustling of your toes moving around in his face, the swish sound of your sock or nylon clad feet sliding across the floor, bare feet semi-sticking to your leather couch, the crackling of plastic that is being walked over, or even that slurping sound of a well lubed cock fucking your pressed together feet. When I think of sound, I think of the verbal banter that I provide when we are involved in feet sex. I can discuss it in a tone that is sensual, teasing, begging, baby talk, or humiliation when I am engrossed in pleasing my man. I will give examples of each...\n\nSensual- \"Oh yes baby that feels wonderful. Do it just like that. Oh yes, kiss my arches nice and slow...\"\n\nTeasing- \"Oooo baby, look at my toes. I just painted them. No, you can't touch them until they are dry but don't they look cute?\"\n\nBegging- \"Please honey, suck my toes. They need it so bad. Please suck every one of them.\"\n\nBaby Talk- \"You are so silly. Would you take my shoes off of me please?\"\n\nHumiliation- \"You sick fuck! You really like my sweaty feet, don't you? Smell them then you twisted bastard! Smell them until I tell you to stop!\"\n\nWhatever the situation calls for, work it to your advantage. \n\nDomination vs. Humiliation\n\nWithout sounding redundant, I believe that the foot fetish stems from a sexual submission eroticism. However, I am not suggesting that guys who have a foot fetish are sexually submissive all the time. I am merely suggesting that loving feet falls under the submission umbrella. Now a guy is still a guy and he has innate animalistic tendencies fueled by his testosterone. This is what I believe causes a guy to feel the desire to either cum on his fetish or see cum on his fetish. I equate this to an animal \"marking\" his territory. If a guy loves breasts, he wants to cum on them. If he loves asses, he wants to cum on them and if he is a foot lover, this is no different with our feet. This actually works out good for me because I like cum. I know it's a slutty guilty pleasure but I can't help it. Just to feel that warm, thick goo gets me going. Anyway, I need to get back to focusing on the topic.",
        "When you are giving a footjob, encourage him to explode all over your feet or toes. Just by your encouragement, that will enhance his sexual pleasure. I know it's not for everyone but I like to eat the cum off my feet while he watches. The key is to make eye contact with him, always smile, and lick it up slow and sensual. You can even show it to him on your tongue before swallowing it. He will go absolutely crazy with lust! Have him cum on your feet when he least expects it. He can be making love to you and when you sense he is about to explode, whisper in his ear, \"Cum on my feet. Please, when you're ready, shoot it all over my feet.\" As he gets ready and pulls out, put your feet together, point your toes and let him paint them white. Even if you are going at it doggie style, when he pulls out, put your feet together and allow him to shoot all over the soles of your feet. Either way, he feels masculine and excited that he was able to spill his seed all over his most prized fetish. \n\nNot only will a foot lover enjoy cumming on your feet, he also will enjoy cumming on your feet accessories like socks, shoes and hose. He will love cumming on your nylon clad feet or you can just use a pair of hose or socks to jerk him off with and let him cum inside them. They will wash out. Foot guys also like cumming on shoes, especially flip flops, pumps/heels, and boots. While they worship your feet inside your shoes, make them jack themselves off and cum on them. Of course you want to make sure they are your lower priced pair and not your Fendi ankle or black Delman knee high boots or anything cloth or suede. After you have worn a pair of knee high hose to work, conveniently leave them laying around so he can find them and I guarantee that eventually he will jack off to them. \n\nBeing sexually dominant and kinky by nature, I love to humiliate a foot lover and there are oh so many ways to do it. First, you have to find out what he truly enjoys so not to cross his sexual boundaries. The nastier he likes it, the nastier you give it to him. As I discussed, verbally humiliating him works wonders. Tell him how nasty, sick, and perverted he is for loving your feet. Make him smell, lick, and violate your feet in ways that make him look foolish. I have had guys eat their own cum off my feet and enjoy it. Smear your cum covered feet all over his face. Make him smell your dirty socks while he is jerks off in front of you. Stuff your dirty socks or nylons in his mouth while you jack him off. Make him get down on all fours and become your foot stool until you allow him to stop. Make him wear your pantyhose or high heels while you're fucking or jacking him off. Role play and pretend you are a stranger at work and make him get down on his knees, kiss, and worship your feet. Role play and wear a Hooter girl outfit and make him kiss and worship your nylon covered feet. Use your imagination as much as you need. \n\nClosing Arguments\n\nOnce again, I am not an expert or in a position to analyze peoples' sexual impulses, but I have a kinky streak and take good mental notes to give you what I think make guys with a foot fetish tick. Combining sex and feet may seem strange to some but if you have an open mind and realize that guys who have this fetish are normal, kinky people who happen to associate feet with sex, then that will help enable you to accept that and use this power to your advantage which in turn, the sexual satisfaction can be enhanced for the both of you!"
