        "When I began my Domme journey years ago, I wrote a how-to story about dominating a man. Since then, I've discovered I specifically prefer sensual domination while inflicting little to no pain. That isn't always what people think of with D/s, so I wanted to write another how-to about this type of dominance. I've explored my dominant side through reading, writing, conversations, and playing with subs. The most repeated feedback on my stories is an appreciation for showing domination can be sexy without pain. I have absolutely nothing against domination with pain and cruelty, but it's just not for me.\n\nThis isn't a short how-to because it covers a lot of things, including responsibilities, communication, clothing, anticipation, sexy talk, teasing, orgasm control, putting him on display, toys, rewards, punishments, and aftercare. This isn't about negotiating scenes or playtime with new acquaintances, and it does not address D/s as a lifestyle. This is written for a Domme who already shares a connection with her sub. Personally, I need to know my sub and feel a connection with him in order to enjoy dominating him. This is also written from the perspective of a woman dominating a man. However, I hope that anyone, regardless of gender, orientation, or partnership status, can find some helpful and sexy ideas from this story.\n\nA few basics\n\nThere is a physical side and a psychological side to dominance. Physically, sensual dominance means dominating with activities that revolve around sexual pleasure. Sexual pleasure is a broad term for all erotic physical sensations and not just oral sex or intercourse. It may include kissing, dry humping, spooning, massaging, etc. Rewards consist of sexual pleasure given by the Domme and received by the sub. Punishment means sexual pleasure is denied or taken away from the sub. Light pain is often part of the fun, but the more substantial pain is more commonly used with other types of dominance. Psychologically, sensual dominance may make a Domme feel worshipped, sexually satisfied, powerful, controlling, and loving. Subs may also feel sexually satisfied as well as vulnerable, cherished, controlled, and loved. The brain plays a vital role in domination, and the physical and psychological elements are incredibly interconnected. Ideally, your D/s interactions fulfill both the physical and psychological needs of you and your sub. Many people enjoy mixing sensual dominance with other types of dominance, while others prefer to stick to one kind. There's no right or wrong way to dominate as long as all parties involved are consenting and enjoying themselves. \n\nSome people wonder if sensual dominance has much of a power exchange when it's all about pleasure. Absolutely! The extent of the power exchange depends on what level you and your sub desire. For example, you could climb on top of your sub to make him feel like he doesn't have a choice, and then fuck him senseless until you cum. There isn't a ton of power exchange in that scenario, but there's no rule that says you need to incorporate more. If you wanted more, you could tie him down and straddle his face while making it very clear that his pleasure has to wait until you're satisfied. Then you climb on top and ride him really slow until he's going crazy and begging for release, but he's not allowed to cum until you let him. When you make a sub get permission before he can cum, there's a lot of power exchange there even though you're focusing on pleasure. You can make your playtime more severe because you and your sub find a hard, unforgiving Domme sexier. Or you could play in a lighthearted, whimsical way by being a fairy who casts a spell to control him. Sensual domination can be intense, light, or anywhere in the middle.\n\nWhen it comes to dominance in general, Dommes typically enjoy being in control because the sense of power is heady. It can also help a woman feel confident, sexy, desired, brave, and like an erotic badass. In addition to these reasons, I love the trust, honesty, and connection that come with dominating a sub. People often think that Dommes are controlling in all aspects of their lives. However, I have known very good Dommes who had a more passive personality outside of playtime. Additionally, not all bossy women make good Dommes. \n\nOn the other hand, many people believe subs want to submit because they have strong personalities but need a break from being in control. That can certainly be the case, as was true for one of my subs who was a cop. However, I also have met men who have a more laid back or mild personality but still love submitting to a woman. Subs can enjoy being controlled for several reasons. The most popular reason I hear is they love the feeling of submission and helplessness and find it extremely erotic. Another very common explanation subs give me is that they love pleasing a woman and making her happy.\n\nWhy Dommes and subs want dominance without pain can vary widely. I prefer sensual dominance because I like being in control of pleasure and orgasms. I love to tease and ramp up the anticipation to make both our orgasms better. I'm also a nurturing and giving Mistress and want to take care of my sub and his pleasure. I love making him happy because a happy sub is a devoted sub. I've heard from subs about why they want to be dominated sensually, and many explain that they get off by being at the mercy of a woman yet still want intimacy and pleasure. Additionally, many subs don't have an interest in pain, but they do have a strong desire to serve a woman sexually. They are hesitant to explore their submissive side because they don't find the pain aspect sexy. However, there's a world of sensual dominance waiting for them if they find the right Domme to match their desires.\n\nThe Domme's responsibilities\n\nDuring playtime, you're in charge of a lot as the Domme. However, your most important responsibility is looking out for your sub. You need to make sure he's comfortable, happy, and safe throughout the entire experience, from discussions to playtime to aftercare. It's a lot of responsibility to be open and honest, understand his needs, plan activities, choose his rewards and punishments, take care of him, know when to push or back off, adjust things on the fly, and provide aftercare. Whew! It takes a lot of mental energy but is extremely rewarding. Be sure you recognize the effort it takes, and please don't half-ass it. It's impossible to be a perfect Domme all the time, and that's okay. But a desire to be an excellent one goes a long way toward great sensual playtime. It takes a lot of trust to submit to someone, so make sure you appreciate your sub's trust by doing your best. I always say my number one job as a Mistress is to take care of my sub. How I take care of him varies depending on who he is, what he needs, and what we're doing. No matter what, I always want him to feel safe, secure, and cherished.\n\nCommunication\n\nI cannot stress enough how important communication is to help everyone be safe and have fun. This is the main reason why I need a connection with my sub; we have to be very open and honest with each other. Even with sensual dominance, you must have a safeword. You and your sub can use the same word, or each of you can have a different one. A safeword is a way to stop all play immediately, and both you and your sub must always have the ability to do that. Pick something that would never come up naturally in playtime. \"Stop\" and \"wait\" are terrible safewords because your sub might want to use them to increase his submissive feelings. Instead, choose something like the make of your car or your favorite musician. No matter what, always stop playing immediately when someone says the safeword. Trust plays a crucial role in dominance because whoever says the safeword trusts that their partner will stop. Once play stops, talk about why the safeword was used. It might be due to feeling unfun physical discomfort, being too overwhelmed, needing water, or having a muscle cramp. Don't automatically assume you're a terrible Domme if your sub uses the safeword. It just means that you need to have a talk as non-D/s people to figure out how to make things better. You may even continue playing if you both want to after your break, or you might choose to stop for the night and play another time. Remember, Dommes have every right to use a safeword as well. Anytime you need to stop and talk to your sub in a non-D/s space, use the word. Maybe you're not feeling well, you're not enjoying an activity, the condom broke, etc. Don't hesitate to use the word, and then explain why you used it. \n\nThe other major element of communication with your sub is determining how you want to play. You must have detailed conversations about what you each like and want to try. Both of you need to be honest about what you like and don't like, and you both need to be kind about what the other person says. If he asks about something that you're not into, like pegging him, don't make a face and don't belittle his interest because there's nothing wrong with his desire. Just be honest and say you don't want to put that on the list of things to try. You both probably have a desire that the other doesn't want to try because two people's kinks won't align perfectly on every item. There's also give and take, and one of you may bring up something the other hasn't thought about. If one of your sub's ideas doesn't really do it for you, but you aren't against it, be open to trying it. As a Mistress, I've done things for my sub that didn't sound erotic but became really hot and sexy once I did it and saw his reaction and arousal. \n\nBoth of you need to be clear about your limits and interests. Through talking, you'll find where your interests overlap and decide what to try. If you find it hard to get those conversations started, try finding a good story on Lit to read together and then discuss what you like and don't like about it. It's like sexy homework! Perhaps he loved the Domme's tenderness, the restraints, the anal play, or other specific things that start a great conversation. You could also have a discussion jar, and each of you writes ideas on slips of paper and puts them in the jar. Then when you go for a walk or have some cuddle time, take two ideas with you and talk about them. There's no rule about how the conversations must go, but just remember to be honest and kind. \n\nThroughout the rest of this how-to, you'll notice multiple references to communicating with your sub and learning what he desires. However, some subs are Domme pleasers and really only want to serve you and your desires. If you have this type of sub, he may not voice his preferences because he wants to do what you want. It's possible when you ask him questions, his responses are, \"It's up to you,\" or \"You decide.\" Be aware those answers could honestly reflect his desires because he wants you to lead, and he does not want much of a role in planning your playtime. However, continue to communicate and ask questions because it is essential to know when he does have limits and preferences.\n\nClothing\n\nThere are no rules about what you must wear during playtime. Clothing should be based on what you like and what's going to enhance the play and make it sexier for both of you. You might want to be in leather and metal if that helps you embrace your Domme persona, or you might want to wear romantic lingerie to highlight the loving bond you have with your sub. You may also have a variety of outfits that make you feel great as a Domme, and you pick one based on your mood or the playtime activities. You can choose your sub's clothing based on the planned activities too. If his collar makes him feel very secure, you'd be a thoughtful Domme to have him wear it when you're trying something new or pushing his boundaries. Perhaps you want to put him in a pair of your panties to make him feel more shy and vulnerable. Usually, I plan the night's activities and then select the clothes that match the mood I want to create. I find it much easier to be domineering in knee-high boots and a corset than in a schoolgirl outfit. It's also possible to pick the clothes first and then plan the activities. For example, if I found a sexy jockstrap for my sub to wear, I'd plan activities that put his gorgeous cheeks on display for me. \n\nTo help you select clothing, you should know your sub's preferences. He might struggle to answer a broad question like, \"What would you like me to wear?\" If so, try asking more specific questions like, \"Would you feel more dominated if I wore dark colors?\" His answers also reveal what psychologically affects him, which can help you be a better Domme. It helps to look online for lingerie and fetish clothing, and searching together can be very sexy. I specifically want to mention CFNM (Clothed Female Nude Male) because many men love feeling submissive this way. Not only does a sub usually feel more vulnerable when he's naked, but you can feel more powerful and in control by being fully dressed. Then you dictate precisely how your sub can earn the privilege of seeing more of your sexy body. The clothes you'd wear in this scenario are often your work attire, but it could be anything. In any case, CFNM can be another layer to make him feel more submissive. Don't worry, you can still get naked when you want! I personally love a naked sub and prefer him that way the majority of the time. I love being able to see how hard he is, how much he's leaking, and what makes his cock twitch with lust.\n\nAnticipation\n\nBuilding anticipation can drive your sub crazy and intensify his orgasm. It's also dominating because you're guiding his thoughts and arousal. The key to anticipation is letting him know what will happen in the future and then making him wait for it. A way to build anticipation without being specific would be leaving him a note in the morning that says, \"7 pm tonight, be naked and face-down on the bed.\" He won't know what you're doing to do, but he'll enjoy wondering about it, especially if he has a great imagination. You could also be much more specific and tell him, \"You'll be using a toy on me tonight to make me cum before I tie you down and finger you.\" Specifics can really make your sub crazy, especially if you describe them in the car on the way to dinner with friends. Do your best to follow through on your sexy promises unless there must be a necessary change in plans. Otherwise, your attempt at building anticipation becomes confusing and frustrating.\n\nSexy talk\n\nMost men, subs included, love a woman who talks sexy. Sexy talk also includes dirty talk, but maybe you and your sub don't always want to use more explicit words. Imagine you have your sub restrained while you're riding him, which is his favorite position. Sexy talk that is less explicit might include, \"I love having you under me where you belong. Remember, I have to orgasm first, so get ready for a nice, long ride.\" The words are less naughty, but it's still sexy, and you're asserting control by reminding him of a rule. Dirty talk could look more like, \"I love fucking you like this, with you under me where you belong. Don't forget you can't fill me with cum until you please me first. And with such a delicious cock for me to ride, I might want to make this last a very long time.\" It's the same general message, but you're using words like fucking and cock and specifically mention him cumming inside you. Most subs will enjoy both versions, but you should know which type arouses him more so you can use that to your advantage. Combine sexy talk with other elements like anticipation or rewards to help push all your sub's buttons. You can always get sexy talk ideas from Lit stories. I wouldn't recommend getting ideas from porn videos because, well, they aren't known for their stellar dialogue. Sexy talk takes a little practice, and it might feel awkward at first. However, you'll learn where your comfort zone is and what words drive your sub crazy. \n\nTeasing and edging\n\nTeasing plays a considerable role in my sensual domination. It really ramps up the sexual tension and anticipation, which makes the release more powerful. The goal of sensual dominance is pleasure, which includes everyone's pleasure. You can only tease your sub so much before it becomes mean and tiresome. Where exactly that line lies depends on your sub because some enjoy more teasing than others. How you tease is based on what your sub likes and how much you want to torment him. If he's very visual, tease him by starting fully-dressed and revealing your body to him slowly. If he loves sexy talk, talk about what you're doing, what's coming next, how things feel, etc. Don't forget physical teasing as well, like barely touching his cock when you know he wants firm strokes. If you're on top, slide him inside you and then just be still and wait, especially if you know he's dying to thrust. You can even lightly scratch his balls with your fingernails while you're waiting to add even more teasing. Also, use his body's sensitive areas to your advantage to drive him absolutely wild. Teasing can be easily combined with other playtime fun. \n\nEdging is a form of teasing that gets your sub right to the edge of climax then backs off just before he cums. You do this again and again, which keeps him at a very high level of sexual tension for an extended period of time. It can be difficult to edge your sub because it's impossible for you to know precisely how close he is to the edge of orgasm. Inevitably, you will make him cum accidentally because you didn't stop in time. To avoid this, you can make him tell you when to stop, or you can order him to edge himself while you watch.\n\nOrgasm control\n\nControlling orgasms is one of my favorite ways to dominate because it has a clear sense of authority and is very sensual. This control often translates to rules about when, where, and how he's allowed to cum. Your rule about when he can cum might be that you have to cum first. Maybe twice. If you like your sub to refrain from orgasms for multiple days, you could have an orgasm scoreboard where he gets one for every five of yours. You can also make your sub ask permission to cum so he can't have an orgasm unless you allow it. You could even do this in your relationship outside of playtime if your sub really loves you controlling his orgasms. If you prefer control without him asking permission every time, you could allow him only two orgasms for the week, including masturbation, and he chooses when he wants to have them. Or perhaps you give him a weekend to cum as much as he wants as long as you get to help or watch every single one. \n\nControlling where he cums usually relates to on or in your body. Many Dommes won't let a sub cum on them because they feel it diminishes their status in the D/s relationship. Personally, I love to dictate where a sub cums on me because he is so grateful, especially if the location is related to one of his fetishes. Letting a sub with a foot fetish cum on your feet will make him so happy and very devoted to you, especially if you let him wash your feet afterward. \n\nControlling how he cums is another way to assert your dominance over his orgasm. You can dictate whether he cums from his own hand or from your body when you're together. You can also be specific about his position for masturbating. Many subs find masturbating for their Dommes even hotter if they're given specific instructions like being on all fours while they do it. The more ways you control his orgasm, the more powerful you feel, and the more submissive he feels.\n\nPutting him on display\n\nPutting your sub on display for your viewing pleasure can be a great way to feed his submissive desires. Additionally, he may love being your sole focus because it makes him feel very special. Make sure your sub is okay with being on display for you. If he has scars or body issues, he may not appreciate being the center of such visual attention. Watching your sub while he undresses, masturbates, or holds specific positions are sexy ways to put him on display. While you're watching him, you can compliment him, tell him how he's pleasing you, or play with yourself so he can see your pleasure. You want to help your sub feel comfortable and proud to be on display for you. You might also want to direct some of his actions to add more dominance, like giving him explicit instructions on how to undress for you. I also love asking my sub to describe his feelings while I watch him because it's amusing to watch him struggle to put together coherent sentences. ",
        "Toys and other fun gadgets\n\nThere's a whole world of sexy items to play with while dominating sensually. It's another topic area to discuss with your sub to determine what things might make your playtime more fun and arousing. It's impossible to list every sexual gadget out there, especially since almost anything can be used to enhance your experience. However, I want to discuss a few of the more common types. First, there are items to restrain your sub like handcuffs, spreader bars, chastity devices, cages, ropes, gags, leashes, etc. This can really highlight your dominance because it restricts his freedom, and you choose how to restrain him and in what position. It will also enhance your sub's feelings of helplessness, which can be a huge turn-on for you both. Restraints make it easier to tease your sub when he cannot touch your body or move closer to you. It also makes it very clear that he only can do what you allow. He can only kiss you if you get close enough. He can only suck your nipples if you put them within reach. He can only lick your pussy if you put it against his mouth.\n\nBe aware that restraints take a higher level of trust because your sub is putting himself in a situation from which he cannot escape without your help. If he's not ready to do that, or if you aren't prepared for that level of control, here are a couple of alternatives that might work. You could just order him not to move. It's a simple but powerful solution that can be very dominating. This is how I prefer to restrain my sub because I love the psychological element and his voluntary obedience. My sub has full freedom to move, but he chooses not to in order to please me, which is very erotic evidence of his submission. If he obeys and doesn't move until he's allowed, he gets a reward. If he moves before he's allowed, he gets punished. Another option that offers your sub more movement would be a rule like, \"Keep both palms on the bed at all times.\" This allows you to see how much he really squirms while still restricting his movements in some way. \n\nItems for penetrating him anally are sometimes also used in domination, including butt plugs, dildos, strap-ons, and anal vibrators. I mention this type of toy for four reasons. One, be sensitive to your sub's preferences, and don't be surprised if he loves or hates the idea. Most men feel strongly one way or the other about being penetrated. Two, you do not have to use toys to explore him anally. Fingers can be a great way to get started to see how you both feel about this type of fun. Three, if you do use something other than your fingers, please get a toy made specifically for anal penetration to help ensure safety and comfort. And four, make sure you use lube as you experiment in this area! Subs who want a Domme to penetrate them appreciate the intimacy of letting someone inside them, and it can feel extremely submissive even while it's tender and loving. Additionally, the physical sensations can be extremely pleasurable for your sub, especially when the prostate is involved. Making a man cum always makes me feel like a good Domme, but absolutely blowing his mind with the most fantastic prostate orgasm makes me feel like a goddess for days. \n\nSpanking toys are popular, which can include floggers, whips, riding crops, paddles, and canes. You can also use things around your house, like rulers, wooden spoons, hairbrushes, etc. In sensual dominance, spanking usually focuses more on the psychological impact and sexual arousal than physical pain. You can spank your sub for fun or use it as a reward if he loves it. It can be used as a punishment as well if he finds it very humiliating or if he becomes extremely aroused by it, but you don't let him cum. The most common place to spank a sub is on his sweet ass cheeks, but you can also spank him in other fleshy areas like his thighs. Various positions can also have different effects. If you're behind him while he's on all fours, he'll feel very exposed and vulnerable, especially having no idea when the next spank is coming. Putting him over your lap allows more skin-to-skin contact and can help increase intimacy. Having my sub face down across my legs is my favorite way to spank him because it's the best way for me to feel his physical reactions. The way his body squirms and thrusts against me as I spank him is very arousing. I can also feel how hard he is and how much he's leaking on my legs. Another great position for spanking is ordering him on his back and making him pull his knees up wide to give you access to his thighs and ass. This can make him feel very exposed, and as a bonus, you can see his face as he reacts to each swat. \n\nYou also need to decide what you want to spank him with. You can always use your hand, which is an easy and free way to start. I actually prefer to use my hand so I can feel the heat of his skin against my palm and enjoy how it gets warmer the longer I spank him. If you don't use your hand, be aware some toys hurt a lot more than others. Be sure to research and learn which toys are better for light play versus heavier play so you can choose the best one. It takes some trial and error to learn how hard to swing a spanking toy, but just start gently and work up from there to achieve the desired pain level. \n\nToys that aren't typically used with dominance can also be a lot of fun. Imagine using a clit vibrator on yourself while he watches and cannot move. Perhaps you want to order him to use a dildo on you while giving him explicit directions on how to do so. This is a win-win because you get an orgasm while he serves you, enjoys the gorgeous view, and hears the sounds you make. This is also great for Dommes who may need a little extra help orgasming. Just make sure you discuss bringing a toy into playtime before you do so. If you're getting toys that go inside either one of you, be sure you consider what size to get. In my experience, you get what you pay for when it comes to sex toys. I'm not saying break the bank to buy them, but if you want good toys that are quality and have more options, they will cost a decent amount. You might want to start with cheaper toys to see what you like. Then you can upgrade and spend money on the things you really love. \n\nRewards\n\nYou'll want to reward your sub when he's done something wonderful. Maybe he obeyed perfectly, or he went above and beyond your orders to please you. In any case, make sure he knows why you're rewarding him to reinforce his excellent behavior. You can give big or small rewards, both of which are based on what he really really likes. For example, if he loves blowjobs, then giving him one makes a fantastic reward. Yes, you can give blowjobs to your sub. Some Dommes think that isn't very dominating, but I beg to differ because you're still in total control of his pleasure. You get to decide whether to suck him slowly to prolong his orgasm or suck him deep and fast, so he's helpless to do anything but cum. If he has a foot fetish, allowing him to give you a foot massage can also be a great reward. If he loves being under you, then give him some quality make out time while lying on top of him. \n\nYou can certainly add more dominance to your rewards to foster his submissive feelings. Let's say your sub is a breast man, and you reward him by letting him kiss and suck your breasts for eight minutes. He would feel more submissive if you tie him up, kneel over him, and 'feed' him your breasts. Or you could make a rule that he can't get any precum on you. Maybe the rule should be that he can't make a noise the whole time. Perhaps you want to set a timer for the eight minutes and give him periodic updates on how much time is left. Ultimately a reward is tailored to your sub. I guarantee there are subs out there who would have trouble not cumming while sucking your toes as a reward, and there are others who would never want their mouth anywhere near your feet. That's why it's essential to know what your sub likes, dislikes, loves, and hates. \n\nPunishments\n\nPunishing your sub in sensual domination means you withhold or delay pleasure, which can be very fun. You should punish your sub when he disobeys you or breaks a rule. He may test the boundaries and disobey to see what happens. He also may purposely break the rules because he's in the mood to be punished. Subs who continually act out to get punished are called brats. I personally don't like a bratty sub because I find it disrespectful to my dominance. However, there are many Dommes out there who love to take a firm hand to a bratty sub, so it just comes down to personal preference. It's also possible for you to force your sub to break the rules so you can punish him. For example, you can make a rule that forbids him to make a sound for the next five minutes. Then you can perform very wicked sexual pleasures on him so he can't help but make a sound, which forces him to break the rule. You can do this if you're in the mood to punish him and need an excuse to do so. However, be aware that if you do it too often, your sub might not appreciate you stealing his ability to obey. \n\nYou should also consider the punishment duration and match it to the level of offense if you prefer. In other words, if he barely disobeyed and maybe even did it by accident, his punishment might not last very long. More significant offenses would then translate to longer punishments. Some Dommes like to punish their sub by denying them pleasure and orgasms for many hours or even days. Personally, I always allow my sub an orgasm before the night is over because I'm a greedy Mistress and love making him cum. I enjoy seeing and hearing how much he loves what I do to him, and his orgasm is the number one way for me to witness his pleasure. How long I make him wait depends on how strongly he needs to be punished, but more time just means more anticipation and teasing.\n\nAftercare\n\nIt's your responsibility as a Domme to make sure that you take care of your sub after playtime is over. Whenever you are done dominating him for the day/night, you need to provide aftercare. There are two types of aftercare: physical and emotional. Make sure that your sub is physically comfortable as he comes down off the pleasure high. He may need water, snacks, warm blankets, a shower, etc. I suggest always providing hydration and then take visual cues of what he might need. If you aren't sure what he needs, just ask him. Also comfort him with touch in a loving way, so he knows you're there for him while he relaxes. You could hold him, stroke his hair, spoon him, and give him small kisses. Make your touches comforting and not sexual to help him come back to earth gently. It also continues the intimacy of what you just did together and most likely comforts you too. \n\nYou must also care for him emotionally. Your sub might feel a little embarrassed about what you did together, or he might wonder if he pleased you enough. During aftercare, you should shower him with compliments. You can talk about how sexy he was, what he did that you loved, the amazing noises he made when he came... just sweet pillow talk that makes him feel great. He's welcome to share what he loved too, but he might not have enough brainpower to do so right then. Take that as a compliment about how hard you rocked his world, and don't be offended if he doesn't rave about you until later. Now is not the time to be asking questions or having a discussion about your playtime. Make it a rule that those conversations wait until the next day. Aftercare is about comfort, peace, and happiness.\n\nLearning for next time\n\nEvery time you play, you will learn things that help you be a better Domme. The next day is a great time to think about your experience and discuss it with your sub. This is an integral part of sensual dominance and will help your D/s relationship grow. You'll learn what worked great and should definitely be done again in the future. Remember to repeat the compliments you gave him during aftercare now that he's no longer delirious with pleasure. You can also spin off new ideas from the things you loved. For example, let's say you tried using a timer in your play, and you both agree it was really hot. Then next time, you can use the timer to give him a one-minute window to cum. It's up to you on how much you help him make or miss that window. If he doesn't cum in that one minute, use the timer to dictate how long he has to lick you before you give him another window. \n\nYou also need to talk about what wasn't awesome. Discussing why it wasn't great is very important because maybe you want to try again with a small adjustment. Let's say you wanted to put your sub on display, so you watched him masturbate while using a toy on yourself. Maybe he didn't love the experience because you had your eyes closed from the toy, and he didn't feel on display as much as he wanted. A tweak would be to take turns playing with yourselves instead of doing it simultaneously. If you didn't discuss why he didn't love it, you might wrongly assume he didn't like masturbating in front of you. Sometimes it can be hard for your sub to ask for adjustments to playtime because you're supposed to be in control. Therefore, be sure he understands that his opinions matter and that he has a voice in your D/s relationship. \n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this and have many sensually dominant fantasies and so much fun!"
