        "Various Blowjob Techniques to Intensify Orgasm\n\nIn my first writing on how to give blowjobs, I basically gave information on the whole process along with past experiences on sucking a dick to completion. In this writing, I want to give you some specific ideas and various techniques on how to make your man cum harder than usual during a blowjob. When I suck a man off, my goal is not just to make him cum but to have his body lock up and shake as though he is experiencing a seizure. I want him to point and lock his toes in a fist while he is growling like a bear or screaming like someone in pain. I want his eyes to roll back in his head while he can't catch his breath. Finally, I don't just want his dick to just release its sperm; I want to feel his whole body discharge it as though it started in his toes and rocketed up at full force until every drop launches itself out his dick hole like you dropped a Mentos in a coke bottle. I want his sphincter, ass cheeks, and nut sack to forcefully spasm with each shot until he feels like his balls have been completely drained dry. Now that is an orgasm!\n\nI have written before that stimulating your partner mentally before you blow him is just as important as the physical sucking. The worst words ever said before a blowjob are, \"Are you gonna cum quick\" or you are going to have to hurry because ....\" You want to take your time and treat his dick like your loving on it or making love to it and not just sucking it. Mental stimulation is the key to a great orgasm but for this article, let us assume you have already stimulated his mind and prepared it for sex. Now I am going to share some physical tricks to get him over the hump and make him blow like an overdue volcano. I know some of the techniques that I am going to share with you involve a lot of hand and could be also classified as a hand job but anytime during the act, the penis is in your mouth, I consider that a blowjob. Most importantly, you don't want to use these techniques throughout the blowjob but only after you have built him up and more towards the end so the sensation is heightened.\n\n<p align=\"center\">Ass Play</p>\n\nIf you're blowing a \"straight guy\", sometimes ass play can be a little trickier because he wants to convince himself he is not gay so he may initially resist, but more often than not, after they feel it, most will enjoy ass play if it makes them cum like a bull.\n\nGiving the Finger\n\nMany guys like when you stick your finger in their asshole. Gentleness and timing are the two main factors in producing a powerful orgasm. You don't just jam a finger in a guy's ass and start reaming. My technique is I like the guy to be standing in front of me while I'm kneeling on a pillow or sitting on a stool. I like to have him spread his legs while I'm sucking his dick in that standing position. I like to take my time and build him up. I will take one hand with my palms up and cup is balls as I suck him. I will manage to slip my middle finger in my mouth to lubricate it with my saliva. As he really gets into my oral skills, I will slowly slide my hand back and place that wet middle finger on his ass crack. I slowly work it in the crack until I have reached the hole. Don't jam it in. I will gently work my middle finger in his butthole and stop when I get to the first knuckle. You want him just to have that little sensation inside the rim. You proceed with the blowjob until you feel him building up and ready to cum. I sometimes wiggle my finger around to help with stimulation until he starts cumming and then I slowly slide the rest of my finger up his rectum while he is filling my mouth up with his wad. He will buck and shake while you are rubbing his prostate from inside his ass but in that position, it is easier to hold him close until he completely empties and he can hold your head for leverage. I guarantee he will have an amazing orgasm and provide you with a nice size load.\n\nPlugging Away\n\nThe same concept as the finger, but you are using a thin object such as a thin butt plug, small dildo, or something else. Make sure it is well lubed and slide it gently in his ass just as you get started. This technique is not good in the standing position like the finger because many times it will plop out on the ground just as you get going and you will end up working too hard to hold it in as you're trying to concentrate on sucking his dick. There are basically two good positions for him while you use this technique. The first is with him lying on his back with his ass hanging over the edge of the bed and his legs up in the air. It is best to stand because I like to work the dildo in his ass and hold it with my left hand and use my right hand to pull his cock away from his belly and point it straight in the air. Insert the thin dildo or plug very slowly as you begin stroking him. Eventually, after you have it in, you can start his blowjob. Sucking his cock while you are fucking his ass is very erotic. When the guy is ready to shoot, the most common mistake from the sucker is they want to push the dildo/plug all the way in and leave it while the guy cums. That is a mistake because the muscles around the prostate are the ones contracting during orgasm which give it that power. If something is up the rectum, those muscles can't contract as fully, actually weakening the orgasm and the semen just oozes out rather than shooting. When your man starts cumming, it is very important to keep sliding the dildo/plug in and out slowly during the entire orgasm. This gives the prostate and muscles surrounding it time to fully contract which allows his cum to discharge more forcefully. The hard part is keeping your mouth going up and down on his dong simultaneously as you are fucking his ass. It is kinda like rubbing your stomach as you pat your head.\n\nThe guy I am currently seeing who shall remain nameless is only 24 and is in very good shape. Being in shape also helps with the prostate muscles' power during orgasm. He loves when I do this. We have a couple of butt plugs but the one he likes the best is a green one about the width of a magic marker and about 6 inches long. We actually sixty-nine with him on top and I use the \"green hornet\" on him very slow and sensual. Most of the time, he gets so turned on, that he sucks my dick like that there is no tomorrow and I cum first in his mouth. My orgasm along with my using the plug on him makes him cum like a stallion and he lets out a muffled scream with my dick still in his mouth.\n\nThe second position while using the plug technique is what I feel is the best. Lay on your back with your head propped up on a few pillows against the headboard so that your chin is touching your chest. Have your lover straddle your neck as though he was going to titty fuck a woman. He needs to be up far enough where he can fit a few inches in your mouth, hold on to the top of the headboard, and you to have your hands free behind his ass. Have him hold still with his cock still in your mouth as you insert the dildo/plug in his ass. In this position, he will be in control and have him fuck your mouth slowly as you hold the dildo/plug still and allow his natural thrusting motion to pull it in and out of his butt. You just have to make sure when he cums, that he doesn't stick his dick too deep and choke you. The first time I ever tried this position, I didn't have any ass toys so I found a long thin candle and put a rubber on it. I slid that candle in and out of his ass so slow and sensual, he violently came so much in my mouth that I momentarily thought he wasn't going to stop. Without exaggeration, I bet he shot 10 to 12 times until his orgasm finally stopped. Then he just stayed there with his dick in my mouth for about 5 minutes quivering and shaking while trying to catch his breath. I had to finally force him off of me so I could swallow his cum and breathe.\n\nJust Bead -it\n\nAnal beads are also called Ben-Wah balls. Most men prefer the soft rubber beads as opposed to the hard ones. The concept of the beads is to put them in your lover's ass while you are blowing him and then as he cums, pull them out slowly causing stimulation to his prostate and his asshole. If my lover and I are going to use them, I will wrap a heating pad around them during foreplay. At the right time, I will lube them up and gently slip them in his ass. Be sure to leave the tail or stem sticking at least an inch out of his rectum so you have something to hold on to at the point of orgasm. There are many positions that are good for this technique especially if you are jacking him off but if you are blowing him, I think with him standing is the best. It is very important you don't lose your grip on those beads while you're sucking him off. Finally, when your lover starts to blow his load, pull the beads out very slowly. This action causes the balls to rub all the sensitive nerves in his anus and around his butthole. Probably the most common mistake is you will want to pull the beads out too quickly which takes away the stimulation. What I try to do to ensure that I take my time is to synchronize my pulling with each one of his squirts. If your lover is cumming in your mouth, it is easy to feel the twitch of every shot and you just plop another ball out with each one. My current lover likes to tighten his ass cheeks up as tight as he can when he cums so it is more difficult for me to get them out but in turn it provides more stimulation for him. He told me that he feels like his dick head is literally exploding.\n\nLovin, Touchin, Squeezin\n\nThe ass cheeks and the crack also can be stimulated into a more powerful orgasm for a man during a blowjob. There have been a few techniques that I have performed on men with very positive feedback. Of course the only positions that will work because of ass accessibility are if the man is standing, on his knees, or suspended in air. If I am on my knees sucking a man off, I will usually do something with my hands where I am manipulating his balls or ass. You can reach around and massage or lightly tickle his ass cheeks while you are giving him head which brings stronger orgasms. Another technique that is stimulating is when you reach around and use all 8 fingers up and down in his ass crack and just as he is about to shoot, pull his ass cheeks apart and the cool air on his anus provides extra power to his ejaculation. Light smacking or whipping on his ass while he is cumming is also a good enhancer. Some guys really like that and some don't.\n\nOn night a few years back, after clubbing real late, I took this short, stocky, guy to the alley about a block away from the club to give him a blowjob. He was drunk and pretty rowdy. We went behind this old parked car that to this day I remember was a black impala. I squatted down and was doing my business and he told me to \"smack his ass.\" I started out by lightly tapping is ass and he kept yelling, \"Harder.\" So I kept smacking more forceful and I was terrified we were going to get caught because he kept yelling. Eventually he locked up and shouted curse words as he blew his load in my mouth. The idiot was even banging the top of the car with his hand while he was cumming. I left as soon as he was finished and was out of that alley before he even had a chance to pull his pants up. I did know he really enjoyed his orgasm.\n\n\"Taint\" that a shame\n\nThis technique is great to use on guys who don't like anything in their ass. The perineum or taint area is that area between the asshole and the balls so technically it is not part of the ass but close enough. This area holds the \"prostate muscles\" to which I have been referring. Like I stated earlier, having something large in a man's ass while he cums actually hinders his orgasm because all the contraction of his perineum is concentrated inward. However, if you message and then put pressure on the outside of this area, it can enhance the power of the orgasm. I think the best position for this technique is with him lying on his back. I will have my partner lying on the floor with his legs spread and his feet up on a chair or couch for comfort. Be sure you get on the proper side so you can use your strong hand on his taint. As I suck his cock, I will message his taint in a circular motion to stir up the nerve endings in that area. When he starts ejaculating, I push down and up toward the balls simultaneously which causes him to forcefully cum. Most of the time, guys will push your head down on their dick and try to lift their ass off the ground while they are cumming in this position so be prepared so not to get choked or gagged.\n\n<p align=\"center\">Ball Stimulation</p>\n\nThere are some great ways to stimulate a man's balls to intensify ejaculation. I prefer my lover's balls to be very hairless and smooth. Licking and playing with a man's nuts are a great warm up before you blow him. The key to a great ending to that blowjob are the sensitive techniques you apply to those balls as he cums.\n\nGood Vibrations\n\nYou take a vibrator, preferably the egg, with the cord attached so you can control power and speed. You then take some cellophane plastic wrap and you attach the vibrator underneath his testicles by wrapping the plastic around his balls and penis base. Be sure you don't put plastic wrap to high up on his cock because it will take away the sensation of your mouth. The best position for this technique is with him sitting on the edge of a chair or couch with this balls hanging over the edge. My vibrator has long cord so I just sit the control handle on the floor. I have also used a couple of stacked pillows on the floor and sit the controls on them. It is not a good idea to let it dangle down or drape it over his leg. It seems too clinical and takes away from the mental stimulation. You also could hold it with one hand the whole time but then you only have one hand available for the cock. I like to have both hands free for rubbing and stroking while I suck dick especially if he has a long one. When you feel him getting close to orgasm, take one hand and turn on the vibrator on a low setting. That low vibration on his balls will speed him up. He will be saying or grunting things like, \"right there, here it comes,\" or \"stay on it, almost there,\" or some type of pleasure cursing. Watch his legs or feet and as soon as you see either tighten up or clench, turn that vibrating egg that is attached under his nut sack to full blast and feel him powerfully unload his slimy prize in your mouth. Just remember if you mistime it and he cums before you turn it on full power, don't forget all together while you are concentrating on catching his sperm. The vibrating egg also works good in his asshole but be sure you put a rubber on it so it doesn't break off.\n\nBlack and Blue Balled\n\nThis technique is about very light abuse to the balls when your guy cums. I know there are people who get into stomping, piercing, abusing balls and I don't judge, but for me, that is not my style. I do think that gentle tapping, tugging, cupping, in certain situations does enhance orgasm. The guy you're sucking needs to have his balls dangling or hanging for this technique to be affective. He will need to be in the standing position, sitting on the edge of his chair or couch, or him on his knees. Sucking or licking a man's balls is great foreplay and he will like the sensation as long as you are gentle. If you have one or both of his nuts in your mouth and you suck too hard, it has the sensation of racking him up which is not good. Many people pay attention to the balls before and during sex but seldom include the balls during orgasm.\n\nI used to have sex with this black football player in college. His name was Vincent Michael and all his friends called him Vinny. To date, he had the largest cock I have ever pleasured if you count length with girth. It measured twelve and one eighth inches from the base to the end of his huge pink head. It was as fat as a Pringles can like I mentioned in one of my previous writings. Vinny also had huge balls. I would compare them to the size of tennis balls and they were close together like a figure eight but hung lower than most. He loved when I gave them a tongue bath before I gave him head. He liked to stand with his nuts hanging and have me put something around them to supply a little pressure. I used many things to tie them up such as rubber bands, two bread ties put together, I'm not sure but I think I used a string one time and this rubber cock ring I bought at an adult store. It is a good thing it could really stretch. Vinny liked when I held those tied up balls with my palm while I sucked him. This was always a little bit of a dilemma because when I suck a large cock, I like to use two hands for the messaging and stroking. I would just alternate back and forth and when Vinny started to cum, he would yell out, \"smack em or get em,\" and one other thing that I can't remember and I knew this meant he loved to have has balls lightly smacked in an upward motion as he came. It really wasn't easy to do all this at one time. Here I am with a guy's huge dick that I can barely fit in my mouth, trying to suck it without scraping my teeth, barely getting my one hand around it, while slapping his balls with my other hand, Vinny jerking and twitching violently, all the while trying not to choke on this gushing river of spunk blasting in my mouth. When you are done with something like that, you are exhausted.\n\nI also stayed with this guy and his girlfriend for a while in college and he loved to have his balls tugged while he was cumming. We all three used to experiment and his girlfriend loved it. Bob liked the added sensation of having his balls tugged or jostled whether I was blowing him or when he was fucking me. Obviously it was rare that I could tug on them while fucking unless he had my legs behind my head and I could reach down or sometimes if I was in a standing, bent over position where I could reach between both of our legs. When I sucked Bob off, I would caress those balls but the instant he started cumming, I would take the sack between the balls with my thumb in front and my middle finger in back and start pulling down. I would pull the sack but careful not to grab the nuts. He said it made his orgasms much more powerful. His cock was long but not too terribly thick and I was able to deep throat him while I did this and it drove him wild. I would have his cock all the way down my throat while my lips were touching his pubic hair as I tugged his nuts. Sometimes it would choke me but most of the time; he would cum so hard he would be the one choking.\n\nGreat Balls of Fire\n\n\"Great Balls of Fire\" is a term that I use for anything that warms up a man's testicles and that feels great during orgasm. Don't make the mistake and think anything that has menthol in it and artificially warms skin up feels good. It doesn't. Stay away from Vicks vapor rub, BioFreeze or like products, and lotions that contains artificial temperature stimulants like cinnamon or alcohol. These may start out feeling good, but you will be wiping them off well before the orgasm. Warm water, heating pads, and the one of the best things to use is a tied wool sock full of white rice. Put it in the microwave for about a minute and it will stay warm for a very long time. That warm contrast on a man's balls causes them to naturally pull away from his body and makes all the sperm inside become more active. Remember, women who want to want to increase their chance of becoming pregnant should have her man's balls loose and warm.\n\nI have tried a few ways to warm a variety of men's balls up while I blew them. I have put a stool in a hot tub or bath tub with his balls hanging submerged in the warm water and his hard cock sticking straight up out of the water for me to suck; I've had men sit in a chair facing the wall and close enough they could put their feet up on the wall and I put the warm rice filled sock underneath their nuts as I sucked them off. On a side note, be sure you have a secure chair because one time, I was doing this technique and as the guy started to blow his load, he locked his legs out and the chair tipped over and he fell on his back. He ended up cumming all over his stomach and chest. We both had a good laugh.",
        "One time I took a long tube sock and cut the toes out. I took one end and attached them around my lover's balls with my cock ring and attached the other end to the hair dryer with a rubber band. He was sitting on a foot stool and I turned the hairdryer on low (be sure to test it out so it doesn't burn him) while I left it sitting on the floor. It sure didn't take him long to cum. Another ball warming technique is to use a heating pad. Take a pair of his briefs or an athletic supporter that he doesn't mind ruining. Cut a small hole out in the front so you can pull his dong out through the hole. Take the heating pad (on low) and place it under his balls inside his underwear or jock. As long as you are close to a plug-in or have an extension cord, you can use this technique in almost any position. I like for him to be on his hands and knees and me underneath him. I will either pull his dick down where it's pointing toward the floor as I suck it or he will lower himself down to be able to fuck my mouth. It does help to have a long cock to do this better but I have done this with smaller cocks as well. Either way he will cum really hard in your mouth or give you a major facial. You can also cut a hole in the back of the briefs and have a little ass play for a double whammy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">Head Games</p>\n\nWe all know when a man is fully erect; his penis head is all puffed up like an umbrella, helmet, or mushroom. A man's cock head is made up of many nerve endings and if you work it over properly, you will have him ejaculating in no time. Having said that, there is only so much you can do with a penis head. We have all performed the standard foreplay mouthing of that mushroom by sucking it and popping our mouth off very quickly, or taking our tongue and licking the head along with the rim underneath the helmet, or just trying to stick our tongue in his hole and dig out the pre cum like we are using a shovel. We have all done those things. There are a couple of things that can be done with the head as your man cums from a blowjob.\n\nMy Friend Flicker\n\nThis technique is physically not easy to perform, so you really only start it right before he cums. If you try to do this throughout the blowjob, your tongue will wear out and you will have to quit anyway. This position only works if you are lower than him. He can be standing and you on your knees, or he can be sitting down on something and you are between his legs or you can be on your back and he can be over top of you, on his knees, straddling your face. The reason you have to be under him is because you are going to flick your tongue very quickly in the grove under the cock head that comes together like the top of a heart shape. That area is very sensitive. You suck his cock like you are giving a standard blowjob and when he is just about to cum, take two fingers and put them on top of the shaft, your thumb on the bottom vein on the shaft, and stick your tongue in that groove and start flicking in and out very quickly. If he is uncircumcised, then you may have to pull some of the foreskin back if it keeps sliding down over the head. While you are flicking, take your two fingers and thumb and very slowly stroke the cock with short movements. When he starts ejaculating, be sure you keep the flicking and stroking going until he completely finishes so not disrupt the orgasm.\n\nThere are some common mistakes with this technique and I have made every one of them. The first mistake is when a guy starts cumming, it is very tempting not to want to wrap your whole hand around his cock and jerk it. You have to remain steadfast with the slow finger stroking as he is unloading. The exception to that is if he grabs his own dick and starts jacking it as he cums. If that happens, just move your hand, let him beat it out but keep that tongue going if you can. Another mistake that is commonly made is you will have your head too low or tilted at the wrong angle and his load will end up all over your face which isn't a total waste but if you have your mouth wide open and properly angled, most of it will end up in your mouth but there will still be spillage. I've had guys shoot their load over my head onto the floor, I've been hit in the eye, and one time I even had the guy's first shot go up my nose. The more you do it, the better you become at judging his aim. Some guys will shoot hard, some medium, and some are just oozers and once you learn him you will be more successful. No matter where his spunk ends up, he will really enjoy the powerful head orgasm you just gave him. You just might have a lot more to clean up.\n\nThe Rim Rocker\n\nThis title is not referring to basketball. The \"Rim Rocker\" would definitely fall under the handjob category just as much if not more than a blowjob even though there is a lot of sucking involved. As I stated earlier, as we all know, the rim is that area under the cock head before you get to the shaft. You can do this technique in any position but I find the best position is with him lying on his back and your cheek is laying on his stomach with his prick underneath pointing up to your mouth. Cocks are similar to snowflakes in such a way that no two are the same. Some guys love this technique and some guys, not so much because their penis head is too sensitive. Once again you have to learn your lover. You start out by wrapping your whole hand around his dick with a decent grip but not too tight. Now pull all his skin down away from his head until it is very tight (if he is uncut, you will have more skin to pull down) and just hold it there. Now his cock head is completely exposed. You proceed to suck his cock for a while to build him up without moving your hand. You then want to suck the head hard like a baby trying to get milk out of a bottle. If you do this long enough, his head will get really swollen and puffed up. That is good because it will now be more sensitive to pleasure. You slide your hand up without allowing the skin to come back with it until you have gotten your thumb and index finger wrapped around his member and pushed snugly right up under that swollen rim. Now you start jerking his cock with your hand butted up under the rim in very short quick strokes and be careful not to allow the skin to come back. Also you don't want to rub your hand over top the head too much. Have your mouth ready to catch his wad but if this technique starts to tickle his head, then start licking the tip to balance out the sensation. In that position you will be able to watch his toes lock up as he blasts in your mouth or face. I would have to say about eighty percent of the guys I've blown liked it, some could take it or leave it and couple of them hated it. It just depends on the guy. The girl who taught it to me said her boyfriend loved it so much that he wanted her to do it most of the time.\n\n<p align=\"center\">The Shaft</p>\n\nThe Heat is On\n\nI discussed earlier about heating up your partner's balls to enhance orgasm and this also applies to the cock in general. Heat boosts stimulation because of the increased blood flow throughout the genitals. I wrote about how good if feels for your man to get sucked off in a hot tub or warm bathtub. Get some flavored or edible oil and wrap a heating pad around it until it gets very warm or soak the bottle in hot water (do not use a microwave because it gets hotter in spots or it will explode). Now the oil is warm, it is ready. You can use any position for this but it is best to set the atmosphere like you are going to give him a message. There needs to be soothing sounds in the background, have him completely naked and start with a towel wrapped around him, have some silk or nice comfortable sheets for him to sit or lie on, be sure the air temperature in the room is warm and comfortable, and finally you want there to be dim lights. You remove his towel and guide him to sit or lay down. Start with a slow message of different parts of his body eventually stopping at his cock. Be sure not to use the warm oil for anything until the end. Take hold of his dick and stroke it slowly, eventually wrapping your lips around it. Suck him very slowly and sensually. If you can deep throat, be sure to do that a few times. After you have him rock hard and worked up, take the warm bottle of oil and squirt it on his cock and the warm sensation will feel great. Proceed with the blowjob until he releases all his pent up sperm in your mouth. He will love this one. I have never had a guy yet not love it.\n\nI will tell you another heated place that is very erotic and that is a sauna or steam room. I am not talking about the ole clich\u00e9 bath houses of the 70s and 80s. I am talking about a modern day sauna. There is a huge problem with this because it is not very accessible for sex without getting arrested. I was at a conference about 5 years ago in Anaheim, California and I stayed at a five star hotel which shall remain nameless. I met a guy at the conference who later I found out was staying there also. We had sex every night the whole week and most nights, twice. We got to know the night shift desk worker and eventually he gave us a key to the sauna about three in the morning on three separate occasions after it had been long closed for the evening. We would strip and go in there and sit for a good half hour before we would have any type of sex. We would be dripping in sweat and we would suck each other off and the last night we fucked like wild animals. The sweat was a clean natural sweat and not a stinky workout type of sweat. I really enjoyed licking the sweat off his balls and cock before I gave him a blowjob. We both came so hard, each and every time and the heat was a great aphrodisiac.\n\nFire and Ice\n\nYou will always hear people say things about sucking cock after you have eaten ice or drank something warm. The ice thing is overrated because nobody is going to continually eat ice and suck someone off. Second, the ice has a great first shock sensation but eventually becomes uncomfortable. However, if used properly you can give a great blowjob to a powerful orgasm. Cocks love warmth, but a cold contrast is great and can heighten the warmth. You will need two cups. One should be with some crushed ice and the other should be very warm tea, coffee, or cocoa. Make sure you are comfortable and can reach both easily. Suck his dick without each element in the beginning. Suck him long enough to get him close. Now you get a mouth full of crushed ice and swallow, then suck up and down a few times, then take a big drink of the warm liquid, then suck about twice as long as you did with the ice. Keep alternating the extremes but each time stay on it a little longer after the warm drink. You have to make sure you have enough of both, be careful not to hurt your teeth with the contrasting temperatures, and when you sense he is right on the verge of cumming, stay on his cock with your mouth and finish him off. Almost always, after the warmth is when he will shoot it but I had it happen one time where the guy came after the ice. His cock was a decent size but he had a very large head and when I put my cold mouth on him for the last time, he just blasted off without warning and nearly choked me. I do remember he was one of those guys who would hold the back of your head down when he came to make sure you stayed on it.\n\nAnother hot and cold contrast that will enhance a blowjob orgasm is when the room temperature is colder than your mouth. You take your man into a cold room or outside where it is cold. I have even done this a few times when snow was on the ground back in my hometown. Make sure you both are bundled up and comfortable. If you are out on a cold porch or standing in the snow, have him take his pants off but obviously keep his shoes on. The only skin that should be exposed is his legs, ass and cock. Of course his balls will shrink and contract closer to his body. Find a comfortable spot and start sucking away. You can also use the warm cup of liquid without any ice. You will be surprised how good a blowjob feels with a warm mouth on your meat compared to the cold around it. When I was in high school, my blowjob buddies and I would go out into the woods in the wintertime (on separate occasions, not all at one time) and I would have them pull their pants down to their snow boots, exposing very little, lean against a tree for leverage while I sucked them off. I realize they were young, but all of them said the cold really strengthened their orgasm inside my warm mouth and it did not take any of them long at all to shoot. The only drawback to this is you will need to wear gloves because you don't want to touch a hard cock or an ass with cold hands. I used a moveable log to sit on and I would put my hands on the back of their thighs where their pants were still bunched up. It was erotic in the woods because it felt like we were sneaking and when they would cum, they could scream out and it would echo without anyone hearing, which really turned me on.\n\nThe Coke Bottle\n\nWhat happens if you take a bottle of coke and shake it up? You use that same theory on a cock. Any position will work it but I like for the guy to be lying down. Take the hard cock and pull it down until it is pointing directly to the ceiling. Be sure you are high enough over his dick so you can comfortably jerk it and switch off to sucking it without much trouble. I usually get up on my knees especially if he has a long cock. The idea is to give the dick two distinctive sensations but alternate them for the same length of time. I always start out with the sucking first so I can use my saliva as lubrication. When you perform this technique, be sure you keep his dick at the same angle so it does not change up the sensation.\n\nPut your open palm on his stomach, using the side of your index finger to hold the dick in place. You are going to bob up and down on and jerk it just a little faster than usual but not at the same time. I like to suck up and down on him about 8-10 strokes and then jerk up and down 8-10 strokes. Just keep alternating doing this like you are shaking up a soda can. Remember to hold and suck lightly but quickly. Stay consistent. Don't suck 12 strokes and jack 7. He will build up slowly in the beginning and all of a sudden he will detonation without warning. The great thing about this technique is you can verbally encourage him every time you switch to the jerking. This one is unpredictable when it comes to knowing if he will cum by your hand or mouth. In my experience, it is usually 60/40 with the mouth but still unpredictable. Most men will push their feet into to bed or couch and lift their ass off the surface right before the shoot but it is still unpredictable. My current boyfriend loves this technique and he actually uses his hands and feet to lift himself off the bed as he fills my mouth up with his cum.\n\nAl-tug-nator\n\nA form of this technique is commonly used during a blowjob. You use your hand and mouth simultaneously on his cock rather than switching on and off, like the \"coke bottle.\" Most often the blower is basically jerking the cock off while they suck. This technique synchronizes the hand and mouth so they are working as a team. Whichever direction your mouth is moving then your hand stokes the opposite direction. When your mouth goes down on his dick, your hand strokes up so that your hand and lips meet then as your mouth comes up on the shaft, your hand goes down toward his body. It feels awkward in the beginning but don't squeeze or suck too hard and it will create a wonderful combination causing him to blow his load in no time.\n\nI'll be Dammed\n\nI discussed this technique in my first writing about giving blowjobs. The concept of \"damming\" a cock is that while you are sucking your man off, right before he cums, you grip his penis as tight as you can causing the semen to stop flowing up the tube which causes it to build up or \"dam up.\" Then after a slight delay, you start jerking it off in a rhythmic, pulsating motion, causing the balled up cum to spurt out all at once. This technique is very difficult to perform because there are a few things that have to be timed perfectly and they all have to go right. If you ever watch porn, you will see a form of this when a guy pumping away and he pulls out and you watch him hold his cock until the other person gets down on their knees so he can give them a facial. First, you have to have great communication with your partner. He has to let you know the moment he is about to cum because if you dam him to soon, he will lose his orgasm and that is called \"ruining his orgasm,\" and if you dam him too late, he will already have started squirting and that will also ruin his orgasm. Second, if you dam him too long, then he will lose his orgasm once again but you will be able to start over and he will receive the same amount of pleasure the second or third go round. Finally, you have to be prepared for his cum. About 90 percent of his spunk will all shoot out on the first shot which will make one gigantic wad and the rest of his spasms will have very little fluid in it.\n\nIf you are not ready for that, it can choke you. I suggest you jack yourself off a few times to practice and the first time you try it on your partner, don't have him ejaculate in your mouth so you can watch it. If performed and timed correctly, this technique will cause your man to literally scream out in pleasure. The best position for damming is with him sitting and you between his legs but above his hard on. Obviously it is more difficult to perform on thicker cocks but it can be done. If I can do this to Vinny, then it can be done to anyone.\n\nOle Glory... hole\n\nYou read stories all the time about sucking off strangers through glory holes and yes it can happen occasionally but it rarely happens and if you do have the opportunity, you have no idea where the cocks on the other side have been or how disgusting the other guy may be. I have only used the traditional glory hole 2 times (all at the same location) and that was my freshman year in college. There was an older softball complex where all the intramural college softball teams used to play and there was a main bathroom by the concession stand and then there was an older bathroom that sat out beyond left field that wasn't used much. I caught wind of seedy things happening out there and one evening I went there to check it out. I couldn't believe there were about 5 guys hanging around there like it was nothing. I go in and it smelled like old cum which in some ways was very disgusting and some ways very exciting.\n\nThere were two stalls and I learned that if you wanted to get sucked, you went to the last one by the wall and if you were going to suck you entered the one by the urinal. There was nobody in either stall so I went into the sucking stall and sat down on the toilet with the lid closed. There were two holes and one was about a foot higher than the other one. Being young and na\u00efve, I learned quickly that the higher one was just for taller guys. It wasn't long before I heard the outside door open, a young man walked into the next stall, I could hear his pants unzip and I saw them fall to the ground. His underwear followed shortly thereafter and I could see his half erect cock pop through the glory hole. Besides not being very big, I noticed it had an elongated head. I sucked it and it became rock hard and not very long after that I could hear the stall barrier thumping around and this guy grunting like a wild hog. This small cock let out a load that to this day, has to be in the top two or three of my all-time amounts produced after all the blowjobs I have given. It was right up there with my current lover's burst when I first used the \"green hornet\" on him and my 18 year old neighbor I used to suck off in his bedroom.",
        "That is the thing about sucking off young guys, they can cum extremely quick. I also learned that dick size has no correlation to amount of semen produced during orgasm. This guy was extremely horny. My mouth was completely full of this guy's spunk. I didn't know if I should spit it or just swallow. I went ahead and swallowed it and it actually didn't taste bad. Another guy entered and I sucked him off as well. It was uneventful. I left after that and the one thing that stands out in my mind about that experience is nobody said a word the whole time. I went back one other time and was worried I might get arrested and after blowing one guy, I never went back.\n\nIt can be fun and erotic to make your own artificial \"glory hole\" for your partner. Of course you can cut holes in large pieces of cardboard or get the sheets of large Styrofoam insulation at Lowe's and use those as your own personal glory holes but I am going to tell you about a glory hole technique that I like to use. All you basically need is a shower curtain, pillows and a coffee table. You have to have a coffee table that is hollow underneath and you throw the shower curtain over in like a table cloth. You cut a hole in the \"table cloth\" for his cock to fit through. I use a shower curtain because the density doesn't allow the curtain to mover back and forth when he is thrusting in and out. Make sure the hole is big enough for the same reason. If he is going to stay still and you are going to do all the work, then you can even use a blanket or sheet. I crawl under the table and put a blanket on my legs so it appears nothing is there. My partner gets on his knees, fits his dick through the hole and then I prop myself up with some pillows until I am the right height. I don't get too close so he doesn't gag me. He puts his hands on the coffee table for leverage and after I have sucked him awhile, he will start thrusting and fucking my mouth. Be sure you keep your teeth out of the way and get a towel because this technique produces a lot of saliva and it will be soaking wet underneath your face when he is finished. Keep your mouth grip fairly loose in which I will explain a little better in the next section. Most guys will tap on the table or verbally cue you when they are about to cum so not to catch you by surprise. This anonymity strengthens orgasm.\n\nLoose Lips Sink Dicks\n\nThis technique is represented frequently when someone is hand gesturing a blowjob and they have their hand in a circular figure, moving it toward and away from their mouth, and using their tongue to push out on their cheek to represent the dick head pushing it out. Most of the time when you suck dick, you will grip it snuggly, but not too tight, with your mouth. However, as you are trying to mix it up, in this technique, just barely put your mouth on his dong as you blow him. As long as he isn't too large, this will give you room to use your tongue more on the shaft as you're going down which gives him variety in texture. This feels great for him but be careful because I have had that surprise ejaculation on more than one occasion that gets caught in my throat because my tongue isn't protecting it. Also when you use the loose lips technique, you can give him a \"sloppy\" blowjob like many men like. That involves a lot of saliva and as I stated in the glory hole section, you will need a towel down for the cleanup. The loose lip blowjob also allows him to fuck your mouth more comfortably no matter the angle because it is difficult to always get that perfect angle. You just have to be careful and keep those teeth out of the way.\n\nTwist and Shout\n\nThis technique also falls under mostly the handjob category, but can be used at the end of a blowjob. I like for the guy to be lying down with his cock sticking straight up to the ceiling but with his head propped up so he can see. After I have sucked him for a long time and lubed up his shaft with my saliva, I take a hold of it with my hand right at the base or bottom of the shaft. I stroke up and down in a spiral motion like the red stripe on a candy cane. While I am doing this at a slow pace, I lightly kiss and lick his cock head. The visual along with the feel will have him erupting in no time. I am a swallower, so I like to put my mouth on it as he is cumming but you may like to see him shoot all over your face or on himself. I use this technique when a guy is drunk or is older and may take longer to cum. One of my first sexual encounters was an older man that lived on my street named Kelvin who showed me this technique but I will discuss this adventure some other time.\n\nThe Skins Game\n\nThis technique centers on sucking off an uncircumcised cock. Depending on where you live or visit, will determine the likelihood that the next cock you orally please will be uncut. Most men oversees from Europe to Africa are uncircumcised. Ironically, the Nigerian graduate assistant that I blew was circumcised because he was actually born in New Jersey and his parents wanted to live as he stated, \"American way.\" An uncut cock has foreskin that surrounds the shaft and runs all the way up covering the cock head while flaccid or soft. When the cock gets hard, the shaft stretches causing the head to pop out most of the time. I have blown a few dongs that the head never fully came out and one in particular stayed covered up even when completely hard. When I first give head to an uncut prick, I like to start by licking inside the foreskin surrounding the head. I use my hand to pull the skin back like a banana and lightly chew or gum on it for a while until he gets completely hard.\n\nYou can use all that lose foreskin to his advantage. There are many times I don't like to use lube on an uncut cock so that I can slide all that skin up and down while stroking. It has the same concept of when we were young and used to beat off inside a sock or my mother's nylon knee highs. I try to carry over this hand technique into the blowjob. I first make sure my mouth is as dry as I can get it. I will stick the dick in my mouth and clamp down a little tighter than usual with my lips and gums while my teeth are buried far behind both. With my clamped lips, I \"jack him off\" by sliding his skin up and down using only my mouth. The guys I've blown like this, have really loved it but the drawbacks are your mouth gets tired very quickly so you may have to occasionally use your hand and sometimes he will cum inside his skin which can get quite messy. When he is completely finished, I hold him inside my mouth, pull the skin back with my hand, and clean up all the slime before he withdraws. It is kinda like sucking the juice out of a tomato.\n\nThe Artificial Skins Game\n\nIf a guy is circumcised but you want to simulate sucking an uncut cock, there are ways to artificially give him foreskin. My favorite technique is very simple. I use a ribbed condom and some lubrication. Take the rubber and cut the end off of it with scissors. Pinch the cut end and smear some lubrication oil on the inside of the rubber. Put the rubber on your partner's erect cock but slide the open ended section down to the bottom so to expose the cock head. Remember, the lubrication is on the inside of the rubber making it easy to slide it up and down the shaft simulating foreskin. The drawback is you will get the lubrication in your mouth so it is always good to use edible oils like the ones you can buy at adult stores, kitchen products like butter or cooking oil. You can use the technique I described earlier or you can jerk him off in your mouth. It is also good for a facial if he likes that. The sky is the limit.\n\nSweet Tooth\n\nI discussed earlier how putting artificial warming stimulants on a man's balls is just not very pleasurable for him. However, adding a mild warming stimulant to the head or shaft can feel great during orgasm. Adding whip cream, chocolate, or sweat tart dust can be very creative and taste very good on a hard cock. It can be fun licking it off and provides a great visual for the recipient. However those products are mainly for the blower not the blowee. I am trying to give tips on how to make a man cum harder during a blowjob. The criteria of this technique is that it changes a sensation enough, which improves orgasm.\n\nAnything minty, like gum, candy, or breath fresheners can work well on a cock when you're sucking it. Guys really like that warm sensation after you have sucked on it awhile then put a piece in your mouth and crunch it up before going back on his pole. I promise he will be coating the back of your tonsils in no time. The old childhood candy, Pop Rocks, is another great stimulant. These still can be purchased online or vintage candy stores. When added with liquid, they crackle and pop, causing a mild electric current feeling. You need to do this right before he cums. I have only done this once and it was in my friend from high school's barn. We were out there messing around eating pop rocks when we got this idea. His dad had this old rusted car sitting in there and my friend got up on the hood. He had his feet on the front bumper and his shorts only pulled down to his knees in case we had to stop suddenly because someone was coming in. I stood in front of him, leaned over and proceeded to suck that dick of his with reckless abandon. It was not long at all and he mumbled and pointed at the package and that is when I took a mouth full of rocks and followed that up with a mouthful of Mountain Dew. It started popping and fizzing while I started sucking again. He started sliding on the hood as he came violently and of course the Mountain Dew mixed with most of his cum is running down his shaft, on the hood, and on his pants. We had to get the hose and wash down the car and he also had to go in and change his pants.\n\nAsphyxiation... Sort of\n\nI would never recommend auto-asphyxiation orgasms. This is when people hang themselves while beating off in search of a light headed powerful orgasm in which many people have died including celebrities. We can fool our brain into this without the risk. Have you ever blew up a balloon very fast and then got very light headed or woozy? Have your man sit in an easily movable chair with room behind it. Have him hold a few deflated balloons in his hand. He needs to have his pants all the way off with his legs spread very wide. While you are sucking his dick, he is waiting for just the right moment. As soon as he feels the urge to ejaculate, he should start blowing up the balloons very quickly while also trying to stand up (he needs to move the chair back so not to disrupt you on his dick). Blowing up the balloons combined with standing up will create that light headed feeling while he is shooting his load in your mouth. Be cautious because he can get so woozy, he could faint or fall down. I tell my partners beforehand to use their one free hand on my head for balance and I always grab behind their thighs or ass while they are standing up to hold them during orgasm. I always error on the side of caution and just hold them there for a minute or two after they have finished.\n\nGift Wrapped\n\nThis term refers to giving a man a blowjob while he wears a rubber. Now obviously this is not usually a preferred method because it takes away some of the feeling of your warm wet mouth sliding up and down his dick. Occasionally it is a nice variation and it can make less of a mess if you're performing a quickie. You can get more intimate with his cock by putting the condom on for him. Don't forget to use the condoms that are spermicide and lubrication free. Also be sure you put it on for him especially if he is really long, so that you can take your time unrolling it all the way down for effect. I like to try to put it on him with my mouth. I put the rolled up condom in my mouth with the edges between my lips and gums like I am preparing to blow a bubble with bubble gum. After I get it over the head, I gently use my teeth to slowly work it over his shaft. Of course the longer or fatter he is, the more difficult it becomes and you have to take your time and work on it.\n\nOnce you have the rubber on him, you will need to need to lube the cock naturally. Be sure to do three things that compensate for the blocked sensation. The first is to clamp your mouth a little tighter than a standard blowjob to allow him to feel the snugness. The second is to breathe heavily on it to naturally warm it up for him. The third is to use your saliva to your advantage and get that condom covered cock nice and slippery. Now suck his dick like a vacuum cleaner is hooked up to him. Try different techniques on him. There is a big advantage to sucking a dick off inside a rubber and that you will not have to know exactly when he cums because there is no danger of choking on his load. Of course he will be jerking and bucking which tells you that he is unloading but you will not have to change anything with your mouth.\n\nTo be or not to be...his \"rubber\"\n\nThis is more of an idea rather than a technique and it technically only qualifies as a blowjob at the end but I wanted to share it with you. We all know the purpose of a condom or rubber is to barricade the cock and semen from the outside stimulus to prevent pregnancy or disease. I first heard this concept when I was staying with Bob and Brenda and I have to admit, the humiliation and excitement sent my arousal into overdrive. I will tell the detailed story in a later writing but the first time I heard it was a time when Bob was fucking the shit out of Brenda while she was briefly out of birth control pills. The fact that Brenda was gorgeous combined with her saying, \"Mark, get over down here and be Bob's rubber,\" meaning the instant he was cumming, he would pull it out of her and shove it in my mouth, in a sense, using me as his condom to prevent her from getting pregnant. This experience was so erotic that it gave me the idea to use it whether your man is fucking a person or an object then you can be his rubber by allowing him to finish in your mouth.\n\nOf course if you are having a threesome or moresome, this technique is very self-explanatory. I want to share some of my artificial experiences with you. The first experience involves making use out of balloons once again. Purchase the high quality long, tubular balloons. Fill about 4 or 5 of them half full with very warm water. Lay out a couple of towels or do this in the bathtub just in case one of the balloons breaks while you are doing it and that is also why you want extra balloons. I always have him stand or on his knees but you could do this in about any position. I put two warm balloons together and hold them even with my face. He then sticks his cock through the balloons and fucks them just as he would a pair of warm boobs or feet. If he has a long dick, you will be able to put some of it in your mouth, if not; you just need to be ready at a moments notice or use smaller balloons. He fucks these warm balloons until he blows his wad in your mouth. If he has a shorter cock, he will just have to signal you right before cums and jerk off in your mouth which I don't like because he no longer is using the balloons to get off with.\n\nAnother thing I have used for him to fuck is a hollow dildo that I wrap a heating pad around and put it under the mattress with only the entrance sticking out. It is warm and comfortable for his penis and I frequently get under him while he is on his knees fucking it and perform ball or ass play with him until he pulls out and cums in my mouth. I have also used tubing from Christmas wrapping paper, a nylon knee high open inside a paper towel roll, and adult toys such as the Senso Lips and Fleshlight. Be creative but be sure it feels good to your man.\n\nSit and Spin\n\nI was actually the recipient of this one from my ex-wife. Lay a towel on top of your washing machine and have your guy sit on it while you give him head. Suck him until he gets close and then you turn on the machine to the spin cycle. Be sure you keep stroking his cock while you do this so he doesn't lose sensation. When that washer starts spinning, it will provide an awesome vibration to his entire groin area while he is cumming. Be sure to put a few clothes inside to make the tub more unbalanced which will give a stronger vibration during the spin. The drawback is that the spin cycle doesn't last very long so you either need to make sure is on the verge of cumming or you will have to twist the handle all the way around and start it over. I have performed this technique on a couple of guys and one came immediately and the other, I had to reset it twice before he let loose.\n\nDrive a Hummer\n\nOh the hummer. You hear this term used a lot as a slang term for a blowjob but do we really ever do it? Humming while sucking is not the easiest thing to do but can provide stimulation. There are two types of humming. There is the humming that comes from your throat and nose which is used in humming a song and then there is the vibrating or humming that comes from your mouth that you should use when sucking dick. Your man will like this and it will provide a little extra punch to his orgasm but there are two drawbacks. Your mouth will get tired a lot quicker than standard sucking and it becomes more difficult the thicker or fatter your man's cock is. I have done this many times and each time when I have finished, my mouth is completely numb but the guy's reaction after he cums, makes it worth it. I have heard the story of a woman wrapping aluminum foil around the guy's balls or the base of his manhood to catch and enhance the vibration. I have never tried this so I cannot give an opinion.\n\nSword Swallowing\n\nI wrote in an earlier post about deepthroating a cock. I gave specific steps in learning and perfecting this technique so I won't repeat myself for this section. I will repeat that deepthroating dick is not easy and it becomes even more impossible if that dick is thick. If you can deepthroat then this technique is for you. Even if you have mastered getting past the gag reflex, it is still impossible to deepthroat someone the entire blowjob without gagging and that is why you have to strategically use it during important phases. Never start out deepthroating so you can enhance that sensation later on. Deepthroating provides that warm, wet, friction over the entire erect penis which only happens during intercourse.\n\nI like my partner to be sitting or standing when I deepthroat him. I have also done it why he was lying on his back. I will start off by sucking and licking as usual and then go all the way down on him about two or three consecutive times before going back to standard sucking. This usually draws a comment or moan from him. I will suck for a few minutes, then deepthroat a few times and I keep alternating this until he is on the verge. That is when I stop sucking and start jacking him off while I talk dirty to him. I will say things like, \"I am going to swallow your dick down to your balls,\" or \"Tell me when you're going to cum so you can have you shoot your warm sperm directly into my stomach,\" or something nasty like that. When he is ready, I will deepthroat that pole until he starts cumming. He will be jerking and grunting but it is very important to only slightly rock your mouth on a shooting cock that is in your throat because you can easily get choked on his cum. Always remember, the cock can gag you but the cum can choke you. Guys always love to be deepthroated and it will not be long before they ask you to do it again.\n\nHide and Seek\n\nThis technique is also more of a concept rather than just a physical technique. I had a blind friend in high school that would tell me his other senses were heightened because he paid attention more. This gave me the idea of the blind blowjob. You can blindfold your man but the best atmosphere is being in a room or closet that is completely dark and quiet and I mean where you cannot see your hand in front of your face. He needs to be naked and comfortable. Do everything slowly like kiss and lick around his crotch area, paying special attention to his grooves where his legs meet his crotch. Be sure to slowly lick and suck his balls and taint. Eventually slowly give him his warm blowjob but make lots of sucking and slurping noises for effect in the darkness. The total darkness will enhance the stimulation and because he can only feel and hear you sucking that cock, it will help get him off more forcefully.",
        "I hope these techniques can help you blow your man in different ways and give him an earth shattering orgasm in the process. You can use these multiple times, changing them up during the blowjob or use a combination of them. You can use many of them toward the end of the blowjob, right before he gets off. He has entrusted his most prized possession to you and has put his faith in the fact you will be able to do your job and give it the maximum amount of pleasure it until it cums. Remember, mix it up, learn your man and what turns him on, and then work that dick over until he has no choice but to blast off for you. "
