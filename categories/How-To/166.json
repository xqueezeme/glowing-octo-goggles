        "How to Enjoy 69: Getting the Most out of Mutual Oral Sex\n\nWhat is a 69?\n\nThis is considered one of the best oral intercourse positions as it allows both partners to stimulate each other at the same time. Either partner can be on top, but performing fellatio is significantly more difficult when in the bottom position... just remember not to forget to stop and enjoy being on your sides between switching!\n\nThe Steps To Perform The Best 69. \n\nIf at first you don't succeed, well just keep practicing. Practice makes perfect and also enjoyable if you are new to it.\n\n1. Line Up: The \"69\" sex position gets its name from the shape of the numbers. The nine looks like an upside-down six and the two numbers fit snugly together like puzzle pieces. So in order to perform and to receive mutual oral sex, two bodies in the sixty-nine position need to be lying head to toe. Successful mutual oral sex comes from finding the most comfortable way possible for you and your partner to be, well, end-to-end. A basic position involves one partner lying down on top of the other partner so that you're facing each other's genitals. The partner on top can lean on his/her elbows for easier movement of the head, neck and upper body. Lying on your sides facing each other's bodies is another position which can allow for more freedom of movement (you can rest your heads on each other's thighs \u2014 instant pillows!). \n\n2. Around the House: Utilize furniture at home to make 69 easier. Place pillows or cushions under your heads or hips and you'll have easier access to each other's sweet spots. Ramps and Wedges, angled foam cushions made to be used for sex, can also help your positioning. \n\n3. All in the Timing: One criticism of 69-ing is that splitting one's focus between giving and receiving oral sex at once can be distracting. While the concept of mutual oral sex is to give and get, it doesn't necessarily have to happen totally simultaneously. You and your partner can take turns giving and getting stimulation for certain periods of time, so you each get a chance to concentrate solely on creating or receiving sensation. \n\n4. Tune in to your partner. Check in with your partner to ensure that both of you are getting what you want from the sixty-nine position. Listen to your partner for signs she or he is feeling good \u2014 moans, heavy breathing. Take a moment to ask quick yes-or-no questions \u2014 nothing complicated. A single-word question will do: \"Harder?\", \"More?\", \"Faster?\", etc. Encourage your partner to do the same for you, or just speak up to get what you want.\n\n5. Accessorize! You can also mix things up by using your hands and toys along with your mouth; try small wireless vibrators as they both fit right on a finger to easily use on clits, vulvas, penises and testicles alike. You can also use dildos, butt plugs. \n\n6. Enjoy the ride. Remember to take your time with 69 - it's not a race to see who can come first! (And if you do come first, make sure your partner has your full attention afterward.) Take your time and enjoy making your partner feel great and vice-versa. Make the act more of a tease and even a challenge with a blindfold or handcuffs wrist restraints. For handjobs or vaginal penetration during 69, try silicone lube like Eros bodyglide, which is super-concentrated to last and last. \n\nADVANTAGES OF HER ON TOP\n\n\u2022 She has control because she's on top. \n\n\u2022 She can move her vagina deep into your mouth as she pleases. \n\n\u2022 You can use your fingers to explore within while you suck on her vagina like a human vacuum. \n\nDISADVANTAGES OF HER ON TOP\n\n\u2022 Depending on how much she weighs, she can possibly cut off the circulation in your body, hence turning your solid member into a flailing leaf. \n\n\u2022 You have less control over the situation (use a pillow to keep your head propped up). \n\n\u2022 She may tire quickly from having to lean on her elbows or hands. \n\n\u2022 She might end up having rug burns on her knees from the friction (something to remember you by).\n\nMANS TIME TO SHINE\n\n\u2022 Now if you're the one on top, things change somewhat. First off, you'll be leaning into her sweet treat and your face will be in immediate contact with her clitoris (yum yum). You can take things at a slower pace and lick her from the clitoris to the end of her vagina.\n\nShe, on the other hand, can put your member deep down her throat. And since her hands are free, she will have more liberty to maneuver and venture into areas like the Male G-Spot. \n\nADVANTAGES\n\n\u2022 You have a lot of control in this given position. \n\n\u2022 She can venture around your body parts in ways like never before. \n\n\u2022 You can ram your member down her throat at will \n\nDISADVANTAGES\n\n\u2022 You could suffocate her easily if your pleasure takes over your realistic train of thought. \n\n\u2022 You might strain your neck if you keep struggling to lick her deep within. \n\n\u2022 Once she puts your penis in her mouth, she could have a hard time getting it out considering you'll probably have a tendency to want to keep it in there.\n\nSIDE BY SIDE\n\nThis is probably the best 69 position to ever come about. Men and women alike rant and rave about what a wonderful and viable position it is. \n\nIn this position, you and your woman lay in opposite directions but side by side. Thus, your face, as usual, will be in direct contact with her vagina, and her face will be facing The Ladies' Fan (or penis if you like). \n\nBecause no one is putting their weight on the other, this position remains comfortable and you can even look at one another while doing your thing. You're not dominating the situation and neither is she -- it's perfectly equal. \n\nADVANTAGES\n\n\u2022 You don't have to worry about hurting her with your weight. \n\n\u2022 You can use your hand to rub the outline of her body or rub her breasts, nipples, tummy, and all that good stuff. \n\n\u2022 She can rub her hand down your back and massage your thighs in the midst of her private performance. \n\n\u2022 You can watch her inhale you \n\nDISADVANTAGES\n\n\u2022 There may be a lot of fluid dripping down the side of your face (but for most, that's not such a disadvantage after all). \n\nAnd so there you have it. The world's most popular number finally realized and defined in detail. Remember, when you orgasm, don't forget about her; instead hold her tight or suck her juices until she yells out in ecstasy. "
