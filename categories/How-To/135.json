        "What\u2019s in a name? \nMore than you might think, actually. Can you imagine if the hero in Raiders of the Lost Ark was named Kenny Miller instead of Indiana Jones? Or if Dorothy Gale had been Libby Lieberman? \n\nWhether you\u2019re writing an erotic, intergenerational saga, or just a simple description of a sexual encounter, character names are important. They imbue your characters with a certain flavor all their own and can enhance all the personality traits you develop in the course of your story. If you choose a name that grates against the character\u2019s disposition, your readers will feel a vague annoyance each and every time that name comes up. \n\nHypothetical question for ya\u2019--what if I\u2019m writing a true story about my significant other and me?\nThat\u2019s great. Many people write stories for Literotica based on fantasies they\u2019ve had since high school, or to mentally live out a recurring daydream they have about a co-worker. If you want to keep your real names for that extra thrill that you, and maybe your sweetie, will get every time you read it, go for it. \n\nBut take into consideration that someday the truth might come out.  Whomever you\u2019re writing about might not appreciate the fact that you\u2019ve been fantasizing about doing her in the X-rated theater, so you might want to \"change the names to protect the innocent.\"\n\nI\u2019ve heard that some people just assign a name at random, intending to change it later. Anything wrong with that?\nNot at all. If that method works for you, then you should keep using it. Writing is completely individual, and you may find unique routines that are successful for you. However, I think you should take the time to find a character\u2019s name right off the bat. \n\nFor me, naming a character is much like choosing a name for a baby, except that I get to choose the baby\u2019s personality. (In fact, I\u2019ll get into baby name books later.) When I start a story, I find it helpful knowing what my main characters\u2019 names are. It helps clarify their natures for me, which makes it easier to write about them and to decide what their courses of action will be in the plot.\n\nBaby name books?? \nYes, baby name books. Although they\u2019re meant for expectant parents, they\u2019re also excellent resources for writers with nameless characters. I picked up Baby Names from the Bible,  a pocket baby name book by the check-out at the grocery store because it had some unusual names in it. But if you\u2019re going to be writing a lot, I\u2019d suggest splurging on a more comprehensive list. The one I use most is The Best Baby Name Book in the Whole Wide World by Bruce Lansky. It doesn\u2019t quite live up to its name, but it\u2019s not bad. \n\nI have another interesting name source called, The Writer\u2019s Digest Character Naming Sourcebook, in which the names are listed according to their ethnic origin. So, if you have your heart set on a certain nationality, you instantly have a large list from which to choose.\n\nSo, what do I do? Just close my eyes and point?\nGood heavens, no. And I wouldn\u2019t suggest picking your favorite name either. Here are some suggestions on what to do.\n<OL>\n<LI>Think about your character\u2019s personality. Is she prissy, proper, and devout? I\u2019d think about Mary, Sarah, Abigail, and I\u2019d reject Delilah, Lolita, and Serena. Is your hero mean and sadistic? Then Danny, Biff, or Bruce might not be the best choice. That\u2019s not to say that you can\u2019t make a Mary a slutty cocksucker.  If you\u2019re a good writer, you definitely can. Just be careful.</LI>\n<LI>Say the name out loud. Listen to see if it has hard sounds (k, g, t, d, b, p, j, etc.) or soft sounds (sh, th, s, h, l, v, m, n, w, r, etc.) A hard-hearted person might be better off with a hard name. Villains often have names with sibilant sounds. </LI>\n<LI>Be wary also of having two major characters that share a common first initial. Strange as it may seem, sometimes readers have trouble distinguishing between the father, Michael, and the best friend, Matthew. </LI>\n<LI>Just as words have connotations, so do names. \"Skip,\" is obviously a preppy, yacht-sailing kind of guy. \"Bertha\" is a large woman with facial hair and a voice like a foghorn. Use this to your advantage. If you want a character to fit a certain stereotype, you might want to use a name that carries that same feeling.</LI></OL>\nHow do YOU choose a name?\nAs I said, I use the baby name book. Sometimes I start with A and skim the pages until I find something I like. Sometimes I know the name I want right off the bat. Sometimes I have to name an incidental character, and I turn to my bookshelf, the phone book, or a magazine\u2019s editorial staff list, and mix up names from there. I sometimes think of students I\u2019ve had in the past (I\u2019m a teacher.) and take a first name from one person and a last name from another. The Bible, literary classics, myths, and movies are all good sources for names. \n \nWhich ever method you end up using, take some time to make sure the name fits. I\u2019ve taken an hour before to find the right name and not thought a minute of that time was wasted. Then again, I\u2019m sort of anal about my writing.  You don\u2019t have to go that far, but don\u2019t necessarily use the first name that pops into your head.\n\nGood luck with your writing. I\u2019m off to write about Mary, the Slutty Cocksucker!"
