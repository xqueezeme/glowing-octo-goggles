        "Guys, women usually approach sex from a different perspective then we do. Let me briefly try to explain the difference. \n\nFor most guys sex is about the physical contact and action. For most men the approach is....I kissed her once, now let's get the clothes off and get to the real action. \"I don't need no stinking foreplay, foreplay is for pussy's and I'm a man\" so lets start with the hardcore sex\".\n\nAnd you know what, you pretty much have that exactly right....foreplay is for pussies. For the approximately 3,000,000,000 women on this planet it is absolutely essential for a great experience. \n\nFor women, the physical act of intercourse is like the last course in a seven course meal. But that last course really isn't all that good if you didn't have the first six to set it up. \n\nFor women, 85 - 90% of great sex is creating the mood, setting the atmosphere, getting mentally and physically ready to have a series of mind blowing orgasm's; and the remaining 15% is the actual physical acts (intercourse, oral, toys, etc..).\n\nIf you only want to be with a woman once, get your rocks off, and then be talked about in a bad way to all her girlfriends....and build a reputation as a poor lover, stick with the guy's way of thinking about sex. \n\nIf you want her cumming (pun intended) back for more, telling her girlfriends you are a stud in bed, and building up a reputation as being a great lover, you need to focus on the 85% and master the final 15%....especially the art of eating pussy.\n\nLet's face it -- guys that get to the point with a woman where the physical acts of sex occur, always get their rocks off. It may not be a mind blowing experience that will make you want to come back for more, but you'll cum one way or the other. \n\nFor women, they could potentially spend a couple of hours going through the physical motions of sex, and leave absolutely frustrated, sore, pissed-off; having never come even close to having a single, tiny little orgasm...let alone the body rocking one they were hoping for when they started. \n\nAnd that usually happens because we screwed up the 85% and didn't really do very well in the remaining 15% area either. The Pussy - what are we really talking about\n\nI was quite intrigued to discover that most women have never really examined their pussies or know what they are made of. I'm sure most men are probably in the same department. Before I really start talking about eating pussy, I thought it might be a good idea to provide a little perspective so we're all talking about the same thing. \n\nI can tell you one thing for certain. Pussies are like roses, they are absolutely beautiful, and no two are exactly the same. Sure, they have the same parts, but every pussy looks a little different and everyone acts a little different and, fortunately, everyone feels a little different. Guys, that last sentence is absolutely critical to your success to making the woman you are with experienc mind altering orgasm's. Every pussy responds to you differently. They may be subtle differences, or they could be major. \n\nFor example, one woman's clit might really need to be taken to task in-order for her to have that mind blowing orgasm while the next ladies clit is so sensitive that simply blowing on it gently will be all she can take. \n\nBecause of this, you can't let your mind wander when you are eating pussy, you have to pay attention to how your lady is acting, and reacting to what you are doing.\n\nNow, let's talk a little bit about a pussy so that we have a common frame of reference for the rest of our discussions. \n\nFirst, no two are the same and about 70% of all women have never really looked at their pussies, or have really taken enough time to look at one to know if it is beautiful or not, they just assume it is gross. \n\nAgain, there are 3,000,000,000 women on the planet and I would venture to say that if we took all the women in their sexual prime, took pictures of their pussies and ran them through a pussy identification software program, we wouldn't find any two that looked exactly the same...and I'm not sure any two would act the same under your touch. \n\nI know all the pussies I've seen in the last 30 years were each unique in their own special way, and I've never seen any two look the same in pictures or movies. But they are all beautiful, and if clean, they all taste great!!! So, here are the key body parts that you need to know about in your journey to mastering eating pussy.\n\nMons -- pubis: pussy hair (although some women these days are shaved).\n\nHood of the clitoris: just what it sounds like, a hood of flesh that covers the clit.\n\nClitoris: The clit -- the absolute center of the universe when it comes to 99.9% of all mind altering orgasm's.\n\nLabia Majora: The outer (or large) pussy lips Labia Minora: The inner pussy lips\n\nVaginal Opening: what most men think of as the pussy: the channel to the inside\n\nPerineum: vulgarly called 'the taint' cause it 'taint pussy', and it 'taint ass'.\n\nAnus: The butt hole.\n\nWith the exception of the pussy hair, every part mentioned is sensitive to the touch, and if touched properly, can leave your woman exhausted from multiple orgasms. \n\nBut, we are far ahead of ourselves. If you remember from the introduction, 85% of good sex for a woman is in the foreplay, and probably 70% of that has to happen before she's willing to take her clothes off and give you an opportunity to play with her pussy. \n\nFor the sake of this story I'm going to assume that you and your special lady friend have made it past the roadblocks and she is seriously considering making love with you. Or you have made love before and she wants you to improve your 'A' game. \n\nPerspective -\n\nGuys, I think we all want basically the same thing here. On the continuum from fantastic lover to uncaring and clueless, we want to be on the fantastic lover end of the scale...and our women want us to be there also. \n\nWe want to be great lovers. Women want men who are great lovers. Whether it is with that one special lady; or having a reputation among the ladies that you know what you are doing when it comes to satisfying a woman's sexual needs and desires, everyone wants to be on the fantastic end. But I have news for you, most of us aren't. \n\nAgain, I'll go back to what I said earlier. Men and women think about making love and sex differently. For men, it is sex, the end game, the actual physical act where dicks and pussies are being stroked and caressed that determines whether the woman is great in bed or not. \n\nFor women, it is making love, it is the journey, the foreplay, the anticipation, the excitement, the passion, the buildup, the seven course meal, and then the icing on the cake...everything leading up to the actual physical intercourse is as important, and in most cases more important than the actual physical act of intercourse. \n\nThe most important ingredients in deciding whether you are a great lover, an average lover, or totally clueless and uncaring lies in how well you do before the actual intercourse starts. Yes, you have to give her that mind blowing orgasm to ace the final exam and be considered a fantastic lover, but if it's just wham, bam, thank you ma'am, you'll be in the average to uncaring range on the continuum, and none of us wants to be there.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, there are times when a woman is super horny and wants to get right to it because something has already gotten her excited...and you have to be able to read this because in these cases she's not looking for the romancing and foreplay but just wants the pure physical desires satisfied...but, from my experience, and from talking to a lot of women over the past few years, those occasions are far less frequent then guys like to hope for. \n\nThink of your favorite sport and the professional athletes that are at the top of the game. They don't just walk out on the court or the field and start playing full speed. They often spend hours warming up so that when it is game time, they are ready. If they don't warm up properly, they have horrible games, are fatigued when everyone else is going at full speed, and often end up injured or in pain the entire game...although most women probably don't look at it like this, they have to, and want to be warmed up before making love (for most women, warm-up means romance and foreplay). \n\nIf they aren't warmed up, they usually do not enjoy the experience and you do not get invited back to play again; and eventually, you earn the reputation as a poor performer and no one invites you to play. Oh, and here is an absolutely critical point guys, almost all women think the warm up is part of the game, and you have to play if you want to have a full season!!! \n\nPreparing to get intimate:\n\nMaking love to a woman, foreplay, eating pussy, sexual intercourse, and just fooling around are all very intimate times. You and your special lady friend are going too physically (and potentially mentally) be very close to each other for a long time. Be clean!!!\n\nHygiene --\n\nShower before you pick her up, use soap and shampoo!! Even better, perhaps the two of you can shower together. She's going to be looking, touching, kissing, caressing, licking, and inhaling the aroma of you for a few hours - this needs to be a positive and pleasant experience. \n\nIf she runs her fingers through your hair and it's all nasty and greasy, that's a mood changer. If she goes to gently (or not so gently) play with your nipples and gags on the smell of your armpit, that's a mood changer. \n\nIf you take off your shoes or cloths and the room fills with a pungent odor, at the very best she's going to ask you to go shower, at the worst, she's going to ask you to leave. \n\nFinally, if you are so lucky that she decides to go down and give you a little oral pleasuring and it tastes and smells like the salt mines or an outhouse in the south Texas heat....the day is over!!! Bottom line, be as clean as possible. Don't let a foul, sweaty, smelly body kill the moment for her and you.\n\nShave if you aren't sporting a beard. A little stubble might look sexy, but a hard bristly beard is hard on a woman's soft skin. If you scratch her every time you get near her....especially when you get down between her legs....she's not going to want your face near her.... \n\nIf you wear cologne or aftershave, or anything smelly, go very light. First, you don't want her nose to stuff up (because she can't kiss, give you oral pleasures, and stay in the mood if she's gasping for oxygen). Second, you don't want it to be so overpowering that she's focusing on the cologne and not you....if you use it, it should just be a hint that excites her senses, not a dousing that drowns her into submission. \n\nFinally, don't put it anywhere she might be running her tongue over your body. If she ends up licking along balls and comes away with the horrible taste of aftershave or cologne, she's going to be trying to get that taste out of her mouth, and again, that means she's concentrating on something other than pleasing you or that mind blowing orgasm you want her to have.\n\nBrush your teeth and use a gentle mouth wash. Women like to kiss; they like to chat intimately during foreplay. If the smell of your breath is gagging, or they give you a French kiss and come away with a piece of whatever it is you've recently eaten....you can pretty much kiss the night goodbye, because you won't be kissing her anymore. \n\nAnd again....WOMAN LOVE TO KISS!!! It warms them up, gets the desires and juices flowing, excites them, and wins them over to the idea of going all the way with you. I would also recommend if you are going out for a few hours before the big event, that you carry along a box of Tic-tac's or something along that line to help keep your breath fresh... I have had several women in my life (over the years, not all at once) tell me they absolutely love kissing me because my breath is always so fresh....\n\nBelieve me, if your breath smells like the ass end of a horse, the bottom of a shoe, or a butt can, it's going to make it so much more difficult for a women to actually want to be with you. If your breath is fresh and clean, that can actually help turn them on and get them excited about being physically close to you.\n\nBottom line -- be clean and have fresh breath....or as fresh as possible!!\n\nWomen, all the clues and tips above also apply to you!!! Generally you are all very clean and know how to get ready for an exciting evening. Before going out on a date or getting ready to have a romantic evening with your stud, I recommend a shower, and while you're in there make sure you wash your butt with warm water and a little soap. This will guarantee you'll be clean and there will be no smell or taste if your gentleman friend decides to go exploring down in that area. \n\nOnce you've washed, rinse well because when a guy runs his tongue along your body and comes away with the taste of soap, it distracts him from the moment. \n\nFinally, you might be a little conscience, just prior to the big event, that your pussy is dirty, or salty, or smells. If your thinking those things and it's distracting you, excuse yourself for a second to go to the bathroom, and while in there, wet some toilet paper and gently dab your pussy and it will be fine. I recommend you don't rub because some of the toilet paper can stick to your pussy, and if a guy is running his tongue through there and comes away with a piece of toilet paper, that's not a good thing....even though it is clean.\n\nFinally ladies, a healthy pussy washed with water does not smell, does not taste funny, and is not dirty. If you are drug and disease free, your pussy probably has no taste or smell at all!!!! It is a wonderful place for a guy to bury his face and have a great time. And if you have washed your butt hole with a little soap and water before going out, or in to the bedroom, your ass does not smell or have any taste either!! \n\nSo you don't have to be consciously worrying about that!! If you don't believe me, after you've cleaned up, run your finger along your ass, gently between the lips of your pussy all the way up to your clit, and then bring it up to your nose for a sniff, or to your mouth and suck on it, and you won't taste anything and you won't smell anything either!!!\n\nBottom line for both of you...being clean is great...being salty, smelly, or having foul breath is bad. And a clean pussy and ass do not smell and they do not have any bad tastes!!! \n\nGetting her motor humming and hot:\n\nOkay, you are all prepared. You now have a basic understanding of how women and men think about making love, a little knowledge of the different parts of the pussy, a little perspective on why a woman needs to build up to the big moment, and a few tips on hygiene so that you don't both go gagging from the room shortly after the clothes start coming off.\n\nWine her, dine her, and perhaps even take a couples massage together. Spend a few romantic hours together, focusing on her so that she feels special and appreciated. If you've been successful she will either invite you to her place, or agree to go with you someplace. \n\nNow, let's get her in the mood to want to make love. Before we go down to that pussy and really start pushing her over the edge to mind altering orgasms, we have to make her want it. \n\nWhat we want is for her to be in a state of mind where she's begging (maybe not out loud, but in her mind), praying, wishing with all her desires, that you would finish with the seduction and get down to business and start eating her pussy. \n\nThe first time you touch her pussy it should be soaking wet and eager for your touch. In order to get a pussy in that physical state, you have to pay attention to your ladies mind and the rest of her body first.\n\nFor a guy, just the thought of sex can get him rock hard in about 30 seconds. A woman's body, mind, and pussy are not like that. Women need to take some time to get in the mood, anticipate the pleasure, and get emotionally and physically in to the encounter before they can really enjoy their time with you.\n\nThink of foreplay like cooking steaks on a charcoal grill. First you have to prep the grill and the steak. You have to get the grill ready and you have to get the steak ready before you can start cooking. Only when the grill is at the right stage of preparation can you put the steak on and cook it properly. \n\nIf you put it on too early the temperature won't be hot enough. You'll have to take a long time cooking the steak and you really risk the chance of having a poorly done steak that's not satisfying when you eat it. If you wait too late to put the steak on there isn't enough heat left in the charcoal and you either have to restock it or you continue and end up with an unsatisfying steak because there wasn't enough heat to cook it to perfection. \n\nA woman's body is like the grill, her pussy is the savior steak, and you are the chef. You have to prepare properly (romance and foreplay), put the steak on the grill at the right moment (start pleasuring her orally when she is at her peak of anticipation), and cook it to perfection (bring her to a mind altering orgasm, or two, or three, or more). If you want your steak done right you have to take the time to prepare. \n\nIf you want a woman to really enjoy her time with you, and tell all her friends that you are great in the sack, you have to take the time to prepare. AND HERE IS AN AMAZING TIP. I have found that even if I didn't do a great job cooking that steak the first time, and it turned out to be less than a satisfying meal for the lady, if I did a great job preparing to cook it, she willing wanted me back to cook for her again. \n\nEventually women want a satisfying steak, but they enjoy the prep work (foreplay, to include oral pleasures) as much, if not more, than the actual cooking (intercourse).\n\nTake a minute to picture a woman's body. Think about her from her head to her toes, front to back. Once you are done with that, think about yourself as a detective. With the exception of the tops of their heads, almost every other part of a woman's body could be a potential erogenous zone and it's your job to figure out what makes her hot, and what doesn't. Here are some of the areas that are sensitive for almost all women.\n\nLips -- women love to kiss. Some women will enjoy kissing for 10, 15, 20 minutes or more before moving on. So, make sure your breath is fresh and your mouth is clean. Guys, if you don't think you are a good kisser, play the mirror game. Basically, let her lead and you do what she does. \n\nIf she gives gentle kisses, you return gentle kisses. If she gently sucks your upper lip into her mouth, you suck her lower lip in to yours. When she lets go, you let go. TIP. Most women enjoy a little French kissing, but don't ram your wet slobbery tongue all the way down her throat or swirl it around like you're cleaning the inside of her mouth. Otherwise, relax and do what comes natural...or follow her lead if you aren't sure. Kissing is generally best when it is soft and tender, gradually building to passionate and intense.\n\nEar lobes -- women usually love to have them gently kissed, licked, and nibbled on. Gently blowing in to their ears turns them on, sticking a wet slobbery tongue in there generally turns them off. Also, before you get to the ears, while you are still kissing, softly run your fingers along the lobes of her ear and the back of her neck. This will help warm those areas up when you go to kiss, nibble, and lick them. \n\nTIP. From this point on, talk to your lady once in a while as you are exploring her body. Tell her how wonderful her hair smells, how soft her skin is, how much you are enjoying yourself, how wonderful she tastes. Ladies, return the favor, if your guy is doing something that really turns you on, let him know.",
        "Necks -- women generally like you to kiss, nibble, and run your tongue along their necks, especially the back of the neck just below the hair line.\n\nAt this point, if she's really into it, it's probably time for the clothes to come off. You really can't do anything else with her clothes on. Start undressing her, and if she begins to help, I recommend you start taking your clothes off while she takes hers off. I know it sounds romantic to undress each other, but most of us (men and women) aren't good at it, it takes too long, and it stalls the mood and anticipation.\n\nWomen, if you are still conscious about whether you are clean enough to let your man lick your butt and eat your pussy, this is a perfect time for you to excuse yourself to quickly run to the bathroom (supposedly to pee) and quickly clean yourself one last time. \n\nGuys, while she's in there, this might be a good time to pop that last tick-tack in your mouth so your breath is nice and fresh. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's comfortable with her cleanliness and doesn't need to go to the bathroom, simply undress and move on with your investigation of her erogenous areas.\n\nBreasts -- most women love having their breasts stroked, licked, sucked, nibbled on, and kissed. A little talking here about how beautiful her breasts are really helps get her excited. Breasts come in all shapes and forms, there is always something positive and wonderful to talk about. \n\nBut be honest, if you say things she knows aren't true, or knows you believe not to be true, it will kill the moment. For example, if you like big breasts, and she knows you like big breasts, but she's an 'A' or 'B' cup, don't tell her her breasts are the perfect size...she'll know you are lying. However, they probably are soft, sensitive, and taste wonderful...tell her those things.\n\nTime for something unique. I like rolling my lady over on her stomach and working on the back of her body. I've found in talking with ladies, to include the ones I've been with, that most men don't do this and it adds a lot of excitement for them.\n\nLower back -- the lower back and her sides from the ribcage near her breast all the way down to her hips are usually sensitive to softly wandering hands, tongues, and lips. Again, this is another area to gently run your hands over while you are kissing, or nibbling on her ears or neck. \n\nThis really is a double bonus for you because you are exciting two areas of her at once, and she will be more sensitive when you finally get to her lower back and sides with your mouth.\n\nAss -- there are a lot of nerve endings in both butt cheeks and they can be very sensitive. Women usually enjoy their man running his fingers over her butt, squeezing, and maybe even a little light spanking. \n\nThey also enjoy you kissing, licking, and gently nibbling on their butt cheeks. Sometimes butt cheeks are sensitive to the slightest touch, and other times they need a little more force. When you get to this area, experiment and see what is turning her on....it could be different each time. \n\nHere is another great opportunity to do a little talking. Tell her how beautiful her ass is, or how soft (or firm) it is, how wonderful it tastes and feels. Be honest with what comes at the moment, don't lie. If you are with a women with a big soft butt, don't tell her its firm, small, and beautiful (because that's the kind of butt you like but don't have) tell her it's soft, and sensitive, and you love kissing and licking her cheeks.\n\nThe backs of the legs and backs of the knees -- these areas are often very sensitive to lightly scraping your finger nails across them while you are kissing and playing with her butt, and then sensitive to kissing, running your tongue along them, and gentle sucking...especially the backs of the knees.\n\nFeet -- some women's feet are extremely sensitive when they are sexually aroused. Many women love you to suck on their toes, or gently scrap your teeth across the top of each toe, the balls of their feet, or their heels. If they are really sensitive, they will be moaning and squirming as you nibble on their toes. \n\nRemember, they are still laying on their stomach. As you nibble on their toes, they may start to push their butt up off the bed back towards their feet...almost like they are getting in to a doggy position. If she raises her butt up high enough, stop sucking on her toes and quickly lean forward and give her butt a little nibble or lick. \n\nThis will usually cause her to drop her butt back down to the bed. She won't be expecting this the first time. Go back to nibbling on her toe, if she really liked what you did, her butt will be back up in the air in a few moments so you can lick it again. \n\nThis could go on for a little while, but eventually, if this really turns her on, her butt will stay up in the air, and if her legs are spread a little bit, this is a perfect time to gently lick her butt hole and her perineum. \n\nIf she drops back down to the bed, and then brings her butt back up as you continue to chew on her toes, she's still trying to figure out if she likes it or not, so keep doing it. If she drops her butt back to the bed and doesn't come back up, it's not for her. \n\nIf one time she brings her butt back up, and keeps it up there as you are licking her anus and perineum, and kissing and nibbling on her but cheeks, she is ready and most likely wants you to eat her pussy in that position. At this point, stop with the feet and focus on the butt and pussy. More about this later.\n\nIf she dropped her but back down to the bed and doesn't come up, gently pull on her legs and roll her over on to her back.\n\nNow start working your way back up.\n\nMost women's calves, the fronts of their knees, and the fronts of their thighs are not very sensitive. But spread her legs apart and the inner thighs are very sensitive to gentle massage by hands, lips, and tongues. \n\nStart near the knee on one leg, work all the way up to the pussy, but don't touch it, go over the top, kissing and licking the flat of her belly and her pubic mound, then go back down her other thigh to her knee. Work your way back up to her pussy. Unless she's dead, she should be ready for you to eat her pussy.\n\nWhen you get to her pussy and ass, reassure her that you are happy to be there. Tell her how beautiful they look. Gals, you might think pussies are gross to look at, but to guys they are some of the sweetest looking things in the world. Honestly, they are. I'd rather look at pussies than roses or puppies any day.\n\nAs you start licking her pussy (I'll talk about ways to do that in a little bit) tell her how soft her skin is, how wet she is....if she is wet...and how much that turns you on. Tell her how wonderful she smells and how sweet she tastes. \n\nShe needs to know you are really happy to be down there, and that you are hot to eat her out. This is also a good time to tell her that you want her to climax, you want her to have a mind blowing orgasm...as many as she can get, while you have your lips and tongue on her pussy. The reason you are doing this is to make her cum...so reassure her that is exactly what you want her to do. \n\nSome women are self-conscious and think a man won't like it if she cums while they are eating her out. For any ladies reading this blog, how many guys do you know that want you to give them a blow job and have you swallow. Right, nearly all of them. This is the same thing. We want you to cum, so don't hold back!!! \n\nWhether you are on top when he is eating your pussy, or you are laying on your back, when you are ready to cum, don't hold back, let it loose....that is why we are down there in the first place. We want you to have intense, passionate, body aching orgasm while we are exploring your pussies with our mouths and tongues!!! And for all of you, a clean pussy has virtually no taste, even during and after an orgasm.\n\nAt this point, you've probably spent 10 - 30 minutes kissing, and another 15 - 20 minutes going from her earlobes to her toes and back up to her pussy. Here is a tip. If you are paying attention to your ladies reactions to your kissing and foreplay, and the things she's telling you, she should be extremely hot and wet right now. She's ready for you to go down on her, and you should be ready to eat that sweet little rose till it explodes.\n\nOral Pleasures\n\nOkay guys, it is the moment of truth. You are staring at your lover's pussy and it is now time to take her to the heights of ecstasy with your lips, tongue, and fingers. As you are gently kissing the inner parts of her thighs, closest to her pussy, tell her how beautiful she is. Tell her how lovely her pussy looks. Tell her how excited you are about being so close to her and how much you are going to enjoy kissing and making love to her pussy with your mouth. \n\nTell her how sweet she smells and how erotic and exciting that is to you. Tell her to relax and get lost in the moment. Tell her to let her body take over and enjoy this moment to its fullest. These things will reassure her that you really want to eat her pussy, and that she is clean and beautiful and you want her to cum when she's ready.\n\nThere are five very sensitive areas here, six if you count the anus. If you remember from the earlier picture you have the clitoris and the clitoral hood at the top, the inner lips, the outer lips, the vaginal opening, and the perineum. \n\nThe clit is by far the most sensitive right now, so don't go directly for it as you begin eating her pussy. You've spent the past 20 -- 40 minutes getting her body and pussy ready for this moment, now you need to spend a few minutes getting her clit ready. \n\nFor the purposes of this story, let's assume your lady is lying on her back, stretched out on the bed and totally comfortable. If she has her knees up in the air, and her feet planted on the bed on either side of your shoulders, you might want to consider gently reaching under her butt cheeks, lifting her off the bed a little and pushing slightly towards her body so that her anus comes in to view. \n\nGently blow on it, and give it several soft and sensual licks. Believe me, if she enjoys this she will let you know, and if she doesn't she'll push down with her hips so that her butt is back on the bed and you can't get to her anus. If she washed with water and a mild soap, there will be no smell and not taste....for you it will be very much like sucking on one of her nipples. \n\nFor her, there will be a direct line of nerves running straight from her butt hole to her brain and her clit....both increasing her pleasure and anticipation. If she is enjoying it, stay there for a minute or two gently licking her anus, her perineum, and nibbling on her butt cheeks. If she's pushed her butt back down on the bed and won't come back up don't try to force her back up, move on to other areas.\n\nNext move on to her outer pussy lips and the area between her thighs and inner pussy lips. Either flatten your tongue, or make it stiff like a point and apply a little bit of pressure. Don't touch her pussy or her clitoris yet. Lick this area and her outer pussy lips from perineum up to where you are almost touching her clitoris. \n\nWhen you get to the top, move over her clit without touching it and blow on it gently. Move your head back down and repeat this long lick on the other side of her leg. Her reactions should tell you whether she likes this or not...if it's making her hotter, stay at it for a minute or two, staying away from the inner lips and clit, but gently blowing on them after each lick. Tell her how much you are enjoying this and you can't wait to open her pussy and enjoy her wonderful juices.\n\nNow it is time to go in. Before you start, reach one of your arms around her leg, put a couple of fingers on her pubic mound a \u00bd inch or so from her clit and gently pull backwards exposing her clit to the fresh air. \n\nIf she's really hot, and her clit is big enough, it may already be outside the hood, but this action and the slight pressure will help increase her excitement even more. Remember, the clit is probably still super sensitive so you have to explore gently. \n\nStart down at the perineum again, make sure your tongue is nice and moist, flatten it against her perineum and then gently and slowly take a long lick from her perineum all the way up and over her clitoris. This should take you about 4 or 5 seconds to get from the bottom of her pussy to the top....nice and slow. \n\nWhen you go over her clit, watch her reaction, if she jumps, it's still very sensitive and your next several licks should be very gentle when you pass over her clit - till she can take the stimulation. When her clit is this sensitive, it can actually cause pain, not pleasure, so watch closely. \n\nGo back down and start again, this time, as you pass from perineum to vaginal opening, push your tongue inside her a little and taste her moisture and see how hot and wet she is. This should be a really exciting time for you, and as you enter her (only slightly) with your tongue, let out a low moan like you've just bitten into the sweetest dessert in the world. \n\nThis will really help her confidence soar and get her even hotter. Once you've gone over top of the clit, before you start going back down for your next lick, tell her how wonderful she is and how delicious her pussy tastes, and how hot it is making you.  \n\nAll in all, take 8 -- 10 of these long slow licks and really enjoy the reaction and taste. After 8 - 10 long slow licks her clit should be accustomed to the stimulation and ready for more. Again, as you are doing this, moan a little like you would when taking the first bites of a great steak. \n\nNext, softly spread her inner pussy lips apart, or ask her to do it, and then gently push your tongue in and out of her. About 85% of all the nerve endings in a woman's pussy are in the first one or two inches of entering the vaginal opening, so you don't have to push in too far. \n\nAs long as she's enjoying this, keep tongue fucking her. Women can and do climax while being tongue fucked. If you are lucky, this will happen, if not, after a few minutes it is time to focus your attention on her clitoris.\n\nJust before you move on to the clit, slide two fingers (index and middle are the easiest) into her pussy. Don't stick your fingers in there dry though, anything dry can cause pain, not pleasure. \n\nEither stick them in your mouth and get them nice and wet, or put them up to your ladies mouth and let her suck on them and get them nice and wet. Once they are wet, slowly push them in to her pussy as far as you can comfortably go. \n\nI prefer going in with my hand facing down, and then twisting as I'm entering so that by the time my fingers are all the way in my palm is facing up. Slowly pull your fingers all the way back out. If she is watching you, stick one in your mouth and suck her pussy juices off your finger....don't worry there is no taste, just moisture on your finger. \n\nTell her how delicious it is, and offer her the other finger to suck on if she wants. Some women will really be turned on by this and go for it, others won't want to do it....go with the flow. \n\nLadies, if you've never tasted your pussy juices before, this might be an excellent time....you'll see, there is no taste; it's just warm and wet. If she doesn't want to taste herself, bring your hand back, stick both fingers in your mouth to get them nice and moist again and push them slowly back in to her pussy. \n\nWhen you are all the way in, your palm should be face up. Feel around for a spot on the top of her inner pussy, about a finger length in, that feels a little rougher than the rest of her pussy (almost like a washboard). If there is a G-spot, this is where it will be located. Stimulating this area on the inside while sucking on her pussy and clit on the outside should double her pleasure.\n\nWith your other arm reach around her leg again, put your hand in her pussy hair (or where it would be if she's shaven) and pull her clitoral hood back and expose her clitoris. \n\nIf you can picture this in your mind, you are now very close to her clit with your mouth, you have two fingers deep in her pussy, and you have a thumb and two other fingers with nothing to do. Open that part of your hand up and cradle your chin in-between your thumb on one side and your pinky and ring finger on the other side. \n\nThis has two distinct advantages. One, it will help you hold up your head and rest your neck so that you can eat her pussy longer. Second, the back side of your hand is touching her inner thighs, not your scraggly bearded face. \n\nThe entire area around the pussy is sensitive to the touch, and if you haven't shaved in a couple hours there is a little bit of stubble on your face that will probably feel like rough coarse sand paper on the inside of her thighs...by holding your chin like this, you don't have to worry about scratching her with your stubble, and she can concentrate on getting off. \n\nSo you have your chin cradled between your thumb and fingers, protecting her thighs and giving you some support to hold up your neck. You have two fingers buried deep in her pussy, hopefully touching her G-spot. And, you have your other hand gently pressing on her Mons Pubis and pulling her hood back exposing her clit. Now it's time to begin the real fun. Serious Business - bringing on the orgasm:\n\nNow it's time to get down to serious business and bring your lady to that gut wrenching orgasm she's hoping for. If you still have your arm wrapped around her leg, place your fingers around the clitoral hood and pull it out of the way so that you can make direct contact with her clit. Expose that little puppy to the fresh air. \n\nKeep your arm wrapped around her leg as you start licking and sucking on her clit and be prepared to put her leg into a gentle vice grip if needed. Once you really start licking her clit, some women start squirming around. \n\nThey love the sensation, but want to escape from it at the same time because it can be so intense. If you aren't hanging on for dear life she very well could pull away from you...and you definitely don't want that to happen at the wrong time....like just before she is going to cum.\n\nWhen you first start licking her clit, vary the pressure, vary the direction, vary the intensity of what you are doing and watch her reactions. Focus more on the things that make her squirm and moan, and less on motions that don't elicit a visible or audible response. \n\nLadies, give your guy a response when something feels good so he knows what's working and what's not. Think of it as being a teacher, you want him to learn what really turns you on, you don't want him guessing and getting it wrong. \n\nAlso, don't fake it, unless you've already made up your mind you aren't going to see him again and you just want to get it over with. Guys remember! If you fake it, they'll think they did a great job. The next time if it seems like you aren't enjoying yourself they'll go back to what they think works, and you've created a viscous cycle where the guy thinks he's doing everything you like and you are continuously faking it and getting more and more frustrated. \n\nGuys, there are all kinds of options here so let your mind wander on what you are doing, but stay focused on her reactions. She doesn't want you all over the map so there must be some consistency, but she wants a bit of variety at the same time so it doesn't get boring.\n\nYou have two goals here. First you want to stimulate her mind so that she gets more and more excited. Second, you want to really start heating her up and get the motor running. \n\nHere are some examples of things you can try. Vertical licks; licking from the bottom of her clit to the top. Horizontal licks; licking from side to side across her clit. Lick in a circular motion around her clit. Some girls like you to go clockwise, others like you to go counter-clockwise - try both and see what works. ",
        "With each lick you can either keep your tongue on her clit as you go back to the starting position or you can lift your tongue away so that there are brief moments with no stimulation to the clit on each lick. \n\nYou can lick fast, or you can lick slowly, you can bear down with some pressure, or you can keep the contact of your tongue on her clit feathery light. \n\nIf you want, you can spell out letters and words....like \"I love eating your pussy,' or 'this is so hot,' or 'you taste great,' or 'I want you to cum for me.' \n\nAs you are doing this, after you've spelled out the phrase, back off for a \u00bd second or so, and tell your lady what you just wrote with your tongue on her clit. This will let her know you are enjoying what you are doing, and that will increase her excitement. \n\nRemember, most of making love for a woman is the mental aspect and if she knows you are having a good time, she can relax and have a good time too. However, don't ask her to try and guess what you are spelling. \n\nYou want her mind, body, soul, and entire being concentrating on the pleasures she is feeling and not the words you are writing with your tongue.\n\nAfter a few minutes of licking her pussy, gently wrap your lips around her clit, clitoral hood, and the upper portion of her inner lips and suck them into your mouth. Gently suck on them, moaning as you do it, and if you have the talent, continue to stimulate her clit with your tongue. \n\nMake sure never to bite her, or suck her in so far that any of these really sensitive parts scrape across your teeth. That could cause pain and she'll lose her concentration.\n\nAll the while you are doing this, licking her pussy to start, and then sucking on her clit later on, gently glide those two fingers you have in her pussy back and forth. As you do that, make sure your fingers rub against that rough area (covering the G-spot) on the inside of her pussy. \n\nThis might take a little practice, because, remember, the thumb and other two fingers of that hand are cradling your chin so you don't scrape her with your whiskers, and you have some support to help relieve the strain on your neck.\n\nIf you've prepared everything properly, somewhere between about 3 -- 15 minutes after you started licking your sweeties' clit, she should be ready for her first orgasm. Generally there are subconscious and physical clues your lady friend will be sending out letting you know that she is close. \n\nShe may be moving her hips in a regular rhythm now, pushing up in to your face. She could be moaning and whispering something like 'that's it, don't stop,' or 'that feels so good.' \n\nShe may have moved one or both of her hands to your head where she could be gently running her fingers through your hair, or reaching around back and pulling you in to her pussy. \n\nIf her hands aren't on your head or near her pussy, she may be playing with her breasts or pulling her nipples. She could be grabbing on to the head board with one hand while clutching the side of the bed or sheets with the other. Sometimes when she's getting really close she may move one hand down near her pussy and start digging into her thigh like she's kneading bread.\n\nOne other sign that she is getting close. If, when you started licking on her clit it is standing out proud and strong, but as you work on it, at some point it starts to disappear....and she's still moaning and groaning and showing all the signs that she's really loving it....\n\nthat's the little clit bitch trying to trick you into thinking you're doing something wrong!!! Unlike men, who get harder and stiffer the closer they get to orgasm, a women's clit does the opposite. It runs back inside and gets ready to throw a party.\n\nWhatever you are doing when these signs happen, DON'T STOP!!! At this point, variety is not a good thing. Keep doing exactly the same thing. If you can keep it up for another 1 -- 2 minutes your lady friend should reach her peak and have an orgasm. \n\nThere are two other thing you might want to try at this point...just before the orgasm. If she is in a regular rhythm, or holding your head to her pussy with her hands to where you think she won't jerk away and lose the contact with your lips and tongue, you can let go of that vice grip you have around her one leg and use that free hand to reach up and play with her breasts and nipples. \n\nIf she's already playing with her own breast, the other option is to let go of that vice grip, suck on your index finger and gently insert it into your ladies butt hole and gently twirl it around....no more than up to the first knuckle. Go slow when you first start to insert your finger in to her anus, some women really love it, and others want nothing to do with it.\n\nWatch her reactions, if she sends you some kind of signal to stop, stop and go play with her nipples. Again, if she is playing with her nipples, softly run your free hand over her belly or across her ribs...just another added sensation to intensify her pleasure. \n\nIf however the signal is a positive one, keep your finger in there and gently move it in and out...or around in circles...whatever is getting the best reaction. One note of caution though, if you do stick your finger up your ladies bottom, once you are done don't use that finger again to play with her pussy because it could lead to an infection.\n\nOnce she starts cumming, move your hand that is not playing with her butthole back to that leg lock again because she's probably not going to stay still any longer but start bucking and jerking around. While this is happening, keep doing whatever it is you are doing for as long as she can handle it. \n\nShe'll probably clamp her legs on to your head, and if she's got her hands behind your head she may pull you in even further as she grinds her hips up in to your face. Ladies, I ask a favor here. \n\nAs you do this, try to stay focused enough that you don't cut off all your guys means of getting oxygen. If he can't breathe, he won't be able to keep sucking on your pussy and at this point you don't want him to stop.\n\nWomen's orgasms tend to vary in length from a few seconds to several seconds. Keep doing what you are doing while she's cumming, do not stop. \n\nThink of your own orgasms. Imagine how you would feel if a woman had her hand wrapped around your shaft and was stroking you back and forth at the same time she was going down on you, and just as you started to cum she pulled you out of her mouth and stopped stroking your shaft...how would that feel??? Horrible right, you want her to keep going all the way through the orgasm and maybe a little more. \n\nA woman is the same way....keep going.\n\nShe'll let you know when it is time to stop. She may put her hands on your forehead to try and push your head back off her pussy, tell you to stop, or collapse in temporary exhaustion. \n\nNow is the time to stop. Let go of her clit at this point because she's either lost all sensation, or it's gotten super sensitive again and needs a break. Pull your fingers out of her pussy, and at this point kiss her inner thighs, lick your tongue in that V space between her legs and her outer pussy lips. \n\nWrap both your arms around her legs and gently rub your hands over her belly. Tell her how wonderful this moment is for you and how happy you are that she came. Keep this up for a minute or two, and then lick her pussy from perineum to clitoral hood. If she doesn't jump from the shock of your tongue gently passing over her clit, she is ready to start round two. \n\nGive her several more long slow licks, wet your two fingers and slide them back in her pussy, and start tongue massaging that clitoris again. Second and subsequent orgasms should come much quicker than the first, often in half the time. \n\nNow your goal is to see how many you can make her have. Enjoy it down there!!!! At some point she will be exhausted and ask you to stop.....take a 5 -- 10 minute break. While you're on break, kiss her, hug her, gently run your hands over her soft skin and tell her how wonderful she is and what a great time you are having. At some point she will recover her strength, and then it is time for intercourse.\n\nThat's it; hopefully you have successfully brought your lady to multiple orgasms and had a great time yourself. I only talked about giving her oral pleasure while she is lying on her back, but there are many variations. \n\nYou can lie on your back and she can sit over your face. There are two general variations to this. One she is facing you so as you look up you can see her belly, breasts, and face. Or, the second option she is facing the other direction and you see her butt and back. \n\nThis is a really good position if she enjoys you licking her anus because you can play with that for awhile before you get down to serious business. Ladies, you have to be careful with this one because it is so easy for you to cover both your guys' mouth and nose, and if he can't breathe, he can't pleasure you. \n\nAnother position is where you lady friend is on all fours (the doggy position if you were going to have intercourse) and you kneel down behind her and pleasure her orally. This is also a great position if you want to do it on the stairs....or the kitchen countertop. \n\nA favorite of many people is the good old 69...but this is often only good for warming you both up for intercourse, because if you are both concentrating on orally pleasing your other half, it is much harder to have an orgasm of your own....although not impossible. \n\nFinally, figure out what works for both of you and enjoy yourselves. Guys, you virtually always get your orgasms, take care of your ladies needs before you have you take care of your own and she'll most likely invite you back for seconds..."
