        "'I've picked you up before, haven't I?' the cabbie said.\n\nMonica tried to see his face. 'Have you?'\n\n'Yeah. Two or three times.'\n\n'Maybe. I don't remember.'\n\nMonica checked her phone for messages. There were ten. Most of them were just FYI. And a couple more were read and delete. But there was one that needed a reply. And, by the time that she had finished that and put her phone back in her bag, they were travelling along the edge of Hampstead.\n\n'I don't suppose by any chance you forgot to bring your purse today, love.'\n\n'Forgot to bring my purse?'\n\n'Yeah. You know. Nudge, nudge.'\n\n'I'm not sure that I do know. Why do you ask?'\n\n'It's just that we're supposed to take a ten-minute break every couple of hours these days,' the cabbie said. 'Health and safety. You know. Ridiculous. But there you are. And I think I'm probably way past my two hours now.'\n\n'So?'\n\n'I think you're a girl who likes a bit of fun. Am I right?'\n\n'I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.'\n\n'There's a little spot just on the edge of the park up ahead. There's never anyone there at this time of the day. Well ... not usually.'\n\n'And?'\n\n'I was just thinking ... we could pull in there and do a bit of business. It'd give me my health and safety break, and my meter could forget all about your fare.'\n\nHad the cabbie said what Monica thought that he had said? 'A bit of business? What sort of business?'\n\n'I was just thinking that I could slip in the back there with you, let the old fella out for a bit of fresh air, and you could give him a bit of attention.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'A bit of attention.'\n\n'In the park?'\n\n'No. In the cab. Ain't nobody going to see. There's a bit of a parking space at the end. Between a couple of big bushes. Very private.'\n\n'You sound like you've been there before?'\n\n'I've driven past it.'\n\n'What sort of attention are you thinking of?'\n\n'Just a hand job.'\n\n'A hand job!?'\n\n'The meter's already showing just over twenty quid.'\n\n'Gosh. Is that the going rate, is it? Twenty quid for a hand job? Is that with or without VAT?'\n\n'It's going to be closer to thirty quid by the time I get you up to Muswell Hill.'\n\n'And you'll just wipe the whole lot? The whole thirty quid?'\n\n'Yeah. Why not?'\n\n'What makes you think I'd do it in the park? In broad daylight.'\n\n'It's very private. But we could find somewhere else if you like.'\n\n'Somewhere else?'\n\n'Yeah. You choose.'\n\n'Why don't we just wait until we get to my place? You can come inside. It'll keep your cab nice and tidy too.'\n\n'Now you're talking, love. I thought that you were a girl who likes a bit of fun. Didn't I say?'\n\nMonica took out her phone again and sent a text message.\n\nAnd then they were there.\n\n'Second house on the left,' Monica said.\n\n'Yeah. I know. I brought you here before, haven't I?'\n\n'Have you. I don't remember,' Monica said.\n\nThe cabbie stopped outside the house and waited for Monica to get out of the cab. Then he got out himself, taking his money bag with him, and locked up.\n\n'Come on then,' Monica said, leading the way to the front door. Monica put her key in the lock, pushed open the door, and walked inside. The cabbie followed. 'OK. Get your old fella out,' Monica said. 'You've only got ten minutes.'\n\nThe cabbie lowered his zip.\n\n'I suppose you want me to take my skirt off,' Monica said.\n\n'Yeah. That would be good,' the cabbie said.\n\nMonica unzipped her skirt and let it fall to the ground. 'OK. Where is it?'\n\nThe cabbie pulled out his already half-hard penis.\n\nRight on cue, there was a series of flashes, accompanied by the whirring and clicking of a DSLR camera. 'My husband,' Monica said. 'He thought that you might need photographic evidence of your ten-minute break for your logbook.'\n\n'Oh, fuck!'\n\n'I don't think so,' Monica said. 'A fuck was never part of the deal. For a fuck, I'd expect you to take me all the way to the airport and back.'\n\nThe cabbie was still trying to stuff his penis back into his trousers as he exited the door.\n\n'Oh ... but you were right about one thing,' Monica called out. 'I am a girl who likes a bit of fun. And I'm having lots of it. Right now.'"
