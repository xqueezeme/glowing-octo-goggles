Again. If he had some luck with the traffic lights, however, there was a small chance he could make it to work on time. Fortunately most people were still home in bed on that cold, dark February morning. Paul pushed his Honda past 50 on a deserted side street and hoped for the best.\n\nSuddenly something streaked through his headlights! Paul slammed on the brakes and turned hard to the left, but whatever it was disappeared behind the front of his car. What the hell was that?! Paul slowly pried his fingers off the steering wheel and put the car in park. It had looked like ... a fat, naked kid? Did he just run over some kid?\n\n\"Oh, shitohshitohshit,\" Paul scrambled out of his seat and rushed to the front of the car. \"Are you okay?\" he called out before realizing there was no one there. Paul walked around the car twice, but didn't see anyone, naked or otherwise. When he got down on his hands and knees to look underneath the car, all he saw was a miniature bow and a tiny quiver of arrows lying on the pavement.\n\n\"Hello,\" he called doubtfully. \"Is anyone there?\" He searched up and down the block, but after 20 minutes he started to wonder if he'd imagined the whole thing. After all, how many naked kids were out playing in the road on a winter morning? It had to be less than 15 degrees!\n\nNo, Paul decided, he had definitely imagined the kid in the street. Flesh and blood children do not just disappear into thin air, no matter how hard you hit them with a Honda Civic. The bow was a mystery, but he would have to figure that out later. Right now, he was definitely late for work.\n\nOnce he arrived at his office, Paul scurried through rows of cubicles with his head down. If he could just get to his desk without being noticed, he would be ok. When he finally ducked into his own cube and dropped the tiny bow and arrows onto his desk he thought he had made it.\n\n\"Hendricks was looking for you,\" announced a nasal voice from across the aisle. It was Paul's neighbor, Wayne the systems analyst. \"She looked pissed.\"\n\n\"Shit,\" Paul swore under his breath. Sharon Hendricks was his supervisor and the last person he wanted to talk to. \"That's all I need.\"\n\n\"Have car trouble this morning, Mr. Anteros?\" a tall, slim woman in a conservative brown pant suit appeared in the doorway of Paul's cubicle. Her black hair was peppered with gray and pulled back in a tight bun. Wayne the systems analyst grabbed a stack of papers from his desk and scurried off.\n\n\"Ms. Hendricks!\" Paul exclaimed, \"I was just ...\"\n\n\"Your latest TPS reports were to be on my desk at close of business yesterday,\" she glared down at Paul. \"Where are they?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Paul sputtered, \"I am nearly ...\"\n\n\"And what on Earth is this?\" Hendricks grabbed one of the arrows from the tiny quiver. It was a vibrant red with a heart-shaped arrowhead. \"Some sort of Valentine's Day nonsense, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Paul shrugged.\n\n\"Actually this looks quite sharp,\" she poked at the tip of the arrow with a finger. \"It may be a violation of the company's weapon policy. I'm going to have to report...\" Right before his eyes, the arrow vanished! One moment Hendricks was gently tapping the tip of the arrow with one manicured finger, the next moment there was nothing but a shower of glittering sparks. Those quickly faded.\n\n\"What the hell?\" Paul sat up in his chair. He looked around on the floor, but the arrow was nowhere to be seen. When he looked back at his supervisor, she was watching him with an uncharacteristic smile on her severe features.\n\n\"Mr. Anteros,\" she breathed, \"have I told you how irresistible you are?\"\n\n\"Uhh, no. Not in so many words.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are,\" Hendricks sidled toward Paul, putting one leg to each side of his office chair. She ran her fingers through his hair and then lowered herself onto his lap. \"So totally irresistible.\"\n\n\"Uhh. Thanks,\" he croaked. What the hell had gotten into her?\n\n\"I can't believe I didn't notice it before,\" she lightly caressed his face.\n\n\"Guess you just never know,\" he shrugged. Was she going to kiss him? Paul had worked for Sharon Hendricks for nearly five years. By every indication she couldn't stand him, yet now she was perched on his lap and gazing longingly into his eyes. Did it have something to do with that strange arrow?\n\nShe quickly popped off Paul's lap and looked up and down the aisle. \"Come to my office,\" she instructed and grabbed him by the hand. She whirled around and marched off, dragging Paul behind her.\n\nIn her office, Sharon let go of Paul's hand and whipped off her suit jacket. \"Shut the door,\" she whispered urgently and began to unbutton her blouse. Paul did as instructed. When he turned back, Hendricks was on top of him. She pressed her long, lean body against Paul, pinning him against the back of the door. Her lips locked onto his, frantically drawing him in.\n\nPaul has never considered whether he was attracted to Sharon Hendricks or not -- he was too busy being afraid of her. She was all hard angles and straight lines; not at all what usually appealed to him. There was no denying her passion, however, and he found himself responding. He kissed her back, trying to match her eagerness. His lips parted and allowed her searching tongue into his mouth. He had no idea what was going on, but that didn't mean he couldn't enjoy it.\n\n\"Come this way,\" Hendricks broke away. She led him around her commanding, solid wood desk. Sharon's unbuttoned blouse hung open, revealing a simple, white bra and the tight, undulating muscles of her midsection. Obviously she exercised with the same obsessive intensity that she used in her career.\n\n\"Wow,\" Paul slipped his hands inside her blouse. \"You're really buff.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" Hendricks smiled. \"I work hard at it, but I never let anyone see me. Usually.\"\n\n\"You should! Get a teeny tiny bikini. Hang out by the pool in the fitness ... \" Paul trailed off as Hendricks slowly sank down to her knees in front of him.\n\n\"No,\" she shook her head and unbuckled his belt, \"my body is only for you.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" Paul mumbled. Sharon slowly and deliberately unfastened his pants then hooked her hands into his waist band. She pulled his Dockers along with his boxer shorts down to the floor. His erection sprang free and pointed out straight in front of him. Hendricks wasted no time wrapping her hand around his shaft and guiding him into her warm mouth.\n\n\"Ohhh,\" Paul moaned. Never in a million years would he have imagined Sharon Hendricks sucking cock, much less his own cock. This day was full of surprises.\n\n\"Mr. Anteros,\" she moaned. \"You are delicious!\"\n\nPaul slowly scooted backwards, leading his boss by the cock in her mouth. He reached back and found her big, leather desk chair and lowered himself into it. Paul leaned back and closed his eyes, just enjoying the sensations of getting a sloppy blow job from his tough-as-nails boss in her own office.\n\n\"I need you in me,\" Sharon stood up and started unzipping her simple, brown suit pants.\n\n\"You ... what?\" Paul sat up.\n\n\"Do you want to fuck me?\" Hendricks stepped out of her slacks and pulled down her plain white panties. The muscles in her long, lean legs flexed and strained like steel chords.\n\nPaul looked down at his throbbing erection, glistening wet with Sharon's saliva. \"Yeah,\" he answered with some surprise. \"I guess I do.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she turned her back to him and spread her legs wide. Paul grabbed her narrow hips with both hands and guided her onto his protruding rod. As she lowered herself onto him, his rock hard member was slowly enveloped in her tight pussy. Finally her firm, round ass settled onto his lap and he was completely inside of her. \"Oh that's fabulous,\" she cooed.\n\n\"Ohhhh,\" Paul answered. Sharon grabbed the arms of the chair and started to pump herself up and down Paul's shaft. He was on fire! Sharon's body was squeezing him so tightly he knew he couldn't last much longer. \"Mmmmm.\"\n\nThe phone on Sharon's desk began to beep insistently. She stopped pumping and settled on Paul's lap. \"I have to take this,\" she told him and reached for the phone. Paul groaned to himself. Why now? He was so close!\n\n\"This is Sharon Hendricks,\" she said in a calm, professional tone that was nothing like you would expect someone to sound with a hard cock buried in their pussy. \"Oh, hi, Dave. How are things on the thirtieth floor? ... Yes. ... Um-hmm ... Sure I have that report right here.\"\n\nSharon shuffled through some papers on her desk. As she reached and leaned her pussy would flex and squeeze, driving Paul up the wall. While calmly talking about project schedules, Sharon started to rock her hips and grind her body onto Paul's. It was only teasing him to greater arousal. It wasn't providing the stroke he needed to get off.\n\nFinally, Paul could take no more. He grabbed Sharon's hard, round ass and lifted her slightly. That gave him just enough room to push off from the floor and drive his cock into her. He had only a few inches of travel available, but he started pounding his shaft into Sharon.\n\n\"No, I don't think ... oooooo ... don't think those num ... mmmmmm ... bers are accurate,\" Hendricks said while Paul was bouncing her up and down on his cock. She grabbed the arm of the chair with her free hand to try to steady herself against Paul's thrusts. He could feel the pleasure building all along his shaft.\n\n\"Dave, I'm going to have to put you on hold for a minute,\" Sharon blurted into the phone. She punched at a button and then slammed the receiver down.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" she cried out. \"Fuck me! Fuck! Me!\"\n\nSharon's body suddenly went rigid. Paul could feel her pussy convulsing on his cock -- gripping his hard member tighter than ever. It was all he needed to go over the edge. He blasted his seed into Hendricks with a powerful spasm. The two lovers collapsed in a sweaty pile.\n\n\"God, that was amazing,\" Sharon gasped. Paul could only nod his head. She turned to him and laid her head on his shoulder with a heavy sigh.\n\n\"Where did that come from?\" Paul panted.\n\n\"I finally realized how utterly and totally amazing ... oh, no! Dave!\" Sharon jumped up and grabbed the phone from her desk. \"Dave? Sorry about that. Just ... just a little technical difficulty on my end.\"\n\nPaul decided it was time for him to go. He stood to pull up his pants and tuck his softening cock back into his boxer shorts. \"No, it's taken care of now. Very well taken care of,\" Sharon was saying into the phone. She gave Paul a wink as he slipped out the door.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" he mumbled to himself when he was back at his desk. He didn't know what was more mind-blowing: that Sharon Hendricks fucks like a wild animal or that she just called him \"amazing.\" That was not a word that was used in his last performance review. It must have been that little fire red arrow, he thought. It did something to her.\n\n\"Dude, did you see what the intern is wearing today?\" Wayne the systems analyst whispered conspiratorially.\n\n\"Who? That kid with the fuzzy hair? Did he wear a Star Trek uniform again?\"\n\n\"No, I'm talking,\" Wayne leaned in and lowered his voice even more, \"I'm talking about the girl in marketing. Hot!\"\n\n\"Ohhh,\" Paul nodded with understanding. The marketing intern was the talk of the office. The female employees were in a huff over her edgy fashion sense. The male employees mostly just drooled over her. \"Diana\"\n\n\"Hot,\" Wayne offered in his nasal voice.\n\n\"Definitely,\" Paul agreed. Diana was the sort of girl who caused traffic accidents just by walking down the sidewalk. She had the face of an angel and a body made for sin. Her skin was bronzed and tan, but flawless and smooth. Her breasts were large and round, but high and perky. Her ass was thick and curvy, but her waist was thin and trim. Diana was well out of his league, but she made an excellent fantasy. Why couldn't she have popped the freaky-magic arrow instead of Hendricks? That would have been amazing!\n\nWait.\n\nThere were more arrows in the tiny quiver, Paul realized. Did he dare try to use one on Diana the intern? On the other hand, would he ever forgive himself if he didn't?\n\n\"I'll be right back,\" Paul mumbled as he slipped the bow and one of the fire-red arrows behind his back and rushed out of his cubicle.\n\nBefore he even reached the marketing section, he saw Diana at the copy machine. Her back was to him, but there was no mistaking that body. She was wearing a short, tan skirt that clung to the curve of her round ass like a second skin and ended soon enough to reveal more of her shapely thighs than was probably allowed under the company dress code.\n\nPaul was so lost in admiring the way her luscious posterior swayed back and forth as she fed paper into the copier that he almost forgot what he was doing. Finally, he caught himself and looked around to check that no one else was watching. He carefully took aim with the tiny bow and fired an arrow toward the magnificent ass in front of him. Unfortunately for Paul he had no particular skill with archery and the arrow flew wide, smashing into a recycling bin and disappearing in a shower of sparkles.\n\nForget the bow, he decided. There were only a handful of those arrows. He couldn't afford to waste them. He would just have to poke Diana at close range. That had worked well enough with Hendricks -- maybe a little too well, actually. \n\nPaul went back to his cubicle and dropped the bow on his desk. He slipped the shaft of one of the tiny red arrows up his sleeve and held the arrowhead in his palm. That would work, he thought. No one would ever notice it. Just one casual pat on the back and he would be balls deep in the hottest coed in the tri-county area.\n\nDiana wasn't at the copy machine so Paul went to find her cubicle. He casually walked through the marketing area, checking name tags on each desk and trying to look like he knew where he was going. If you look like you know where you're going nobody bothers you.\n\nIt turned out that Diana's desk was easy to identify. It was the only one with three men orbiting around it like moths around a street light. Shit! He wasn't sure how the magic arrows worked exactly, but getting the stunning, young intern alone seemed important. Paul was not keen on making her fall in love with Barry from the mail room. How was he going to get rid of these jokers?\n\nPaul didn't wait long, however, before Diana's telephone beeped. She snatched it up on the first ring. \"This is Diana,\" she told the caller.\n\nDiana talked on the telephone for several minutes while her admirers milled about awkwardly. Eventually they realized that she wasn't getting off the phone just to chat with some random coworkers and one-by-one they went back to their actual jobs. Move it along, boys. She's mine now.\n\n\"I'll email you a link to that YouTube video,\" Barry from the mail room promised earnestly before shuffling off.\n\nDiana nodded and smiled politely. \"No, it says 'ICMS password expired' whatever that means,\" she said into the phone. Paul perked up his ears. He had seen that error himself often enough. The ICMS system was necessary for almost everything from requesting vacation to ordering supplies. It was also a pile of crap.\n\n\"Okay,\" she continued hopefully. \"Can you do that right now? ... Two weeks!? ... But ... but ... I need to get online today! ... Hello? ... Hello? ... Arrggh.\" She slammed down the phone. Paul could sympathize. He'd run up against the same problem many times -- the I.T. group used the shoddy management database as a way to consolidate their power in the company. They'd fix your errors and let you do your job, but only on their terms. Luckily, he'd found a few shortcuts over the years.\n\n\"Trouble with ICMS?\" he slipped into Diana's line of sight.\n\n\"Yes!\" she exclaimed. \"I have to log in to release this report, but it says my password is expired. If I don't get this report released before the director's meeting at 1 o'clock my boss is going to kill me! I was supposed to ... well ... I was supposed to do it yesterday, but I forgot.\"\n\n\"It happens,\" Paul nodded.\n\n\"Right. So they'll fix it, but not for two whole weeks! How am I supposed to do anything until then?\"\n\n\"There's a way to get online even with an expired password,\" he tried to reassure her.\n\n\"There is?\" she asked hopefully. \"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I work in project management. We use ICMS all the time. Name's Paul, by the way.\"\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" Diana flashed him a smile. \"I'm Diana. Project management, huh. So you're under Sharon Hendricks?\"\n\n\"Uhh, yeah. So to speak.\"\n\n\"I interviewed with her when I got this job,\" she leaned in and lowered her voice. \"Is she always so intimidating?\"\n\n\"No, not always,\" Paul offered. \"Sometimes she's downright scary.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" Diana giggled and scrunched her button nose. She was beautiful! Flawless skin, luminous eyes, sumptuous lips, and all framed by cascading waves of golden brown hair. How would it feel to run his fingers through all that silky hair and kiss those plump, red lips?\n\n\"What?\" she smirked at him.\n\n\"Uhh, nothing,\" Paul stuttered. Crap! He had been staring. Get back on track! \"So, try logging into your account again.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Diana said doubtfully and turned back to her computer. \"There. It just gives me this error message.\"\n\n\"Sure. Then click here where it says 'Try Again.' Then enter your password again.\"\n\n\"Okay. Same error.\"\n\n\"Try one more time.\"\n\n\"Great. Now it says my account has been locked out because of too many login attempts,\" Diana grumbled.\n\n\"It's ok,\" Paul assured her. \"Now hit the back button. No, no. The back button. There you go. Now try to login again.\"\n\n\"Holy cow! I'm in!\" Diana turned her radiant smile to Paul. \"Oh my God, you're a lifesaver. Thank you so much. How did that even work?\"\n\n\"It's a bug in the system,\" Paul said enjoying the warmth of her approval. \"Seriously though, don't tell anybody. If the sys admin group finds out they'll just fix it.\"\n\n\"Your secret is safe with me,\" Diana grinned.\n\n\"What secret?\" Brad from marketing has come up behind Paul and joined the conversation.\n\n\"Oh, I was just telling Diana about my years as a cross-dressing Las Vegas showgirl,\" Paul replied. He threw a wink at Diana who was covering her grin with one delicate hand. \"I'd prefer if you didn't spread that around, though. I just don't have the legs for it anymore.\"\n\n\"Uhhh, okaaay,\" Brad from marketing gave Paul a suspicious look and then turned to Diana. He was holding some sort of glossy catalog. \"Hey, I wanted to show you the big-screen TV that I've been looking at buying.\"\n\nDamn! Paul had completely forgotten about jabbing Diana with the arrow. Now Brad showed up with his electronics wish list and ruined everything. \"It's more than four thousand dollars,\" he was droning on, \"but it's twenty-one-sixty lines of resolution, you know?\"\n\nIt was obvious that Brad from marketing wasn't going anywhere soon. Damn damn! Paul decided it was time to retreat and watch for another opportunity. He could hardly hang around and chat about home electronics all morning. \"Anyway, I should get back to work. It was nice to meet you.\" \n\n\"Thank you so much, Paul,\" Diana told him. \"The advice on my high-kicks will make a huge difference.\" \n\n\"... my old set was forty six inches but I decided it was time to upgrade ... \"\n\n\"Glad to help,\" Paul chuckled. Drop dead gorgeous and she was also smart ass. Imagine that?\n\n\" ... come over when I get it installed,\" Brad was telling her. \"Avatar will look amazing on this thing.\"",
        "\"Oh. Yeah? I'll keep that in mind,\" Paul heard Diana reply vaguely as he slipped away. This was going to be harder than expected, he realized. It was definitely going to be worth it, though. She was amazing! Beautiful, smart, and funny. It was little wonder that every guy in the place was trying to get her attention.\n\nBack at his desk, Paul sat down and tried to get some work done. About every twenty minutes or so he would get up and casually walk past Diana's desk, but she consistently had two or three visitors. Finally, on his third trip Paul didn't see the usual crowd. Unfortunately he didn't see Diana either because her cubicle was entirely empty. He was no closer to fucking the gorgeous intern than when he started. He was, however, finished with the TPS report that Hendricks was looking for. Paul decided to go to lunch.\n\nHe bought a hot dog from the vendor in the building lobby and sat down on a bench beside a gigantic potted plant. How was he going to get Diana alone? Offer to write her reports for her? That might seem suspicious. Hide in the women's restroom? That would only get him fired. Follow her home after work? That was a possibility. Unless she lived with roommates.\n\n\"Mr. Anteros,\" Paul's plotting was interrupted by Sharon Hendricks calling to him across the lobby. \"There you are. Come with me.\"\n\nHe downed the last of his Coke and tossed the paper cup and napkins into a trash barrel. Then he followed after Hendricks. Ordinarily, this scenario would lead to Paul getting chewed out. Today, however, he didn't know what to expect when he caught up with his boss in the elevator.\n\n\"Director's meeting,\" she said. \"I want you to go with me.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Paul was confused. He'd never been to a director's meeting before. He had assumed it was only for, well, directors.\n\n\"You can help me take notes,\" Sharon winked at him.\n\n\"Ok,\" Paul shrugged. He rode the elevator up to the thirtieth floor for only the third or fourth time in his career and followed Sharon to the meeting room. There was a gleaming, wooden table with plush chairs all around. One wall was entirely glass, providing a breathtaking view of the downtown skyline. It definitely beat the scenery in his cubicle -- an unobstructed view of Wayne the systems analyst.\n\n\"This is Paul Anteros from my department,\" Hendricks introduced Paul to the group. There were ten or twelve old, white men in dark blue suits seated around the table or standing in small groups. \"He'll be joining me today.\"\n\nHendricks walked to the far end of the room and took the next to last seat at the vast table. She patted the very last seat and motioned for Paul to sit down next to her. She set her laptop computer on the table and powered it on. No wonder Hendricks was such a hardass, Paul considered. She was the only woman in this room -- it had to be tough to compete in that world.\n\n\"Let's get started,\" a tall, broad shouldered man with steel gray hair and excessively upright posture strode quickly into the room and took the spot at the head of the table. Paul recognized him as David Duquesne, the senior vice-president. At his word, the room went quiet and everyone took their seats.\n\nDuquesne tapped a button on a panel set into the table and a projection screen just behind him lit up. He tapped a few more buttons and the lights dimmed and blinds slowly shut out the wall of windows. The screen showed the company logo and the caption \"First Quarter Progress.\" Oh great, Paul moaned to himself. Death by PowerPoint.\n\nAs Duquesne began to drone on about a series of pie charts, Paul slumped down in his seat. He would be lucky to stay awake in this dark corner. Then he felt a hand brush against his leg under the table. He looked at Hendricks in surprise. He could just make out her profile in the glow from her laptop screen. She turned to him and cocked an eyebrow suggestively.\n\nThen the hand was back, stroking gently up and down the inside of his thigh before sliding into his crotch. Without a thought, Paul spread his legs wider so Sharon could massage his cock. His body quickly responded to her attention and soon she was stroking a full hardon through the fabric of his Dockers. Was she just going to tease him through the whole meeting? It would keep him awake, but his balls would surely be aching by the time he got out of there.\n\nSharon slowly unzipped his fly and slipped her hand inside his pants. Now there was nothing but the thin material of his boxer shorts between her wiggling fingers and his engorged cock. Paul clenched his teeth to hold back a moan. \n\n\"I have missed your cock sooo much,\" Sharon leaned over and whispered in his ear as she stroked his throbbing shaft. \"I want to play with it.\" Paul looked around the room anxiously, but all the faces were turned toward Duquesne and his presentation. Her hand found the fly of his boxer shorts and glided inside. He felt the heat of her skin as she wrapped her fingers around his manhood. Paul drew in a sharp breath and held it.\n\nShe lightly caressed him for a moment, then pulled his cock out his open fly. Paul's hardon was in the open air. He let out his breath slowly. Sharon gently drew her finger tips up his full length and then paused to lightly caress the head of Paul's cock. Then she slowly slid back down to start all over.\n\nThe sensation was delightful! Paul's cock pulsed and grew even harder, stretching straight out of his lap and nearly bumping the bottom of the table. Sharon rubbed her palm over the head of Paul's cock, spreading around the slick precum that her attentions had produced.\n\nSharon closed her cum-slickened hand around Paul's member and squeezed him gently. She pumped him up and down, twisting her hand in a corkscrew motion. More pecum oozed out, increasing the lubrication of Sharon's fist as she stroked him. She was no longer just playing with his cock, but rather whole-heartedly jerking him off under the table.\n\nPaul tried to focus on breathing in slow, deep breaths. He did not want to orgasm in the middle of the director's meeting! Sharon apparently didn't share his reluctance, because she continued rubbing Paul without mercy.\n\nHe tried paying attention to Duquesne and his dry presentation. Sales figures, cash flow, soft firm hands, pumping up and down, waves of pleasure ... Damn. \"I'm going to cum if you keep that up,\" he warned Sharon in a barely audible whisper.\n\n\"Sharon,\" Duquesne was talking to Hendricks. \"What are we doing to make sure this project gets back on schedule?\" Oh, crap! Paul squirmed. What was he talking about? He hoped Sharon had been paying more attention because he had no clue.\n\n\"I plan to get more involved in day-to-day management,\" Sharon replied confidently while continuing to caress Paul under the table. \"Take a more ... hands on approach.\"\n\n\"Are you confident you can finish this off?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Sharon assured him. Duquesne seemed placated and went back to his presentation. Sharon turned to Paul, flashed him a wicked grin, and went to work on his rod with even greater enthusiasm. Paul accepted that he was going to blow his load whether he liked it or not. Sharon was the boss, after all. He might as well enjoy it.\n\nPaul leaned back in his chair. He looked toward the presentation screen and hoped he appeared to be paying attention. In actuality, however, his attention was focused on the pressure building in his balls. He could feel his body hurtling toward the point of no return! His muscles tensed. His toes started to curl. He gripped the sides of his chair and prepared to explode. Then Sharon let go of his cock!\n\n\"Whaaa,\" Paul released a tiny squeak of disappointment. What was she doing to him?! In the next seat, Sharon was calmly unwinding the power chord for her laptop, as though she hadn't been administering a vigorous hand job under the table just moments before. She dropped the plug through a port at the center of the table and ducked under to reach one of the sockets that were always in the floor.\n\nNo sooner had Sharon crawled under the table, when Paul felt small hands push his knees apart. Then his still rock-hard cock was tugged downward and enveloped in a warm, wet mouth. Sharon sucked enthusiastically on the bulging head of his cock while stroking the shaft with her free hand. The urgency of her oral attack immediately pushed Paul over the edge. He pumped his spunk into Sharon's eager mouth. \n\nShe quickly popped back into her seat and wiped her lips with the back of her hand. Paul was breathless. He looked at the room full of executives anxiously. What had they seen? What had they heard? None of them seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary, however, and soon the meeting was over. Duquesne tapped on his control pad and the room was bathed in light. Sharon closed her laptop and started reeling in the power chord.\n\n\"Don't' forget to zip up your pants,\" she told him with a wink. Paul snuck a hand under the table and tucked his softening phallus back where it belonged and zipped his fly. \"That was an amazing meeting, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Uhh, yeah,\" Paul nodded. \"Very productive.\"\n\nDavid Duquesne collared Sharon after the meeting, so Paul headed down to his own floor on his own. On the way to the elevators, however, he caught sight of Diana the intern in the break room. She had been cornered near the coffee machine by three admirers. Julio from accounting was waving a coffee mug and enthusiastically chattering about something. Barry from the mailroom had blocked her escape to the north and someone Paul didn't recognize was standing to the east with his chin tucked into his shirt collar in order to stare directly at Diana's round, full breasts straining against her tight blouse. How did she ever get any work done, Paul wondered.\n\nHe was going to wave and be on his way -- he didn't even have an arrow with him -- but when he caught her eye she gave him such a pleading look that he stopped in his tracks. \"Help me,\" she mouthed silently. Paul shrugged and decided to try to rescue the poor girl.\n\n\"Hey, Diana,\" he called out. \"Do you have some time this afternoon to go over that report?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she exclaimed and pushed her way through the gap between Barry and the third guy. \"I have some time right now. Would right now work for you?\"\n\n\"That's perfect,\" he grinned. She was so adorable. Julio from accounting glared and pointed his coffee cup at Paul like a pistol. Barry from the mailroom moved off sadly. The third guy tracked Diana's breasts all the way out of the break room and down the hallway. \n\n\"Thanks, again,\" Diana said when they were alone in the elevator. \"I thought I was going to be stuck there all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Paul chuckled. He was finally alone with Diana, but he didn't have a single arrow with him. This was a perfect opportunity! Why wasn't he prepared?! Of course, he never planned to go upstairs. He hadn't expected to see Diana there either. \"So why were you on the thirtieth?\"\n\n\"Raiding their break room,\" she held up sack she had been carrying. \"My boss is meeting with a big customer, so he had me get some of the good coffee.\"\n\n\"Good thinking. The stuff we have downstairs is dishwater.\"\n\n\"Oh my God! Totally!\" she agreed. \"I had some my first day and had to throw it out. Haven't touched it since.\"\n\n\"Well, now you know where to get the good stuff.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she declared. Paul allowed his eyes to linger on her tiny midsection. It seemed like a man could close his hands around that impossibly slim waist. It would be fun trying, either way.\n\n\"Hey, what were you doing on the thirtieth floor?\" she asked after a while.\n\n\"Oh, my boss dragged me along to the director's meeting.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she said with admiration. \"Wow. You must be, like, Sharon Hendricks' right-hand man.\"\n\n\"No, not usually,\" Paul shook his head. The elevator door opened on their floor. \"Today was ... out of the ordinary.\"\n\n\"Okay, Mr. Modesty,\" Diana twirled a lock of her glossy, brown hair and stepped out of the elevator. If only he had an arrow! He was alone with the most beautiful girl he'd ever met and the magic arrows were just a dozen yards away. If only he could get her to follow him back to his desk.\n\n\"Listen, I was wondering ...\" he started to ask.\n\n\"Hey, I was thinking ... \" Diana said at the same time.\n\n\"Wait, what? Were you saying something?\" he asked.\n\n\"You first,\" she insisted and nibbled on the corner of her plump red lips. Paul found it very distracting and forgot for a moment what he had been about to say.\n\nHis reverie was interrupted by Sharon calling to him from across the aisle. \"Mr. Anteros, there you are. Could you come to my office please?\" Damn! What did she want now? Were they going to have a threesome with the CEO?\n\n\"You better get going,\" Diana said and backed away toward the marketing area. \"I'll talk to you later.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Paul said glumly and turned to follow Sharon to her office.\n\n\"I owe you an apology, Mr. Anteros,\" she said stiffly when she had settled behind her massive desk. \n\n\"What? I don't ...\"\n\n\"My behavior today has been extremely inappropriate. I have no explanation ... I have never ... \" Sharon paused to collect herself. The magic arrow had clearly worn off. They apparently last about 6 hours. That was good to know. \"As your manager, I should not have taken advantage of you this way and I apologize. I never intended to create a ... a ... hostile work environment.\"\n\n\"Actually this was one of the least hostile days I've had here,\" Paul mumbled.\n\n\"Something just came over me today. I have had to work and struggle to get where I am,\" her voice cracked with emotion. Paul could see tears well up in her eyes. \"I don't know how I could risk it all like this!\"\n\nAfter years of angry lectures from his boss, he was tempted to rake her over the coals. He could probably file some sort of complaint and she would lose her job. Maybe he could even sue the company for a load of money. Of course, it was his fire-red arrow that started the whole thing, even if Sharon didn't realize it. \"Listen, we both got carried away. We got it out of our system. Now we can move on. Forget it ever happened.\"\n\n\"Yes? Yes,\" Sharon sighed. \"I appreciate your understanding. I really don't know what came over me. Over us.\"\n\n\"Everybody has needs,\" Paul shrugged. \"If they get bottled up, eventually we just explode.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Sharon looked thoughtful. \"I have been focusing on my career to the detriment of my social life. I am just sorry you had to suffer for my ... breakdown or whatever it was.\"\n\n\"Well, I wasn't exactly suffering,\" Paul smirked.\n\n\"No? There were some positive aspects of the experience, I hope.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding?\" Paul retorted. \"It was great. You have a lot of skills that have nothing to do with project management.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know about that. Nonetheless, it may be time for me to get out more.\" Sharon looked significantly at Paul. \"With a more appropriate partner, of course.\"\n\n\"He's a lucky guy, whoever he is,\" Paul said with a grin.\n\n\"Mr. Anteros, it's a little late in your career to start brown nosing, isn't it?\" she retorted with the barest trace of a smile on her thin lips. \"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were hoping for an invitation to the next director's meeting.\"\n\n\"Ms. Hendricks! Did I hear that correctly? Did you actually make a joke?\"\n\n\"It's hardly the strangest thing I've done lately,\" Sharon rolled her eyes. \"So are we in agreement? We're just going to forget all about this?\" She looked at Paul with a pleading expression.\n\n\"Forget about what?\" Paul stood and moved to the door. \"I better get back to work, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Yes. Let's get some work done today.\"\n\nPaul, however, had no intention of getting work done. Instead, he was planning to go back to his desk, grab one of the red arrows, and find Diana the intern as fast as possible. He fully intended to spend the next six hours getting to know her perfect, little body. Much to his surprise, however, when he got to his desk Diana was there waiting for him.\n\n\"Hey, Diana. What's up?\" this wasn't a problem. He could nick her with one of the arrows right here, he decided. Wait! Where were the arrows? They should be lying on the top of his desk beside the computer monitor.\n\n\"Hi, Paul,\" Diana greeted him brightly. \"How was the meeting with Sharon?\"\n\n\"Oh, pretty good,\" he answered absently. Paul took a step back and tried to lean over and look under his desk without drawing attention to himself. There was nothing there. Where the hell did the arrows go? Did someone steal them? \"She just wanted to touch base on a couple things.\"\n\n\"Good deal,\" she smiled. \"So, I was wondering ....\"\n\n\"What the hell,\" Paul saw a small, naked boy not more than three feet tall standing at the end of the aisle behind Diana. He had a full head of curly hair and he'd thrown the quiver of tiny arrows over his shoulder. The miniature bow was clutched in one chubby hand. When he saw Paul looking at him, the little boy glared angrily, extended his middle finger, and scurried around the corner.\n\n\"What is it?\" Diana turned in the direction that Paul had been looking, but the naked boy had already gone.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Paul mumbled. \"Just thought I saw something. It's been a strange day.\" He didn't know what he had just seen, but it seemed like a sure bet that the fire-red arrows were gone for good. Now he would never have a chance with Diana!\n\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" she said quickly. \"Quitting time can't get here soon enough for me either. Maybe we could go get a drink after work?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. Wait, what?!\"\n\n\"You and me,\" she said more slowly. \"Going out for a drink or two. Only if you want to, of course.\"\n\n\"Wow. Yes. I'd love that.\"\n\n\"Great,\" she smiled radiantly. \"Come by my cube when you're ready to go, ok?\n\n\"Sure,\" Paul nodded. \"I'll just follow the aroma of gourmet coffee.\" Diana giggled and turned away. Paul stood and watched her hips sway seductively as she walked down the aisle. Yes, it had certainly been a strange day.\n\nTHE END "
