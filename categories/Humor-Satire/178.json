    "pages": [
        "A new story from TT. Edited as always by Angel Love. Please enjoy. \n\nFor those of you who don't know me, my name is TT Spalding and I run a detective agency along with my wife, Maggie. TT is my name and no one but Maggie is allowed to call me anything else. She calls me TT except when she's mad at me about something and then it's Theodore Terrell! or just Theodore, or Terrell! if she's really pissed. I do a lot of family stuff in my work and some of it is enough to break your heart, but it pays the bills. If we're lucky we get some business espionage stuff that really brings in the cash but they're less common. We had a couple of good ones this year so it made for a happy holiday. My driving passion is Mickey Spillane and his Mike Hammer novels. I have them all, every last one. I almost had a breakdown when Mickey died, but Maggie helped me survive. It was her suggestion that I dedicate myself to writing one great novel in his style. I took her up on it and I started it. I really did!\n\nBut that's enough about me. Maggie thought I should tell you about one of the cases we handled just recently and I thought it was a nice story, especially around Christmas when it originally happened, so enjoy.\n\nThe Pickering Case\n\nIt was hard to see her now, the droplets of fog splintering the orange rays from the street light, reflecting it back and making the whole scene appear to be smoldering, almost like it was on fire. She was there for sure, hidden somewhere in that orange glow. I knew because I followed her here, my car two lengths behind her Beemer, just out of her view. She was cocky, not expecting anyone to have tripped to her scam. But then I wasn't just anyone. I knew what she had going on, and she was ripe for the pickings. Scam the scammer! That was the ticket. I was going to pull it off or my name wasn't Mike Hammer!\n\nI stared at the little flashing cursor, fascinated by its dedicated stupidity. It would wait forever for me to do something, anything at all. Really dumb. But I had to admit, this new computer was really slick. It had a flat screen, a wireless keyboard and mouse, and it seemed so fast it hardly took any time at all for it to do its crap. I really didn't want anything this fancy, but with the money we made on the Villager Espionage case, Maggie decided I needed it. At least she did before she got mad at me. Well, tough! I loved this thing now and I'd fight anyone who tried to take it back. I saved the work and read up to where I left off.\n\nSo far, so good. I had almost two chapters now, and they were pretty damn good if I do say so myself. I was going to write the next Mickey Spillane novel and get his people to sign on. Like a ghost writer, or whatever the hell they called it. It was done all the time. Hell, I remembered reading a series of books continuing the Foundation series from Isaac Assimov, and he's been dead for a long time. No shit! Dead author's names being used by someone else! So, why not mine? Who else but Mickey's biggest fan. \n\nThe door to my sorry office slammed open and Maggie stuck her blond head in. \"Mr. Pickering is here Terrell! I'm sending him in so get your ass in gear!\" She withdrew and left me glaring at the space where she had just been. Damn that woman! \n\nMaggie and I were fighting. It was a stupid fight but neither of us wanted to admit to being wrong. It was over her mother. Of course, her mother. The evil, conniving bitch that never liked me. Oh, she never said as much but I saw her eyes. Evil eyes, mean eyes, always watching me. Always ready to catch me doing something to wrong her little girl. She wanted to come and stay for a week or two over the holidays just to visit. What she wanted was to drive me into a heart attack so Maggie would be free of me. Too bad her dad was gone. He was an OK guy, and you guessed it, he died of a heart attack. Yeah, the heart attack was her mother!\n\nThe problem was that since we agreed that my dad would come for Thanksgiving, she decided her mother would come for Christmas and stay two weeks: a few days before and the rest after. That would put her there for New Year's Day as well and I objected to that on principle. But, the problem was that I agreed to it. Sure, I agreed but I agreed during an exceptionally intense bout of Maggie loving. You know what Maggie does to me during our lovemaking. I have no control of myself and would do anything she asked me to do. Not fair! \n\nI saved my work, blanked the screen and sat back, waiting. Mr. Pickering. Hell of a name. Made me think of a short, bespeckled, balding gentleman who probably worked with numbers, lots of columns of numbers. A real nerdy type. I was prepared to try to humor him and see what he wanted. Probably needed some spying on a competitor. These guys always wanted to get an edge in business. Sneaky bastards! But hey, good money in that. The man who walked in was just the opposite. \n\nHe was a tall man, well built, muscles up to his eyeballs, dressed like a model and a face to match. Good looking guy, if you liked guys. \n\nI didn't. I reminded myself nervously. But I'll bet Maggie had given him a good going over. Probably watched his butt when he walked in. \n\nHe walked with that self assurance that came from knowing he could have his pick of the dames. His type never had to do anything but reach out and they were there, in their tight skirts, low cut blouses, and bodies to make the strong whimper. My pulse jumped a notch or two and I made a mental note to include that in my novel. Just then, Maggie stuck her head around the still open doorway, gave me a look that suggested exactly what I was thinking and flashed an evil smile before asking if she could get Mr. Pickering something. Hah! Like she actually would. Maggie didn't do drinks. I waited while he turned, giving her a smile but declining. She gave me a last glare before shutting the door.\n\n\"What can I do for you Mr. Pickering? How can TT Spalding Inc. help you?\"\n\n\"Call me Ian, if you will. May I call you TT? Thanks. Well, I'm afraid my request is very simple and probably very common to you. I think my wife is having an affair and I want to know who and where. Simple.\"\n\nThis guy was smooth. He rattled this off like it was a simple everyday request. My wife is screwing around on me and I want to know who the bastard is and where they're doing it. He didn't say but it was implied: Once I know, I'll take care of it. But I knew the type. He wasn't into revenge. He was in love with her. I could tell that right off just looking at his eyes. They were full of pain and I could see the hope flowing out of them. He didn't want me to find anything, but he was too smart to fool himself. He had to know for sure.\n\n\"You'll have to tell me more than that Ian. I'll want to know all you can tell me about Mrs. Pickering, where she goes most days, who her friends are, her credit card numbers, things like that. Are you willing to give me that information?\"\n\n\"Well, some of it, yes. Are you licensed and bonded? How do I know I can trust you with that kind of information?\"\n\n\"Very good questions. We have a standard non-disclosure contract that binds us and protects you. It's part of our contract with you. Did Maggie explain our fee structure to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, she did. She is a very beautiful woman, and you are a very fortunate man, if I may say so.\"\n\n\"You may. If you can have the information sent over to us, we can sign the contracts today and begin right away. Normally, I expect the first report to be available in two weeks with a final report a week later. But since this is almost the holiday, I assume you wanted to wait till after New Year? I assume you'll want pictures and CDs which may take some time?\"\n\n\"That's unacceptable. I'll take the contracts and sign them and return them with the information today, but I'd like to have this over and done before Christmas. I couldn't stand spending Christmas with her under these conditions: not knowing. I hope that's understandable?\"\n\nI considered and thought about mentioning a bonus if we did this before Christmas, but something in his eyes gave me pause. What the hell! It was Christmas and maybe we could make his a better one.\n\n\"Perfectly understandable. I'll walk you out Ian.\"\n\nI escorted him out to the desk and to Maggie. I intended to stay there until Mr. Smooth left. I wasn't going to leave him with Maggie in the mood she was in. She would torture me, talking about him and the way she flirted with him and that sort of crap. But if I was there, things would be on the up and up. As it was, she did everything but grab his ass until he left. But, I was there so she was screwed and she knew it.\n\nOnce he was gone, she lit into me.\n\n\"Well, I see you had to protect him from little ole me. I guess you think I'm a real tramp, just like my mother. Isn't that what you called her last night?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't call her a tramp. I called her a bitch! That's what she is you know. She's a real bitch!\"\n\n\"Well, she's coming and that's final. If you don't like it, you can move out while she's here.\"\n\n\"That's fine with me. I'll call Bruno. I can stay with him for a week or so. He'll have me. Then you and the evil bitch can trash talk me all you want. Your mother hates me so this will be perfect for her. Me, gone.\"\n\n\"Don't you even think about it. You're staying and you're going to be nice to her while she's here.\"\n\n\"You just told me to move out if I didn't like it and I don't. So, make up your mind.\" \n\n\"Do you enjoy sleeping alone? Do you plan on sleeping alone in the future?\"\n\nDamn! That's just not right! That was so wrong on so many levels! I love my Maggie to death and I love making love to her and she knows it. It's cruel for her to use that against me. Just like with her mother! But, she had me and she knew it.\n\n\"Fine. I'll be nice to her if it kills me. And it probably will.\"\n\nMaggie's smile was blinding. Maybe it wouldn't be too bad. Only two weeks. But I could survive it. Maybe.\n\nTrue to his word, Ian sent the contracts and the information over that afternoon. I took the folder into the office and sat back to peruse it. He had sent pictures of her, her contacts, her cell phone number, credit cards and driver's license. More, and all of it useful. I pulled out her picture and set it on the desk. \n\nShe was a strikingly beautiful woman, mature with a face that was compelling, making you want to look at it twice. She had long, straight blonde hair, worn just below her shoulders. Her eyes were an ice blue, wide and innocent. Her skin was golden, showing an expensive tanning process. She was tall, that was evident from the picture. She had on gold, around her neck and at her ears, and the diamond she wore was impressive. She was dressed in a casual silk blouse with tailored slacks and low heels. She looked like she knew her way around a boutique or two. Overall, she made my mouth water. This was a babe!\n\nPerfect! That was my heroine, Pauline, in my novel. I had to get that down on tape. While I was looking for my little recorder, Maggie came in to tell me that she had closed the office for the day. I mumbled something but didn't notice her as she walked over to my desk. She stood there, waiting for me to notice her which I did very quickly. I think it was the hand that stroked my hair so softly. I stopped what I was doing and glanced up at her. What I saw was enough to make my heart begin to pound and my blood pressure to shoot up. I knew in the back of my mind that Dr. Jacobs would not be pleased if he measured my pressure just then.\n\n\"What's this? I thought you were mad at me. Did I do something right?\"\n\n\"Why whatever made you think I was mad at you lover? You're my man. I love you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, that's not what you said last night. Or this morning for that matter. You threatened to castrate me if I didn't stop bitching about your mother coming.\"\n\n\"But you agreed to be nice to her and that's all I needed to hear. Now, push that chair back so your Maggie can sit on her TT's lap.\"\n\nWell now. What was this? Just because I said I'd be nice to the evil one, I was forgiven? If I had known it would be that easy, I'd have done it sooner. Maggie was moving over my now happy erection and giving me the lap dance to end all lap dances. God the woman could make me sweat just by looking at her, but when she set her mind to being nice to her man, look out! I was groaning and making all sorts of happy noises but Maggie wasn't done. I almost cried when she stood up and moved away from my now frantic lap but before I could say anything she leaned over me and yanked my pants down to my ass. While I wiggled said ass to let said pants slip over and then down my skinny legs, she was removing a pair of white cotton panties. Now you might be surprised, but I loved those panties. I know a lot of guys like the thongs or the hi cuts, but not me. I loved those old fashioned durable panties and Maggie always wore them just for me. \n\nThe rest of Maggie's reward to me for playing nice is confidential. No play by play here. Just know that I smiled for the rest of the day and when bedtime came, well the grin on my face the next day should give you a clue as to what she did for me. God, I loved that woman! That was almost enough to make me forget her mother was due in a few days. Almost, but no cigar.\n\nThe following day I called Bruno. Polly would have been better for this one but she was somewhere in Mexico on a shoot I think she called it. Shooting who would be the real question. Polly was a damn fine photographer and she loved going on shoots. She did some famous people. I asked her once if she ever met Mickey Spillane but she just laughed at me. I guess it was a dumb question. She wasn't good enough to have photographed the Mick. Few were. The man was a legend!\n\nI gave the details to Bruno, asked him to start a run on the credit cards and anything else he could think of besides the regular surveillance. He mumbled something about typical shit and then took it all and left. Bruno was a real technician and he would find out all there was to find about our Mrs. Pickering. Her name was Rachael by the way. Pretty name, Rachael. Not as pretty as Maggie. Of course.\n\nIt was just over a week later when Bruno called to ask to come see me. He said he had something but needed to know where to go from here. Not unusual. We often got to a point where we wanted the client to tell us how to proceed. That was standard practice for me. See, sometimes the client will be satisfied to know the spouse is cheating and wants to know nothing more. No pictures, no CDs, nothing. Just the name and dates. I liked those kind because it was often those that were trying to save something of their marriage. The others, the ones that wanted it all were just out for revenge. I hated that. I understood it but I hated it. But, that's life in the big city.\n\nBruno came in and showed me some footage he had taken. He was looking very bored and I knew he thought this was just a simple cheating case. He filled me in.\n\n\"The Missus goes to an apartment house down in the cheap part of town. She dresses down when she does and she goes up to an apartment on the forth floor. Stays there about an hour to an hour and a half then leaves. Nothing out of the ordinary but so far I have only a name. Question is, do I run it and try to get pictures and sound or do we just drop it here. She's cheating, that's clear.\" \n\n\"Good question. Let's call the Mr. and see what he prefers.\" With that, I pulled the file, got his cell and called. \n\n\"Ian, this is TT Spalding. Can you talk?\"\n\n\"Go ahead. I'm alone right now.\"\n\n\"OK, here's the deal. Your wife is going to an apartment downtown to meet a man named . . . Rick Harris. Does that name ring a bell with you?\"\n\n\"No it doesn't. Do you have any other information yet? Any pictures or proof of what she does with him?\"\n\n\"No, we don't and that's why I'm calling. We can stop here if you wish or we can go forward. We can probably get pictures and sound for you as well as information on Mr. Harris. It's your call. Some don't want to know any more.\"\n\nI held my breath. This was the key question. Where would he go with this?\n\n\"I want it all.\"\n\n\"You're sure about this? There's no going back once you see her in a bad situation. You'll never be able to forget it. Unless that turns you on. It does with some.\"\n\n\"God no. I love her with all my heart, but if she's cheating on me, I have to see it so that I'll have the strength to let her go. Get me what I need, please.\"\n\n\"OK Ian, we'll go to work. Give us a week or two and we'll give you what we have.\"\n\nWe said perfunctory goodbyes and hung up. This broke my heart but it had to be done. He was the boss here.<br> <br> \"Get the goods Bruno. Let's give it all to him and God help both of them.\"\n\n\"You got it boss.\"\n\nI forgot about Ian and Bruno while I worked to clean up the outstanding work before the big holiday break. I promised Maggie that I would close the shop during the two weeks before and after Christmas so that she could spend the time with the Devil's daughter. It was quick work since the only outstanding jobs were long range and would continue even during the break. Money would be tight this Christmas since the long term stuff didn't pay up front. Once I collected from Ian Pickering, we would be fine. I already had Maggie's present: a necklace and matching earrings made from diamonds and citrine. November was Maggie's birthday and citrine was her birthstone. The yellow/orange color of the citrine stones with the diamonds was beautiful. She saw it once in a catalog and I ordered it the next day. Set me back a pretty penny but this was for my Maggie. She was worth every dime. I decided to pick up something for the evil one and thought maybe a nice bottle of perfume. I had a contact, sold what looked like the good stuff but were actually knockoffs. Looked real though, and for the evil one, that would be perfect. Mucho points with Maggie too. \n\nThe day before we were closing down, Bruno came in. He usually sent his stuff in but for some reason he wanted to do this in person. I set him up for 4:00, the end of the day. He walked in, sat down and looked at me with this hangdog look on his face. OK, I'll bite.\n\n\"What's with the face? This should have been an easy job compared to some we've had. Why the long face?\"\n\n\"Boss, there's something going on here and I don't know what it is. I want to show you something and then get your take on it.\"\n\nWith that, Bruno slid the CD in the player and we sat back to watch the screen. When the picture came on, Bruno let it play for a short time just to set the scene. Rachael Pickering, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt was going into the apartment house Bruno told me about. The camera followed her until she went in the door. The next picture showed her walking down a long hall and stopping before a door. She stood there for the longest time, shaking her head and mumbling to herself before pushing the buzzer.\n\nJust for the record, I have no idea of how Bruno does what he does. His pictures seem to be taken right next to the people we investigate. He has cameras everywhere and he seems to be able to get right in the bed with some. I don't know how he does it and I never asked. I don't think I want to know.\n\nWhen the door opened, she walked in slowly and the door closed. The next scene was from inside the apartment. It seemed to be from the perspective of someone standing off to the side of the room. The man, who I assumed was Rick Harris, was talking to Rachael and she was gesturing angrily and shaking her head. I looked at Bruno and he just motioned to follow the picture. He had the sound off for some reason. As I watched, Rachael turned and walked down the hall toward what I assumed was the bedroom.  ",
        "The next scene was from a camera pointing directly at the bed. Rachael came in the room and sat on the edge of the bed. Harris followed, pulling off his shirt as he came in. She began to remove her sweatshirt while he dropped his pants. Then, he moved toward her, grabbed her head and began to pump his cock into her mouth. He put both hands behind her head and was moving so hard she began to choke. She finally forced him back, gasping for breath. He was laughing and the scene changed again. Now he was on top of her, pounding her for all he was worth. That's when Bruno stopped the playback.\n\n\"That's the overview. Seems simple so far, but here's what I wanted you to see and hear. Tell me what you see.\"\n\nBruno moved forward on the CD, found what he wanted and began playback. I now heard sound. It began where the other had but this time I could hear Rick Harris and Rachael Pickering talking.\n\n\"You son of a bitch! You promised to give me the tape when I did what you asked. Why won't you stop this? Give me the tape now!\"\n\n\"Sorry Rach. I was going to, but damn it all, you sure know how to make a guy happy. I've never had a piece of ass as good as you. I'm going to get some more pussy from you before I give you the tape. Now, get your pretty ass in the bedroom and get ready.\"\n\nNow, I had a better idea of what Bruno meant. I was about to ask him some questions but he motioned me back to the video playback. This time the camera was focused on her face as she was being fucked by Harris. Her face was screwed up and there were tears pouring out of her eyes. I could here the sobs as she lay there. She was certainly not enjoying this and she was being raped by any definition. That's what it was, pure and simple. I was watching Rachael Pickering being raped.\n\n\"OK. Stop the playback. Shit! Shit, shit, shit! We can't let this go can we?\" \n\n\"I don't want to boss. She's a beautiful lady and she's being raped by that bastard. I want to get him and get him good. We can't show this to the husband. I just don't know how to play this. You're good at this stuff. What do we do?\" \n\nBruno and I talked it over and came up with a game plan. Bruno would get the full scoop on Mr. Harris and we would take it from there. I told Bruno that I wanted in on this one and he seemed pleased to be working with me again. I trained Bruno and he always said I was the best. I have to admit, I'm easy. Flattery makes me happy. I sat back and waited. It wouldn't take Bruno long.\n\nA week later we had it all. It seems that Mrs. Pickering, Rachael, was almost a porn star. When she was just eighteen, she had done a demonstration tape for a schlock outfit that promised to give her a lot of money for making some movies. She did the audition but later changed her mind and dropped out. She asked for the tape but was told it was destroyed when she backed out. She thought no more about it and went on with her life, happy not to have made a huge mistake. \n\nBut the tape hadn't been destroyed. It was in a file cabinet that was left behind in a second floor space when the pseudo film maker had flown the coop. Turns out that the space was owned by our Mr. Harris. He kept what furniture was left behind and he went through the file cabinet and found the tape of her audition and it was apparently really hot. How he found her we weren't sure, but somehow he did. And now, he was using it to blackmail Rachael, threatening to tell her husband if she didn't take care of him. She had paid him some money as well but he kept stringing her along. Bruno hadn't been able to see the tape but that was about to change.\n\nI called my Maggie into this now. She would be an ally in our scheme since she was a woman and had the devious mind typical of them all. I let Bruno give her the short version of what he found, complete with the edited video that Bruno showed me to convince me. When he finished, the look on Maggie's face told me that our Mr. Harris was about to rue the day he was born. God, I loved that woman! And once again I was glad I was married to her and not her enemy. Lord have mercy if you were.\n\n\"OK, I assume you boys have a plan? Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"What I want to do is to somehow frame Rick Harris and then let the police know he's a bad dude. I want to put him away for a long time. But first, I want to get into his apartment and rifle through his files and confiscate all of the tapes he no doubt got from that file cabinet.\"\n\n\"There's another thing. We have to get Rachael on board so she's aware of what we're doing. You leave that to me. I'll talk to her woman to woman. Then, we'll get Mr. Harris by the short hairs.\"\n\n\"Why talk to her? Maybe she should just find Harris gone. Isn't that good enough?\" I asked with the incense of the typical male. \n\n\"Then what are you going to tell Ian? Haven't you already told him about Rick Harris, and about his wife going to her apartment? Didn't think about that did you boys? Do I have to do everything for you?\"\n\nShe was right. I looked at Bruno and he looked at me and shrugged his shoulders as if to say, 'she did it again'. Well, she was right. We had to cook up some story to offset what we had already told Ian. That was going to be some job. So, I took the intelligent path. I asked Maggie what we should do. And she told me. \n\n\"Rachael was not visiting Rick Harris. You just got the apartment number wrong the first time you spoke to him. You need to find out who else is on that floor, make up some story about Rachael visiting a friend with a sick mother or something, and then fill in the details. You might even have to hire an actor to play the part if Ian wants to meet her. Maybe Polly can do it.\"\n\nI looked at Bruno and he was smiling. Apparently he liked the idea. So, we had the beginnings of a plan to get Rachael off the hook. I liked it too. But Maggie wasn't done. \n\n\"Next, you have to plant the evidence. I would contact Michael at the DA's office and tell him I told you to call. Ask him for a copy of the evidence they have on a Catholic Priest named Father Murphy. He was indicted for child pornography. The tape was quite graphic but was never used because the Priest pleaded guilty to avoid the publicity.\" \n\nWell now. Who the hell was Michael and why did Maggie know so much about him? This I had to ask. Damn it all! Bruno was standing there but he didn't seem ready to leave so I had to push ahead anyway. Just a casual question, no harm done.\n\n\"Ah, babe, who is Michael and how do you know so much about that case? Do you know him well?\" My voice was soft and sugar wouldn't melt in my mouth I was so sweet. \n\nMaggie just smiled at me and shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"I know him pretty well. I see him a couple of times a week. Why do you ask?\"\n\nI looked over at Bruno, waiting for him to get the hint, but he was having none of it. \"Bruno, would you run out and get us a couple of cokes from the machine down on the first floor?\"\n\nA smirk now! \"But boss, there's a machine here on this floor.\"\n\n\"Bruno?\" I was glaring at him so hard I was surprised he didn't have welts springing up on his face. But then he snickered, before he turned and walked out. Damn him!\n\nWhen he was gone, I turned to my Maggie and waited. I began to sweat when I saw she had that look of innocence on her face that I knew so well. She had me and she damn well knew it. I had walked into it with my eyes shut and my mouth open. Oh, well. \n\n\"Michael is Mrs. Palumbo's son. He's a lawyer for the District Attorney's office and he comes over to see his mother two or three times a week. She broke her hip you know so I've been keeping her company. He sometimes brings his wife and baby with him. The baby is just ten months old and is a real sweetheart.\"\n\nMaggie smiled at me sweetly with her hands folded neatly at her waist. I wouldn't have been surprised to see a halo floating over her head, from the angelic look on her face. Damn, I really think she set me up for that one.\n\n\"How'd you know about the tape?\"\n\n\"He was telling his mother about it and I overheard him. Not something I would be asking about, now is it?\"\n\n\"No. Am I going to pay for this?\" I was afraid for my life now. Maggie hated it when I doubted her.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to forgive you this time since I sort of helped you jump off the cliff. And anyway, you still have some points coming for promising to be nice to mother.\"\n\n\"I love your mother! She is a saint, that woman!\"\n\nMaggie laughed and reminded me that Bruno was coming back. I watched her walk out of the office with an added sway to her hips, just for me. I took it as sort of a promise of more to come. God, I loved that woman!\n\nWell, Bruno and I made our move two days later. I had indeed gotten a copy of the tape and I had it along with my tools as we took the back stairs to the fourth floor where Rick Harris had his apartment. We knew he was out and would be gone all day. We had hours to do our thing. I let Bruno pick the lock since he was faster than me and we slipped inside.\n\nThe apartment was a real dump. Dirty dishes in the sink, papers and carry out cartons scattered around the single living room, a dead plant on the window sill, a smell like something died permeating the whole place. I hesitated to touch anything until I had my gloves on. Bruno nodded toward the hall that lead to one of the rooms and I went in to find a desk with a computer and a file cabinet. Maybe the same file cabinet? Could be. I went to work while Bruno fired up the computer.\n\nIn the cabinet I found what I was looking for. There were more than thirty tapes of various women in hardcore pornography. Each had a file number on the casing and in another folder I found a list of names and addresses matching the file number on the videos. The rest of the files were filled with additional information on each of the girls, including three guys. I took them all, leaving the file cabinet empty. I searched the desk and drawers and found some additional names and addresses and took those as well. I checked the rest of the room but found nothing.\n\nBruno had the computer working and had somehow cracked Harris' password. For Bruno, that was child's play. The man was a techno genius. But, I've told you that before so you know. He had found a few more files that were hard-core and he looked at me for guidance.\n\n\"Trash them, or whatever you do to get rid of them. I have the tapes so he can't reload them.\"\n\nBruno did so and then did what we had come there to do: he uploaded the child pornography file that we had onto his hard drive. Bruno then did something so that the file couldn't be erased. He made up a name for the file and then buried the file in Harris' Documents file. It was now only one of more than thirty other files and Harris would likely never even notice it. But we made a note of the location for the police. Oh yes, we would let the police know about that file. \n\nWe shut down the computer, I looked around to be sure nothing was obvious while Bruno removed his cameras, and left the apartment the same way we came in; out the back. This time we had a bag of tapes and files and folders. It was a good caper and I had fun. Now to let Maggie know it was OK to talk to Rachael. In the car, Bruno was laughing and slapping me on the back.\n\n\"God, it was good working with you again, boss! I wish you'd do it more often. You got to admit. It's a blast!\"\n\n\"You're right Bruno my man. But, you know how Maggie feels about me working out in the field. She thinks I'm past my prime and you know, she's probably right. But when it's worth it, like this, I'll be there. Count on it! Now, let's go home.\"\n\nBack at the office, I let Maggie know that the job was done. She called Rachael Pickering, told her that she had some information concerning her and Rick Harris and told her she had best come in. I was surprised that Maggie was so cold to her, but she assured me that she knew what she was doing. \n\n\"This girl needs to be hit hard, right between the eyes. She needs to know how close she came to losing everything. She thought she was doing the right thing but she needs to know never to trust anyone like that son of a bitch. I'm going to explain things to her that she needs to know.\"\n\nI knew Maggie and I knew she would treat this girl like her own. Maggie's heart was as big as all outdoors but she didn't like to think anyone knew it. I certainly did. She was my Maggie and I loved her like crazy. \n\nRachael Pickering came in the office the next day just after lunch. Maggie told her 1:00 and she was right on the dot. I watched her come in and she was more beautiful in person than she was in her pictures.\n\nShe was a real knockout . . . \n\nOh hell. You know the drill by now. She was hot, that's all I need to say. Maggie came into my office with Rachael and that was my cue to leave. I stood, introduced myself and then kissed Maggie on the mouth before walking down the hall to the little conference room we used sometimes. I had some time to kill.\n\nI was drinking a coke and reading the paper when Maggie came to get me. She said Rachael wanted to thank me and for me to come back to the office. I walked with her back while she filled me in. Seems Rachael was almost in tears when she came in and was about to confess all to her husband rather than let anyone else blackmail her. She said she was fed up and couldn't lie to her husband anymore. Maggie calmed her down, told her we had the tape and that Rick Harris was about to be arrested and sent up for a long spell for child pornography. When she told her that, she said the look on Rachael's face was like a child given a wonderful present. She was in shock still but beginning to realize she was free. \n\nI walked into the office to see Rachael sitting in one of those uncomfortable plastic chairs we kept to cut down on the stay time, snipping away with a pair of scissors at the tape she had pulled from a cassette. She was grinning from ear to ear and jumped up as soon as she saw me. She came to me, threw her arms around me and pressed those DD cups against my chest, causing my blood pressure to rise uncomfortably high. Unfortunately she didn't keep me long. She was too excited.\n\n\"Maggie told me what you did for me. I want to tell you how grateful I am and to tell you I'll do anything I can for you. Anything Maggie would permit of course.\" Then she laughed and hugged Maggie again. Maggie seemed to be OK with what she said because she just laughed. I was glad of that. \n\n\"You're very welcome Rachael. We just couldn't let you be destroyed by something you couldn't control. We can tell your husband that you were seeing a friend with a sick mother. I guess Maggie filled you in?\"\n\n\"Yes, she did. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you and please say thank you to Mr. Bruno. Maggie told me about him. All of you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\n\"Consider it a Christmas Gift. From all of us to you and Ian. He just won't know about it. But, all in all, I think he'll be happy as well with my report.\"\n\nRachael stayed a short while and then left to go home. I called Ian as soon as she left and asked him to come in to receive the final report. He asked me if I had confirmed what I told him and I assured him the news would be good. He didn't answer and hung up almost immediately. I thought I heard a sob just before the line went dead.\n\nWell, when Ian heard that his wife had not been visiting a Mr. Rick Harris but rather a woman on the same floor by the name of Polly whose mother was sick, he was almost giddy with relief. I assured him that his wife had done nothing inappropriate during the entire time we monitored her and I apologized profusely and offered to reduce the charge by 10% for our original error, but he was so happy that he insisted on paying the full $3,000 with a bonus of $500. He told me to just destroy the report. He was going home to his wife and to the best Christmas he had ever hoped for. I slapped him on the back and ushered him out of the office and on his way home. \n\nMaggie came in after he left and I handed her the check for the full amount. \"This will keep the wolves from our door for another month. Then things should get back to normal once the new year begins. This was a good case. A good ending.\"\n\n\"It was. You did good on this one. You and Bruno. We should give him a nice little bonus for his work.\"\n\n\"I'd rather give you a bonus. How about right here and right now? You know your Mother is due in tonight. I have a feeling I'll be awfully horny by the time she goes home. But I'm going to be nice like I promised.\"\n\nMaggie walked to the door, closed it and slipped the lock. \"I'm going to reward you for your big heart right now husband, and again tonight, and if Mom doesn't want to hear me making love to my husband, that's her problem. I hope she brings her ear plugs for bedtime.\" \n\nGod, I love that woman!"
