Saddened by that fact, he decided to walk along the fabulous beach in front of the hotel. 'Some topless women sunbathing will cheer me up,' he thought.\n\nAs he walked along, he spotted something out in the water rolling towards the beach. He waded out and picked it up. It looked like a big lump of barnacles and coral, but there was something shiny under the crud. He looked around and found a small stone and carefully smashed his find with the rock. To his amazement, the crud broke off cleanly and left him holding a delicately carved glass bottle. \n\nThere was a stopper in it. 'Should I?' he thought. 'I don't know. It might be more valuable intact.' Pondering, his curiosity got the better of him and he yanked the stopper out. \n\nRed and yellow and purple smoke billowed out of the bottle and James tried to throw it away, but he was too terrified. Finally, the smoke cleared and a stereotypical genie stood in front of him.\n\n\"What is your one wish, my master,\" the genie intoned. \n\nBefore he had a chance to think, James engaged his mouth and spoke up, \"I thought I got three wishes? What's up with only one wish?\"\n\nThe genie glared at him and James could almost feel his skin blistering from the heat of that look.\n\nThe genie took a deep breath and asked, \"Have you ever been imprisoned in a small glass jar for five thousand years?\"\n\nJames replied instantly, \"Obviously not. Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" the genie began. \"For the first five hundred years, I was imprisoned I thought about nothing else but clawing out the throat of the person that set me free.\"\n\nJames gulped.\n\n\"For the next fifteen hundred years, I thought of nothing but disemboweling the person who set me free.\"\n\nJames' hand instinctively went to cover his stomach.\n\n\"For the next two thousand years, I thought of nothing but sticking my penis in the ass of the person who set me free, until it came out their mouth.\"\n\nJames' hand instinctively covered his butt.\n\n\"For the last thousand years, I thought of nothing but making the asshole who set me free immortal and cutting him with little cuts all over their body, so they always bled and then throwing that person to the sharks.\"\n\nBy this time James was petrified. He was absolutely, positively, 100% sure he was going to die.\n\n\"But in the last 10 minutes, I decided to be nice and grant the person who set me free, a single wish. And so, my master, I am not going to cut your throat, or disembowel you or fuck you to death or feed your immortal carcass to sharks.\n\n\"So, what is your wish?\"\n\nIt took a moment for James to realize he wasn't going to die and even more time to find his voice. \"Can I have a minute to think about this? I mean, it is kind of sudden.\"\n\n\"Take your time, my master. I am enjoying my freedom. I've not felt the wind in my hair and water at my feet for five thousand years, not to mention the almost naked women parading around on this beach.\"\n\nRelieved, James started to think. 'Money? Nah, too passe. A beautiful woman to be my sex slave? Nah, genies always find a way to twist things around, she'd probably have clap. An amazing house? With a pool? Nah. The taxman would probably get it because I couldn't pay the real estate taxes.\" \n\nThe genie scowled at James and growled, \"Hurry up little man. I have been trapped for five thousand years and I long to tear it up.\"\n\nJames gulped again and then said, \"I'm sorry but there are so many thing that I could wish for and so many of them could go wrong. I'm having trouble figuring it out.\"\n\nThe genie swelled up and began to tower over James. \n\nJames began to cower and suddenly blurted out, \"Oh, fuck. I wish I had never found this bottle.\"\n\nThe genies eyes grew wide and as he began to turn into smoke, he screamed at James, \"No, you stupid motherfu\"\n\nAs the smoke cleared, James was left standing on the beach. 'What a beautiful day,' he thought. \n\n\"I wish my vacation would never end,\" he said to nobody as the blonde playing volleyball jumped up and her tits popped out of her top. He thought he heard someone screaming."
