        "Gayle knew it was very important to borrow the money if she was to stay in business. Things were tight but expected to improve soon, meanwhile she just needed a thousand dollars to keep her head above water and Gayle was determined to get the money somehow. \n\nGayle tried to think of her options for borrowing the money and all she could come up with was a friend that had the money and would be more then willing to loan it to her. But the catch was.. the way he would want it re-paid. He had the 'hots' for her and sex would be the issue. Gayle had no doubt about it but no one else she could think of to loan her money on such short notice. She decided to approach David about the loan and to deal with it as carefully as she possibly could.\n\nSeveral nights a week, Gayle went to David's house to sit in his hot tub. He was a friend but wanted to be more. She did not want to be anything but friends... she didn't feel attracted to him other then as a friend or so she told herself often enough. They always enjoyed each others company and laughed a lot when they hung out. He was constantly trying to convince her it was a rule that you had to go naked in the hot tub, but she refused to take her suit off and laughed at him about it. He never gave up trying to get her naked and devised different ways to get her out of her clothing. It had become a game between the two of them, one she did not intent to lose.\n\nGayle figured she had to offer more then the normal 'payback' to get the loan, but she had to be very careful what was said. She went over to David's house, a new thong swimsuit in her bag, and her mind set. She'd at least show him her ass and hope he would be satisfied enough with that and would just loan her the money. She was sure she could get the money but it had to be repaid as quickly as possible or who knew what David would demand of her in lieu of payment or interest.\n\nDavid greeted Gayle at the door, a more then happy expression on his face. He was crazy about this hard to get naked female and was always eager to see her. Now if he could just get her out of her clothing.... just once. They chatted for a few minutes before Gayle went to change into her suit. She heard the doorbell ring as she came out of the bathroom, then heard the voices of a couple of David's friends and figured he wouldn't come out to the hot tub for awhile. That was fine with her, she felt pretty close to naked, wearing the thong, and hurried to immerse herself in the tub's water.\n\nGayle sighed in pleasure as the water covered her up to her chin. The jets doing their job as they pushed water over and against Gayle's body. It felt heavenly to sit there in the hot water, her head tilted back, resting against a cushion. She let her mind drift, thinking of how to ask David for the loan and curious about what he might demand for it.\n\nGayle was a petite woman. The kind men thought of as a 'spinner.' She was sexy, bright and had a good sense of humor which men found attractive.\n\nHer features were small, she was juat barely over five feet tall and weighted a whole 108 lbs. She wore her hair shoulder length and liked the light blonde color of it. She colored her natural hair, which was a mousey brown, and had for years.\n\nShe had lived alone for a number of years after having had a failed marriage and a broken relationship with a long time boyfriend. She didn't trust men much anymore, they had caused her too much pain. Of course she liked men, always had, always would, but as for falling in love again, she had her doubts. She loved sex and hated to think of not having it on a regular basis, but it was too risky to sleep with just anyone.\n\nShe sat, with her eyes closed, enjoying the hot tub's comfort and didn't notice that David had come outside. He stood a distance away from the tub, just looking at Gayle and thinking how much he wanted to fuck her. She was one special lady as far as he was concerned. Now if he could only convince her to sleep with him, the world would be a better place! Davod grinned to himself, thinking, 'It will happen, just got to be patient.'\n\nGayle snapped out of her daydreaming when David announced his arrival in the tub with a splash of the hot water washing over her face. \"Damn it David! You shouldn't try to drown your guests with hot water!\" she scolded. David just laughed as he got comfortable across from her. \"Oh hush,\" he replied to the irritated woman he adored and lusted after. They spent a half hour teasing each other, joking about different things and laughing. \n\n\"I'm turning into a prune,\" Gayle finally said as she reached for a towel and stepped out of the tub. \"No way, maybe a little raisonette\" David said, reaching to pinch Gayle's ass. She saw his movement and got out of his reach before his fingers made contact. \"Your a snake!\" she laughed, wrapping the towel around her waist. \"Nice ass..I mean thong,\" David leered, watching her blush. \"I can't understand why you need to wear anything in the tub, I'll go naked if you will.\" he added. \"You wish.\" she answered with a tight little smile.\n\nThey dried off and went inside the house. David fixed drinks for both of them and they sat in front of the fireplace, talking. Gayle was trying to work up the nerve to ask about the loan.\n\nShe had a strong feeling he was going to finally make her bend to his will with the request of seeing her naked. 'What harm could there be in that?' she thought as she half listened to him. \"Penny for your thoughts,\" David said, \"I'm sorry, I was just thinking.\" Gayle said in apology for not really listening and getting caught at it.\n\n\"David, I need to ask a big favor of you..\" she began.\n\nDavid listened intently as Gayle told him her situation and asked for a loan of money. His heartbeat excelerated with excitement. A grin threatened to pull his mouth up at the corners. When Gayle had finished asking her question, he sat and looked into the fire for a few moments, letting her grow more nervous. \"Well Gayle, it seems to me we can work something out here.\" he finally said as he turned his gaze on her once more. Gayle didn't miss seeing the twinkle in his brown eyes. She decided to ignore it.\n\n\"Oh David,\" she said in relief of having it overwith and said, \"You don't know how much I appreciate you doing this for me! I'll have the money back to you in one week.\" she added. \"One week huh? And if you don't have it then? Interest?\" David ask slyly. \"Oh I'll have it.\" Gayle said, caution bells sounding in her head. \"But if you don't?\" he said again, still staring directly into her eyes. \"What do you want if I don't?\" she responded a little annoyed by his question.\n\n\"If you don't repay me the money in exactly one week from the day I give you the cash, I want to eat your pussy for one half hour.\" David told her.\n\nGayle's mouth dropped open, then closed quickly. She stared into the fire, feeling her cheeks burn pink at his suggestion. She shouldn't have been surprised, he had made it clear often enough that he'd love to touch her. She sat there thinking over the deal he wanted her to agree to and decided, it wouldn't hurt to agree since she would have the money in plenty of time.\n\n\"Okay, it's a deal.\" she told him and frowned when he clapped his hands in his excitement. \"Oh yeah! Baby...your gonna be one happy loser!\" he told her with a big sloppy grin on his face. \"Aww c'mon babe, don't look so 'down an out' it's just a half hour that you'll love!\" he told her. \"Shut-up you jackass!\" she scolded. David laughed at her words and the tone in which she said them. He loved a woman with a temper! It just meant she was probably pretty hot in bed too. He hoped she couldn't come up with the money and had to 'pay up' on the interesting part of the deal. But he was also aware that she was pretty much capable of coming up with the money in a pinch, besides the fact she didn't want to let him have his way with her. He planned to keep his fingers, toes and anything else that would work, crossed, in hopes that she couldn't do it on time.\n\nDavid thought of Gayle's tight little ass, which he had seen in the thong suit. Without a doubt the rest of her was just a yummy. Damn it was going to be one tense week of waiting and hoping she'd fail to have the cash back to him at the appointed time. \n\nThe next afternoon, David gave Gayle ten hundred dollar bills. She thanked him and again promised to have it back to him at the end of the week. She had just made a buisness sale that would pay her a great deal of money, and it was supposed to be in her hands on Friday. She had to pay David by Monday or be forced to keep her word and let him have her. At least have her for a half hour.\n\nIt wasn't that David was unattractive, he wasn't. In fact he was quite good looking, but he was a womanizer, always chasing skirts and had a different woman weekly. Or so it seemed to Gayle. She didn't plan to be another notch on his belt or his bedpost. Not if she could help it from happening. \n\nThe week seemed to drag for David, he was anxious for it to end so he could 'do as he wished' with pretty, little Gayle. He was more then a little fond of her, he sometimes thought he might even be in love. She was so different the the other women he knew and he respected her independance and spirit. But he wouldn't let her back down from their agreement, no way, no how.\n\nGayle felt the days slip past and it seemed to her they did so far too quickly. She kept busy with work and waited for Friday to arrive, bringing with it the money she was counting on. At least she did have until Monday in case, for some unknown reason, she didn't get it Friday. She could just imagine the smug smile on David's lips if she had to give it up to him.\n\nFriday came, and Friday went... and the check was 'in the mail' or so her customer told her on the telephone that afternoon after the postman had been there. Gayle had hung up, sat at her desk for a moment, then gotten up and kicked her wastebasket across the room. Her fists were clenched and she felt like throwing a tantrum right then and there. Getting herself under control, she got through the rest of the day. When she got home she called David. \"Hi David, there's been a problem with the mail. It's going to be Monday after all, when I can bring you your money.\" she said, trying to keep her voice light.\n\n\"No problem babe,\" he answered in her ear, then laughed. \"I can wait for you.\" he added before hanging up.\n\nGayle hadn't gone over to David's house all week and missed using the hot tub as well as his company. She just didn't feel relaxed enough to put up with his teasing, so she'd stayed away. On Saturday, she made a trip to her office to check the mail but found no check waiting. She frowned as she locked the office and headed back home. The weekend finally ended and Monday arrived like it always did. Gayle tapped a pencil on her desktop while she waited impatiently for the mailman's arrival. He was late, of course, just to add to her annoyance. Then to make matters worse, he delivered no check.\n\nGayle couldn't believe it! She had been so certain it would be there. Now she had to face David with the news that she couldn't repay him as promised and she knew he would be thrilled...\n\nGayle decided she couldn't face David just yet, so she called him instead. \"Hello David, I'm afraid it's going to be a bit longer before I have your money..\" she said nervously. \"No problem Gayle, I know your word is good and you'll give it to me as soon as you can.\" he answered in a calm voice. She couldn't see the hugh smile on his face. \"Oh thank you David! I knew you would understand!\" she breathed in relief. They spoke for a few more minutes, then hung up. He didn't mention the promise she had made about sex. Gayle was sure he wouldn't hold her to it anyway...of course he wouldn't.\n\nTuesday morning brought the check she was waiting for. Gayle hurried to the bank to deposit it and to withdraw the borrowed money to repay David with. The day went by smoothly and she was feeling much better about things.\n\nGayle drove to David's house and sighed with relief when he took the money and acted as usual. He said the hot tub was heated up and ready for use. He told Gayle to go on ahead that he had a couple of telephone calls to make first, then he would join her. She smiled at him and went to change into her suit. She'd forgotten it was the thong in her bag. She had no choice but to wear it now. Again she hurried to the tub so she could hide in the water the fact that she had it on.\n\nDavid finally joined her, bringing drinks for both of them. He climbed into the hot water and sighed in pleasure of the hot water rushing around him. Gayle sipped her drink and thought how good it was. They chatted about each other's week and about mutual friends. A half hour later found them climbing out of the tub and toweling off. \"Have you had dinner?\" David asked. \"Yes, I grabbed a bite to eat after work.\" Gayle answered. \"Well so have I, but I'm definately ready for dessert!\" David said with a leer. Gayle stood frozen in her tracks. \"David?\" she said, puzzled at his tone and the way he was looking at her. \n\nDavid laughed. \"C'mon Gayle, you know the deal, and you are a day late with the money.\" he said.\n\nGayle frowned deeply at him then said, \"Surely your not going to hold me to that are you?\" \"Hey, your the one that agreed to it AND said you would keep your promise.\" he told her. Gayle was astonished that he obviously meant to make her keep her word. She felt betrayed and angry at him for it. But damn it, he was right, she had given her word. \"Okay, okay,\" he said, \"It doesn't have to be this very minute.\" \n\nGayle got dressed and told David she would honor her word but not right then. She needed a little time to get her head right concerning it. He told her to take all the time she needed, as long as it wasn't more then a day or two. With that, she left madder then hell.\n\nDavid grinned to himself after Gayle had slammed the door and stormed off. He knew she'd get over it and might actually enjoy herself if she'd give him a chance to show her how much he felt for her. He had made a mistake with their relationship in the beginning by basing it totally on 'friendship.' That was what she had wanted and he'd gone along with it only to regret it later when he found he felt more for her then just being 'buddies.' He would wait until the right time to tell her how he felt. Meanwhile, if he could get a taste of her luscious pussy, all the better life would be! He hated to 'make' her give in to him, but if that's what it took, so be it.\n\nGayle sat on her bed trying to calm herself down. She was so mad at David and at herself for getting into this 'deal' of his. If she didn't follow through, it would make her look like a liar and a cheat, or that her word wasn't good. But considering all things, why should she honor her promise? She'd given him the money back. But no matter how she looked at the situation, she was still in the wrong by not repaying the debt as promised when she got him to loan her the money. \"Dammit! Dammit to hell\" she muttered. She was restless and angry at the whole thing having happened at all, and had no one to blame but herself for agreeing to it.\n\nShe jumped up off the bed and dressed again. \"Might as well get it over with.\" she said to her reflection in the mirror. \"And if I have to do it, I might as well make the best of it.\" she added, as she brushed her thick hair in quick strokes. She put on a short dress and back tights underneith. \"Fuck the panties!\" she snarled as she jerked her shoes out of the closet and roughly put them on. She was so mad she could barely stand it. She knew she was acting childish but wasn't about to stop herself, not right then. Her anger was the fuel to keep her moving right at the moment.\n\nDriving back to David's house, she had time to collect herself and by the time she arrived at his front door, she appeared cool and calm on the outside. David opened the door and smiled when he saw Gayle standing there. She was so beautiful in his eyes, even angry. He hoped her anger made her aggressive in bed! He stepped aside as she entered and stalked into the livingroom. One light was lit and the fire was blazing. He'd been reading when she had knocked. A drink sat on the coffeetable and soft music was playing. \"Can I get you something to drink?\" he asked. \"Yes, make it something strong.\" Gayle snapped at him, then took her coat off and flung it over the back of a chair.\n\n\"Okay Gayle, relax...I'm not going to kill you or anything.\" David told her when he returned with a whisky and seven-up in his hand. He handed her the drink and watched as she drank half of it down. Her eyes watered from the whisky, he'd made it strong as she had requested. She felt the liquid warm her inside as it went down. Gayle wasn't much of a drinker and started to feel the alcohol right away. She visuably relaxed after a few more sips of the drink. David grinned, thinking how beautiful she was. No way would he let her out of their agreement, it might be his only chance to have her and he wasn't going to miss his opportunity.\n\n\"Well David, let's fuck.\" she said suddenly, her voice slightly slurred. She started to unbutton her dress. \"Whoa...wait just a minute hon..\" he said \"I'm in no hurry babe.\" he added, watching her dress slide down her petite frame to a puddle on the floor. She kicked it away and started to peel the tights off next. David watched her with amusment and lust. 'Damn' he thought, 'She is one beautiful woman.' Gayle stood staring into the fire, wearing only her bra now, her petite body took on a glow from the light of the flames. Her hair fell down her back in waves and curls, making her look like a wild fairy to David. She was so tiny and childlike, it made his heart ache to look at her.\n\n\"Well, c'mon..lets do it.\" she said as she turned on her heel and marched down the hallway towards his bedroom. \"Gayle wait,\" he called after her. \"Let's go sit in the hot tub for awhile.\" he told her when he caught up with her in the hall. \"Why?\" she asked him, she had made up her mind and wanted to be done with it. David frowned, this wasn't exactly the way it was supposed to go. He didn't want a 'grudge fuck' from her, he wanted her to enjoy it as much as he would. Taking her by the elbow, he guided her out the side door to the hot tub. She shrugged his hand off and reached behind her back to unhook her bra, then kicked her shoes off. David enjoyed looking at her naked body for a moment before she got into the water. He was delighted to see that she shaved her pussy. It was smooth and as lovely as he had figured it would be. His cock was also finding the sight most intriging. Not wanting the sight of his hardening cock to scare her off, he quickly got out of his pants and climbed into the tub and sat across from Gayle. \n\nTo ease the tension, David made small talk about his job, then about people they both knew. At first Gayle was reluctant to talk much. She could be pretty stubborn when she wanted, but after awhile she started to relax. David made no moves towards her, just chatted. It didn't take long before Gayle forgot her anger and was laughing at one of David's silly stories. She noticed her nakedness and grew quiet again. She'd forgotten that she'd taken her clothing off! Now she saw that David was also in the buff and her cheeks turned pink. David saw her blush and knew what had caused it. He quickly decided to ignore it and kept talking like nothing had happened.\n\nReaching over the side of the tub, David opened a small refrigerator and got ice cubes out of it. He had brought the whiskey and 7-Up out with them, he poured Gayle a fresh drink and handed it to her. She took the drink and thanked him before taking a big gulp. The warmth flooded her body on the inside as the whiskey made it's way down. David sipped his drink and looked at Gayle, admiring her skin, her blue eyes with their dark lashes, even wet, her hair looked good to him. He watched a drop of water fall from the tip of her nose to her chest, then roll downwards. He wished he was that drop of water right at the moment. Better yet, he'd like to lick the dropplets of water off her body, one at a time. His cock twitched at these thoughts.",
        "They had been sitting in the tub for a little more then half an hour. David suggested they get out and go back inside to the fire. It was getting pretty chilly outside. He stood and wrapped a towel around himself, then handed a terry cloth robe to Gayle. \"Here, bundle up in this..\" he told her, then walked back to the house. Gayle watched him go and waited until he dissappeared inside before she stood up and put the robe on. Her teeth chattered as she hurried inside to find David adding wood to the fire. He had slipped into a pair of pants, just to ease her nervousness. When she sat near him, he barely glanced towards her.\n\nDavid stood up and walked over to the one light burning in the room and turned it off. Now the only light came from the fireplace. He put some music on and sat on the couch, looking at the fire's flames licking the logs of wood. Gayle stared at them too, her mind a bit fuzzy from the drinks. She sat on the carpet, her back against a chair and her knees drawn up to her chest. She didn't notice the robe had fallen open and that David had a clear view of her snatch. \n\nThey sat in comfortable silence for awhile, then David rose from the couch and sat beside Gayle on the floor. She tensed up when his hand brushed her leg. Glancing at him quickly, she saw he was just getting comfortable on the floor, not trying to do anything to her! It suddenly dawned on her that she was acting pretty childish about things. After all, he hadn't forced her to agree to anything, she had done so willingly. And it wasn't his fault she hadn't been able to have the money when it was agreed upon. It was she who had given her word to honor their agreement. And now she realized how stupid she had been acting. They were both adults, not two kids.\n\nGayle moved over next to David and took the robe off. She lay back and smiled shyly at him. \"I made a promise and I'll keep my word on it.\" she told him softly. David's eyes twinkled in the firelight as he gazed at her. One eyebrow had lifted a little when she spoke. He reached out and put his hand on her stomach, gently moving it over her softness. He scooted closer and leaned over to kiss her lips. He was thrilled to find her responding to his mouth. She was actually kissing him back!\n\nDavid's tongue slid between Gayle's soft lips, exploring her mouth. He felt her tongue dance with his and his cock reacted with a jerk. He put one leg over her body and ran his hand down her, marvaling at her perfect little body. His mouth left hers and kissed it's way across her jawline then her throat. Gayle moaned softly as David made his way to her breasts. When his mouth covered the nipple of one of her tits, she felt like an electric shock had gone through her body.\n\nDavid felt her nipple harden in his mouth, his tongue played around it for a moment, then he took it between his teeth and bit down lightly. Gayle groaned in pleasure, her eyes were closed, her lips slightly parted as he moved further down her body. It was like being in a dream, her body was loving the attention it was getting while her mind drifted on a cloud. David kissed her stomach, then used his tongue to make a damp path to the vee between her legs. He stopped and looked up at Gayle face for a second. \"Don't stop!\" she moaned. He continued to lick and kiss everywhere but her pussy. He could see the moisture there and knew she was responding to his touches. Moving around so he could get between her legs, David lay down and put her feet over his shoulders. \n\nGayle held her breath, waiting for him to touch her pussy. She could hardly stand it now, she NEEDED to be touched there! He continued to play, moving his tongue in little circles close to her pussy but still not touching it. He wanted her to ask him to do it. Finally he heard her say, \"Please David, lick my pussy! I can't stand it anymore!\" He smiled in triumph and plunged his tongue between her pussy lips. Gayle arched her back, raising her hips to meet his mouth. Pleasure exploded in her mind and body.\n\nDavid inserted a finger slowly as he licked her pussy. He quickly found her clit and flicked his tongue against it. She was moaning and tossing her head from side to side. He felt her hands on the sides of his head, pulling him closer, deeper.\n\nHe sucked hard on her clit and she cried out for more. His cock was screaming for pussy now! He could feel it throbbing. The deal had been for him to just eat her pussy, now he wondered if he was expected to just do that or if fucking was part of the deal! Damn...he'd never thought about that until now.\n\nHis question was answered when Gayle started begging, \"David, fuck me..fuck my pussy! I want your cock inside of me..please!\" He slid up her body, careful not to crush her under his weight. When his cock was at the entrance, he held back, waiting. Gayle was crazy with lust, she HAD to have his cock and she wanted it NOW! With that thought, she thrust upwards and impaled herself on his hard manhood. \"Aughhhhhhh YESSSSSSS!\" she yelled out as he started pumping his dick in and out of her wetness. Her legs lifted and wrapped around him, opening herself up to his thrusts. Their bodies moved together towards the same objective...release and pleasure. David's mouth found her breasts once more as he fucked her pussy. She responed with her body, her hands running over his back and shoulders, her hips grinding against him. He held back until her orgasm exploded wet juices over his cock, then he let go and she felt his hot cum deep inside her pussy. They both rode the wild ride together for a long time, or so it seemed. Finally, spent, he rolled over to hold her as he lay next to her on the floor. When her breathing was normal again she whispered \"Wow..\" and gave a shaky laugh. \n\n\"Paid in full,\" David said with a satisfied smile on his face. Gayle slapped him on his arm playfully.\n\n\"Jackass.\" she snapped with a grin.\n\nShe knew things had changed between them and much to her surprise, she was happy about it. They lay together as the fire slowly burned down to ashes..."
