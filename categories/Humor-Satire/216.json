        "Editor's note: this story contains scenes of incest or incest content.\n\n*****\n\nThis is a very short story. I think I ended it, before I realized it was over. There are attempts at humor, and it's yet another play on the free-use theme, with a touch of sci-fi tossed in. (In which was tossed? Fuck it, I'm ending it with a preposition.)\n\nBe prepared for pseudosciencebabble, absurd situations, and wholly unintimate, detached sex. For those into silly romps, you might dig it. It shouldn't have to be stated, but all fictional players are of legal age.\n\nI'm putting this in humor (rather than fetish, or incest, or sci-fi). It has sprinkles of all those elements, but is intended to be more funny, than sexual. Hmm, I could have failed at both. That all said, if you don't have a kinky side, you might hate this. \n\nCheers!\n\n*****\n\nThe change in human behavior began over a year ago, and it was instant, not evolved. It was later discovered to have occurred by the technology of an alien device, sent down from an unknown world. One can imagine the confusion when every adult woman on Earth woke up to a supernaturally heightened libido. That's what this device caused. Women openly and wantonly pursued sexual acts, everywhere, at any time. \n\nIt made working and living more challenging, but as life must move on, society came to accept it. Men didn't understand it at first; women throwing themselves at them, demanding sexual favors... but they persevered. \n\nNot long after it all started, a research team in the Antarctic found the alien sphere, 40-foot in diameter. It's materials were unknown, but the fact that it had a door meant there was more to discover inside. After confirming it was safe, funds were allocated to have the sphere moved to a secret location near the states, where it took almost two months alone just to figure out how to open it. Inside, was a giant room of alien technology. There were panels, buttons, flat, flexible screens with strange code and weird symbols flashing on them. Scientists from around the world assembled to decipher the mystery. \n\nLinguistics spent months on it, alongside many IT professionals, before the truth was discovered. The sphere was intentionally sent to change human behavior. It could only be assumed by the scientific community that it was meant to weaken us, in preparation for a future invasion. One of the techs working on the project named it the \"Terra-Slutter\" and somehow that name stuck. It was a global-impacting device that sent a pheromone into the atmosphere changing all women into dirty, cock-starved sluts. \n\nThis didn't mean that women turned into brainless sex zombies. Women were still as intelligent and valuable to society as they always were. They just had insatiable sexual appetites, enough to strip their personalities of shame. \n\nSenator Brandi Piles had been tasked with the committee to see to the end of this project. In fact, it was her team that had managed getting the sphere moved and examined. Today was the day they intended to shut the device down altogether, and Doctor Amanda West, the lead scientist over the team, was answering the senator's questions before they initiated did the act. \n\nDr. West had just explained to the senator that it was highly likely people would go back to living life without wanton sex, just like before the device landed. \"But it is also entirely possible that shutting the machine down could cause extreme mental trauma in some people. There are possible forms of PTSD to consider, especially when people have memories of engaging in sexual acts with strangers, family members, or even people they may dislike.\"\n\n\"Dr. West,\" countered Senator Piles, \"My college son comes into my room every morning and cums on my face. He does this, because I demand it of him. It gets him prepped for the day, and wakes me up, too. You are suggesting that I WON'T want that after we shut this machine down? That seems crazy to me. But you're also suggesting that I might be disgusted, by the fact that I allowed it in the first place?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I'm saying, Senator Piles,\" said the female scientist, as she gently twisted one of her hard nipples.\n\nThe other women sitting around the table began murmuring amongst each other. Some of them were fingering themselves, but a few were in between orgasms at the moment, able to provide their full attention to the matter at hand. \n\nDan Phillips was an assistant to Senator Brandi Piles, and sat on the opposite side of the Senator, as she and Dr. West engaged in their conversation. During this time, the senator had also been shoving a huge purple number into her soaking wet pussy. It was whirring rather loudly, too. \n\nDan worked intimately with Senator Piles. He knew she rarely masturbated with such a large vibrator, so he had no idea why she thought it would be a good idea to use one now, during such a critical meeting. Yet here she was, going to town. To Dan, Senator Brandi Piles was barely able to stay focused on the conversation, though she did fake it pretty well. Senator Piles lowered the speed of the vibrator and turned towards Dan.\n\n\"Dan,\" she said. \"Would you mind standing on the table and putting your cock in my mouth? I could really use some help getting over the edge here.\" Then Brandi turned the vibrator back to maximum. He sighed and scrambled up up the table, dropping his trousers. \n\nDan didn't mind so much having the other ladies in the room watching. In fact, he'd put up with Senator Piles' needs on enough occasions, that he was used to it. She was always around loads of people. She was a public figure, after all. It did, however, feel a little strange being one of the only men in the large conference room today. There were only two other males sitting around the huge table, and they were, at the moment, unmolested. \n\nJust before Senator Piles pulled Dan's hanging cock into her mouth, she looked back to Dr. West next to her and said, \"It's obvious we enjoy being sluts. Do you really think we will regret turning this device off?\"\n\n\"Interesting you bring that up,\" said Dr. West. \"Do you mind if you have your man cum on my face when he finishes?\"\n\nDan looked at the scientist. She was in her mid-50s, with an average body. Decent for one her age, but nothing amazing. She had a nice smile, though, and he certainly wouldn't mind unloading on it. Brandi had always been selfish in the past (typical of a politician), but this time she nodded. \"Swallowing?\" she asked the scientist.\n\n\"Maybe. The thing is, it can be assumed that there is a possibility, that once we turn off the machine, many women will come to the conclusion that all of their actions were... forced. There could be significant menta-\"\n\n\"Forced?!\" scoffed Senator Piles. \"Come on. That's ridiculous. I mean, I guess one could call it that, but our attitudes have always been welcoming. How will that change? \" The senator stopped speaking, opened her mouth and shoved Dan's thick shaft inside. She worked quickly, eager to pump the results onto the doctor's face. Seeing that image would certainly help her cum, she thought, as Brandi continued pumping the thick, purple vibrator in and out of her pussy with her other hand.\n\nDr. West responded, \"I'm just saying, we all need to be aware that some people may have such reactions. I was thinking, if we discover it's a problem, we put a committee together to address any mental health issues. It would look good from a political perspective.\"\n\nSenator Piles couldn't imagine a world where she would be embarrassed about guzzling down a load of cum, as she wanted to do right now. Instead, as she promised, she pulled Dan's cock out, and aimed it at her colleague. A rope of semen shot out, hitting the female scientist on the cheek, who immediately pushed forward to catch the second stream in her mouth. The senator was impressed with the scientist's enthusiasm, but less so with her concern over some fanciful, public anxiety crisis.\n\nSenator Piles explained, \"If we discover enough members of the public are having trouble coping, I think your plan is sound. However, I don't think we should rush to wild theories. After we shut this machine down, we might not be so... hormonal... but I don't think we'll be emotionally scarred.\" Personally, the Senator believed Dr. West should stick with the hard sciences.\n\nDr. West smiled and thanked Dan, before he stepped off the table. She didn't bother wiping off the bits of semen splattered on her face, before replying to the senator. \"I just wanted you to be aware, Senator. I'll contact Dr. Phibs in the Terra-Slutter and have him run the shutdown.\" She pulled out her phone and sent a text, followed by a brief call. \"It's time,\" she said.\n\nAs Dr. West put the phone down, Senator Piles turned to her once again. \"No matter how this goes, it's an historic moment.\" Even though she'd just cum, the senator was still riding the vibrator, albeit slowly. Sensually. \"And it's my personal belief, tha-\" \n\nBut then the senator stopped talking mid-sentence, and her vaginal muscles tightened up like a Venus fly-trap. She realized her skirt was pulled up, exposing everything below, along with a big, fat vibrator shoved in her pussy. All of a sudden, she was horrified she would be doing such a thing, especially in front of Dan, her assistant. He may have been a professional asset, but at times Dan would creep her out intensely.\n\nThe look on Dr. West's face showed a similar surprised reaction. Eyes wide, she just kept them locked on the Senator's. \"Please tell me I didn't leave all this cum on my face.\"\n\n\"You... yo... ya.. yes... you did.\" Senator Piles struggled to talk with the vibrator slamming her drying pussy. Drying, because she was so focused on her humiliation, any feeling of sexual pleasure had evaporated. She needed to get the damn thing out, but she wasn't for a minute going to do that with an audience! Instead, she bore down on it, doing her best to ignore it. Then, in a flash, a memory entered her mind, and her heart sank. Without thinking, she confessed out loud, \"I let my son, Adam, fuck me in the ass last night. Oh my god, how can I ever look him in the face again!\"\n\n\"Did you let him, or make him, fuck you in the ass?\" asked Dan. Senator Piles and Dr. West turned to him. He was furiously stroking his stiff cock, even though he, too, had cum only moments before.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" shouted Senator Piles. She'd seen Dan's cock plenty of times, but she never recalled him openly masturbating. Not even when she did it. Memories of such acts flashed in mind, making her cringe.\n\nDr. West tapped the senator on her shoulder, as the two continued to watch Dan beat himself off. \"Senator, I think we have a problem.\"\n\n\"I think DAN has a problem.\"\n\n\"No, look at the other men in the room. They're all jacking off. Frank over there, keeps trying to feel up Dr. Green, too. We didn't turn off the machine, Senator. Somehow, we just reversed the genders that it affects. I will contact Dr. Phibs immediately.\"\n\nThe senator, thinking quickly, snapped to Dr. West. \"Tell him to switch it back. Now!\"\n\n\"Of course, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Can you imagine a world of insatiable men? Eww. No, thank you.\""
