        "Here we go. Thanks for reading so far.\n\n................................................\n\nWe played for a few more months, adding songs as we found them. We did our version of Galway Girl, with me on accordion, and I got to sing it. The crowds started recognizing it, singing 'day-I-ay-I-ay' at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe did a version of 'Some Nights' that Robbie and I arranged. Three microphones, my pipes, a floor tom tom for Molly, and Robbie with his snare drum, giving it an almost martial air, everyone singing, and I faked the auto tuned voice with my pipes.\n\nDave was a big fan of Rapalje, and he had us all listening soon. He suggested we do 'Loch Lomond', and we did, just the guys, no instruments until the last, with Dave singing lead, and at the end Molly and I did a five minute mournful Fiddle/Pipe exchange, that usually left the crowds quiet. We also broke down, after a lot of begging from our fans, and did a version of 'Danny Boy' that was well received.\n\nI was a Rod Stewart fan, and saw him several times while in service, and one day I was sitting in our living room, doing the slow sweet intro of 'Rhythm Of My Heart' on my accordion. It was one of my favorite songs, and was about a soldier returning home to his family. Amanda sat down and put her head on my shoulder, listening to me play for a moment. I knew she wanted to talk, as I put the accordion down and snuggled.\n\n\"What's up babe?\"\n\nShe looked at me with scared eyes, so I knew it was something serious. \"Honey, can we talk about having a baby? My residency is almost over, and now would be the perfect time.\"\n\nI looked at her intently until she got nervous. \"We don't have to, baby. It was just...\"\n\n\"The best thing you could ever say to me! I wanted to bring it up before, but was waiting until you were established. You would make an excellent mother, and I hope I would be an adequate father.\"\n\nAmanda was crying now, the tears getting bigger. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Seriously. Come with me.\" I led her to the bathroom, pulled her birth control pills out of the medicine cabinet and flushed them down. \"There. Think I'm serious now?\"\n\n\"Yes, and you are so wrong, mister. I see you with kids, and I know you'll be one of the greatest fathers of all time. Now, let's practice for the big event.\"\n\nShe was almost late for work. Doctor Krall could be a real asshole, and she got together with the women under him and compared notes. If you were lily white, or a little flirty, you were treated better. Make waves and your life was hard for a long time. I would be very, very glad when she no longer had to tolerate him.\n\nShe didn't say much, but I knew she was nervous about employment opportunities, very few freshly minted doctors stay local, their grades and reviews have a great deal to do with the offers they got. Amanda had excellent credentials, despite a few negative reviews fro Dr. Krall, so she would get the best interviews.\n\nShe had studied to be a pediatrician, as she loved to work with children, but there weren't a lot of local opportunities. I knew it was laying heavily on her mind, so I took her for a drive, parking in an empty driveway. You could just barely make out the ruins of a foundation. it was what we in the South called a 'homeplace', the foundations were from my old house. The land had been in our family for a hundred and fifty years. I knew I would never build on it, most of the land around it was zoned industrial now, and I'd had many offers as the economy had improved. It was time to let go, found our own homeplace.\n\n\"What is this place?\"\n\n\"This place is your freedom, baby. Originally twenty three acres, I added another seventeen when the economy crashed. The house burned down while I was in Scotland. I put the insurance money into a trust the Colonel set up for me, where no one can touch it. Kim had a cow when it came out in disclosure of assets. She couldn't touch it anyway, and I just didn't want to hear her nag me to sell it, so I never told her I owned it. I'm giving it to you baby, to do what's best.\"\n\n\"Thank you honey, but what am I going to do with forty acres?\"\n\n\"You're going to sell it. The property has gotten really hot lately. Look around, count the new businesses and construction you can see from here. One developer is sniffing around, hinting at eminent domains proceedings. This way, if he wants it, he'll have to put in a bid like everyone else. The lawyers say it'll go for between two hundred fifty to four hundred thousand, depending on how bad someone wants it. That ought to be just enough to open your own office or buy a partnership. Your choice. The auction is in three weeks, so we should know how much you have to work with then.\"\n\nI'm glad I was standing close, because her eyes rolled back and she would have fallen if I hadn't caught her. I kissed and nuzzled her hair while she woke. Her hair was now in a riot of short curls, that I really liked. Amanda said she wanted it just a little longer, but not as much as before. I liked it any way she wore it, but I really was not a fan of bald. She promised me she would never do it again.\n\nShe came to with a start and a scream, before jumping up and down, kissing any part of me she came into contact with. She calmed down but the tears kept coming.\n\n\"Thank you, honey. You don't know how worried I was.\"\n\n\"Oh, I had a pretty good idea. you don't live and love someone as long as I've loved you not to notice things.\"\n\nShe held my hand on the way home, relaxed, before she suddenly sat up. \"We can't spend that money on me! That would buy a really nice house.\"\n\nI surprised her even further. \"No worries, love. Fifty percent of everything I made while I worked for the Colonel, plus that pension and insurance money I told you about, has been in an account in the Sechelle Islands, guided by the Colonel. He assures me we can buy any house we desire, within reason. So concentrate on your career, and when you're not, start house shopping.\"\n\nI thought for a minute she was going to faint, but instead she just smiled. \"What would you do if I told you I wanted to live on the Moon?\"\n\n\"I'd start shopping rockets. You need to understand that you are the most precious thing I've ever held, and I would do absolutely anything to make you happy. Any children, and I hope there is at least two, will be extensions of that love. Do you understand?\"\n\nShe sighed, leaning back again. \"I'm starting to,\" she said in a dreamy voice.\n\nAfter that, Rhythm Of My Heart was our song,and we sang it to each other as a lullaby, practicing it for our children.\n\n.....................\n\nOf course, we added it to our shows, using it as a closer, making it longer and softer, and we ended up singing the last verse over again, standing with arms locked in front of the microphones, without our instruments.\n\nI think back now, and those was probably my favorite times in our whole history as a band. When we wanted to add a song, we would get the words and sing them together, working on vocal arrangements before we even brought the instruments into play. We usually sat on stools, shoulder to shoulder, over one mike. I felt it kept us close.\n\n.....................................\n\nWhile Manda dealt with her career and started house and practice shopping, we were working more and enjoying it less. I was starting to think the group may have an expiration date.\n\nManda and I had a favorite restaurant, the Mexican one we went to on one of our first dates. I knew the mariachi band, and one day I noticed Juan was missing, and asked about him.\n\n\"Juan is pretty sick, he has cancer. They caught it, but his hospital bills are enormous. He had to quit the band, and work extra shifts at his regular job. It's really hard on him, and Maria is scared to death he's going to collapse.\"\n\nI thought about it, and talked to the band. We called in a few favors, rented the local high school football field, lined up the security and first aid the permits required, and we held a benefit.\n\nTwelve bucks bought you six bands and ten hours of entertainment. The local Hispanic churches set up food booths, all trying to outdo the other with spicy and tasty offerings, all profits going to help Juan. We were the headliners, so we went on last. There had a rock group, a country group, a solo blues man a lot of us sat in with, a young Mexican group that tore the crowd up, a beach band, and us. Juan's band sat in and played a few numbers as each group tore down and set up.\n\nWe'd gotten together and practiced a few times for the big finish, and after our set, I spent a couple of minutes talking to the crowd.\n\n\"On behalf of Juan and his family, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. His family have been part of this community for the last thirty five years, and Juan and I played high school football together, so our friendship goes back a long way.\"\n\n\"This money will help him pay his bills, assure the quality of life his family deserves. He was supposed to say a few words, but I'm afraid emotions have gotten the better of him. Instead, he's agreed to play with us, as a thank you. Let's welcome him to the stage!\"\n\nThe crowd roared as he stepped up, holding his trumpet. Despite his recovery, he was still thin and pale. He waved, and then stepped back.\n\n\"Well folks, that's the show....almost. His band, my band, Summer Sounds, and a few more of the people that have played here tonight, we all got together and decided to go out in style, so the next few numbers are our way of saying thank you for your support. Here we go, boys.\"\n\nHis band had on their mariachi outfits, complete with big sombreros, the beach band all had on shorts and big, flowery shirts, there were two from the country band in western shirts and cowboy hats, and we were all wearing our kilts. It was quite a sight. \n\nWe started out with a song featuring Molly on vocals, a song that I had always loved, 'In These Shoes', by the late Christy McColl. The crowd loved it, and Juan really stepped out on a trumpet solo, while the horn section of the beach band filled in behind him. I wasn't playing anything, but helped with the chorus, and when it was over and the applause stopped, the group fired up with 'You Can Call Me Al', the Paul Simon hit. Robbie sang lead. Amanda had gotten a rare day off, and she was onstage with us in her kilt, and as the band played, Molly, Amy, Amanda and I were in a row, doing an African dance to the beat, only stopping when I played the tin whistle, then starting right back. When we weren't dancing, I was banging on the congas, and Manda was playing the rototoms, complete with small cymbals.\n\nIt had gotten dark by then, and we danced around as Dave did the bass break so integral to the song. The crowd was roaring when we finally stopped playing ten minutes later. Everyone stopped, and the stage lights went off.\n\nThe crowd thought the show was over until a spot light hit me and I started singing.\n\n\"Wanna jitterbug, wanna jitterbug,\" The band broke into 'Wake Me Up Before You Go Go', by Wham.\n\nThe girls were lined up behind me, swaying and moving their hands in time just like the video, and we just cut loose and jammed out for about eight minutes. A kid from the Mexican band did an organ solo that had the place rocking, Amy and Molly were on one side of the stage at one point, Amanda and I on the other, and we had practiced doing cartwheels across the stage before the crowd arrived. I had on my black Speedo, and the girls were supposed to have on full cut black panties, but when the crowd started roaring I knew something was up. They'd all worn thongs instead. We ended up together, the girls giggling like mad. This would be a benefit the people would remember for a long time. The applause and cheering went on for five minutes.\n\nNone of us knew it, but one of the local television stations had sent a crew to do a puff piece on the benefit, it being Saturday and a slow news day. They did a nice piece, featuring the last song. They had to blur our the segment with the girls doing cartwheels, but it was so hot they played the segment again in the morning.\n\nFour or five people posted us on YouTube, and we got almost a million hits in a month. One network morning show, cashing in on the popularity, invited us to appear. It took a little coordinating, but we all showed up. The hostess, making chit chat, asked what we were called. We were in our kilts, the mariachi band in full regalia. The horn players for the beach band were in their standard bright flowery shirts, and we were all wearing sombreros. I just blurted out the first thing that came to mind.\n\n\"Jalepeno Haggis!\"\n\nIt stuck, and the agent Molly and Rob had met set us up with a one time deal, and we recorded four songs, the ones we did at the concert, plus a pretty good original written by Rob and Molly, and sold it on Itunes. None of us took any money, giving all the proceeds to Juan.\n\n..................................\n\nTony, Dave, and I were starting to tire of the band. We had started it as a lark, and it had taken a life of it's own. Amy's Agent, as I dubbed him in my head, was pushing us to sign with him and go full time as musicians, playing four or five nights a week all over the country, even abroad, where our style of music was better appreciated.\n\nTony killed that idea pretty quickly. \"I'm getting my daughter back, the ex is remarrying and her new flame and Amber don't get along that well. There isn't a snowball's chance in hell I would quit my steady job and go on the road. That would kill any chance I had of gaining full custody. You guys can go, but it'll be without me. \" Tony paused for a minute before grinning. \"Besides, me and Bernie have been talking. Her daughter and mine are best friends, so we've gotten thrown together a lot. Things happened. Very, very, very good things. It looks like I may be getting two daughters instead of one, and a pretty hot mother to go with them.\" He'd told us right after we started playing he was putting every dime he made off the band into a savings account, waiting for the day he would need it for just such an event.\n\nDave and I were happy for him. He spent a lot of lonely years after he and his wife split over her affair, and it took him a long time to start trusting women again. Bernice, besides being an all round nice person, was pretty hot. When she came to shows or just to hang out in the barn, electricity just seemed to flow between them. Even their daughters could see it, and they spent a lot of time giggling and started introducing each other as \"my sister.\"\n\nDave felt the same way. \"I'm getting really tired hustling the kids off to a relative or a sitter. Janine is starting to act out a little, and the school counselor says it's because we've screwed up her routine. I haven't talked to Amy yet, but it's coming. I hope she takes it well. Congratulations, Tony, there's nothing quite like the love of a good woman.\"\n\nBoy, did that statement come back to haunt him in the weeks that followed.\n\nTony and I had no doubts that Amy would like to keep playing; she was getting hooked on the attention. I saw several serious discussions in their future.\n\n\"Well, I'm like you guys, I'm just about done. Manda will be a full fledged doctor soon, and she is already shopping partnerships, or maybe opening her own office, hiring a couple of older doctors interested in part time work. We did really well at the land auction, three developers got into a bidding war and we were the ones who won, because we got almost two hundred thousand more than we hoped for. I'm in line for a promotion at work, that comes with a lot more responsibility. I told her I would be done with the band in a few months, and she agrees it's time to put that phase of our lives to an end.\"\n\nWe sat, remembering, and agreed it had been a hell of a ride, one worth taking. We decided to tell the others after our next few bookings, to give them time to think about it.\n\nWe didn't get to do it the way we planned, because Robbie rode home with me two weeks later, hemming and hawing around until I told him to spit whatever was sticking in his craw out.\n\n\"Dwayne(the Agent) wants to put us on contract, even has a record deal lined up.\"\n\n\"That's great, Robbie, but what's the catch? There must be something about it that makes you uncomfortable.\"\n\nHe blurted it out as quickly as he could. \"He doesn't want the whole band. He wants just me, Molly, and Amy, saying we would be more hip and relevant with younger sidemen.\"\n\nCuriosity got the better of me. \"What do you and Molly think about that?\"\n\n\"We think it sucks! We wouldn't be where we are now if not for you and Tony. It seems disloyal to even think about it.\"\n\nHe was surprised to see my grin. \"I think you should go for it. Tony, Dave, and I have already had this discussion, and we're all ready to hang it up. Now, pay attention here. I don't trust Dwayne, not as far as I could throw the Sears Tower. Get a good lawyer, maybe use the firm I did to get my divorce. They have one whole group dedicated to intellectual property law, and it would be worth the money to get their advice and listen to it. I can call Maggie and set it up for you, if you like. And this is important, Robbie, I know you guys want to make music your life, so be careful, or you'll end up without control, working for peanuts. Don't sign a thing without letting the lawyers look at it first.\"\n\nHe sighed, glad I wasn't angry, then frowned. \"Dwayne has a contract ready, and he's pushing us, saying he can't help us until we sign.\"\n\n\"That ought to tell you something. Don't do it Robbie, protect yourself and Molly first.\"\n\nHe agreed to talk it over with Molly, and not sign anything until the lawyers looked at it closely. Then something he'd said before hit me. \"Where does Amy stand in all this?\"\n\nIf he looked nervous before, he looked downright stricken now. \"Promise me, I mean really promise me, that what I'm about to say remains between just us for now. Amy has the bug, bad. She wants to go on the road, see the country, and the world for that matter. Molly seems to think there might be something going on between Amy and Dwayne, and that's coloring her decision.\" \n\nWell, damn, that was not news I wanted to hear. My opinion of cheaters was pretty well documented, and I started wondering. Thinking about it I realized Amy had been keeping a distance between us. She and Dave had two kids, a boy ten and a daughter seven. It would devastate Dave if there was something to Robbie's suspicion.\n\n\"Be really careful Rob, and make sure Molly does the same. If Amy is fooling around and it gets back to Dave, it will be very bad. But I'll tell you this. I'll be talking to Amy, soon. If she is even thinking about fooling around with that sleazeball, she needs to tell Tony up front how she feels and walk away. It'll hurt him, hurt him bad, but he may be able to not hate her quite so much than if he finds her screwing around.\"\n\nI thought about it for three days. I'd tried to get Amy alone after a few shows, but she was gone like a shot. I got the feeling she was avoiding me.\n\n..........................\n\nDwayne, still trying to curry favor, got us a job we couldn't pass up, playing at the opening ball of the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games, one of the oldest and most prestigious games in the South.\n\nThe ball was by invitation only, a kind of who's who mixer of the elite. I found the woman running it to be annoyingly condescending, and knowing I would probably never play there again, I let her have it.\n\n\"Look lady, we've been doing this for a long time, so we know what we're doing. So why don't you bugger off and let us set up in peace. If you don't like the show we do, you don't have to pay us. Fair enough?\"\n\nIt was very obvious that she wasn't used to people telling her what they thought, and she huffed and blustered when she could get her voice back.",
        "\"I've never met someone so rude in my life!\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Not my problem. Maybe you should spend more time with musicians who don't give a shit. Then you'd really get an education in rude behavior. Now shoo, I have to set this equipment up pretty fast, so I can get on with being rude to people who deserve it. Have a super sparkly ball now. If you're lucky, maybe you can find a rude waiter or bartender. One can only hope.\"\n\nShe stormed off. I looked at Tony and Dave, who were trying not to laugh and failing, to Amy, who looked appalled, to Molly, who was just grinning as she spun her bow around in circles. We could hear someone screaming in laughter for a minute, then Robbie came strolling back, wiping tears from his eyes and trying not to grin.\n\nThe ball was really something. We were playing first, then a full orchestra was going to take over, to do waltzes and that sort of thing. I looked at the head table, to see the woman I'd had words with sitting beside the Colonel, filling his ear full. Seems they always tried to get some royal Scot or another to come over as guest of honor, and it was his turn. He looked at me while the woman was talking, a small smile on his face as he listened to her. \n\nHe told me about the conversation the next day, as I stood beside him, watching as the Parade Of Tartans wound round the field.\n\n\"You surely put a burr under her bonnet! I nearly choked to death twice, trying to hold back my laughter. It got even better as we talked to the main supporter of the games, and she thanked me for coming.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"I'm deeply honored to attend this event. I was even more keen when I found out an old friend was going to be playing in the band. He's a credit to Scotland and America.\" \n\n\"Really? How does an Earl cross paths with an American bagpiper?\"\n\n\"Well, we crossed paths, as you put it, for the first time in Iraq, where he saved my life and the lives of my men. I met him again in London, where he again saved my life from terrorists, with the help from one of our men from Iraq. After that, I considered him my lucky charm, and got him assigned to me as a bodyguard and piper.\"\n\n\"Was he? A lucky charm?\"\n\n\"I couldn't keep the smile off me face, laddie, when I told her about how you and some old mates saved me once again, and how you personally saved me, my wife, and my sister and her child.\"\n\n\"You might remember him from those times. He was dubbed 'the Mad Yank' by the press. There was a big spread on him in the Times, detailing his life since he came into my service, even had pictures of the Queen presenting him with his medals, and one of him being knighted, and a week later pictures of the royalty of Denmark doing it all over, presenting medals and Knighting him again. My sister is a Duchess in Denmark, and there was even a picture of him flying through the air, as he was getting hit with bomb shrapnel, protecting my niece with his body. Quite the interesting man, our Ewan McLough.\n\nAnd be prepared, laddie, they're thinking about having you as guest of honor next year, a hometown hero with Scottish connections, and a genuine Knight to boot. I wager the woman who railed at you yesterday will be positively affectionate today.\"\n\nWe enjoyed the day immensely. Robbie competed in the pitchfork competition, throwing bags over a bar. He came nowhere close to winning, but had a good time. I did a little sword dancing, and played the pipes in the competition, not as a contestant, but as a guest, after they found out who I was. Dave surprised us all by coming in second in the hammer throw, his huge biceps bulging as the hammer flew. Dave was a stocky guy with a bit of a belly, but under that was nothing but rock hard muscles. I had the thought it would be very bad to have him angry at you, which led me back to Amy. I really needed to talk to her. All of us wore kilts in the colors of my clan, and they marched with me as I carried our flag in the closing March of the C lans, as an honorarium.\n\nThe group sponsoring the event did indeed warm to me, and I was polite, telling them I would think about it, and if there were no scheduling conflicts I would be honored.\n\nAfter the games, we met in the barn for a practice, and announced the end of the band, as far as we were concerned. Of course, everyone knew but Amy, and she seemed dismayed and relieved at the same time. Dave made the comment that while he was sad, he was happy to be able to concentrate on his family. I noticed Amy look a little uncomfortable when he said it.\n\nWe had eight more dates we were committed to, and stopped taking bookings. We had a farewell party at O'Douls, and it was so packed he had to turn people away. To honor our fans, we did another show on Sunday afternoon, for the ones that didn't get in Saturday. They still had to turn people away. I think we were all surprised at the tears, and the number of kilts worn in our honor. Seems in some small way, we had touched the lives of many. It was our last appearance, and there were tears in our eyes, as well. \n\nOur last appearance in the country, that is. Dwayne, with help from the Colonel, got us booked into three festivals, one in Ireland, and two in Scotland. We thought it would be a great way to go out, and agreed. We would be gone for two weeks.\n\nWe also decided to make a family holiday of it. Mike was taking Bernie, his daughter, and hers, and Dave was taking his two children, over Amy's objections.\n\n\"We're only playing three times in two weeks, leaving us lots of time for family events and outings. It would be the vacation of a lifetime. They're old enough now to have these memories for the rest of their lives. We're even going to stay in a real castle for three days, courtesy of the Earl. What possible reason could we have to not take them?\"\n\nAmy folded, and I decided that I was going to have that talk with her very soon.\n\n......................................\n\nWe knew far enough in advance to make vacation arrangements. I had enough vacation time built up not to worry, and when my boss knew why I was taking it, and that I would be concentrating on my real job when I got back, he smiled.\n\n\"Good. You know the assistant production manager's job is going to be available soon, and one of the reasons you weren't at the top of the list was because of your outside interests. Now that that's no longer the case, you're a serious candidate. Go, and when you get back, we'll talk.\"\n\nDave and Tony both had enough seniority on their jobs to get the time off, so we were all set, even Amanda had gotten a week off, over Dr. Krall's objections. She was going to join us the second week, and be there for our last performance. I could see the Colonel's hands on that decision.\n\nWe were a travelling village, kids, all of our instruments, personal luggage. People definitely took notice. They almost had to pry Amanda and I apart. It was the first time since we had gotten together that we would be separated, and neither of us liked it one little bit.\n\nWe played in Ireland first. The band as a group talked it over, and we decided to really put Molly and Rob out front, to help them when they were on their own. I still sang two, but the rest were all theirs, including four originals that were pretty good. Tony and I had been helping them arrange them, and it was still works in progress, but they were getting there. With those four, a few reels and jigs, and a cover or two thrown in, they would have a pretty good first CD.\n\nIt was a crowd of about fifty thousand, and we were the second act. I'm proud to say we were well received. It was a rush for all of us, we had never played to that big a crowd before. I was pleased to see the attention paid to Molly and Robbie. They both got invited to sit in with a few of the larger acts, good exposure in this market.\n\nWe took tours after the concert, saw the Book of Kells, kissed the Blarney Stone, did as much touristy stuff as possible.\n\nWhen we got to Scotland, the kids were really excited about staying in an actual castle, and they loved their rooms. Millicent was really taken with the children, arranging a horseback outing, taking them to local attractions, and generally doting on them. In no time at all, they were trying to spend all their time with 'Aunt Millie\"\n\nThe Colonel and his wife never had children, for reasons unknown to me. His wife really loved them, and she told me point blank to get on with having ours. \"They will be the closest thing I'll ever have to grandchildren. Just so you know, when they get old enough, they'll be summering with us as often as possible. Amanda is already on board with it, although she intends to take them to Kenya as many times as she can.\"\n\nIt moved me quite a bit, and on impulse, I hugged her. She was stiff at first, except for a kiss on the cheek, we had never touched. She finally relaxed, and gave me a firm cuddle, patting my cheek when we released.\n\nWithout meaning to, I reduced her to tears. \"You know, our first son is really going to hate me for naming him Archibald, but I'm sure the first daughter will be all right with Millicent.\"\n\nThey were their given names. I guess the thought of her living on through them was a bit much for her. She fled the room, and the Colonel grinned. \"Ye've done it now, laddie. She may never let them go when they do come to visit.\"\n\nMy life just couldn't get any better.\n\n.........................................\n\nI was really looking forward to Amanda arriving. We hadn't conceived yet, not for lack of trying, and I harbored a secret hope that we could while we were here, making our first a true child of Scotland. She was concerned, but her gynecologist, a personal friend, told us not to worry. \"Keep trying. It sometimes takes a while with the first one. Then BAM! You're having a baby. Relax. Enjoy this time, you're priorities will be completely different once it arrives. Not to worry, it will be a good difference.\"\n\nWhen she called to tell me she couldn't come, I was devastated. \"I can't come, honey,\" she said when she was coherent enough to talk, \"David had a family emergency, and there's no one left to cover. I'm so, so, sorry.\"\n\n\"So am I love, but soon, very soon, you'll be your own boss, and we'll never have to worry about things like this again. I love you.\"\n\nShe cried for a little longer before ringing off. The band could tell I was depressed, so they tried to cheer me up. My mood did improve when Charlie showed up out of the blue. He had put twenty four years in, and was now retired and working for the Colonel.\n\nI was even more surprised when a few more of our old troop came by, including the leftenant I had dragged across the sand all those years ago. The doctors managed to save his arm, but he would have limited use of it for the rest of his life.\n\nI gave him my condolences right after he learned he would be partially paralyzed, and he grinned.\n\n\"No worries there. Alive with one and a half arms is a lot better than dead with two good ones.\"\n\nIt seems that after they retired, they joined a regimental band, made up of veterans and retirees, who played in parades and special events. They were even playing the festival, thirty six pipers and fourteen drummers. The Leftenant was the Drum Major, saying it was one thing he could do with his handicap.\n\nI decided, since the event was being taped for television, that I would do a tribute of some kind to Amanda, hoping the tape would make her feel better. The band was all for it, and plans were made.\n\n...............................................\n\nI stepped out of the elevator, ready to work a night shift, smiling as I walked through the hospital, greeting almost everyone I passed. Many praised my compassion, especially towards children. My smile deepened as I saw the children, knowing that in seven and a half months I would experience motherhood for the very first time.\n\nI went to see my friend this morning, wanting verification of what I suspected, and learned I was definitely pregnant, six weeks along. I hugged her and we both cried. When I calmed down she asked her if I was going to call Ewan with the news.\n\n\"No, I want to be able to touch him, see his face when he learns our dream is coming true. I'm sure it will be worth the wait.\"\n\nMy smile faded as I saw David standing at the nurse's station.\n\n\"David! What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town on a family emergency. How is your father, by the way?\"\n\nHe looked at me oddly. \"Dad's been gone for about four years now. I'm here to take Sally to lunch, since I suddenly had a week off. What was so important that you had to work this week? I thought you were going on vacation with your husband. I was really surprised when Dr. Krall gave me the week off, saying you had postponed your plans.\"\n\nI paled and swayed, and he rushed to my side, concerned I might faint. He told me later there was a strange and disquieting look in my eyes that scared him.\n\n\"So then, Dr. Krall made these changes?\"\n\n\"Amanda, please, we're almost done here. Let it go. Soon he will be just a bad memory.\"\n\nI smiled, and it scared him even more when I answered in Masai. \"What did you say?\" \n\n\"I said you were right, he will soon be just a bad memory. Excuse me now, I have to check in.\"\n\nDavid, Sally, and the other nurses at the station watched her go. \"What do you think she's going to do?\"\n\nDavid looked at the nurse. \"Nothing. I hope.\"\n\nI paused just outside the office door, centering herself, seeing if the record function on my tablet was working, making sure the lens wasn't covered by my lab jacket.\n\nThen I threw the door open, unleashing the demon inside me.\n\n\"You bastard! You arrogant little pissant of a man! There was no emergency, was there? David is downstairs, taking his girlfriend to lunch. He said you told him I insisted on working this week. What makes you think you can fuck with people's lives like that?\"\n\nHis smile disappeared. The door was open and he knew anyone passing could hear them, so he went over and closed it, leaning against it, blocking me in.\n\n\"I did it, you little kaffer bitch, because I could. You think that musclebound husband of yours protects you. He has no power! I have it! I can make it next to impossible to get a good job, so you need to think very seriously about your next words.\"\n\nI sighed, slumping down. \"All right, what do you want? What do I have to do to get to be with my husband?\"\n\n\"You can start by showing me a little gratitude. Why don't you take off your top, let me see if they look as good without a bra as they do with one.\"\n\n\"That's it? A boob shot, then I'm free to go?\"\n\n\"Not by a long shot, bitch. Darkies like you need to be shown how to respect their betters. I think a blow job will go a long way towards softening my attitude. Now why don't you get to your knees and crawl over here?'\n\n\"So then, a blow job and it's over, right?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Fuck no. After you blow me, we're going to spend a quiet evening together. Who knows, after I fuck you, you may not be in such a hurry to get to hubby. Now crawl!\"\n\nI dropped and crawled, watching as he fumbled his pants down. I reached out, still on my knees and when I got close enough I balled into a fist and punched him as hard as I could right into his balls. He let a little high pitched scream escape his lips as he fell over. On my feet by then, I kicked him several times, once in the crotch and twice in the mouth. I felt the teeth crumble on the second kick.\n\n\"You arrogant little shit! You can kiss your medical career goodbye, once the video I made gets out in public. Unless of course, they let you practice in prison.\"\n\nI kicked him one more time in the crotch, and ran crying from the room.\n\n....................................\n\nThe hospital administrator was having a bad day. Revenue was down, donations were down, patient dissatisfaction was on the rise. If he didn't turn it around soon, he would probably be let go.\n\nWhen his computer pinged, he was about to ignore it until he saw the heading 'Lawsuit\". He opened the mail, and got a streaming account of what had transpired in Dr. Krall's office, his heart sinking at every word. There was a short message at the end.\n\n\"I'm taking two weeks off, on the advice of my doctor, to recover from emotional duress and avoid a hostile work environment. You have until I come back to clean up this mess. And I'm charging the doctor with attempted sexual assault and attempted blackmail. Make sure he does not leave and run back to his home country, or I'll be forced to go after the hospital instead. Do not try to contact me before then, I'll be out of the country and unavailable.\n\nAmanda Abasi McLough.\"\n\nThe Administrator watched the tape twice more before calling an emergency board meeting, and the police.\n\n.........................\n\nDr. Krall lay on the floor of his office, moaning in pain, feeling the broken teeth with his tongue, before white hot rage consumed him. Damn that bitch straight to hell! If she would have just followed the program, he would have been over his infatuation by now and would have moved on to someone else. And that redneck husband of hers could kiss his ass. He had never forgiven him for slamming his face into the bar. She was never getting her certification, he would see to that.\n\nSomething was nagging him, just past the edge of his consciousness, when it hit him. She had recorded the whole thing! He could NOT let that get out, it could open a whole can of worms. He had stopped fucking the Indian intern just two moths ago, and she wasn't exactly willing. If she decided to come forth, or any of the others he had assaulted over the years, he would be in very bad trouble.\n\nHe knew he needed to leave. Not just the hospital, but the country. If he could get home his friends, and the friends of his father, would protect him.\n\nHe managed to get to his feet, and staggered out of his office and down the hall, to the elevators by the nurse's station. The nurses looked on in horror at the blood on his face and coat, asking if he needed assistance. He just grunted and closed the elevator.\n\nDr. Krall made it home, where he changed clothes and gave himself a high powered pain reliever. He managed to get into his dentist's office, told the man he had been mugged and needed emergency work done. The fact that the person who mugged him was a young woman he was trying to coerce into performing sexual acts for him never came up in conversation. He was in the chair for three hours while they repaired what they could, and pulled two that were beyond salvation.\n\nGoing back to his apartment for the last time, he grabbed everything he thought valuable and packed two cases. Not wanting to make reservations, he showed up at the airport, and tried to book a trip home, one way. He had to wait a ridiculously long time as they charted his flight, one that him changing planes twice. Krall breathed a sigh of relief as he got the confirmations and turned to go to the correct terminal.\n\nThere were two men standing behind him, their dress and manner screaming 'police' in any language. \"Dr. Krall? I'm Detective James Madison of the Raleigh Police, and this is Sam Tennyson, of the State Bureau of Investigation. We'd like a few minutes of your time, down at the station.\"\n\nKrall looked at his watch and spoke, his voice garbled from the pain killers and dental work. \"I'm sorry, gentlemen, they've just called my plane. We'll have to do this another time, as soon as I return.\"\n\nAgent Tennyson grasped his wrist firmly. \"I'm afraid this can't wait, Doctor. You'll have to reschedule your flight for later. Now, please come with us. If you show the least resistance, we'll walk you through the airport in cuffs. Your choice.\"\n\nThe doctor sighed, and walked between the policemen for a bit before he suddenly bolted. Never in the best of shape, the pain medications made him even more sluggish, and the police detective slammed into him from behind before he had taken twenty steps. He was put in cuffs then, and led none too gently out of the airport.",
        ".........................................\n\nI got to have my discussion with Amy by accident, walking in on her and Dwayne while they were in a fierce lip lock, her hands groping his crotch while he had one hand locked on a boob and the other was gripping her ass. I didn't say a word, I just reacted.\n\nAmy must have been airborne for twenty feet before she hit the floor and skittered into a wall. Dwayne had turned around when I yanked them apart. If he was pissed because of that he must really hated what came next, because I was right in the middle of an old fashioned Southern ass-whuppin' when Amy jumped on my back screaming.\n\n\"Stop! Please Stop! You're killing him.\"\n\nI dropped him like the piece of shit he was, pulled Amy around until we were face to face. \"Are you worried for me? Or him? Doesn't matter, I'm done anyway. I'd hate to hurt my hands to the point I can't play. Toss the trash out. You and I are going to talk, and don't even think about refusing, or I'll have a serious talk with Dave.\"\n\nShe helped him up and out the door. I watched as he limped down the hall, blood dripping all over the carpet. Amy shut the door and got just as far away from me as she could and still be in the same room.\n\n\"Ewan, I...\" was all she got out before I stopped her.\n\n\"Have you fucked him yet?\"\n\n\"Ewan, please, I...\"\n\n\"Have you fucked him yet?\"\n\nAmy put her head down and snuffled. I got a handful of hair and pulled her up until we were face to face.\n\n\"HAVE YOU FUCKED HIM YET?!\"\n\n\"YES!,\" Amy almost wailed. \"I didn't plan it, it just happened. And we have feelings for each other, so please don't try to lessen it with your judgements.\"\n\nShe got her confidence back, and stood defiantly, waiting for the tirade. I sighed with true regret.\n\n\"This will kill Dave. Do you have any idea how much he loves you? How glad he is that the band is finally over, and he can spend his time concentrating on you and the kids? You're throwing a really good life away, Amy. You know if you do this, you lose your children, right? No judge in their right mind is going to award custody to a travelling musician, especially one that isn't going to make all that much money. I bet you'll even have to pay child support. Did you even think once of your children? Even if they don't end up actively hating you, how much of a relationship are you going to have, calling them from odd places at odd times? You'll miss all the games, the dance recitals, the plays, the first crushes, the very first kiss, while off chasing your dreams.\n\nAnd Dwayne? You need to be really careful here. If he's willing to go after one married woman, what makes you think somewhere down the line he won't go after another? Then you'll have thrown everything away for nothing.\n\nAnd as for Scumbucket, what makes you think he'll ever trust you? You willingly betrayed your husband and kids for him, what he's gonna do when some producer or someone higher up the food chain takes a shine to you? Think he won't worry about that? Even if you guys end up together, you're doomed form the start.\"\n\nShe had gradually shrank into the sofa, my words hitting her as hard as any physical blow I could have given her. I stood to leave.\n\n\"Do me a favor, Amy. Don't tell Dave until after the show. Let him have that one good memory of the last time he ever plays with his wife onstage. Right afterwards though, and I mean within a day, you need to tell him your plans. If you don't, I will.\"\n\nI walked to the door, looking back one last time. \"Oh, and Amy? You're no longer my friend. Or Amanda's. If you need to speak to me before the end of the week on business, talk. Otherwise, you and I are done. I'll never be able to look at you again without disgust. Goodbye, Amy.\"\n\nThe enormity of her situation was finally sinking in, and she was crying in earnest, trying to talk as I closed the door.\n\n.....................................\n\nI ran from the hospital, hailing a cab and rushing to the airport. While I rode I sent the video to the hospital Administrator, and the Raleigh Police Department. Later on, I found the Administrator, in a classic example of ass covering, also called the police, all the while decrying what a horrible person the doctor turned out to be.\n\nThe Police arrived, looking for both me and Dr. Krall. Finding neither, they decided to watch the airport, sending a picture of the doctor to airport Security. A camera with facial recognition hardware flagged the doctor immediately, and the police were there very quickly. They were surprised the doctor resisted, having to cuff him and take him through the terminal to a waiting car\n\nI heard the noise, and thought they must have picked up a drunk or thief, not even glancing up. I had rushed to the airport first thing, still in my lab coat and scrubs, my only thought was of getting to Ewan.\n\nI had forgotten I needed My passport, and was near hysteria when I remembered the Colonel telling her if I ever needed anything, to call him, no matter the time of day. I fumbled the card out of my purse and dialed. \n\nIt must have rung two dozen times before anyone answered, the Colonel demanding to know if I knew what bloody time it was. I couldn't help it and started crying again, and between wails and hiccups managed to tell him who I was and what had happened.\n\n\"I need my husband, Colonel. Can you help me?\"\n\n\"Stay right where ye are, lassie. Someone will come to collect you shortly. Tell him to call me when he gets there.\"\n\nAn hour and fifteen minutes a man in a wrinkled suit was standing before me, saying the Colonel sent him. He called the Colonel, and even though he couldn't see it, was constantly shaking his head yes, saying 'yes sir' quite a bit.\n\nHe hung up and grinned at her. \"Lassie, are you ever going to have a tale to tell to your grandchildren. Come on, let's have a coffee while we wait for our transportation.\"\n\nHe got most of the story out of me while they waited, his frown deepening. Before he could say much a shadow fell over the table, and he looked up to see a SAS leftenant and an American pilot.\n\nThe SAS officer stood stiffly while the pilot grinned. \"Get the stick out of your ass, Nigel. We're on a mission here.\"\n\nHe looked at me. \"Don't worry about him, ma'am, someone very high up just messed up his American vacation. Come on, your taxi is right outside.\"\n\nThe taxi turned out to be a military helicopter, sent to fly them to Fort Bragg, where twenty more SAS soldiers were waiting by a plane, their joint training interrupted. Amanda went from helicopter to plane in six minutes, was airborne and winging towards Britain ten minutes later. She tried to relax on the uncomfortable seat, dozing as the men talked in quiet tones. She woke with a start, listening to the soldiers in front of her.\n\n\"Who is she? Whoever she is, she knows people with clout. Word has it she's the daughter of a Colonel and Earl, trying to get home for a family emergency. The Captain says the royal family is involved, and said to spare no expense to get her home.\"\n\nWhat the Earl had told them was to treat me like I was his daughter, and of course by the time it got to the rank and file I was his daughter, at least in their eyes. And he had called his cousins, who graciously offered their help.\n\nThey saw she was awake and fed her hot tea from a thermos. \"I'm afraid that's it for amenities here on Air Britain, ma'am. Is there anything else you need?\"\n\n\"Yes. I need to know how long it's going to take to get to Ferth, Scotland. My husband is playing a festival there, and he goes on at three. I need to be there.\"\n\nThe soldier frowned. \"That's cutting it a bit close, ma'am. We didn't leave until about two in the morning your time, and it will take at least six hours before we land at the airfield. It's a military airfield I'm afraid, so there won't be a commuter air service available, You'll have to motor about ninety minutes before you get to a city large enough, and then you'll have to book and wait. Then, after you get to Ferth, you'll have to hire a car. I don't see you making it on time, but you can get together later.\"\n\nTears streamed down my face. \"No! I have to be there! It's the very last performance his band is giving. Plus, I just got wonderful news I need to share with my husband. We're going to have a baby! Our very first. I hope it's a boy. If it is, whether he likes it or not, he's going to be named for his father. Ewan McLough Junior. Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?\"\"\n\nThe soldier had nearly stopped listening until he heard the name. \"Is your husband a Scot?\"\n\n\"No, he's an American, but he served in your country for almost four years.\"\n\n\"Does your husband have a nickname?\"\n\n\"No, not really. He was written up in the papers for some things he'd done, and they termed him \"The Mad Yank. Does that count?\"\n\nHe almost tripped, he was so excited, standing up abruptly and moving forward, where he engaged an officer in serious conversation. The officer stood, making his way back to me.\n\n\"Ma'am, can you describe your husband, or better yet, have a picture of him?\"\n\nAmanda pulled out her phone, and scrolled through her gallery. The Captain had a huge smile on his face when she was done. He unbuttoned his tunic, showing her a tattoo that matched Ewan's. \"It's a small world, Mrs. McLough. I served with your husband. And he is indeed a Mad Yank, but a solid man, one you could depend on in tough times. Now, tell me your story.\"\n\nI gave him our history together, from the day we met until now. The Captain nodded, asked a question or two, and then left her, going forward to get on a radio.\n\nI dozed again, emotionally wrung out, only waking when the plane touched down, looking out at the verdant green below. The Captain helped me unbuckle, grinning, and led me out to a huge helicopter.\n\n\"Your taxi, Lady McLough. We'll see to it you reach your Yank on time.\" He turned to the men behind him. \n\n\"Load up, lads, we have a package to deliver.\"\n\nThey stowed their gear in minutes. I took advantage of the wait to call Molly. She was overjoyed to hear from me.\n\n\"Amanda! I really wished you'd have gotten to come. Your hubby has been mooning over you pretty bad.\"\n\n\"Well, he may see me sooner than he thinks. I need a favor.\"\n\nI had to hold her phone away from her ear as Molly screamed. \"I'm on it! See you soon.\"\n\n...................\n\nI wondered what was going on, Molly and Rob were walking around grinning, Tony and Mike trying to hide smiles. Amy, I found later, hadn't been told.\n\n\"What's up with you guys?\"\n\nMolly grinned and hugged me. \"Nothing. We're in Scotland, preparing to play to sixty seven thousand people, why wouldn't we be smiling?\"\n\nI knew they would tell me when they wanted me to know. I assumed it had something to do with the show.\n\nMolly scheduled one more practice, because one of the Scottish drummers was going to play a few songs with us, to give Robbie a chance to shine. We ran through the songs until we were satisfied.\n\nI tired to call Amanda just before we went on, disappointed when it went to voicemail. I told her how much I loved her and that I couldn't wait to get home, then went out to do our last performance.\n\n...........................\n\nI looked at her phone and smiled. He was going to see me a lot sooner than he thought. The big helicopter stopped, landing on the Castle grounds, and the Colonel, his wife, and a young woman, wearing the bars of a Captain, met them.\n\n\"Right,\" she said, as she led me inside, \"let's see if I've gotten this correct.\"\n\nI had wondered why there had been a discussion on the radio about my clothes sizes, but it was revealed when I entered one of the bedrooms.\n\nThe Captain was tugging on my lab coat. \"Okay, love, you've just enough time for a quick shower, then into your clothes, and we'll deliver you to you husband. Get cracking, now.\"\n\nRushing through my shower, then the Captain helping me with makeup, saying I needed to be perfect when Ewan saw me. I blushed at the racy underwear while the Captain grinned. \"He'll want you out of these clothes as fast as he can, might as well give him a treat.\"\n\nThe clothes were traditional Scottish garments, in the McLough colors. There was even a tam, which was placed over my curls at exactly the right angle, and held in place with bobby pins. The troops whistled as I came back to the helicopter. The Colonel, in his full dress uniform, and his wife in a very nice dress, were already onboard.\n\nWe arrived at the concert, the big black helicopter circling the arena, and I was amazed at the mass of humanity below. I could see the stage, and knew he was on it. Tears threatened my makeup, and the Captain and Millicent fussed over me, trying to keep me calm.\n\n.............................................\n\nWell, here it was. The last time we would ever appear together again. I looked at their faces, trying to memorize them all at this instance. They were all smiling, even Amy, though she lowered her eyes and refused to look at me.\n\nWe heard our names, and took our places. We started out with the song that gave us our name, Robbie beside me as we sang. The crowd seemed to love it, and we went through our set, playing the songs that had the most meaning to us. It seemed like no time at all until we were winding it up.\n\nMolly stepped up, thanking the crowd, and announced for the final song we would have a little help. I knew Charlie and another of the pipers were going to play with us, but was totally surprised when the entire pipe and drum corp came out, taking their places. The band just grinned, pleased at their actions. The only glitch came when a huge helicopter circled the arena, almost drowning us out. Press, I guessed. I knew they were filming the concert for British Television, and figured it would end up on PBS sooner or later.\n\nI had my accordion, starting the opening notes of The Rhythm Of My Heart, and I started talking as I played.\n\n\"Thank you so much for allowing us this time with you. Most don't know it, but this is the very last time we will ever play together as a group. Most of us are older and we're retiring, and the younger ones, as they should, are going to carry on the tradition. Before we do this song, I wanted to say a few things.\n\n\"I've spent a lot of time here, in service. America is the home of my heart, but Scotland will always be the home of my soul. In Iraq I was with some lads of impeccable bravery, loyal to their friends and their cause. I came home with them, those that didn't leave their Highland blood on desert sands. Good men all, may they rest in peace.\"\n\nI don't know where they got it, but the video that journalist had taken so long ago flashed up on the screen, showing me in the tower, playing even as the bullets flew around me. Then the picture changed, showing me at the terrorist attack, flying through the air with the little girl in my arms, and later some of the Queen knighting me and presenting me with my medals.\n\nThe crowd grew really quiet, most were old enough to remember the event.\n\nThe jumbotrons showed a picture of Amanda in her wedding dress. \"This is my wife, Amanda Abasi McLough. Quite a lass, eh?\" The crowd roared out their approval.\n\n\"She's a doctor. What she sees in an old piper is beyond me, but I treasure her. She was supposed to be here with us, but her duties wouldn't permit it. I miss her terribly. We're in the process of trying for a wee one, and I harbored a hope that it would be conceived here, in Scotland.\"\n\nThe crowd applauded and cheered before subsiding again. \n\n\"This song is our personal one, one that we hope to sing to our children as a lullaby. We use in our show, and decided it would be a fit ending to our group. Manda, honey, I love you, and can't wait to have you in my arms.\n\nThank you again, from all of us.\"\n\nWe started into the song, Molly helping me off with the accordion, leaving me to just sing. The entire pipe and drum corp played along with us, a wall of Scottish sound. I had shut my eyes, concentrating on the emotion of my words, when the crowd roared. When they kept roaring I opened them to see what was going on. At first, I though it was an illusion.\n\nManda. It couldn't be! But there she was, being carried across stage on the shoulder of two brawny SAS troopers, an entire squad marching smartly behind, being led by the Colonel in full uniform, Millicent at his side.\n\nAmanda was dressed in my clan colors, down to the tam. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my time on this earth. She was holding up a little sign that I couldn't quite make out until she was close. I read it and dropped to my knees, overcome.\n\nThe cameras zoomed in on the little sign, and the crowd roared yet again. \"WE'RE PREGGERS!,\" in big block letters. She slid off the shoulders and rushed to me, dropping onto her knees in front of me, and I swept her up into a hug, too overcome to speak, as the tears flowed down my cheeks.\n\nWe stayed there the rest of the song, hugging and crying. The instruments stopped, all but Amy on the piano, as sixty seven thousand voices rang out, following the words on the screen.\n\nThe whole band had gathered around us, holding microphones and singing, joined by their families. Tony had Bernice and both daughters, Dave had his two, Janine trying to hide behind him. The SAS were standing at attention, confused, and the Colonel looked at them before giving them an order.\n\n\"SING, YE WANKERS!\"\n\nThe rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum The words I love you running off my tongue.\n\nAnd never will I roam or leave my happy home where the sky meets the sea I'll be sailing.\n\nThe end\n\n........................\n\nWell, that's it. Yes it was over the top, and unrealistic, but then, aren't all fantasies? Thank you for your time.\n\nI could have written about their life afterwards, the success of Molly and Rob, Bernie and Tony, the heartbreak and recovery of Dave and Amy. But this wasn't their story.\n\nAnd of course, Amanda and Ewan lived happily ever after.\n\nAnd special thanks to Randi, who got me away from my profession projects long enough to come home.\n\nQ "
