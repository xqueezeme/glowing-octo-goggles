        "Author's note: This story started out entirely different when Unoriginalist burst on the scene and the genius of his adaptation of HDK's story of the dissolution between a husband and wife stirred all of Literotica. I began thinking what could have been more painful for the husband and all I could come up with was the dissolution of the father/children relationship.\n\nPerhaps one day, Unoriginalist will delve on that subject and treat us to another masterpiece. Or maybe one of the other truly great authors will answer the call and titillate us with a classic story.\n\nOnce again, I hope you enjoy the story.\n\n***********\n\nI sat waiting in my lawyer's conference room. Not much had changed in the five years from when I had retained him. Same paintings on the wall, same furniture, even the same damn National Geographic magazine located at the end table in the corner. Kinda sad considering that for all the money I had paid him in the past, he could've afforded a subscription to eternity.\n\nLuckily, this wasn't costing anywhere near his hourly rate since I was alone in the room. So why was I in a lawyer's office if I wasn't actually going to use a lawyer? Well that was a good question. The short answer would be because of Stella Jefferson, my ex wife.\n\nFor the past couple of weeks she had been trying to call me without success. The reason why she didn't have any success was due to her penchant to introduce me to justice, divorce style. I had learned the hard way that any unauthorized contact with Stella would result in police and court appearances.\n\nI was made a true believer when she lured me to meet with her while the divorce was still pending to talk over some custody issues for our children. When I got to the restaurant where she wanted to meet I was hoping that it was a good sign since it was where we had our meal where I had proposed marriage to her. \n\nAgainst all logic, I was hoping that she was in a reconciliation mood. Even after all the pain and humiliation she had caused me, I just wanted my wife and family back. I had dressed up in a sport jacket and tie for the upscale restaurant and I eagerly looked for her in the hustle of the busy establishment.\n\nFinally, I spotted her at a corner table looking outside the window. Maybe she was looking for me to arrive. I pointed her out to the hostess and made my way to her table. I was still enthralled by her beauty. A tall statuesque brunette you wouldn't believe that she was the mother of two children especially how she looked in her little black dress. She was the epitome of elegance as I approached.\n\nMy movements alerted her and she directed her gaze at me as I prepared to sit down at the table. Her lovely visage harden into a cold animosity which puzzled me. Before I could say hello or ask what was wrong, a number of people approached our table. Two were uniformed police officers who asked if I was John Perry and told me I was under arrest for violating a temporary restraining order issued by the judge presiding over our divorce case. \n\nWhile I protested that she had called me to meet her, I was told that I could take that up with the judge. The court order was quite specific that I was not allowed any contact with her without the court's permission. That was because she had alleged that I physically abused her and the children and she feared for their lives if I wasn't kept away.\n\nI had been dumbfounded when I had initially read the divorce pleadings that I had been served with. She had beaten me to the punch in filing for a divorce and she had taken a no holds barred approach as I read through all the lies she and her attorney had put to paper. The upshot was the court determined that I was a risk to the safety of my wife and children and the judge would be the sole arbiter of if and when I would see them again.\n\nI'm sure that most people have no idea of the embarrassment of being arrested. As I was physically doubled over the table and handcuffed behind my back I saw a young child recoiling in horror at an adjoining table. I wanted to explain to him that I wasn't a bad person, but, how do you start that conversation?\n\nIt wasn't like I would have had the time to finish an explanation as I was manhandled out of the building and into the back of a police cruiser. All during the trip I protested my innocence to the officers. They continued to ignore me as they drove to the municipal jail. I suppose they had heard it all before and ignoring me was the standard practice.\n\nThen I was booked and processed into the facility. Fingerprints and mugshot completed, I was asked for information regarding my name, residence, place of work, and vital statistics. I complied with all their enquiries fully expecting an opportunity to explain what had happened. Instead I was led to a general holding cell with about fifty men milling around aimlessly.\n\nBefore I was led inside, I said, \"Wait a minute, don't I get a phone call? How do I see about getting bonded out?\"\n\nThe police sergeant patiently told me, \"A phone is brought around each morning for inmates' use. You can make any local call. If you call long distance the party you call will have to accept the charges before you are connected. As far as bond, you are charged with being in contempt of the judge's order; therefore, you will have to appear before the judge before you can even think about being released. And since today is Friday, you won't be scheduled to appear in court until Monday at the earliest.\"\n\nWith that he firmly pushed me into the cell and the metallic clang of the cell door and the latching of the key echoed against the dank cold concrete walls. Without making eye contact with anyone I found a spot against the wall and sat on the floor and huddled to ride out the three days.\n\nReally there's no way to adequately describe being in that environment. There were people from every spectrum that circulated through that weekend. Hardened criminals, gangbangers, college frat boys, drunks, addicts, and the occasional good citizen like me. The ebb and flow of new people arriving and people leaving after making a bond, kept the noise a disruptive flow.\n\nA pecking order was in place for everything. It didn't matter if it was for using the phone, or for meals, or even if you were issued a blanket. The anti social personalities would seek out the weakest links and agitate them into a fight which would eventually require the police to intervene and take the victims to get medical treatment and disperse the perpetrators into an adjoining holding cell for \"violent offenders.\"\n\nDressed as I was, I drew some attention throughout the three days. I guess everybody figured if I could afford to dress like that then I should have been able to afford a bond. That was as far as it got for me. I guess as pissed off as I felt that I probably looked the same way and the jackals decided to go for easier targets.\n\nMonday morning, we were all roused and ankle chained together as we shuffled outside to a bus. There we were unchained and placed into the seats and coupled to wrist restraints. After a vocal tally we were driven to the courthouse where we were again ankle chained and escorted into a basement holding cell and then we awaited our turn to appear before our designated judge.\n\nFinally around two p.m. the bailiffs for my court came for me and I appeared in my unkempt disheveled clothes, reeking from the odor of the jail cell, sporting a three-day beard shadow before the baleful eyes of the judge.\n\nStella sat there with a gloating look as her attorney regurgitated the events of Friday night from Stella's perception. \"Your Honor, my client was tending to her own business dining out when she was traumatized by the appearance of her husband. Before he could commit bodily harm to her, the police called to the scene were able to successfully interdict before any injuries were sustained to my client!\" he thundered with righteous indignation.\n\nTo my surprise my lawyer was there and countered that I had no such intentions. I found out later that even though I had failed to contact him, the judge's clerk had made a call that morning to tell him to be in court to represent me. I tried to hurriedly whisper to him what had happened and he was simultaneously parroting what I was telling him to the judge.\n\nFinally after enough squabbling the judge shut the attorneys off and looked at me. \"Mr. Perry, do you think you've learned your lesson? When I issue a restraining order and a no contact order I mean for you to obey them!\"\n\nI began to open my mouth to protest only to have my attorney firmly clench my arm and hissed for me to shut up. The judge continued his diatribe for a couple of minutes and eventually ordered for my release and again warned me not to contact Stella. With that the court was adjourned and I watched Stella rise from her seat and walk out of the courtroom accompanied by Ted Jefferson. Both wore a look of triumph as they left.\n\nMy lawyer spent a few minutes of hurried advice to me as the bailiffs handcuffed me to escort me back to the basement holding cell. Then it was a matter of waiting until all the individuals were through with court and we were driven back to the jail. I was culled out of the line and taken to a process room where my personal belongings were returned to me. I was handed paperwork showing me where my truck had been towed and how to contact and pay for it to be released.\n\nI sighed and as I left the building I called the towing service and made arrangement to pick up my truck. Then I called a cab and waited. I tried to call my boss but the phone went to voicemail since it was past five p.m. I decided I would tell him in person tomorrow. \n\nI was hoping for a quiet ride to the tow yard and as my luck would have it I drew a particularly friendly cabdriver that wanted to converse the entire trip. As he kept yakking and asking questions, I would respond with monosyllabic answers. Still he continued until I finally said, \"I'm going to start deducting your tip for every word you say to me.\" That finally shut him up and we finished the drive in peace. I did feel guilty for lashing out at him and I did leave a big tip.\n\nThen I had the pleasure of trying to get my vehicle back. If I thought, the bureaucratic paperwork was daunting by the police I was shocked by the hoops I had to go through to ransom my vehicle back to me. I was finally able to placate them and drove home.\n\nHome being a small camper trailer, which had a bedroom, small bathroom, a kitchenette with electricity and running water. I stripped off my clothes and debated whether to burn them and decided my pride would have to be subjugated to my pocketbook. I couldn't afford to go around and buy new clothes at the moment. I would have to hope the dry cleaners could get out the smell, if not, the shame.\n\nI went and took a hot shower. As much as I hoped to languish in the water, the hot water tank quickly ran out and I finished bathing in cold water. I shivered as I toweled off and stumbled to the small bed and dove under the covers. It had been one hell of a weekend I thought as I drifted off to sleep.\n\nMorning came and I quickly made and devoured a large breakfast of eggs and bacon. After what I had experienced I thought I deserved it. Then I got to work early in time for the boss to publicly ream my ass out for missing work yesterday. \n\n\"I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but, I'm not going to put up with your dicking around and not showing up for work except when you feel like it!\"\n\nThe accusation stung as yesterday had been the first day I had ever missed work except for scheduled vacations in the ten years I had worked there. Still my boss continued to rant and the commotion was drawing a crowd which seemed to fuel him to more inspired verbiage.\n\n\"So where the fuck were you?\" he demanded to know. I kept trying to stall him and asked to speak in private but he had found an issue he was hellbent to bring forward and make an object lesson for the rest of his employees. He kept asking and I kept stalling and in the midst of the argument we were both stridently yelling at each other.\n\n\"WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU?\" my boss asked again pausing after each word yelled to empathize each word.\n\nI finally snapped. \"I was in jail! My goddamn wife had me put in jail! Now are you happy, motherfucker?\" I screamed.\n\nThe shocked look on his face mirrored those of my coworkers. Never in a million years would they have thought that I would have wound up behind bars. Still the emotional purging continued as I spewed out the venom I had long held inside.\n\n\"And thank you for making it all public, you sorry son of a bitch! I remember eight years ago having to prop you up when you went though your divorce and this is how you return the favor? Well, fuck you! Fuck you and the horse you rode in on! I quit, you sorry motherfucking son of a bitch!\"\n\nWith that I turned around and walked back to the parking lot to get into my truck. Several of my coworkers trailed along with me trying to persuade me not to leave and to come back to discuss everything with my boss in private. But I wasn't going to be persuaded. For ten long years I had been breaking my back, unappreciated and underpaid to support my family. And for what? Now, I was living alone and I didn't know when I would get to see my daughter or son.\n\nAs I drove off I heard the ping of my phone announcing the arrival of a new text message. Since I was driving, I decided not to dig it out of my pocket and see who it was from. I suspected that it was from my boss wanting to make amends. Having nowhere to go and it being too early for the bars to be open I went back to my camper.\n\nI pulled into the dirt driveway avoiding the more severe potholes and turned off the truck. Then I pulled out the phone and opened up the text. I was flabbergasted to see it was from Stella. It read: \"John, I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding.\"\n\nBefore I could even think, I texted back: \"Stella, what were you trying to prove?\" \n\nI waited for a reply but none was forthcoming. Then a couple of hours later I got a call from my friend Jerry from work. I was sure he was going to try to convince me to come back and ask for my job back. Instead he told me, \"John, the police are here looking for you.\"\n\nI thanked him for the information and hung up. Once again, I had fallen prey at a weak moment and Stella had taken advantage of the opportunity. I knew that the police would soon be at my new location since I had provided it for their records when I was being jailed. I could expect another stay at jail courtesy of Stella.\n\nI quickly studied the matter and made my decision. I unhooked the electrical and water connections to the camper and backed my truck up to hitch up the trailer mount. It wasn't good knowing that I would lose my security deposit at the trailer park, but, I was desperate to buy me some time.\n\nAs I drove out of the trailer park with all my worldly possessions, I lost my qualms about using the phone and driving at the same time. First, I called my lawyer and after I was finally connected to him, I explained what had happened. First he called me a dumbass and then proceeded to chew my ass out. Then he said he would call the court and try to get a hearing set so I could surrender in court rather than be arrested again. He warned me not to have any future contact with Stella. I assured him I had learned my lesson. Then I called the manager of the trailer park canceling my lease. Then I called my grandparents.\n\nThen I drove. For close to a hundred miles I drove eastward to my goal. Here I would find my maternal grandparents. Here I would find sanctuary. As I unlimbered from the truck, they came out to greet me. Both had concerned looks on their faces. They knew the initial extent of my troubles, but, updating them was going to cause them grief just due to them worrying about me.\n\nGrandma insisted on feeding me before we started talking. As we ate some of her fried chicken, I explained the weekend trauma that I had undergone. They were appalled that my relationship with Stella had gotten to the point of this toxic radioactivity. Then I told them I needed a big favor. \"Would it be okay with y'all if I camp out here for a while until everything settles down?\"\n\nMy grandfather looked at me and said, \"John, you know this will always be your home. You just set up your camper where you want.\"\n\nAnd with that I had taken care of one problem. I didn't have any income coming in, but, now I could put off paying rent until I was in a situation to start paying back my grandparents. I asked if they knew of any local construction companies hiring. They studied the question and posed potential possibilities to me, but, it seemed like they were of the opinion that no one was hiring right now.\n\nThat did not bode well. I still had outstanding debts and responsibilities to take care of. Not the least of which was my capricious attorney that kept changing attitude with the ebb and flow of the retainer I was paying him.\n\nSo then I asked if they knew anybody that needed any kind of handyman work. They brightened up with that question and threw out a few names and addresses for me to check out. They also promised that they would call around their circle of friends and get more prospects. \n\nThe rest of the day I spent jury rigging electrical and water service to the camper. My grandparents said I could stay in the house, but, I didn't want to crowd them. I was a firm believer in Ben Franklin's adage that fish and overnight guests overstayed their welcome after three days.\n\nThe next couple of days I spent going around all the local construction companies looking for work. Sure enough, no one was hiring, but, I got to fill out a lot of employment application forms. I started cringing when I thought of the possibility that anyone would contact my former employer.\n\nThe good news was that my attorney had gotten a hearing date set for my second show cause hearing for violating the no contact order. All I had to do was avoid getting picked up by the police before the hearing date.\n\nMeanwhile I had my first job as a handyman. A neighbor of my grandparents wanted to raze an old barn. Everyone had bid twice as much as I did just to knock it down. My price included hauling off all the debris. All the other estimates figured on it being a two to three day job using a crew of employees. I had finished up in one long day. As I was finishing loading up the last load of debris in my Grandpa's flatbed trailer, the neighbor came out to me carrying two ice cold longneck bottles of beer and I grateful accepted the offering.\n\nWe watched the dying remnants of the sunset fade into twilight as we silently sipped away. \n\n\"Well, John I wasn't sure you'd be able to get the job done in one day, but, damned if you didn't. And you didn't use any heavy machinery! That was why everybody's bids were so high due to them calculating renting equipment. \"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Lambert my Dodge pickup just thinks it's a bulldozer.\" I explained how I used heavy chains on all the support beams and the torque of my pickup in low gear did the rest as the barn collapsed like a deck of cards. The rest was a matter of heavy work gloves and a strong back lugging the old timbers into the trailer.\n\n\"I got scratched up by a couple of rusty nails so I'll go into town tomorrow for a tetanus shot, but, right now this is all the medicine I need.\" I finished the last sip of beer remaining and tossed the empty into the bed of my pickup. It was just good manners to keep Mr. Lambert company while he finished. So we engaged in small talk and he insisted on me calling him Robert as we shook hands and I left his property slowly hauling the trailer back to my grandparent's place. Tomorrow morning I would dump it at the local landfill before I went in to get my shot.",
        "The next day I unloaded the trailer at the landfill and went and got my shot. Then I drove out to another neighbor where I cut down deadwood trees all day long using a chainsaw. I was assured that next week they would rent out a log splitter and I could split the wood into cords of firewood and then we would discuss the price of removing all the stumps.\n\nI was a tired puppy when I finally got back to my trailer. True to form under the theory that there was no rest for the wicked I was scheduled for court the next day. Donning a set of presentable clothes, I went outside the next morning only to be surprised by my grandparents. They insisted on escorting me back to the city in a show of solidarity.\n\nWell, they got their money's worth as the battle royale commenced. Once again I was threatened with jail if I didn't stop contacting Stella. After issuing numerous assurances that I had learned my lesson, the court set a hearing date for child visitation and custody, property settlement, and the divorce.\n\nThe admonishment not to cause trouble went right over my grandmother's head as she made a beeline to Stella after we left court.\n\n\"Stella Perry, you ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done! It was bad enough you cheated on John, but, now you are trying to get him locked up? And why did you tell those lies about him hurting you and the kids. You know good and well that he loved you and his kids with every breath and he would never harm any of you! It is a crime and a sin to keep John away from his children!\"\n\nTo give her credit, Stella blushed from embarrassment as my little grandmother went face to face with her. Stella and her beau, Ted Jefferson waited uncomfortably for the elevator to arrive to carry them to the lobby away from my angry grandmother. As Grandma continued in on Stella, it got so humiliating that Stella and Ted finally retreated down the stairway to make their getaway. The crowd that had gathered gave my grandmother a small round of applause for the entertainment value.\n\nAs we entered the elevator, I studied the court dates the judge had proscribed. Of the three court hearing dates, the only priority I had was to see my children. Because of Stella's allegations, the state's child protection office had got involved. Now I had to worry about some misguided social worker having the power to keep my children away from me. I was only allowed periodic visits under the supervision of a social worker with my eight year-old daughter, Carol and my ten year old son, Steven at a neutral site until the matter was resolved.\n\nThe joy I felt seeing my children running toward on each visit was only matched by the anguish I felt as they were tearfully led away by the social worker as they pitifully cried, \"Daddy! Daddy!\" when they left. I would blindly stagger to my truck and spend the next couple of hours sobbing uncontrollably inside the cab.\n\nHow could Stella have done this to us? I looked back on how blessed I had been to marry her. She had been the love and light of my life for more than ten years. She had graced me with the greatest children in the world. And while we weren't rich; we weren't exactly poor. We both had jobs and had the ordinary struggles to maintain a budget. But, all in all, I was happy and complacent with life.\n\nBut there was a wolf at the door.\n\nTed Jefferson, a well to do businessman had somehow been attracted to Stella. And he ruthlessly and systematically set out his goal to seduce her. I had no idea how long it took. All I was aware of was a slow gradual cooling off from the love and ardor I shared with Stella. I was beginning to be perplexed by her ever increasing reluctance to make love to me.\n\nWhen we first married we had plans to have three children, yet, now whenever I brought it up it was one excuse after another. Eventually I gave up the subject and decided to be satisfied with my two beautiful children. Which was fine by me as we started gearing up for all the activities that adolescents partake in. \n\nFootball, baseball, and I even gritted my teeth for soccer. Piano, ballet, and swimming. Whatever drew their attention I encouraged as I felt that a number of activities would lead to a well-rounded child. As they got older, then they could focus on the few they truly enjoyed and excelled at. Stella and I had prepared a calendar to help with the logistics of making all their appointments. Over time I began to notice a trend of me being the primary chauffeur while Stella begged off due to \"business meetings.\" \n\nThe meetings began to occur more often and for longer durations. Whenever I complained to Stella, she would lash out at me saying I wanted to keep her barefooted, pregnant, and in the kitchen. So I learned to suck it up and bite my tongue as we negotiated through these perilous times in our marriage.\n\nAny possibility I held out for makeup sex when we went to bed was quickly shot down as Stella began the habit of reading in bed. Any attempt to get her to physically respond to me was shot down. I would turn over facing away from her, frustrated and confused. But it was more than that. I also missed the time we used to talk to one another in bed in the dark still of the night. Those were times I cherished just as much as when we made love. I began to miss my best friend.\n\nHostilities were brewing on another front. I began to hear harping about how poor we were and how she and the children were having to do without. I was stunned by the ludicrous accusations. I kept pointing out all I did for them and asked Stella what specifically was missing from her life.\n\nSix months later, I found out that the answer to that particular question was Ted Jefferson. I know what you are thinking. I had all the signs in front of my face. All the telltale indications of an affair. But you know what, I loved and trusted Stella and, honest to God, I had no idea until we had \"the day.\"\n\nBoy, what a day that was. Carol and Steven had soccer practice scheduled for that Saturday morning. I was sitting in the bleachers of the soccer complex yelling encouragement to both Carol and Steven as they practiced on different fields. A whole slew of parents and family were doing likewise for their kids.\n\nA woman sat next to me and I recognized her, Donna Richards, our preacher's wife. She smiled and we got to talking about our kids. It was a pleasant conversation with just the right touch of guilt for not having perfect church attendance. I'm sure that Donna and her husband both had to deal with interacting with people with a similar guilty conscious.\n\nShe remarked how beautiful a morning it was and what were my plans? I told her after practice, me and the kids were going to grab a hamburger and then I would have to mow the lawn. Donna frowned and told me that she had heard on the radio that a bad weather front was moving in and the prediction was for rain the rest of the weekend. I wasn't happy to hear that. I had already procrastinated for a week on mowing and the yard was looking shabby.\n\n\"Man, I wish you hadn't told me that\" I groaned, \"Stella will have my hide if I don't get the yard cut.\"\n\nDonna laughed and offered a solution. She would look after the kids and take them with her kids to get a bite after practice and then drop them off at the house. I insisted on her taking the two $20 dollar bills I offered to pay for everyone's meal. As I left I took one last glance at the practice fields trying to spot Steven and Carol swirling in the midst of the kids. \n\nI hurried home and noticed the late model Cadillac parked in our driveway. I assumed that it was one of Stella's friends vehicle and so I parked on the street. I went into our carport and unlocked the utility door and hauled out the lawnmower.\n\nIt fired up on the first crank and I proceeded to march back and forth across the lawn. I had gotten to the fifth pass when the front door opened and a stranger stepped out of the house and proceeded to the car. He studiously ignored me and fumbled to get his key in the doorlock. I observed his general appearance and didn't understand why his shirttail was tucked out on one side of his pants. He jumped in the car and fired it up and quickly backed out of our drive and then rapidly accelerated down the street ignoring my yells of \"Hey!\" to get his attention and stop.\n\nI left the mower running and went inside, Stella wasn't anywhere downstairs and I hurried upstairs. I was calling for Stella and she wasn't answering. Just as I got to our bedroom door, the bathroom door opened and we converged, but, both our attention were fixed on a small item of clothing lying on the bedroom floor. A pair of Stella's panties...a rumpled bed...Stella with marred makeup and hair.\n\nI slumped against the wall and slowly slid down it hyperventilating from my discovery. I didn't even notice when Stella carefully edged around me and crept out of the room. When I finally broke out of my fugue state it was around noon. Stella was gone, who knows where. The lawnmower had idled until it finally ran out of gas, Donna had not arrived with Carol and Steven.\n\nI was at a loss of what to do. Should I go track down Stella or do I need to wait for the kids to arrive and regroup? I decided I needed to take care of my kids first. Eventually, the kids arrived and asked where Mom was. I didn't know what to tell them. All my efforts to reach her cellphone were going to voicemail. Gloom remained in the house for the rest of the weekend. The kids finally accepted that I didn't know anymore about their mom than they did. It didn't stop those worried looks on their faces.\n\nI somehow managed to get the kids dressed and off to school Monday. If I had known what as going to transpire I would have done something different to change the near future that was about to slam me. I arrived at work and it was torture trying to concentrate and thinking of Stella at the same time. Then came the lunch break and I sat with my fellow coworkers while they ate and joked around. I just stared at the paper bag that held my sandwich that I wound up throwing away. The afternoon toil was no better and as I left the construction site a man approached me and asked if I was John Perry. As soon as I said yes, he handed me a thick manila envelope and told me that I was being served. I asked him served with what? He told me to read the paperwork. \n\nI tore open the package and tried to make sense of the legal gobblygook. What a racket lawyers have to come up with a system that requires you to rely on them. There were certain phrases that caught my attention: divorce, alimony, restraining order, sole custody. This was above my capacity to understand so I called my buddy that had gone through this a couple of years ago. After I told him why I called he gave me the number of his cousin who was an attorney. As a favor to him, his cousin would wait after hours to meet me at his office.\n\nEventually I found out how those extra services like that would eat through a retainer. Stella and Ted could afford to spend that kind of money as they had to expedite filing and serving me so quickly. That alone would have cost me an entire week's payday.\n\nAnyway, there I was in the attorney's office watching him behind his desk reading through the paperwork that I brought him and taking notes. Then he asked me all kinds of questions. Finally, he gave me the bad news.\n\n\"John, I've been practicing law ten years and I can already tell you this is going to be one of the worst cases I've ever seen. Start with the fact that your wife was able to retain a firm of cold conniving snakes like the Ferriday's firm and to get them to file and have you served the Monday after you discovered your wife's infidelity means that someone had to pay some big overtime for those attorneys to work on the weekend. \n\nThen you have the petition for a restraining order already signed by a judge at an ex parte hearing. After reading what you allegedly did to your wife and kids, that was a no brainer. They are alleging that you physically assaulted your wife and were mentally cruel to her and your kids throughout the entire marriage. Your wife fear for her safety, blah, blah, blah. Here's the no contact order that you are required to obey unless and until the court lifts it.\n\nRestraining order keeping you away from your wife and minor children except as permitted by the court. Said restraining order allows you to come no closer than 500 yards to them or your house. No contact by electronic means or writings or conveyances by third parties. Request to keep you from having visitation; or, in the alternative, supervised visits at a neutral location not to exceed one hour in duration. Request for sole custody. Request for the house to be adjudicated to your wife. Request for the court to award your wife alimony for her lifetime at triple what the state's guidelines requires based on the unusual aspect of this case. Request for your wife to be awarded all the assets of the marital estate due to the unusual aspect of the case. \n\nAnd so on and so on.\" He waved the paperwork over his head.\n\n\"You also got a request for psychological evaluations on your children at your expense.\" He sighed, \"She is plumb pissed at you.\"\n\n\"I just want to know when I can see my kids.\" I said in despair, \"Can we fight all this nonsense?\"\n\n\"Hey, you can always fight it, John. The problem is going to be whether you can afford it. What they are going to do is bury you in paperwork and legal fees. They are going to stall you and fight you on every issue until you've exhausted every penny you've got or until you give up.\"\n\nAnd that was pretty much how it was. It took me a hearing before I could get the court to order my clothes and personal effects returned to me and still her lawyers insisted to be allowed a month to review my list of property. \n\nAt least the court refused that request. The one that broke my heart was the court agreeing to limited supervised visitations until the final disposition. I originally thought I could rent an apartment and ride out the storm of the divorce, but, that was cutting too much into the money I needed to fight the custody. A buddy at work had an old small trailer that he only used during deer season that he was willing to let go for $3,000. I found the cheapest trailer park around and while it helped it still did not staunch the tide of money needed for experts' testimony and legal fees.\n\nThat was why I was so agreeable to Stella's proposal to meet. I thought at the very least we could come to some arrangement on Carol and Steven. At the very best we could reconcile and get counseling and I would have my family again.\n\nHer little ploy paid dividends that even she didn't anticipate. I lost my job, I had to move away, I was no longer steadily employed, and I was living in a small decrepit trailer on my grandparents' property. I was also getting more and more mired in legal costs.\n\nThe judge took all that into account when he finally adjudicated the custody of Carol and Steven. Given that I no longer resided within the jurisdictional boundaries of the court; that I was not gainfully employed and could not provide a living area capable to sustain the needs of myself and my two minor children, the court determined that sole custody would be awarded to Stella Perry.\n\nFurthermore, due to the reasons aforestated and the allegations of abuse, the court ordered that it was in the best interest of the children that visitation by the father continue to be limited to an hour duration of supervised visitation within the jurisdictional boundaries of the court, Said visitation to commence on the second Saturday of each month.\n\nThe bitterness I felt sitting watching Stella celebrating her victory with Ted Jefferson and their team of lawyer plummeted me to the darkest depth a human being could endure. To keep me away from my children. How could she? How could the court believe all those lies? Despite all the efforts by Stella's experts, none of them could get Steven or Carol to say anything bad about me. Why wasn't the court listening to my children?\n\nI had to wait for the entire courtroom to empty before I could leave. My shoes echoed down the deserted hallways of the courthouse as I approached the statute of Justice. Now I knew for a certainty that Justice was blind...and deaf.\n\nI continued to battle as best I could, but, it was a forgone conclusion, Stella was awarded the use of the marital home until Carol reached the age of eighteen. At which time the house would be sold and the proceeds split 50/50. But, guess who was still responsible for making the mortgage payments?\n\nChild Support? You betcha!\n\nAlimony? You betcha! (Small victory in that it was the regular rate and only for five years)\n\nResponsibility for all the debts accrued in the marriage? You betcha!\n\nIt was laughable when the assets were divided up. They were so meager that I basically came out with my Dodge pickup truck and my trailer. I figuratively left town with my tail tucked between my legs. I had two conflicting thoughts; first, at least they'd have to burn gas to come pick me up when I wasn't able to pay for everything and second, that I would do my damndest not to get to the point that they would have to come pick me up.\n\nI scrambled around to make every buck I could. I was working 12 to 16 hours everyday with no day off except the second Saturday of the month circled in red on my calendar. When that day finally arrived I sped down the highway to the designated spot where the visit was to take place. I arrived with two hours to spare and eagerly awaited their arrival. \n\nA half hour before they were scheduled to arrive the social worker showed up and we took up spots in neutral corners in the room and the seconds ticked away...and ticked away...and ticked away. Fifteen minutes into the designated hour, the social worker deduced they were not coming and perhaps we should leave. I refused saying they were just running late.\n\nThirty five minutes into the hour she suggested that I call my ex and find out what was the holdup. I tried to explain why that wasn't a viable option. She asked for the number and called from her phone.\n\nOh, was that suppose to be today? Gosh, they had miscalculated and they were at the zoo in Dallas. Well, they would make sure that mistake didn't happen again!\u2014was the response Stella gave the social worker. The social worker packed up her belongings to leave and I begged her to stay for the last twenty minutes.\n\nThe look she gave me. You poor sad son of a bitch was what her eyes expressed as she walked out. I remained rooted watching every second ticking away in the countdown until the minute hand finally clicked on twelve. Then I picked up all the little gifts I was able to buy and carry for the visit and carried them back to the truck for the long quiet drive back home.\n\nSo the court's reaction was what I expected, Stella got yelled at and then everybody went home. My request for an alternate day was objected to by Stella as it would be \"too disruptive for plans that had already been made\". The court harumphed and said he would let it slide this time, but, don't let it happen again. \n\nI went back and scrambled for another month to keep all the payments up to date. My Saturday rolled around and I paced in the room waiting for Carol and Steven's arrival. Finally they came running into the room and I fell to my knees as they surrounded me in a hug. I openly cried tears of joy as we rocked back and forth. Then trying to take advantage of every minute I asked them how they had been.\n\nVicariously, I became aware of Stella's events as they pertained to the kids. They were no longer living in the house. They had moved across to the new part of town in a great big house with their \"Uncle Ted.\" Some people had moved into our old house and were paying Mommy rent to live there.",
        "Uncle Ted was buying them all kinds of toys and taking them places with Mommy. And Mommy was so happy and smiling and laughing all the time. I suffered the torture of a thousand small cuts as I kept smiling for the kids as they innocently told me of all the good things they had done. I reached for the gift bags that I brought back from last month fiasco and waited with expectation to see the smiles on their faces. Steven picked through his and said that Uncle Ted had bought them both iPads and iPods.  \n\nThe bottom of my heart dropped out as I realized I could never compete with Ted Jefferson on that level. Still I kept that frozen clown smile on my face as the social worker warned we only had five more minutes. I grabbed them both and held them and kept telling them I loved them, over and over and over until finally it was time for them to leave.\n\nAfter they left I noticed Steven hadn't taken his gift bag so I carried it with me. When I got outside I saw Carol's gift bag lying on top of a trash receptacle where Stella had left it. I stared at it. I walked over and put Steven's on top of Carol's and walked to my truck for the drive back.\n\nMonth after month I would suffer the same ignoble fate as my children slowly slipped away from me. I started to sense an undercurrent of resentment by the kids being forced to visit with their father. The tighter I tried to hold on, the more they slipped away. Then came a visit where at the end Steven asked me for a favor. I smiled and told him sure. He told me that Ted had tickets to the University of Texas Longhorns game scheduled on the same day for the next month's visit. Would I mind if he and Carol skipped next month's visit?\n\nHow could he not see how he had ravaged me with that question? I stammered sure it was okay, the next visit we had they could tell me all about it. Steven reluctantly allowed me to hug him as they walked away.. It became easier and easier for Steven or Carol or both to let me know they preferred to be elsewhere rather than with me during the visits. As Carol told me when I tried to put up a resistance, \"It's not like you're really our daddy anymore.\"\n\nI should have been livid. I should have been fucking livid. I should have been over the top, take no fucking prisoners livid. And all I felt was numb. \n\n\"Do you feel that way, Steven? Are you tired of me visiting?\" Steven bowed his head and nodded yes.\n\nWell that just left one last question to ask, \"Do y'all want to stop with the visits?\" \n\nNow both my kids sunk their heads down and nodded yes.\n\nI paused for a minute and neither kid would look me in the eyes. \n\n\"Okay, this will be the last visit. I'll keep driving up in case either of you change your mind, but, I won't expect y'all to be here. I wish you only knew how much I love both of you and how much I'm going to miss you.\" I quietly said.\n\nFor the first and only time I left first. And wouldn't you know it I bumped right into Stella outside waiting to pick up the kids. I could tell she was panicking being face to face with me, her damn court ordered 500 yards buffer zone not being worth a fuck to her in that instant. I just looked at her and said, \"You won.\" And then I walked off.\n\nThe wedding announcement was in all the local papers, my girl was a little bridesmaid and my son served as Ted's best man. I contacted my lawyer for what I thought would be the last bit of representation and told him to file for reconsideration of the alimony and request the sale of our marital home.\n\nFinally, the court sided with me and ended the alimony. Once we showed the marital home became a rental property, the court ordered that I be awarded the difference upon the sale of the house. Too fucking little, too fucking late.\n\nI went to my trailer and celebrated with a week long drinking binge. I was nowhere near recovering when I heard a knock on my trailer door. As I opened the door empty beer cans cascaded down around the feet of Robert Lambert, my grandparents' neighbor who gave me my first job in razing his old barn.\n\nHe looked at the sloppy mess I had become and asked if I could come by his house tomorrow. He had a business proposition for me. I told him I would and I sat mired in the remaining rubble throughout the trailer. I was disgusted with myself and I went and collected every can and then tidied up the trailer as best I could. Then I showered and shaved and made sure I had a change of clean clothes.\n\nWhen I arrived at the appointed time, he held his hand out to me for a shake and I said, \"I'm sorry about yesterday, Mr. Lambert\"\n\nHe reminded me that he had told me to call him Robert as he led me inside. We went into his den where a woman sat on the couch leaning over to the coffee table. She was poring over a series of maps and then typing into a laptop computer.\n\nI couldn't help notice the austere behavior she projected. Her auburn hair was wrapped tightly in a bun. She was wearing large reading glasses and her face was scrunched in concentration. Her alabaster complexion and lack of makeup did not conceal her attractive features. I noticed she was unusually tall for a woman. I had the totally irrational thought of what it would be like to look into those vivid blue eyes straight on while kissing her.\n\nAs though to complete her struggle to appear unattractive, her torso was adorned with a baggy Texas A &M sweatshirt, and her jeans were worn and baggy. It was as though she didn't give a damn about impressing anyone. \n\n\"Gayle, I want you to meet John Perry\"\n\nGayle peered over her glasses and it was evident that I didn't impress her. I went to shake her hand and I found myself as a source of disdain as I was captured in the laser beams of those deep blue eyes as she ignored my hand.\n\n\"Mr. Perry, would you excuse us?\" \n\nAnd not waiting for an answer she stormed out of the room with Robert Lambert quickly trailing after her. They retired into what appeared to be the kitchen and I became aware of an argument escalating by the minute. The noises were too muffled to make any sense out of until the very end when I heard the woman yell, \"Why do we need him?\" To which Robert replied, \"Because I said so!\"\n\nWhen they came out it was apparent that though a truce may be in effect, a brush war could reignite any instant.\n\n\"John, I'm sorry for the interruption let me finish introducing you to my granddaughter, Gayle Lambert.\" \n\nGayle gave a fleeting smile but the eyes did not match the smile as Robert continued, \"Gayle is a recent graduate at Texas A & M in business agriculture and she came to me with some very interesting news. So I'm going to let Gayle take over now.\"\n\n\"Mr. Perry, what do you know of Shreveport, Louisiana?\"\n\n\"If you don't mind why don't you call me John. As to your question, not much, I know they have a racetrack at Bossier City and some casinos over there.\"\n\n\"Let me rephrase the question Mr. Perry\" she ignored my request to calling me by my first name, \"Do you know anything about the history of Shreveport?\"\n\n\"No, I don't\" I replied .\n\n\"Have you ever heard of Captain Henry Shreve, Mr. Perry?\"\n\nAfter studying on it, I said, \"No, can't say I have.\"\n\n\"What about the Great Raft, Mr. Perry? Have you ever heard of it?\"\n\nI responded, \"Wasn't that the Kon Tiki boat that Thor what's his name sailed?\"\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes in exasperation at the response.\n\n\"No, Mr. Perry, close to 800 years ago a logjam formed on the Red River. For all those centuries, trees unearthed in the Red River continued to float down to become part of the logjam. At its apex the logjam stretched 150 miles upstream and became so thick that many streams and tributaries and lakes formed as a result of it. You could actually walk on the river for miles and never see water.\n\nAs you can imagine many of those trees over time lost their buoyancy and sank to the bottom of the Red River or whatever tributary it caught on at the logjam. And remember this went on for centuries.\n\nEventually, Captain Shreve was assigned the task of clearing the logjam and he eventually did so to make the Red River navigable. In thanks for doing so, the town of Shreveport was named for him.\"\n\nI interrupted, \"That is a very interesting history lesson, ma'am, but, I understood this was a business meeting. So why is this important?\"\n\n\"Mr. Perry, have you ever seen lumber made from water stained wood? It is exquisite and more importantly, expensive. And my grandfather and your grandparents are sitting on a gold mine.\"\n\nIt slowly sunk in about my grandparents and Robert Lambert's land abutting against the bank of the Red River. When you add all the tributaries and lakes as well as the wetlands there was no telling how much timber had been buried over the years. True, the Red River was constantly being dredged, but, that would be the main channel. Off to the sides, who knew what was lying in the murky deep?\n\n\"Okay, this sounds very intriguing, but, how do you propose to get to this gold?\" I asked.\n\n\"That is where you and I come in John.\" Robert interjected, \"I will outlay the cash to purchase a large pontoon boat, complete with three winches. Gayle will map out the areas most likely to have sunken timbers, you will pilot, and dive on the timbers and hook the winch chains onto them. Once a timber is up, it will be cradled between the pontoons and be taken ashore. We will jury rig a crane to load the timbers onto a log truck to be transported to a sawmill built where I had the old barn you razed.  \n\nFrom there it will be cut into lumber and we will sell either wholesale or retail depending on the profit margin. There is no telling how much we can make out of this is it is handled right.\"\n\n\"Okay Robert what is the split?\" I asked.\n\n\"You get 10%\", Gayle interjected before Robert could comment.\n\n\"No Gayle, I told you that we were going to be fair about this!\" Robert angrily replied. \"John, for providing all the sweat equity you get 50%. Gayle and I will share the remaining 50%.\"\n\nGayle Lambert appeared ready to chew nails from the betrayal her grandfather had just engaged in. She continued to glare at me for the rest of the evening as Robert and I discussed what we would need for the boat. Finally, we decided we had all equipment contingencies covered and I told them goodnight.\n\nAs I walked out. Gayle trailed behind me and stood on the porch as I walked down the steps.\n\n\"Mr. Perry!\"\n\nI turned around and looked up at her and even as she haughtily peered down at me I was struck again at her potential beauty.\n\n\"I just want to say Mr. Perry that I am not on board with you being partners with my grandfather and I. As far as I see, we are giving away money to have you on this venture. And as far as I am concerned the day my grandfather realize you are just baggage will be a happy day.\"\n\nIt must have been a reaction to all the events transpiring that caused it but I lit in on her.\n\n\"Ms. Lambert, I don't know who pissed in your cereal and I don't fucking care. I came into your house at your grandfather's invitation and you have been a total bitch the whole time. I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but, to come out here and talk to me as though I was a dog is the last straw.\n\nYou don't know what I've been going through and you don't have any idea who I am as a person. I am tired of people shitting on me and if you think for a second that I'm going to let you shit on me, you've got another thing coming!\"\n\nAs I stormed off I saw her with mouth agape and then rushing indoors. I suppose to tell Robert how I had mistreated her. I started to wonder what it was about me that pissed off women. I figured I would soon find out if Robert still was interested in being partners. If not, I would have to continue scrambling to earn a living.\n\nWhen I arrived the next morning nothing was mentioned to me by Robert and the only indication of the previous evening tete a tete was a momentary glimpse of a redheaded wraith adorned in a Texas A & M T shirt slamming her bedroom door shut.\n\nAfter our mutual flinch and waiting for the reverberation from the door slamming to cease, Robert and I both had the same junior high school boy smile on our faces. After that snicker, we continued discussing what we would need to transport the logs and what we would need for our sawmill. A couple of times we heard the door open and we buried ourselves in the paperwork as Gayle traversed through on whatever objective she was on.\n\nThe last time she went back into her room I made the comment that she sure was loyal to her school. Robert commented that since she had been back home that she had worn a Texas Aggie shirt everyday. I knew people that were fanatical about their schools, but, Gayle didn't strike me as that type.\n\nIn a week, we had the boat outfitted and ready to go on a trial run. The construction of the sawmill would wait until we determined the feasibility of the venture. If we were not able to dredge up enough timber to make it profitable, Robert could turn around and resale most of the equipment and not sustain too much of a loss.\n\nMe, on the other hand would continue to accrue losing a day wage until my finances would redline. I was desperate for this venture to work and start giving me some breathing room.\n\nRobert after consulting with Gayle decided to go out on a small tributary where we would work unseen by others. As I appeared the next morning, I was surprised from the indications that Gayle was going with us. She had on yet another A & M shirt on as she packed the items she intended to carry in the bed of my pickup. So we all loaded up and drove out to a suitable place to launch the pontoon boat. Gayle sat in the back and didn't participate in any of the conversation. \n\nI drove the boat a short way and killed the engine. We slowly drifted and I picked up the large bamboo pole I had on the boat and started probing the pole into the water. After five minutes, a solid thunk was felt and we anchored the boat. I had my old scuba gear that I had bought when I was in the service, but, the water was shallow enough that my mask and snorkel would work.\n\nI dove into the murky depth and feeling my way on the bottom I felt the slimy texture of a large object. As I felt along the curvature I estimated the girth to be bigger than my arm span. Then I quickly explored horizontally and estimated the length to be around sixty feet. I went to the surface and told Roger and Gayle that we had found our first log.\n\nThey excitedly ran the line from one of the winches and I dove again. I found a way to encircle the log with the wire from the winch and hooked the connection together. Then I surfaced again and climbed into the boat. Slowly and carefully I engaged the winch to start drawing the line in. After the slack caught up we became aware of the boat settling deeper into the water as the winch continued to strain. Soon the bow of the boat began dipping and the stern rose precariously.\n\nNeither Robert nor Gayle had that much experience in a boat. I had as a teenager enjoyed going fishing many times in a bassboat. But never had I tried to land something this big. Still my experience at working with heavy machinery at my construction job gave me a clue on how to handle this even though it was a different application.\n\nThe boat continued to angle down and Robert and Gayle appeared anxious. I was as well, but, wanted to give a sense of confidence. Without warning, the inert suction holding the log to the bottom gave way and the line from the winch easily rolled in. \n\nA light of anticipation appeared on Gayle's face and as the tip of the log appeared in the sunlight for the first time in untold years, a hearty laugh came from Gayle. I was back in the water ready to run the second line around the log now tilted at an angle from the riverbed. I swam and tossed the winch line under the timber and swam to the other side to hook it up.\n\nOnce again I went to the surface and was at the controls of the second winch. Since the log was no longer stuck in the riverbed the second winch line came up easily and soon we had our first log strapped to the boat.\n\nIt was cause for celebration and Robert and I shook hands and patted each other on the back. Robert and Gayle laughed and hugged one another and me and Gayle...sorta stood beside each other uncomfortably until we drifted away from one another.\n\nI slowly drove the boat toward the shallow end of the water near the ramp and we determined that we had dredged up a cypress tree. Gayle explained that was one of the more sought after timbers.\n\nWe continued going out that day and we finished with five cypress trees ready to be loaded and harvested. As we drove back we discussed how to proceed. The ice thawed and Gayle talked as long as it was business related and she directed her comments to Robert. We decided I would drive the boat directly to the site in the morning and continue harvesting logs. Robert and Gayle would go ahead and purchase the logging truck and bring it to the bank of the river. \n\nBy use of a loading arch, winches, and log tongs and chains on the log trailer the logs would be loaded unto the trailer whereupon we would deliver our first load to an existing sawmill and sell our load. With that capital outlay we would begin to construct our own sawmill.\n\nI got up before dawn and drove back to the lake and launched the boat just as sunrise broke. I found the first log and dove back into the water not taking into account how chilly the water would be that early in the morning. I forced myself to complete latching up the log and got it ashore. I then scurried to my truck and turned it on and allowed the heater to combat the early signs of hypothermia. Clearly, there were still some lessons to be learned in harvesting the logs. Then I remembered my scuba gear on board and luckily the neoprene wetsuit still fitted me. It would be able to take the edge of the chilly water until I was warmed by the truck heater or the sun.\n\nBy the time Robert and Gayle arrived with the truck an additional ten logs had joined our trove. I backed the truck up and attached the tongs and chains that would assist the arch in winching the timbers up on the truck. It was arduous and inefficient, but it was the cheapest way to load until the scale of our business justified using a log crane. Since I was the only one with enough experience, Robert and Gayle watched my efforts.\n\nAs I finished chaining the last log, I overheard Robert asking Gayle if she still thought I was unnecessary to the operation. The silence was gratifying to me as Gayle continued to barely tolerate my presence. Finally, I had enough logs loaded for the first load. The remaining logs continued to sit in the shallow water awaiting their turn on the second load.\n\nI drove the logging truck to the sawmill we had planned to offload the logs and where our expected buyer was waiting. Gayle and Robert drove ahead of me as we approached the logyard. The trailer was weighed and inspected by the buyer who finally threw out a number that I was agreeable to. There was where I saw Gayle earn her keep. \n\nShe reminded the buyer what the present price was and how demand was continuing to outpace supply. Also, the present rate did not take into account the grade and size of logs that we had transported. The buyer was going to get double the board feet from our logs and therefore would have to pay accordingly. They continued to dicker back and forth until they reached a number that duly impressed me and Robert.\n\nArrangements were made to meet and inspect the second load I would deliver and the buyer would have a check waiting on us. I scrambled back eager to get the second load on the trailer and in the logyard. The vast difference in pay made me willing to accept Gayle as a necessary evil. I could only hope she would reach the same accommodation with me.",
        "I continued to get up every morning and take the boat out to start each work day. I made it a point to invest into a couple of items. The first was a Zippo lighter and the second was a chimenea. A chimenea is a portable ceramic fireplace that emits an incredible amount of heat. Before going out on the boat, I would start a fire in the chimenea and go find and winch in the first log of the day. Then I would take a break from the shivering cold until I was warm enough to go out again. \n\nUsually by midmorning the sun would warm the water enough that I could skip huddling around the chimena. As I thought would happen Gayle scoffed at my need for my breaks, ascribing them to general laziness more than anything else. I responded that for a woman that wore nothing more than Texas A & M tee shirts she certainly had a lot of opinions that nobody gave a damn about.\n\nThe remark had her gulping air like crazy and tears fell as she ran towards Robert's car and left Robert stranded with me for the day. I told Robert that I didn't think it was that good an insult as we went to collect another log. \n\nBy now, the sawmill was up and running and Gayle and Robert had hired a couple of guys to run the sawmill. Even though it was unspoken I knew Gayle was pushing Robert to end our partnership and hire a boat crew to operate the boat. To his credit Robert refused to listen to Gayle.\n\nNow about the only time I saw Gayle was when the three of us would go on a boat run to scout out a new area. I don't know how she did it, but, through her research Gayle would always have us on a new trove of logs to harvest. Now her new complaint was my sloth was causing delays in getting logs to the mill. Robert pointed out that I generally kept ahead of the sawmill crew and I had a small surplus of logs built up for the sawmill crew to attend to.\n\nThank God for that because when I took off for Saturday's visitation I thought she was going to come unglued. How dare I waste a day! I pointed out that the sawmill crew didn't work on the weekends so I would not hamper the operation by taking a personal day.\n\nSo I spent another sad lonely hour alternating looking from the door to the clock waiting for a visit that wasn't going to happen. Robert had suggested that I continue to insist the kids attend the visitation. I pointed out that any manifestation to show my love by insisting on doing something they both resented would only cause more problems. No, I wanted them to be there voluntarily.\n\nIf Gayle had bothered to notice after I got back from wasting a half day Saturday, I unloaded a log haul late that afternoon and three hauls for Sunday. The work continued to be a salve for my heartache as I wondered about Steven and Carol. Oddly, I felt an amazing lack of concern for Stella. She had so treacherously destroyed our marriage I knew there would be no rebound there.\n\nAs Fall approached, Gayle's efforts to undermine me escalated. The increasing cold continued to hamper my efforts to collect logs. I had to take longer and longer breaks to warm up sufficiently to continue to dive on the logs. That translated to fewer hauls of my timber and more hauls of pine and oak logs that Robert contracted with other logging outfits for the sawmill operation. Gayle argued that justified terminating the partnership.\n\nI felt a strange comparison on Stella's and now Gayle's efforts to denigrate me. Obviously, from my perspective I didn't see anything that justified their actions, but, still in the back of my head I kept wondering what I had done to set them off.\n\nI spent another lonely Saturday with an unanswered prayer. As I drove home I asked God if I would ever be complete again? I didn't hear an answer.\n\nAnother couple of weeks passed and my results continued to deteriorate. I drove to Robert's and suggested to him that maybe it was time to stop diving until Spring. I could see the victory smile on Gayle as the results continued to fall in her favor.\n\nThen she threw a total mindfuck. She wanted to go out tomorrow on the boat to scout locations on the Red River. We had held off on going on the Red River due to our success in the tributaries. Robert reminded her that he had a prior commitment in Houston to attend to so he couldn't make it. I could see the debate waging on Gayle's face as she tried to decide whether she could tolerate being alone with me on the pontoon boat. She finally announced that she still wanted to go out.\n\nThat morning I went to pick her up and she hurried past me in her maroon Texas A & M sweatshirt and jeans and got in my truck. Robert was getting ready to leave himself and jokingly told me not to kill her. I just drew a deep breath and went to my truck.\n\nAll day long we spent going to various places on the river. The only time we would converse would be when she directed me to another location or when I told her I located a log by my bamboo pole. Through my experience I could distinguish when I located timber. Then she would transfix the location into her portable GPS. I took note of several disturbing facts, the main ones being the depth of the river and the rapid current. I had to throw down an additional anchor line to keep the boat from drifting as we searched for timbers. \n\nCoupled by the tons of silt speeding through it would make diving an especially haphazard task in the murky water. Lord knows what other obstacles I would bump into down there. Anchor lines would be needed to tether to so the current wouldn't sweep me down river. Which meant scuba gear so I could stay down long enough to fashion the winch lines around the logs. This was going to be an extremely dangerous proposition, I would need to take a refresher scuba course and update my gear. I would also need a dive partner since it had been drummed into me so long ago not to dive alone. As I continued to watch Gayle enter data into her GPS I thought about mentioning that to Gayle. \n\nThen I had an epiphany. Gayle never intended me to dive on timbers we were scouting on. By next Spring she would have Robert convinced why I had outlived my usefulness and the need to hire lesser paid employees that would take the place of an expensive partner. The new crew would start on the treasure I had helped her locate to assure my termination.\n\nThe bitterness blinded me and I turned away from her and went back to the boat cockpit not daring to look at her plot my betrayal. The late afternoon sun was fading into evening on what would be a glamorous sunset on the river. I continued to pretend to do a chore that didn't require me to look at her.\n\nI heard an unfamiliar short yelp and a loud splash. I turned around to look at the bow of the boat and to my puzzlement I couldn't locate Gayle. I heard a cry by the same time I spotted an object speeding down river. \n\nGayle was desperately trying to swim upriver to the boat as the river powered her downstream. By the time she started to scream I was already running up the length of the boat. By the time I dove into the water she was 50 yards downstream and sunk out of sight from an undertow. \n\nEven as I cringed from the numbing cold of the water I knew I made the right decision to dive in after her. If Gayle had the presence of mind she wouldn't have fought so hard to swim upstream, but, instead used her efforts to swim downstream to the bank where she could have waded out of the water. Instead she was panicking like most people would and sought to return to a safe haven.\n\nI couldn't have gotten the anchors up in time and start the boat to catch up to her. It was essential that I kept her in sight as best I could. I started swimming as fast as I could downstream. I heard her yell again which meant the undertow had released her and she had made her way to the surface.\n\nI didn't see but I knew she was trying desperately to get to me. The problem was she was quickly tiring and eventually she would go into an undertow that she would not be able to power her way back to the surface or she would collide with a snag and be injured and not be able to save herself. I had to get to her as quickly as I could. I reached the area of the undertow that sucked her under and felt it try to draw me to doom.\n\nThe difference being that I was speeding along on purpose allowed me to quickly draw away from its grasp. Slowly, ever so slowly, I gained ground as her voice weakened. Still I knifed through the water to catch up to her.\n\nI was in midstroke when an unidentified snag rammed into my torso. It caused me to gasp from the pain and I sucked in the muddy river water and sputtered it back out as best I could. I had to ignore the pain as I continued to stroke toward Gayle.\n\nThirty feet, twenty feet, she disappeared again and thankfully came back up. Fifteen feet, ten, five. I saw that last remaining looks of desperation on her face before she submitted to the will of Nature. Three, two, one. Her arms blindly flailed to me and her hands snatched away to grasp me. \n\nNow I would have to tend to a new danger of Gayle unwittingly clinching to me and riding us both to our deaths. I waited for the right moment and reached out and jerked her hair. I was using the hand on my injured side so the extra effort shot pain throughout my body , but, I continued to hold on. Luckily the pain I was causing Gayle was making her grab my arm to alleviate tugging on her hair.\n\nAs long as she continued to do that we had a chance. As I slowly guided us closer to the bank I had the incongruous thought that finally I was touching the red flames of those auburn tresses. I quickly dispelled that notion as we approached near a large sandbar. I continued to fight to get us away from the sway of the river.\n\nThen my knee bumped into sand. I started to scramble upright. When I let go of Gayle, she panicked again and tried to grab me before she realized land was underfoot. We both crawled up the sandbar, crying, gasping for breath, shivering from the cold. Collapsing into the wet sand to try to recover.\n\nI felt the hard muscle spasms and the numbing of my fingers and toes. I crawled up the bank ignoring the pleas of Gayle. I grabbed as much of the dry brittle pinestraws and oak leaves as I could from the peninsula of the sandbar. I stumbled back to Gayle and shielding it away from the wind as best I could, I dug out my Zippo lighter to desperately try to summon the strength and dexterity to light a fire.\n\nThe onset of hypothermia was evident in both of us. Unless I could quickly provide warmth, our metabolism would shut down and we would both die on that miserable little sandbar. I prayed hard as my thumb caused the rotation of the wheel of the lighter. Would it ignite? Had the immersion contaminated the lighter fluid? Would this be my final act of desperation?\n\nWould I ever see my children again?\n\nThe wheel of the old metal encased lighter turned like the wheel of Fate determining our fortune. I watched as the first sparks flew about and then the weak flame appeared in the October night. I sobbed as I held it to the dry tender willing it catch fire. Slowly the flame crept among the leaves growing stronger and brighter. I fed more leaves for the flame to consume as it built and started to smoke.\n\nI willed myself to leave and scramble for another load of precious straws and leaves. Then another and another. I told Gayle to strip out of her wet clothes as I made another run to the bank. Now I picked up small dried twigs to feed to the fire. When I returned to throw them on the fire I noticed Gayle had not complied with my order.\n\nAgain I told her to undress as I went back for another armload of leaves to persuade the fire to escalate to the ignition point of the wood I had placed on it. As I dumped the leaves on the fire and it smoldered momentarily. I angrily shook her and told her to get out of her fucking wet clothes before she died.\n\nThat snapped her awake and once again I saw the animosity light in her eyes. Good, the hate will keep you alive, I thought. I went to grab bigger branches as Gayle stood to her knees and began to strip out of the cold, heavy, wet sodden sweatshirt. \n\nI wished I had the opportunity to relish that sight, but, I remained busy alternating carrying woods and leaves to the fire. I noticed she had turned away from me as she fumbled for the snap of her jeans. Still the sight of her bareback was enticing as she struggled out of the legs of the jeans. \n\nBy the next trip, her bra and panties had amassed on the pile of clothes and she huddled modestly before the fire as the warmth returned to her. I now had enough of a stockpile that I warranted it was safe for me to undress. \n\nIgnoring propriety I shivered as I stripped naked before Gayle. Did she sneak a peek at me? I didn't notice and I didn't care. We were two islands of shivering humanity huddled around a campfire gaining warmth as though we were Neanderthals in the Ice Age. As our bodies slowly came back from the brink of death I noticed Gayle began to quietly cry. I tried to ignore her vulnerability and allow her the fiction of privacy as the implication of our escape became more pronounced.\n\nHer quiet sobs turned into weeping and soon escalated into full scale hysteria. I couldn't standby anymore. I went to her and sat by her and forced her to accept my hug. I continued to hold her as she wailed into the frosty night. There was not an iota of sexuality in my gesture. \n\nWe were just two primitive beings stripped of the veneer of civilization trying to cope in a harsh unfeeling world. She buried her head against me and I caressed her just to connect to her. Just to let her know I was there to comfort her. She continued to accept me as the flame continued to warm us. Her crying convulsions ebbed and still she remained in my arms.\n\nThen she looked at me and quietly said, \"Thank you.\"\n\nAnd with that, the magic spell was broken, and we became uncomfortable in our nakedness as I went back to my initial spot of neutrality. We both continued to stare into the fire from our respective positions. I broke the silence to tell her I would get some wood to put her clothes out to dry. As I got up she averted her gaze away. \n\nWhen I returned with some suitable wood, I dumped it close to her and announced I was going farther into the bank for more wood. She recognized this as my effort to tell her I wouldn't invade on her privacy as she prepared her clothes. I waited as long as I could stand being away from the fire and then I returned. \n\nTo my surprise she had also lined out my clothes to dry as well. I quietly thanked her as again we averted away from each other. It must have looked comical from anyone else's perspective. Here we were, grown adults, away from all the world, sharing a life or death experience and we both couldn't overcome the awkwardness of simply looking at each other. It was though we both mutually agreed that we did not have permission to do so.\n\nSo we waited as our clothes dried. Both of us would experimentally test our clothes for dryness by reaching out and touching them. As the garments finally dried, we would turn away from each other and quickly dress. At long last, the heavier garments, the jeans and sweatshirts dried sufficiently to put on. Once we were both finally dressed it was time for our discussion.\n\n\"Gayle, we have to decide what we are going to do. Here are the obvious facts; we are stranded on the bank of the river, no one knows our predicament, we have no way to summon help since both our phones are fried from our swim. The only person that would miss us is your grandfather and he wont be back home till tomorrow.\n\nOur options are; we remain on the bank and hope a boat rescues us, or, Robert returns and initiates a search for us when he misses us.\" I paused and continued, \"Or I could leave you here with enough firewood, walk through the woods back upstream and get the boat and come down and get you. What would you like me to do, Gayle?\"\n\nWithout hesitation she stated she wanted to get back home as quickly as possible. I had expected that answer. Everyone would have answered the same way without thinking of the implications and consequences of that action.\n\nI would have to navigate the bank of the river upstream without light, shod only in tennis shoes among the sharp and knobby roots waiting to trip me. Into the unforseen briars and brush waiting to trap me. I would have to stumble into the chill of the October night and grope forward until I came to our boat and face one last test. I would have to voluntarily dive back in that frigid water and climb back into the boat, start it up, and in the cold chill air pilot the boat down to the sandbar to rescue Gayle.\n\nI went into the woods a last time to gather firewood, quick burning pine and longer sustaining oak to tide Gayle over. I told Gayle that if for whatever reason I did not come back to stay with the fire and keep it burning. When it became daylight, chances were a boat would appear that she could hail to her rescue. I told her I would follow the contours of the bank, so, I should remain in earshot of any potential rescuers.\n\nAs I began to leave, Gayle threw herself at me in an impulsive hug. God, I wanted to stay there locked into her arms, but, I had made a promise and I had to fulfill it. I walked away from her and quickly was in uncharted territory as my eyes tried to adjust to the night. I walked with arms outstretched before me to warn me of any peril. I shuffled my feet slowly among all the brush and brambles scratching me.\n\nOften I would reach an impasse of impregnable brush and have to navigate around it to return to my course. Often I would fall, each time racking my ribs in pain from my colliding with the unknown object in the river. I could tell in the dim moonlight where the river ran below me, inviting me once again to fall into its trap. I lost all sense of time as my journey continued shivering in the cold. How had we traveled so far in the rapid current of the river? A mile? Five miles? More? I began to despair from not finding the boat. I knew every second there was Gayle worried alone in the woods and that gave me fresh incentive to continue.\n\nI rounded a rise in the bank and there it finally was. A dark silhouette silently bobbing in the river. I mentally began to prepare myself for that God awful cold I would have to endure again as I walked to the final steps upstream that would ensure that I would drift to the boat.\n\nSummoning up the last vestige of my courage before I once and finally came to my senses; I jumped into the river for the second time voluntarily that evening. The bone chilling cold again introduced itself to my body. Suffering from another relapse I could sense my body quickly shutting down.\n\nI would not have near the time as I had initially to respond. As the cold cramped my fingers I reached and grasped the boat ladder at the starboard side of the pontoon. Somehow I managed to climb aboard and hurried to start the engine. The trustworthy Mercury outboard fired up as I jumped to the toolbox and groped for the flashlight and knife that were among the items stored. Turning the light on I went to each anchor line and quickly cut through them and suddenly we were adrift.\n\nI ran to the cockpit and moved the throttle forward for maximum speed as I turned on the navigational lights and entered the main channel assured I would not run aground or into any unseen hazard. \n\nI felt the encroaching freeze working against me as the wind chill kept lowering my body temperature dangerously close to the point of no return. I squinted peering in the dark looking for signs of the campfire. There! That orange pinprick! Could it be?\n\nI saw the form of a human dancing trying to wave me down. I shut off the throttle and killed the engine and allowed the momentum of the boat to wedge to a stop on the sandbar. The welcoming cheers from Gayle suddenly stopped as she saw my condition. It finally dawned on her what I had undergone and she rushed to assist me to get me close to the fire.",
        "She threw every bit of wood on the fire and the conflagration lit up a wide berth around the sandbar. Then she undressed me and cursed me at the same time as she cried seeing the scratches and bruises all over my body. I went into the fetal position around the fire and mercifully I passed out still hearing her cuss me for being a fool.\n\nWhen I came back to the world I was still in the fetal position, the fire was still roaring, a new stockpile of wood was on hand and once again my clothes were being dried from the heat of the fire and Gayle was behind me forming her body against my back to provide body heat. I groggily asked her how long I was out and she replied it wasn't important. I just needed to rest and remain warm.\n\nSo we remained on the ground in that position and of all the positions I had fantasized myself with Gayle since I first met her, this was one I hadn't figured on. She began apologizing profusely to me. Had she only thought about what I had to do she would've never asked me to do it. I told her to shut up, no one forced a gun to my head to do it.\n\nWe remained in that position until I saw my clothes steaming and smoldering from the heat. Gayle quickly got up and readjusted the clothes to complete drying and then went back to her former position. I began to think I could learn to enjoy this position.\n\nIn time she got up and said my clothes were dry and then it was her turn to walk into the woods and allow me to dress alone.\n\nI started up the boat and at that signal she reappeared into view. Even though there was a large barrier of sand from any flammable material I order Gayle to help me douse the fire with sand. I felt a little sad as the last dying ember disappeared from sight from the life sustaining fire that had been there.\n\nAs I threw the boat into reverse and turned on the navigation lights again, Gayle walked in front of me and half sat; half stood at the captain's chair at the cockpit. I recognized that we would continue to share body heat as we made our way to the marina we had launched at early that morning. When she got cold from shielding me Gayle would retreat behind me until she was ready to return to the front.\n\nThe marina appeared across the river and I crossed the channel and entered its harbor. I was in no shape to load the boat unto the trailer and transport it out. I found an unoccupied slip and I tied the boat off and killed the engine. The marina was deserted at the late hour. If anyone took offense they could call the Coast Guard to run the registration number and contact Robert, who in turn would contact me. We limped to my truck and I turned it on and immediately turned on the heat to full.\n\nAs it permeated through the cab I saw a large smile of gratitude on Gayle's face as we began the final miles to her house. We still hadn't spoken much since the marina and I started getting drowsy from the heat. I asked her to start talking to keep me awake. Then I just listened to that soft melodious voice for the first time absent the acrid acerbic venom I was used to. The miles for once passed by too quickly as we arrived at her house.\n\nI had mixed emotions as I stopped in her drive. Happiness that I had got her home after such a harrowing experience. Sadness that she was leaving me and probably tomorrow our temporary truce would be null and we would be back in our private little cold war. Anxiety for thinking I had another twenty minutes on the road before I collapsed in my trailer. Chances were good I would fall asleep behind the wheel.\n\nShe got out and I thought she was going to bid me goodnight. Instead she looked at me and said, \"Don't even think you are going anywhere.\" She turned around to the house and I meekly obeyed her and got out of the truck to follow her to the house. Once inside, she commanded me to build a fire in their fireplace. \"I know you can do that. I've seen you in action.\" She walked into the kitchen and I heard clattering going on as I prepared to light the fire.\n\nI tried to use my Zippo lighter, but, it failed to ignite. I reflected on what a whim our lives were balanced as I struck on one of the long stemmed matches Robert used to set the fire. In a matter of minutes, the flames merrily licked up to start feeding on the seasoned oak that Robert had in his tinderbox that I used in the fireplace.\n\nGayle came out with two oversized ceramic mugs steaming away. \"I'm afraid I can only offer you chicken noodle soup out of the can nuked. Next time I promise you it will be homemade\" she explained as put the mugs down on the coffee table and went to the closet in the hallway and got out some thick woolen blankets\n\nShe told me to sit down on the sofa. I looked at my dirty, bloody, sand gritted clothes and hesitated. \"Oh for God sakes, John, it's just a couch, I'll get it cleaned!\" Again, I obeyed as I realized for the first time she used my name and she wrapped a blanket around me and handed me one of the mugs. Then she wrapped herself in the other blanket and slowly sipped on her mug of soup. \n\nShe used the remote to kill the lights and so we sat together side by side, staring into the fire in the darkened den sipping away at our soup. I placed my empty mug back on the coffee table and she did, likewise. \n\nWe continued to stare into the fire and I became mesmerized by the ocean of shifting hues of orange as the embers of the logs heated and cooled at various points. It reminded me of Gayle's hair. Atop the yellow flames continued to burn into the logs. Gayle shifted and placed her head against my shoulder. We remained like that for a long time when she finally spoke.\n\nIn a soft timid voice she began, still looking straight into the fire, \"I'm going to tell you a story. I don't want you to interrupt. I don't want you to stop me. I don't want you to say anything until I've finished.\"\n\nShe continued, \"About two months before I graduated I met this guy from school and started dating him. He looked a lot like you; tall, brown hair, cute smile, green eyes...I was getting real attached to him, but, I still wanted to make sure he was the one. So, I kept stalling him whenever he started talking about taking it to the next level. He made the noise of saying he understood, but, still he kept pushing and pushing at me.\"\n\nGayle paused and moved her hand to my blanket covered bicep for support before she continued. \"Graduation day, we celebrated by going out that evening to an expensive restaurant. I excused myself to go to the restroom. When I got back to the table an expensive bottle of wine was uncorked. Only the best was good enough for me, he said! He raised his wine flute and gave me a toast, 'To us' he declared, 'may we always be happy!' I finished off my wine flute and returned his dazzling smile and relished what my future would hold.\n\nSix hours later I was being transported to the hospital by ambulance. My roommates had made it home and found me sprawled on the livingroom floor. My dress had been ripped to expose my breasts which were covered with bruises and bite marks. When my bra was broken, it caused a large friction burn on my ribcage. My dress had been rolled up and my panties had been unceremoniously dumped on top of my head. My roommates could tell I had sex from the fluids leaking from me. \n\nWhen they couldn't wake me, they called 911. The police arrived about the same time the ambulance did. When I got to the hospital they ordered a toxicology screen and determined I was under the influence of Rohypnol, the date rape drug.\"\n\nI was shocked by Gayle's revelation as she continued to dredge up the trauma.\n\n\"They also performed a rape kit exam which concluded that I had indeed had sex and DNA was extracted from the sperm collected from my vagina.\n\nBecause there was no way to tell whether I had been infected with anything I was prescribed an entire plethora of prescription medications to make sure I was okay. In fact, I'm still required to take some pills and go in for checkups.\n\nThe detective that investigated my case kept asking for the perpetrator's name. He knew I was shielding him. Apparently, it isn't that unusual for a woman to run and hide and pretend it didn't happen or that it was their fault it happened. The detective told me if I changed my mind and decided to cooperate to give him a call.\n\nI went home and for the first day I wore my brand of shame. My maroon Texas A & M shirt would serve as my scarlet letter. A remembrance of my connection with my rapist. Each day, I would die a little more and wear my shame for the world to see. But you understand...they couldn't see... all they saw was a woman with a shirt with a college logo. So it also served as my shield. My shield from the revelation that I had been treated as a piece of meat and thrown away.\"\n\nI wanted her to stop. I wanted her to not experience the horror again as she continued to lance deeper into her wounded psyche drawing out the emotional pus.\n\nHer hand was now painfully clenching my bicep as I allowed her to continue. \"I withdrew from my friends, one by one...as they all argued for me to go to counseling...or tell the police...or this...or that! I still managed to draw deeper into my hell... each day wearing that damn brand...each day hating myself.\n\nI decided I would continue to retreat. I called my grandfather and asked if I could stay with him. Of course he said yes and so I came down and I could forget a little bit of my shame as I enjoyed the beauty of the land. He showed me again the Red River and the kernel of my idea drew back from a long ago lecture in history and I began doing some research and I thought that by committing to this project I could abate the shame a little more.\n\nThen my grandfather suggested to have you included. I knew we would need help to pull this off so I was okay with meeting you...until I saw who you reminded me of...and then I was not. Each day I had to endure the daily torture of wearing that logo and seeing you. Each day I kept trying to find a way to make you irrelevant and unneeded, so you would go away and not bother me anymore...\"\n\nHer voice rose in pitch as she concluded her statement, \"I suppose I would still be looking for a way to get rid of you if I hadn't tripped over my own damn foot and fell overboard!\"\n\nShe started to cry again recalling the experience, \"Oh God, I was so afraid and alone and cold...that numbing cold as I tried to swim back to the boat and saw you diving in. Then something drug me under the water and then I was back on the surface gulping air and trying to get to you...but it felt like I was getting away from you. \n\nEverything was a blur as you grabbed my hair. I wanted to grab on to you so you would save me, but, the pain made me grab your hand so you would release my hair. Then you pushed me onto the sandbar and now the chilly air paralyzed me. All I could do was watch as you built the fire and warmth slowly returned to me.\n\nThen you ordered me out of my clothes and I had another flashback and I wasn't going to obey you. Then you yelled at me and I knew if I didn't take off my clothes, you would rip them off me...and then rape me...and I knew I had no choice...so I sat there paralyzed... waiting for you to dominate and abuse me...then I sat huddling as you approached and began stripping...and then you sat down and finally began to warm yourself.\n\nEach second gave me new hope that I would be okay and then I had a moment of serendipity when I realized you were you and not my monster from the past. I started to feel ashamed of everything I projected on you and I started crying and you came over to me naked. You sat right next to me and cradled me in your arms and I felt protected. \n\nAn hour before our mishap if you had touched me I would have screamed at you. Now we were both naked and I felt safe in your arms and I wonder why it took me this long to realize my mistake!\"\n\nOnce again, Gayle had devolved into full blown weeping and I managed to get my arm out of the blanket and around her and I tried to comfort her and held her silently as the fire continued to die out.\n\nWhen I woke up I felt her stirring awake as well and we both saw the sight of an unbelieving Robert looking down at us.\n\n\"I wouldn't believe this if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes! Can someone tell me what the hell our boat is doing in the marina? And why wouldn't either of you answer your phones?\"\n\nGayle and I untangled and painfully stood up. Gayle looked at me expectantly. I knew what she was asking.\n\n\"You have to tell him. I'm going to go get our boat and I'll come right back and then we will decide what to do.\"\n\nAs I left, Gayle and Robert were walking to the kitchen table to tell him all the secrets. I managed to placate the irate owner of the marina with an apology and a $100 dollar donation which included the staff loading the boat onto my trailer for me.\n\nWhen I got back to Robert's, he was still sitting at the kitchen table, pale and trying to digest the events. I asked where Gayle was and he told me she was taking a shower. We started discussing things from our perspective when Gayle appeared before us.\n\n\"NO!\" I shouted, \"You are through paying a penance you don't owe! Get upstairs and put anything else on but that!\"\n\nGayle was shocked at my reaction seeing her still donning her college logo, still wearing her badge of shame. As far as I was concerned that was over. She came down hesitantly wearing a flowery blouse that complimented her. I reacted by opening my arms and she smiled and rushed to hug me. Damn, my ribs still hurts!\n\nThen she looked at Robert and he invited her into his arms and he hugged her for a long time. Then he insisted on taking us to the hospital to be checked over. It turned out my ribs were severely bruised and were wrapped tight to mend. Various cuts were cleaned and prescriptions ranging from antiseptics to painkillers were prescribed. Luckily, other than suffering from exposure, Gayle had no residual physical injuries.\n\nWe made plans to drive to College Station the next day. Gayle went into the police station escorted by us and gave a complete statement to the assigned detective naming the culprit. Then we met with Gayle's roommates and they heard the story in its entirety. They all rushed to show the love and affection they had for their friend. I was hugged as well and I knew that I would have to take a few extra painkillers to compensate for the emotions these women showed in their hugs.\n\nGayle asked if her friends could get her the name of a therapist that lived close to her grandfather. Ten phones appeared simultaneously to find her that information. Since Robert had to drive us, I was allowed the front passenger seat for my comfort. Gayle continued to huddle over me and asked how I was doing on the drive.\n\nWhen we got back to Robert's house she insisted that I stay in the spare guest room. I had no business staying in that small trailer with no one to look after me, she said. I couldn't wait for her to say something like that in front of my grandmother.\n\nNaturally, they got along great when they met for the first time. Gayle offered to drive me to the visitation since I was still on the painkillers and had no business behind the wheel. It was a welcome change of pace to have someone to talk to on the drive and for that awful hour of anticipation.\n\nBy November I was off the painkillers, but, Gayle still wanted to come with me. So again, she served as a welcomed distraction to my anguish. In December after the fruitless visit, she helped load up the gifts back into my truck. I had purchased the items on the off chance they would appear. Gayle suggested taking the gifts to a charity to be distributed to a needy family.\n\nThings were rolling along for Gayle. Her rapist had been arrested and a warrant was served forcing him to provide his DNA. It was an exact match. Another warrant was served to search his phone. He had videotaped the entire disgusting act on his phone. He and his attorney had decided that rather than stall they would ask for a quick trial. The reason being that given Gayle initial reluctance to cooperate, she would be more likely to fold from testifying now rather than having a year to prepare.\n\nShe calmly appeared on the witness stand and described in detail the horror she underwent. The jury came back in less than an hour and gave him the maximum sentence on every charge. The bailiff told me that they would have been back quicker, but, they were trying to find a way to give him even more time than allowed.\n\nThings moved at a comfortable pace with our relationship. I was asked to participate in some of Gayle's sessions and I made it be known that I would do whatever I needed to do to help Gayle. The therapist assured me that Gayle was already aware of that. \n\nSo the months passed until we were in late Spring and Gayle and I were back on the Red River recovering the data we had originally lost. I insisted that she wore a life jacket the entire trip. She wouldn't tell me what were in the large boxes in the stern that Robert had loaded on the boat.\n\nAs we approached that fateful spot where she fell in back in October she told me she changed her mind and wanted to go to our sandbar. I complied and we landed there and she hopped off and asked me if I would build her a fire. I went and got some old wood and took out my refurbished Zippo lighter and soon had a fire going on the exact spot as before.\n\nThen she asked that I start unloading the items in the boxes. First, I took out a tent. So I went and constructed it where we had huddled together. Then there was an air mattress with an electrical blower. So I had it plugged up on a power converter on the boat and soon it was filled with air. I placed it inside the tent along with the sleeping bag for two.\n\nThe food fare was atypical campfire food. Hot dogs and marshmallows and sodas and bottled water. And a bottle of champagne chilling in the ice cooler. We sat by each other enjoying the simple pleasure of our outing as we talked and interacted with a familiarity that had been alien to both of us the previous Fall.\n\nI reached over and gently moved my hand through her gorgeous auburn curls. She reminded me that I had been a lot rougher with her the first time I did that on the sandbar. I told her I was sorry and asked how I could make it up to her. She told me I could kiss her. \n\nI leaned in and softly kissed her. As I slowly broke away from the kiss, she commanded another one and another...and another. Our hands began to explore each other's body and I enjoyed the sensation of hearing her coo from my caresses.\n\nWhen she was ready, she stripped off her T shirt and I saw her full bosom jiggling as she threw the shirt aside in the approximate area where the clothes had dried. That led to a cascade of clothes being shed and thrown in a mutual pile.\n\nAcknowledging a practical desire for comfort I spread the oversized picnic blanket over the sand and laid beside the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. Her flawless alabaster skin, her deep blue eyes like sapphires, those luscious full lips begging to be kissed. Hell, her entire body deserved to be kissed. And I proceeded to do so from the top of her head all the way down to her toes.\n\nOf course, some areas got more attention than others. But, I figured after forty or fifty years it would all even out. Now, there was a particular area I intended to mine for treasure and I soon directed all my attention there. The sighs, gasps, and moans were rewards enough as my tongue continued to probe. Each lick brought on a plea for another which I would eagerly comply with until I felt her shuddering into a climax.\n\nKissing all around I advanced up until I was looking directly into her eyes as I kissed her. I felt her grope down and soon she had my erect tool and placed it exactly where she wanted it. Her legs were splayed open to accommodate me. Not wanting to discomfort her I moved her atop me and Lordy, she took to riding cowboy in style.",
        "She rocked me to a quick orgasm and collapsed on my chest purring her pleasure. We fell asleep like that. I was awakened in the middle of the night looking at a sea of stars in the moonless night. Gayle was quietly riding me again in the dark and I could sense her body outline as it blocked out the view of the stars.\n\nI rolled her to the side and we continued to fuck side by side. I nuzzled against her head and whispered at her to look at the stars as we rocked once again to completion. And once again we drifted into the tranquility of the night. \n\nEarly in the dawn I woke and saw a heavy fog blanketing us in a sea of light grey clouds. I looked at my lover peacefully slumbering and I lightly kissed her. A faint smile appeared on her face as she went through a series of motions before she finally opened her eyes and a bigger smile appeared as she kissed me again. \n\nWe were soon making love again. This time I was sitting on the sand and Gayle was sprawled in my lap as we quietly rocked away. Another blanket covered us as we became lost into our rhythm. When her soft gasp signaled her climax she bathed me in kisses of appreciation.\n\nShe got up and spread her arms apart holding onto the blanket as though she was an earth mother displaying all her finery for the world to see. The world consisting only of me as we were still encapsulated in our small world of grey. I watched her walk to the edge of the sand bar to the safe eddy of water beside the bank. She carefully waded into the water and continued to acclimate to it sinking more of her body into the still water. \n\nI had gotten out the iron skillet and placed it on the fire I had prompted again. Rashers of bacon were soon ready as I collected them out of the skillet and substituted eggs to be cooked. She must have sensed the food was ready because she slowly walked out of the water to me and suddenly my hunger was for something else as I watched a goddess of nature approach me.\n\nShe touched my cheek and promised me she would sate me. But first, we would eat. She fulfilled her promise and afterwards we walked hand in hand into the water and gently bathed each other.\n\nBy mutual consent we began dressing as the fog began to burn off leaving us in warm glowing sunlight. I packed up everything including the tent and air mattress and sleeping bag that we never got to use. Well, that would serve as an excuse for another trip I thought as we motored back to our launch ramp.\n\nThings progressed along nicely until I started getting unsolicited messages from Stella, my ex wife. As I said at the beginning I was adamant not to put myself in a position where she had any power over me so I ignored everything. Finally, I got a call from my divorce attorney saying that Stella wanted to see me about a proposition. He assured me that meeting her in his office would not violate any court order in effect.\n\nI asked Gayle what she thought and she said I might as well find out what it was Stella wanted to talk about. So that is why I found myself in my lawyer's conference room when the door opened and Stella walked into the room.\n\nThe last few years had not been kind to her. I heard after her marriage, Ted had impregnated her with twins. I guess tending to four children was a little too much for Stella from the extra weight on her frame, bags around her eyes, frown lines on her face.\n\nStella sat down and asked me how I was doing? I decided, FUCK THIS! I wasn't going to idly chitchat with her.\n\n\"What the fuck do you want Stella?\" I coldly stared at her.\n\nShe was thrown off balanced and started stammering why she was there. I couldn't make any sense from her and told her to stop talking in her native tongue of bitch and start speaking English or I would leave.\n\nShe closed her eyes and said, \"How would you like to have the children?\"\n\n\"Ok, Stella, what is the catch?\" I asked warily.\n\n\"There is no catch, John. If you want to have the children I will have custody awarded to you and I will have visitation.\"\n\n\"Alright Stella\" I responded, \"you better explain to me why you are doing this at this stage of the game.\"\n\nShe snapped back, \"Look, do you want the children or not?\"\n\n\"Listen bitch, before I decide to do this you are going to answer some questions. First, I don't care why you divorced me, but, why did you go nuclear on me telling all those lies about hurting you and the kids?\"\n\nShe sighed, \"That day you almost caught us embarrassed Ted. All he could think about was you telling the whole city how he ran off from you. He decided that to take me and the children away from you would be your just desserts. Then it wasn't good enough, Ted wanted more revenge, so I placed that call to have you meet me when you got arrested. That placated him for a little while. Then he decided to turn the children against you by buying them everything under the sun and grant all their wishes. Presto, Ted had an instant family and you were left with nothing.\"\n\n\"Ok Stella, now the real reason why you want to give me custody.\"\n\nStella looked like she was going to cry.\n\n\"When I got pregnant with the twins, Ted shifted his affection from Carol and Steven to his kids. I kept begging him to continue to love them, but, he started seeing his raising your children was a form of cuckolding him. And he resented it.\"\n\nStella began sniffing and looked at the box of tissues near me. Fuck her, if she wanted a tissue she can get her whore's ass up and get one. I continued to wait.\n\n\"Steven and Carol both reacted badly to Ted's rejection. All they knew was they used to get everything and now their half brothers are being spoiled with Ted's time and money. Steven is running with a bad crowd and Carol is claiming she has a twenty two years old boyfriend. If you don't take them John they are going to be totally lost.\"\n\nI tried to imagine my fifteen years old son, Steven as a juvenile delinquent and then my thirteen years old daughter, Carol with an adult boyfriend. I thought back on the beautiful children they were. What the hell had happened to them?\n\nI knew the answer. They had served as a prize in the game of divorce and once Stella and Ted had won they had shifted their attention elsewhere confusing Steven and Carol. And the kids were lashing out for attention in a desperate attempt to find love.\n\n\"Stella, why now? You've kept them from me for five years, why the big change of heart?\"\n\nShe looked to the floor and said, \"I'm pregnant again.\"\n\nWell don't that beat all? For a bitch that complained about me wanting to keep her barefooted, pregnant and in the kitchen; she was doing a stellar job winding right back into that position.\n\nWhen I asked her when she wanted for the custody change to take effect, she continued to look away from me and said immediately. I knew right then she would never make a single visitation to see Steven or Carol. She was planning to abandon them just as she had abandoned me. I just felt utter disgust from this creature I couldn't even recognize anymore. I wanted to get away, take a shower, and then just spend the rest of the day in Gayle's arms.\n\nWe discussed the final logistics of changing the custody by mutual decree. When we finished we both stood up from the table. Stella hesitated as though she expected me to come over and hug her. When I didn't, she stuck her hand out for me to shake. I just continued to stare at her until she dropped her hand and walked out the door.\n\nThe mutual decree for changing custody sailed through the court without any problem. Nobody raised the issue that the alleged child abuser now had custody. The exchange took place at the site of my visitations. I watched two sullen kids enter the room with their suitcases packed with their belongings.\n\nI thought what a crime it had been to have stolen five years of seeing my children grow up. I went to hug them and neither seemed too enthusiastic over that. I realized that I would also have to overcome five years of constant denigration by Stella and Ted about me. This would not be cured overnight.\n\nAs I loaded up the vehicle with their luggage, Steven fished a cigarette out of a pack and lit it up. I reached out and snatched it out of his mouth and ground it under my foot. \"When you are an adult, you can smoke all you want, but, right now you are living under my rules.\" \n\nI made him give me the pack and I threw them away as he sneered at me. Then Carol said, \"I thought Mom was a bitch!\" Before she knew what was happening she found herself across my laps receiving licks. \n\n\"Get this straight, you two, you WILL respect your mother at all times in front of me!\"\n\nI allowed Carol to get up and the shock of having been disciplined for the first time in five years had stunned her. She and Steven meekly got in the truck wondering what was going to happen next. I told them that when we got home they would be meeting someone very special in my life. They didn't seem to be too impressed with that either.\n\nI kept trying to keep a running dialogue for the trip back. All I got was heavy silence or sarcasms. During one of the heavy silences, a phone rang and Carol answered it and put it on speaker phone. I quickly gathered this was the twenty two years old boyfriend as he kept talking vile comments and suggestions to Carol. \n\nShe got the phone a little too close to me and I snatched it and simply tossed it out the window. Carol turned around and saw it bounce three or four times before it was flattened by an 18 wheeler. She screamed at me that she would buy a new phone. I asked her with whose money and on whose plan? That shut her up.\n\nWe got to my grandparents and I could tell that the kids had trouble accepting the unconditional love from their great grandparents. Grandma kept reminding them of all the happy times the kids had visiting the farm as young children. Out of the blue, Carol smiled and said, \"The ducks!\" \n\nGrandma smiled back and said, \"That's right, the ducks, you kept calling them your babies and you had names for them all!\" Then she turned to my son, \"And you Steven, you would hop up to go fishing as soon as you got here till it was time to leave!\"\n\nSensing an opportunity I asked the kids if they would like to go on the pontoon boat tomorrow as I searched for timber. Plenty of opportunity to fish or watch for wild ducks I suggested. The sad reluctance on their faces as they both said no reminded me how this was going to be a long hard road. \n\nIt was starting to get late when Steven mentioned that it might be time to stow away his and Carol's belongings. \"Where is your trailer?\" he asked thinking that he and Carol would share the small ratty trailer together with me.\n\n\"I'm afraid, I'll have to disappoint you Steven. I bought the old Andrews place and I live in that house now. Gayle is there fixing up the rooms for y'all right now.\" I explained. \"Why don't we get started that way. Grandma and Grandpa are coming over for supper and you're also going to meet Gayle's grandfather, Robert Lambert, who is my business partner along with Gayle.\n\nAll I heard on the trip to my house were snide comments about \"this Gayle person\" as Steven mentioned her. I tried to ignore his rudeness. \"So, you boinking her?\" he sneered.\n\nI cut a glare at him as I continued to drive, \"You remember Carol's lesson earlier when she disrespected your mother? Are you trying for the same thing? Because if you are, I can accommodate you right here and now on the side of the road.\" I said coldly. \"Both of you better understand right now, Gayle is just as worthy of respect as your mother is and I will not tolerate any rudeness to her.\"\n\nThe large ranch came into view and Carol and Steven were stunned at the size of the house along with the adjoining acreage. They became excited seeing the horses roaming in the fields and the large swimming pool in the backyard. Then they remembered they were suppose to be cool, disaffected teenagers and became quiet again.\n\nNever had I seen a teenager so predisposed to utterly hate someone as Steven was as he stepped inside my house with his luggage. Never had I seen a quicker turnaround when Gayle walked into view beamed a smile at him and gave him a hug. \"Hi Steven, it is so nice to finally meet you!\" I thought he was going to melt as it dawned on me that he was lovestruck by Gayle instantaneously. Well, I couldn't fault him with that.\n\nGayle turned to Carol and gave her the same measure of love and attention. Then she led them to their rooms. Large spacious rooms, complete with computers, TV's, stereos and private baths. Both Steven and Carol mentioned the beautiful furniture and Gayle explained the wood was black walnut that we had dredged up in our business operation. An artisan had negotiated building the furniture in exchange for several logs for his own use.\n\nIt was then that the kids understood why we were doing our operation. It also gave them an understanding how I could afford this large house. Gayle had another surprise for Carol. Carol had always wanted a dog, but, Stella refused to ever consider it. On Carol's bed was a Labrador Retriever puppy with a red bow on it. As soon as Carol went into the room and saw the eager puppy trying to get to her she ran to it and scooped it up as the puppy began licking her face.\n\n\"Oh my God, what is her name?\" Carol excitedly asked.\n\n\"Well honey, it is your puppy so you get to name her.\" I explained. \n\nThat earned both me and Gayle a big hug as she excitedly talked to Steven about a name.She decided on Pepper after their consultation and Pepper showed her approval by furiously wagging her little tail and licking Carol's face. As Gayle and Carol discussed crate training the puppy, I called Steven outside to accompany me to the large shop building adjacent to the barn.\n\nAs I opened the large overhead door I told him that I hoped he would like it. Inside was a 1964 Ford Mustang in need of refurbishing. I told Steven that I hoped we could work together on bringing the car back to glory. He just stared there battling the duality of wanting to hate me and to love me. I just left him there to study his vehicle.\n\nWe all enjoyed the barbeque out in the backyard. Carol was listening to Grandpa explain how to make Pepper obey commands. Steven was hovering around Gayle listening closely to her every word and kept trying to impress her. Gayle knew what was going on and continued to show him polite deference instead of ridicule.\n\nWhen everyone left, and Gayle and I said an early goodnight to Carol and Steven as we went to our room it answered a lot of questions. I saw a hard grimace on Steven as we left the room. The next day, we spent enrolling them in their new school. That night, I started asking them questions about their day.\n\nThis was something they had forgotten that I used to do. I insisted on knowing what my kids learned every day and having been absent for five years was not going to be an excuse. Each night they would have to be prepared to let me know what was going on and we would discuss their lessons. I also told them that I already signed up in the Parents Teachers Association and would soon be meeting with all their teachers to see what I could do to ensure a quality education for both of them.\n\nAfter we ate, I asked Steven if he wanted to start working on his car. He quickly told me no. I had to chalk it up to his unrequited feelings for Gayle. I mentioned it to Gayle when we were in bed and she said she was working on a plan. I told her that I hoped it was a good one.\n\nTime marched on, I would cherish my little victories and agonize over my little defeats with my children. Then events occurred that finally shifted the balance. It was time to start baling hay from the fields to provide fodder for the livestock. I kept using a small baler that made rectangular bails weighing around 50 to 60 pounds instead of the large round bales which are in vogue around the country.\n\nThe problem was the bales would have to be stacked in the barn. That meant it would be necessary to stack the bales on my grandfather's flatbed trailer, transport them to the barn and offload them.\n\nI enlisted Steven to help me. He and I would load and unload the bales as my grandfather would drive the truck through the field to each bale. What I hadn't counted on was him raiding my stash of beer the night before and being hungover in the morning. When I saw his condition I just dragged him to the trailer and told my grandpa to start out into the field.\n\nI made him haul in the heavy scratchy bales despite all his protests in the heat of the day. He quickly became sick and threw up the remains of the beer he had drank. He insisted he couldn't do anymore. \n\nI threw him a bottle of water to hydrate and I violated one of my major maxims. \"So, you going to quit on me Steven? You going to quit on me, just like your mother quit on me?\" Without waiting for any answer, I hopped off the trailer and walked over and lugged the closest bale toward the trailer.\n\nOff in the distance, Steven was walking to another bale to collect. For the rest of the day he worked like a man possessed. He carried three bales to every one I did and when the last bale was in the barn, he turned to me; hot, perspiring, dusty and said, \"Fuck you!\" as he walked to the house to take a shower.\n\nThat evening, he continued to glare at me as we waited out in the backyard for Gayle to arrive so we could start grilling steaks. I was at a perilous brink with Steven and I couldn't think of anyway to survive the precipice we were perched on.\n\nGayle arrived carrying groceries and to my puzzlement a passenger was similarly laden with sacks. As they got closer I was amazed to see a younger version of Gayle! They stopped in front of Steven and Gayle said, \"Hi Steven, I want you to meet my niece, Betty. She and her family have just moved back here.\" Steven was transfixed as he looked at Betty and I knew the desire he once held for Gayle had just transferred to the lovely teenager.\n\n\"Hi Steven, could you help me carry these sacks?\" Before Betty could finish the question, Steven was on his feet to go to her and relieve her from her burden. As the three of them walked toward the house I could only shake my head at the miracle Gayle had produced.\n\nAll during the grill out, Steven and Betty ignored everything else and focused on each other. Steven asked her what she was doing next weekend. Betty mentioned that her father was having to bale hay next weekend and she would be busy with that. Steven immediately volunteered his services and I told Betty that she couldn't find a better worker than Steven. \n\nSteven looked at me with gratitude for the compliment I bestowed. \n\n\"Oh Steven, that would be fantastic! We could certainly use the help and as big and strong as you are it won't take long to finish that work!\" She hugged him in appreciation and I thought, Damn, he had gotten it bad for her.\n\nI saw Gayle looking at me and realized I was no better. There was something about Lambert's women that proved to be kryptonite to Perry's men.\n\nThey continued to chatter and then Betty wanted to go look at Steven's Mustang and begged him for a ride when he had it fixed. That I knew was all the incentive it would take for Steven to want to refurbish his car. As they left to go look, I held Carol back so Steven and Betty could have some private time.\n\nLater that night in bed, I proclaimed that Gayle was a genius and she insisted I show my gratitude.\n\nWith the advent of Betty coming into Steven's life things became smooth with Steven. In his desire to please Betty he transformed into the son I knew had been hiding under the pain and rejection.\n\nFor Carol it was a different matter. She kept insisting on her love for her twenty two years old boyfriend. I tried to explain that nature physically rejected that age differential since she had just turned thirteen. Later in life, when she matured it wouldn't matter, but, now it was morally and legally wrong.",
        "My tossing her phone did not stop the communications. Carol wrote to him every chance she got and Steven had allowed the use of his phone, at least, until Betty asked him to stop promoting such a creepy relationship.\n\nWe continued to argue about it until one day a knock on the door brought that sorry bastard to my door announcing he was going to run away with Carol and start their lives. Carol came out of her room with a suitcase so I knew that this had been planned. I told him to get off my property and not to contact Carol until she was eighteen.\n\nCarol was adamant that she was going with him until Steven talked some sense into her. I thought we had survived that impasse until late that night I was woken by a large ruckus. I ran into Carol's room in time to see her boyfriend hitting Steven, knocking him down. Steven had caught them trying to sneak out of the house and began fighting him.\n\nBy the time the deputies arrived, the boyfriend had two blackened eyes, a broken nose, bloody mouth and I was raring back to punt his gonads into his tonsils for the third time before they stopped me.\n\nAfter it all settled down, the Sheriff showed Carol some explicit videos on a laptop found in the creep's car. All underaged girls performing porno with the creep. That was his livelihood and Carol had merely been his latest target. That scared Carol into reality and her desire to rush into adulthood. Her creep boyfriend found himself in Huntsville being the love interest of a Crips gangbanger for the next twenty years.\n\nThe final defining moment was Steven and Carol both began missing their mother. They asked if it would be possible to spend the Christmas break with her. I told them I had no objection and they eagerly called to set up the logistics for meeting her.\n\nI was informed that the transfer would be at our usual visiting point and the date and time to meet. I asked Gayle and Betty to accompany us because I had a bad feeling for what was about to go down.\n\nWe got to the spot with time to spare and Steven and Carol were eager to see their mother. At the same time, Steven was saying how he would miss Betty for a whole week and how he planned to make it up to her.\n\nAs time passed, the kids' enthusiasm began to wane. Steven started trying to call his mother on his cell phone with no success. After two hours, they asked me to drive by the house to let them out. I reluctantly agreed and we arrived at a nondescript suburban house. Steven and Carol looked so lonely and vulnerable as they walked up the steps.\n\nThey rang the doorbell and soon a surprised Stella answered the door and stepped outside shutting the door behind her. Though I couldn't hear the conversation, the body language, the animation and agitation brought home what was happening. \n\nStella had hoped the visitation idea would quickly be forgotten in the rush of the holidays. When that hadn't happened she chose to ignore Steven's calls. She never expected the kids would be able to convince me to drive them to her house. Now confronted, she had to tell her children they were not welcomed as Carol ran back to the truck crying to be comforted by Gayle.\n\nSteven slowly walked back to the truck and as he stoically got in, Betty gathered him in her arms as his body began to shake from the silent tears. All I could do was start the painful drive back home. \n\nThe night had fallen and the only illumination in the darken truck was from the instrument panel and the occasional beams of light from oncoming traffic. Nobody spoke until we were about twenty miles from home.\n\n\"This is how you felt. This is how you felt all those times you came to visit and we didn't show up. All those times we were too busy to be with you. Each month we would break your heart and you kept coming back to get it broken again.\"\n\nThe quiet barely controlled voice of my son barely held his pain. A thousand comments were in my throat and the hurt kept me silent for my response. A new sob came from the back as Carol realized after all this time what I had suffered. Gayle continued to hold her.\n\nWhen we got into the house, Gayle and Betty left and went into the kitchen so I could talk to my kids.\n\n\"I can't change the past. All I can do is enjoy the present and look forward to the future. God has blessed me with two wonderful children and all I want is for them to live a happy life. I don't want them to be stuck in the past about things they can't change. I want them to be happy and I want the chance to share their happiness as a family. If I can have that then I will forever be happy.\"\n\nMy speech concluded, the three of us engaged in a group hug that continued until Gayle and Betty joined. With that the healing began. And life continued to go on and our family continued to prosper.\n\nTonight was Steven's and Betty's high school graduation. Gayle, Carol, and I sat along with my grandparents and all the Lamberts clan as a solid bloc of support for them. I felt such pride as Betty and Steven walked up to get their diploma, trying to ignore all the cheers coming from our section.\n\nAfterwards they had to pose for all the obligatory photos and finally we showed them mercy so they could join their classmates in a nightlong merriment of celebration. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her going up to Steven.\n\nShe hugged him and he obliged allowing her without any enthusiasm on his part. She asked a stranger to take a picture of her and her son. The stranger did so and as she looked at it, Steven slipped away. She looked up complaining the photo was out of focus and she wanted another shot. She was crestfallen when she saw there were no do-overs tonight.\n\nI suspected she had a long list of do-overs. Ted Jefferson had continued his philandering lifestyle until he met up with a gold digger that drained him financially. By the time the succubus had finished with him, he had lost his money, his businesses, and his home. He had tried to confront her and the boyfriend put him into the hospital. He had to file bankruptcy and now he and Stella were desperate to make a living. Her children with Ted continued to cause problems at home and at school.\n\nThe emotional pain and humiliation caused Stella to go on an eating binge and now she was truly of porcine size. Her entire life ruined and all she had was an out of focus photo with her son. She turned and walked away disappearing in the crowd.\n\n********************\n\nI was gasping as my perspiring body fell against Gayle's. We were celebrating Steven and Betty's graduation in our own private unique fashion. I heard Gayle ask, \"How was that?\"\n\nI continued to try to catch my breath and said, \"That was...horrible!\" At my mock response, Gayle retaliated with a tickle attack until I told her I gave up. She shifted on top of me and lazily scratched my chest with her fingernails.\n\n\"Have you given any thought about the Thompson's farm?\" Gayle asked about a prospective purchase we had been mulling over.\n\n\"Yeah, I think we could run cattle on the acreage, but, I'd have to see about getting some tags and clearing out all those alligators on that lake; otherwise, they'd decimate a herd.\"\n\n\"Oh honey, we could take the alligator hides and have boots, purses, and belts made for me, my girlfriends and Betty and Carol for Christmas presents!\" And as a visual aid, Gayle brought her dainty foot up in the air making several poses. I tried to visualize a naked Gayle dressed only in cowgirl boots. What a presentation that would be for Santa.\n\n\"Speaking of Carol, where did she run off to tonight?\"\n\n\"Well, honey she is sweet on Tommy Douglas and she wanted to spend some time with him. He's suppose to come over tomorrow and meet you and ask permission to take Carol on a date.\"\n\n\"Tommy Douglas, is that Doctor Douglas' boy?\"\n\n\"Yes dear, and he is already nervous about asking you, so don't scare him off!\" Gayle ordered.\n\n\"Why would he be scared of me?\" I asked puzzled.\n\n\"Well it could be your reputation for beating the hell out of men trying to run off with your daughter!\" Gayle drily responded.\n\nUpon reflection I could only see that as a good thing that would serve well to make sure my daughter would be safe to make up her own mind when it came to that. Still I gave a mental shudder at what had happened to Gayle. I didn't wish that on my daughter or any other woman.\n\n\"I promise you and Carol I'll be on my best behavior.\"\n\nAs Gayle turned out the light I thought how there were so many different types of fortunes. You could have a fortune in gold or any other valuable commodity, and what would it ultimately serve you? The voice of Randy Meisner came to me, \"You can spend all your time making money, you can spend all your love making time.\" I thought what a sad chase indeed trying to take it to the limit on that proposition.\n\nThe only thing I ever found worthwhile taking to the limit was safely ensconced in my arms in my bed and my children living under my roof. I was a wealthy man indeed.\n\nGayle whispered in my ear, \"Darling, could we do that horrible thing one more time tonight?\" \n\nShe licked my ear as I began to take it to the limit."
