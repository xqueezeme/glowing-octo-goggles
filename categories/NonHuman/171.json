        "I turned back to look at the big safe, disgust in my stomach as I realized what we were dealing with here. Luis wasn't just a traitor, he was a killer. He and his sister were working together to kill and terrorize her kind. \n\nI wanted his blood on my teeth, on my claws. \n\nI took out a camera, taking photos of the safe and of the room. I was working my way to the end of the shelf when I saw something hidden, something that made my insides sink. \"Shit. Check this out.\" Gunny came over and I pointed to the object, it was clearly a hidden camera. I reached up and pulled it off the shelf, the wires pulling loose. \"Find out where this is going,\" I said. \n\nThe wire disappeared into the wall, he listened carefully as I pulled the wire taut. Following its path as I pulled and relaxed it, he made his way around to a router behind the desk. \"Fuck, it's hooked up to his computer.\" \n\n\"POLICE INBOUND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE,\" Josh roared. I looked at Gunny, we looked at the open safe, the weapons, the explosives. \n\n\"Blow it or blow town?\" Gunny was already moving towards the open safe. \n\n\"Blow this shit up, we have to destroy his computers and hard drives and hope he doesn't store them offsite or have a remote link up,\" I said. He pulled out the C-4, grabbing a timer fuse from an adjacent shelf. I ran out of the room, we needed more than just an explosion. I headed for the garage, finding a full container of gasoline I grabbed it and headed inside again. I splashed it on the furniture, then down into the rooms off the hallway as Gunny slammed the door of the safe closed. He ran out of the room, and I tossed the gas can on its side in the doorway before I followed him. \n\nThe police cars were just pulling up when we exited the back door. We both shifted, racing for the back wall and leaping over just before we heard someone climb the gate and drop into the backyard. We raced away, seconds later there was a huge explosion that lit up the sky. Chunks of stone and wood started raining down around us, but we didn't stop moving. Gunny got to the bottom of the hill and found a thicket to hide in. \"Josh are you moving?\" \n\n\"Two minutes to pickup for Charlotte.\" \n\n\"Keep going west, we'll follow this creek down to the backup extraction.\" \n\n\"Got it, Gramps. You move pretty fast for your age,\" he teased. \n\n\"Just get Charlotte and shut up before Gunny loses track of how many ways to make you suffer in training,\" I told them. Gunny chuffed at me, then started working his way along the creekbed. The house had rapidly gone up in flames, the night sky was lit by it. I just prayed none of the police were hurt in the explosion. I was glad I took a few photos, they might prove important later. \"Josh, no cellphone calls or anything, I don't want any traces of this,\" I reminded him. \n\n\"Got it Mom. They know what we are doing, I'm sure they'll figure it out from the news. I'm pulling up to Charlotte now. See you in ten.\" \n\nWe kept moving, me following the big cat in front of me. The creek was barely a trickle, and the smooth bottom made for fast movement. The extraction point was a bridge a mile and a half downstream from where we started, and it didn't take us long to make it there. We moved up the side of the canyon to where the roadway came down and waited in the trees for Josh to appear. \n\nIt felt like a lot longer than the two or three minutes it was until he got there. He had warned us mentally, so when the SUV approached with its lights out and windows down, we didn't even let it stop. Gunny jumped through the open window. Charlotte had put the seats down after she was picked up, so he quickly shifted and rolled back out of the way, so I could jump in. I wasn't quite as graceful as my big man. My rear legs didn't have enough clearance, so they caught on the door and I face-planted onto the carpeted platform. Gunny pulled me in and I shifted in his arms. \"Go,\" he told Josh. \n\n\"Fuck that hurt,\" I said as I rubbed my right knee. He handed me my sundress and I pulled it over my head and down. He pulled on shorts and a T-shirt, our sandals were still on the floor where we left them. We pulled the middle seat back up and climbed forward. Charlotte handed me my wig and I put it on followed by the hat, and we were back to looking like a tourist family. \n\n\"Scanner is clear, police are searching the area, but that explosion pretty much cut off any active search for a while,\" Josh said. \"Also, sounds like no serious injuries to the cops who arrived. That's the good news.\" \n\nOh shit, I could feel it coming. \"The bad news?\" \n\n\"Those cameras in the house, they were broadcasting through an Internet link. The guy who called 911 had a description of the burglars, he showed a screen shot to police. You're going to be identified soon as the people responsible.\" Oh shit, out of the FBI for less than a week and I'm already on my way to jail. \n\n\"Let's get out of this area quckly, then,\" Gunny said. He leaned back in the seat and I leaned into his big chest. \"Turn news radio on.\" \n\nCharlotte started looking for the station while Josh drove back to the main roads. \"Where to,\" he asked. \"If they've identified you, we can't go back to Gila. They'll be waiting for us, they know we are staying there.\" \n\nI looked over at Gunny, hiding was a sniper thing. \"El Paso is one possibility, they are allies.\" \n\nHe shook his head. \"Too much risk being on the road that long,\" he said. \"As soon as the APB goes out for us, it won't take long.\" \n\n\"You're right, and I don't want to be out of the loop. We have to find this woman fast; if we capture her, everything with her brother comes out and the FBI will have to listen. Then, they will understand why we did what we did at his house.\" I thought about it for a minute. \"Head towards Albuquerque, they won't expect that.\" \n\nAs we got closer, I had Charlotte look up hotels near the building we were using for the investigation. We found a nice one, and soon were pulling into the underground garage. I had Josh book a room under one of his alternate identities, ones they maintained from their time on the Panama island. He left us in the car as he went up to check in. \n\n\"Melanie?\" I sent the query over the link, hoping she was still at work in the task force room. \n\n\"Rose? Fuck, Rose, are you guys all right?\" \n\n\"We're fine, holing up for a while. What's going on?\" \n\n\"It's a shit storm of epic proportions,\" she told me. \"Luis is furious, he has video of you two breaking into his house. He's laying in to Craig right now on a conference call with Washington, DC. He's demanding he turn you over to them, they are already drafting indictments. Not just breaking and entering, Federal explosives and terrorism charges.\" \n\n\"Craig would never turn us over, Melanie.\" \n\n\"We know that, but he's under intense pressure. Oh shit, the meeting is ending. Stay hidden, I'll update you when I can,\" she said before she cut the link off. \n\n\"Well, it's about to get real,\" I said. \"Melanie confirmed Luis has video of us and the Feds are preparing indictments.\" \n\n\"That won't go over well with the Packs,\" Gunny said. \n\n\"It's smart from his end,\" I said. \"Terrorism charges mean they can hold us without trial, without lawyers. They can disappear us.\" \n\n\"Josh is already dead,\" Charlotte said, \"What are they going to do? DOUBLE-DOG disappear him?\" \n\nShit. \"Josh is not safe either. If they know Gunny isn't really dead, they will soon figure out Josh isn't dead either. It's not like we can produce the body.\" \n\n\"I guess he'll be going dark as well, then.\" I looked away from her just in time to see Josh emerge from the elevator. He waved us forward; Charlotte took the bag containing Josh's equipment and we all walked over. I kept my hat and face down as we walked into the elevator and up to the fifth floor. \n\n\"Aren't you worried about surveillance footage, Josh?\" \n\n\"I'll fix it later,\" he said. \"Right now, they still haven't issued alerts.\" We moved through the hallways and he opened a door, handing me the other card I opened it. Charlotte followed him in, while Gunny and I went into our room. The first thing I did was open the connecting door and knocked on theirs. Charlotte opened it a few moments later, her face a little flushed, her lips a little puffy. \n\nI gave her the Mom look before I glared at Josh. \"You two behave,\" I said. \n\n\"We will, Mom. You're right next door and you have cat hearing now, it's not like we are on our own.\" He pulled Charlotte into his chest, leaning down he kissed her deeply as she molded her young body to his. \"Of course, that doesn't mean we'll be lacking for things to do.\" \n\n\"Just keep it PG,\" I said as I turned back to the room. \n\n\"You too, Mom,\" Charlotte teased. \n\n\"Purely Gunny? I can do that, Char.\" I closed the door as I started to laugh, and Gunny wasn't helping. \"I'm tired,\" I said. \n\n\"Take a shower, I'll get some room service ordered,\" he said. \"Don't worry, I'll have it delivered next door, and I'll make sure no one sees Josh.\" I went into the bathroom, the hotel was upscale and the bathroom was pretty nice. I heard Gunny talking with Josh on the other side of the room as they ordered dinner. \n\nI got undressed and into the shower, letting the hot water soak away the tension. My mind was furiously going through different scenarios, but one thing kept coming back to the forefront- we had been caught red-handed burglarizing the home of a senior FBI agent. It didn't matter that he was dirty, that he was the one who had killed people and built the bomb meant to kill my daughter. In the eyes of the law, he was the victim and we were the criminals. I reached out over the Pack bond again. \"Melanie? What's going on?\" \n\n\"The task force is over, Rose. Craig refused to hand you over, he won't cooperate in them finding and arresting you. The Justice Department threatened to have him arrested for obstruction, but he stormed out of there first. As of right now, the Werewolf alliance is no longer part of the FBI investigation. They wanted to kick us out, but I reminded them that this floor is rented and controlled by the Packs along with all the equipment. So, the FBI is leaving instead. They are taking all the data, all the evidence with them and going back to their building.\" \n\n\"We have all the data, Melanie, Josh made sure of it.\" \n\n\"True, and we can keep our investigation going. We just don't have authority now. All of our FBI credentials have been revoked, as well as our access to the Federal building. Agent Luis has been given full authority over the investigation.\" \n\nTalk about the fox being put in charge of the henhouse. \"Melanie, could you bring Charlotte home for me? If they find us, I don't want her involved. So far we've been able to keep her on the legal side of things. I want her back under Pack protection.\" \n\n\"Of course, Rose. I'll be leaving in a few hours, I'll give you a heads up.\" \n\n\"Thanks Melanie. I'll tell you where to meet her then.\" I ended the conversation and turned the shower off, drying myself quickly. I grabbed a hotel robe, it was thick and comfortable, and I didn't have any clean clothes with me. I went back out and updated everyone on what was going on. \n\nCharlotte stayed in her room until the food arrived, then she brought the cart over. I smelled the food, sorting through the sharper and more complex scents with my improved nose. \"Steak and potatoes with vegetable medley?\" \n\n\"Yes, Mom. I have the medium rare filet, the rest of you got the Porterhouses... rare.\" \n\n\"I don't like rare,\" I said, but my nose started saying differently as Gunny placed it on the table. The juices were leaking onto the plate, and my tongue started moving over my lips. \n\n\"You will find your tastes have changed, love.\" Gunny sat next to me with his plate. \"I found I did not like overly processed food, artificial ingredients or overcooked food. Just try it.\" \n\nI took a bite, the flavor of the beef exploded on my tongue. I was wrong, this was fantastic. \"You're right.\" \n\n\"Of course I am. Just wait until we can hunt together, love. There's nothing like a fresh kill.\" \n\nMy human side was unconvinced, but my cat was loving the idea. We finished the meal, enjoying the time together as a family. My gut wondered if this was the last time. \"Charlotte, you are heading home with Melanie tonight. I want you back under Pack protection.\" \n\nShe looked at me in horror. \"But Mom! I need to be here with you!\" \n\nGunny shook his head. \"She's right. Josh and I aren't supposed to be alive, Rose is going to be a wanted fugitive. We need you out of the way, so you stay safe.\" \n\nShe looked to Josh for help, I worried that he would take her side, but he surprised me. \"They are right, my mate. Things could go bad quickly, and I need you safe. You're my future, love. Please... do this for me.\" He cupped her face, his thumbs wiping her tears away. \"Please, go with her.\" \n\nShe pulled his face to hers and kissed him deeply. \"You stay safe,\" she whispered. Melanie sent to me she was getting ready to leave, so I set up a meeting place. \"There is a park four blocks south of here,\" I told her. We looked at the aerial map on her phone. \"She will meet you at the southeast corner, you can wait in those benches by the fountain.\" \n\nWe all hugged her, and she walked out of her room to the elevator. Gunny went to take a shower, and Josh went back to his room to do some work on his computer. I turned the news on, and what I saw shocked me. I was expecting to see photos of Gunny and I, with WANTED crawls underneath them. They were there. \n\nWhat I didn't expect to see was a photo of Charlotte, taken from a camera that must have been on the front porch of his house. Her face was clearly visible, and we had just sent her out into public alone. \n\nCh. 33 \n\nI rushed to the window of the hotel, looking down I could see Charlotte moving down the sidewalk towards the park. \"JOSH,\" I yelled as I watched. He ran into our room. \"Josh, call Charlotte and tell her to get out of sight. She's on the wanted list,\" I said. \n\n\"Do you want her back here?\" \n\n\"No, she could lead them right to us if she's recognized.\" He ran back into his room. \"Melanie, where are you?\" \n\n\"Just riding the elevator down to parking,\" she responded. \n\n\"I just saw on the news, Charlotte is named as a suspect in the bombing of Luis' house. She's wanted now.\" \n\n\"Damn it, they didn't say anything about her earlier! Do you still have her?\" \n\n\"No, she's on the way to the park. We told her to get out of sight. It will have to be a hot pickup. Get out of there and drive towards her, I'll guide you in.\" \n\nI had been watching Charlotte, she had ducked into a shop a few blocks away. Josh came back in the room, he was on a burner phone and was talking to her. He looked up from the phone. \"She's ducked into a clothing store called 'Vintage Fashion', she's trying to stay out of sight,\" he said. \n\nI looked across the street, watching the exit of the parking area. \"Melanie, you'll exit west and go two and a half blocks, the store is on the left. I'll have her run out to you as soon as you stop, make sure the door is open and don't stop for anyone or anything.\" \n\n\"I'm almost at the exit now,\" she said. A few moments later and I could see her Honda Pilot as she paid the attendant. \n\n\"I have you in sight. When you get her, have her hide in the back seat.\" I yelled for Gunny to get out here while Josh was trying to calm Charlotte down on the phone. \"Josh, she can't keep her phone. They will track it.\" \n\nI listened to him tell her what car Melanie was driving. Then he told her to destroy her phone. He explained what to do, he had her put it on the ground and crush it with her heel. When the phone cut out, he broke the flip phone in half, then removed the battery and tossed it all in a bin. My stomach fell, now I had no way to talk to her directly. Gunny came out wrapped in a towel and I quickly filled him in on what was going on. We watched as Melanie turned onto the street, now four cars back from the stoplight and two blocks away. \n\nThe light turned green and we all watched as she pulled forward to the next light. It was still red, and then I saw the lights flashing. A police car was coming from the other direction. \n\nThe light changed, and Melanie moved forward, slowing to a halt near the cars parked on the right. Charlotte opened the door of the shop and rushed out, waiting for the cars to clear so she could cross to her. She looked at the police car and froze on the sidewalk as it stopped in front of her. She turned and ran back into the shop as the police officer jumped out of his car, his pistol drawn. Two more patrol cars were on their way now. \"Melanie, circle around to the next block and wait,\" I told her. \n\nShe moved forward, changing lanes so she could make the turn at the next street. \"Josh, pull up the street cameras,\" I said. He raced back into his room, grabbing his laptop as Gunny and I kept watch. The second police car arrived, and an officer jumped out and ran into the store. The third police car made a turn, he was maybe a minute behind Melanie's car. \n\n\"Melanie, the police are behind you, have you seen Charlotte?\" \n\n\"Nothing yet, I've stopped by the back door and have my door open.\" I didn't hear anything for a minute. \"I've got her.\" \n\n\"Go, but don't drive in a way that attracts attention,\" I told her. \"Josh, bring up the cameras.\" Melanie was smart enough to stay away from the main roads, but Josh had the traffic cams up and soon spotted her. \"OK, set a grid five blocks around and track,\" I told him. \n\nHis screen split into twenty images, and while he was looking at them I went back to his room and grabbed the police scanner. Turning it on, the airwaves were filled with reports and orders. All available units were being diverted to the area. \"Melanie, they've got your description. Hide the car and evade on foot,\" I told her. \n\nThere had to be another way out. \"Nadine, where are you?\" \n\n\"I'm still at the office, Rose. What's going on? Is everyone hiding?\" \n\n\"Not yet. They spotted Charlotte as Melanie was picking her up, her license plate has been picked up and they know she is helping her escape. I need you to extract them.\" \n\n\"I'm leaving now,\" she said. \"Where do you want me to take them?\" \n\nI looked at Gunny, leaving the link open. \"Where should she go? She can't go to Gila.\" \n\n\"El Paso is the closest ally,\" Gunny said. \n\n\"Too risky,\" Josh countered. \"Immigration stops along the way, they'll have her description and can search the vehicle.\" \n\n\"Johnson Pack, then,\" Gunny said. \"Renee's brother will protect them, and no one will expect them to be heading north.\" \n\nI liked the idea, it would be safe. I hadn't met Derek and Amanda, but they were family and were well respected in the werewolf community. \n\n\"I hate to say it, guys, but that's about a full day's drive. I'm not thrilled with being on the road that long with wanted fugitives.\" \n\n\"The jet we have from the Packs, we control that, right?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"Call them and tell them to get it ready to take Pack members back to the Johnson pack. They won't suspect anything since the task force has been shut down, even if they pick up your call.\" \n\n\"All right. I'm going to text the people here from that area, I'll tell them I'm giving them a ride to the airport. Gotta go.\" \n\nI looked over at Gunny. \"Is this going to work?\" \n\n\"It can if they can stay hidden until pickup,\" he said. \"Nadine has one of the Excursions, it's big enough for a bunch of people. Melanie how are you guys doing?\" ",
        "\"Car is hidden in an apartment parking lot. We're on foot, two blocks away. We're going to go a few more blocks then find a place to hide. How is extraction coming?\" \n\n\"Nadine is going to pick you up in her silver Excursion. It may be a while before she is there.\" \n\nI listened to the police radio, they had lost Melanie's car almost immediately and were setting up roadblocks on a 10-block radius. \"Josh, we need to do something so they can't figure out where they are now,\" I said. \n\n\"Already done. I took the last hour's data from all the traffic cams and overwrote it with the previous hour's data. They can search but they won't find anything. They will try and use facial recognition, but that won't work either, the software has a virus in it now.\" He smiled a little. \"Don't worry Mom, I won't let them take my mate from me.\" \n\nWe waited nervously for the next updates; Charlotte and Melanie had found a good spot to hide out, while Nadine was coming to the hotel to pick up team members from the northern Packs. Gunny turned to me and his face was grim. \"Rose... I want you to go with them,\" he said. \"Josh, you too.\" \n\n\"What?\" We both looked at him like he was crazy. \"No, we're staying here.\" \n\nHe shook his head. \"No, it doesn't make sense now. The reason we came here was to be able to link with wolves in the investigation. Now, there are none. The investigation is human only, and the longer we stay here the greater chance someone sees or remembers us. We can't go back to Gila, and we can't get caught on the road. This is the best chance for you two to get to safety.\" \n\nI hated that he was right. I hated that I was leaving him. I hated that I was hidden under a blanket in the back of Nadine's SUV, holding Charlotte in my arms with Josh and Melanie on the other side. I hated that we were away from our Pack. I hated the glee in his eyes with the last thing he told me before we snuck out of the room. \n\n\"What about you? What are you going to do?\" \n\nHe just smirked at me. \"I'm going hunting, baby.\" \n\nCh. 34 \n\nWe arrived at the airport in the late evening, having stopped to eat first. Nadine bought take-out meals from a local steakhouse. When we arrived, the jet was fueled and waiting for us. Nadine brought the truck into the hangar, parking it near the back. A Pack member would retrieve it later. \n\nThe stairs were down, so we moved quickly into the private jet and found seats. I sat next to Charlotte, with Josh on her other side. Melanie was across from us, along with Nadine who would be flown home on the next leg. \"Are you ready to do this, Josh?\" \n\nHe looked at me as he set up the laptop. \"Of course, Mom. The call will appear to be coming from a cell tower in Annapolis. They'll never track it back here.\" Gunny had a plan, it was a desperate plan, but it might work. I had one too. We were going to go at this from both ends. \n\n\"I'm making my call, then,\" I said. I took the burner phone and opened it up. Dialing a number I knew by heart, I just hoped she would listen to me. I waited nervously as the phone rang. \n\n\"Lisa Giovanni,\" she replied as she picked up. \n\n\"Hi boss, it's been a while. Don't say my name.\" I was hoping she wouldn't blow this. \n\n\"Well, what a pleasure. You're creating quite a stir, you must be feeling better. You look good, that's for sure.\" \n\n\"It's been a busy time for me. You've heard a lot of things, none of them are true. I need to know If you trust me enough to learn the truth, Lisa.\" \n\nThere was a pause. \"Nothing is ever easy with you guys, is it.\" \n\n\"Easy is boring, boss, you know that. Can you come to me? Bring someone you trust, someone high up in Justice with an open mind?\" \n\n\"I can. What's the timing?\" \n\n\"Tomorrow morning, I'll send a plane for you. I'll text you the details when I have them. Pack for an overnight,\" I told her. \n\n\"I will. Are you all right? Safe?\" \n\nI smiled as I looked at my family and friends around me. \"I'll be fine, boss. This will all clear up soon and I'll be back in retirement.\" \n\nShe snorted. \"Somehow, I can't see you just sitting around on the porch in your rocking chair.\" I felt Charlotte twitch, and I smiled as I thought about doing just that. \n\n\"Well, we will see. I'll see you tomorrow, and thank you.\" \n\n\"Stay out of trouble,\" she said before she hung up. \n\nI closed the phone and removed the battery before breaking it in half. We went through a lot of these prepaid phones, but we couldn't risk them using the phone to track us. I closed my eyes and let out a little prayer; we were taking a big risk by going to the White House Counsel. I trusted her, I'd worked with her long enough to know how she was. She had been very helpful in the past, most recently with the Belden Pack. It was when they came to visit her at her home in the middle of the night that I had first met Gunny and Ella. \n\nI smiled as I thought back to that night. Gunny's first look at me made my knees go weak, and I had to avoid looking at him that night or I wouldn't have been able to think straight. He still looked at me that way, like he wanted to grab me and never let go. I still reacted to him, I couldn't help it. The man was my world, one look and I was ready for him. \n\n\"He's going to be fine, Mom,\" Josh said to me. \n\n\"How did you know I was thinking about him?\" \n\n\"Well, you get this goofy smile on your face. Oh, and your arousal is easy to smell.\" I tested the air, he was right. The confines of the plane were going to make it easy to smell. \n\nI looked over at Melanie, who was snickering to herself. \"Wait... all those other flights...\" \n\nShe nodded. \"I had to breathe through my mouth at times because you were putting off such a scent. I had to fake sleeping just so Gunny could take care of you,\" she said with a giggle. My face started turning scarlet red. \"Don't worry about it, new mates are like that. I was the same way, hell, if Jacob was here I would be the same way. Wolves are sexual creatures, there is nothing wrong with being aroused by the thought of your mate. From what I've seen, you cats are even worse.\" \n\n\"Really, if Gunny was yours, tell me you wouldn't feel the same way.\" I loved his look, his bulging muscles, the way they moved under his skin or fur. He got me hot and bothered so quickly. The engines were winding up now and we were moving out towards the runway. \n\n\"Meh, all those muscles just get in the way. My Jacob, now THERE is a hot man. Strong, lean, and can go FOREVER if you know what I mean.\" \n\nJosh buried his nose in Charlotte's shoulder, letting her scent drown out the musk starting to surround him. \"Josh, what's the problem?\" \n\n\"It's getting thick in here, Mom. There's only one scent I want in my head right now.\" I took a breath, it was working because now Charlotte's scent was getting stronger. \n\n\"All right, people, let's settle down. We've got work to do.\" Everyone started cracking up, just in time for the pilot to announce we were cleared for takeoff. I was getting a crash course in Werecat senses, I had never understood before just how much they could smell and hear. It was no wonder no one said anything, you can't ignore it. Everyone knows what everyone else is doing, but like Melanie said- it was all right because they were mates. \"Josh, send the text.\" \n\n\"On it,\" he said as he opened his laptop back up. I watched as he typed the message in. \"GUNNY HOLED UP 27275 HWY 177 EL MALPAIS NM.\" He hit the ENTER key, then cleared his screen. \"It's sent,\" he said. \"Do you think she will fall for it?\" \n\n\"They don't know we know their cell numbers,\" I said. \"They don't talk or text hardly at all. If this doesn't draw Maitea Jennings out, I don't know what will. Gunny says that a sniper's greatest test is another sniper. She'll show up,\" I said. \n\n\"And Gunny? Will he be all right?\" \n\n\"Gunny is the best at what he does, Josh. He's smart enough, plus he's getting help.\" I smiled as I thought about it. Marine Snipers worked in pairs, and his spotter was his best friend. He relayed a message to another wolf, who used his cellphone to get a message to him. In ten minutes, it was confirmed he was on his way, with his gear. \n\nShe would never know what hit her. \n\nGunny's POV \n\nIt hurt like hell to watch her leave, but it had to be done. I needed her and the rest of my family safe, and only a Pack could do that. She had her own plan, one that was just as important. I was a Marine, I wasn't good at this political shit. I didn't have the patience or the contacts to do what she was doing. \n\nI was still pissed at myself for proposing the mission to Luis' house. I fell for it, thinking he just had rudimentary security, not considering he might have layers of defense. We had been stupid, and stupid hurt. Not only were we wanted now, but we had pulled Charlotte into the mess. \n\nI got dressed, having washed my clothes in the sink and dried them with a hairdryer. I didn't have any luggage, or anything else to my name. I watched television, clicking through the cable channels. There wasn't any real news, so the talking heads were out in force. The big topic was the messy divorce between the FBI and the Packs over the investigation. The government apologists focused on the supposed treachery of our break-in, pushing the idea that werewolves never really wanted to integrate again. The defenders were focusing in on the stupidity of thinking we Rose and I were the killers when we and our Pack had been targeted twice by them. \n\nA soft triple knock came on the door, and I moved closer. I didn't look through the peephole, I took a deep breath. It smelled like gunpowder and oil. Pulling the door open, I smiled as I stepped aside to let Lars Thorssen into my room. \"LARS!\" I pulled him into a bro-hug. \n\n\"Gunny, you fuckup,\" he said as he pounded my back, \"once again I have to pull your ass out of trouble.\" \n\n\"Another half dozen times and we'll be even,\" I said. \"Come on, we need to talk.\" I brought him over to the table and sat down to explain things. I started with the attack on our Pack, going through everything that had happened since. \n\n\"Fucking FBI,\" he said. \"You can't trust any agency with three letters.\" That was true; both of us had done work for the CIA, and it was pretty clear they wanted us to be the puppets, and they wanted to hold the strings. More than once we had to get out on our own when their grand plans went to shit. \n\n\"That's one thing I love about my new life, a Pack is family. It's much like our units, we'd do anything for each other.\" There was another knock at the door. \"Hang on, this should be my guy from Gila.\" I moved over to the door and took a sniff. It was him. \n\nI opened the door to reveal the short, heavily muscled cowboy in jeans and a plaid shirt. His white Stetson covered the bald spot on top of his head, his hair was shaved close on the side under it. \"Beta Alex, thank you for coming,\" I said. \"This is my buddy from the Marines, Lars.\" The two shook hands, sizing each other up. \"Ready to have some fun?\" \n\n\"I wouldn't miss it, Gunny. There hasn't been much since we shot up that column that tried to attack.\" Lars didn't understand, so as I pulled a few beers out from the fridge, he told the story of the druglord and his mercenaries tried to attack them. As a sniper, Lars appreciated the finer parts of the story; the explosion, and the fifty cals taking out the helicopter. \n\n\"So, what's the plan, Gunny?\" I had spread out the satellite photos on the table as Lars watched. \"I figure you didn't need me here to help you avoid capture, you're pretty damn good at it on your own.\" \n\nLars laughed. \"No, Gunny wouldn't bring me here unless we get to kill someone. But, I'm curious too... what's the plan?\" \n\n\"It's a countersniper operation,\" I told them. \"We figured out who the Scrabble Killer is. Her name is Maitea Jennings. She's a widow, her husband was pilot of a rescue helicopter that was shot down by Alpha Renee Hasting's squad during the war. That's why she has such a hardon for her.\" \n\n\"Why don't we know this,\" Lars asked. \"If you know the killer, it should be all over the news.\" \n\n\"Except that she is also the sister of Luis Hernandez, the FBI agent in charge of the entire fucking investigation. He's keeping her name out of the investigation, covering for her and her attacks. We found out how the two are communicating, and sent a fake text to her saying I was holed up at this location,\" I said as I pointed to the map. \"We're going to set up three positions around it, and when she shows up, we capture her.\" \n\nCh. 35 \n\nRose's POV \n\nWe spent most of the flight preparing the briefing. We had only one chance to convince my old boss and Justice of what we had uncovered; if they didn't buy it, we were truly on our own. Josh was making up the presentation on his laptop, we just fed him data. It made the flight go quickly, and we really needed to get everything out of Nadine before she went home. \n\nWe finished up just before the pilot announced we were on final descent; I looked out the window and my cat and I were captivated. I could see Josh and Charlotte staring at it in wonder as well; the snow-covered mountains, the endless pine forests, the clearings at low altitude. It was so different from the scenery back in Washington, and especially from New Mexico. My cat wanted out, she wanted to run and climb and hunt. \n\nThe airport was fairly small, and wasn't busy since we were between the peak summer season and the ski season. We landed, taxied off the runway then stopped near a hangar. As soon as the engines shut down, a pair of black SUV's was stopping by the side of the plane. We grabbed our stuff, not having much, and said our goodbyes to those not going to the Johnson Pack with us. \n\nThe air was much cooler than back home, it was crisp and smelled wonderful. I liked it already. A tall man got out of the back seat, another four men standing behind him. They were all big and threatening, obviously warriors. My cat could feel his dominance as I led my group towards him, he must be the Alpha. He gave us a warm smile. \"Welcome to Wyoming, everyone. I am Alpha Derek Johnson, and I'm at your service.\" \n\nI stopped just short of him, my head dipping slightly before looking at him. My cat was strong, but she instinctively knew her place. \"Thank you for having us, Alpha Johnson. I am Rose Rodriguez, this is my daughter Charlotte and her mate Josh Spencer.\" Both came up alongside me and nodded in respect. \n\nI was a little shocked when we were all pulled into a hug. \"You're practically family,\" he said, \"and Josh is a legend. He needs no introduction, he is always welcome on Pack lands.\" I looked at him a little quizzically. \"You didn't hear about what he did for us during the war,\" he asked as he led us to the vehicles. \n\n\"I knew he was a hacker, hell he was on the most wanted list, especially after that stunt with the sewage treatment plants.\" \n\nJosh and Charlotte were led to the second SUV, when I looked at him he just said \"Security,\" and continued to lead me to the first one. I got in, then he went around and got in the other side. The two warriors in our car were in the front seat, and as soon as the doors closed we were off. He opened a cooler and pulled out a water, I nodded, and he handed it to me before taking one for himself. \"Josh did as much to help our species survive as anyone during the war. His hacking raised millions of dollars that were funneled to Packs to help us survive. You have to realize, we were completely cut off from commerce- no access to food, weapons, or other supplies. His funds started a whole logistical network that kept us alive. It wasn't just money, as important as that was. He organized hacking attacks that destroyed databases and made it more difficult for the Feds to figure out who and where we are. He's a special kid.\" \"He is that, Alpha. What I like the most about him, though, is the way he looks at my daughter like she is his world. He will do anything to make her happy, and what Mom could want more?\" \n\n\"You are right, Rose, that's all any of us want for our children, for them to be happy and complete.\" He looked out at trees passing by. \"Thank you for the heads up. The pilots report they have to rest after the trip to North Dakota, so I've booked a charter from DC to here instead. Here is the flight information.\" \n\nI pulled another burner phone out of my purse; setting it to text, I typed in the information and sent it to the personal phone of White House Counsel Lisa Giovanni. She acknowledged it and said she would get back to me with her arrival time after she had talked with the pilots. \"What about the other paperwork?\" \n\n\"It was emailed to the White House a few hours ago, Ms. Giovanni should have it already. I'm not sure I understand what you are doing, though.\" \n\n\"It's all part of our plan, Alpha. Now, how is your family? I understand your mate is pregnant?\" \n\n\"She is,\" he said with a smile. \"Our first, after so many years, it's exciting and scary as hell at the same time,\" he said. He reached into his wallet and pulled out a paper, it was an ultrasound photo. \"A little girl,\" he said. \n\n\"She's beautiful!\" I handed it back and he put it away. We drove on, talking about our family and I was telling him about my introduction to Pack life. Before we knew it, we were in the mountains. \"I love this,\" I said. \n\nThe cars pulled to the side of the road. \"Come on, it will do you some good,\" he said as he got out. He took his jacket off, then his shoes, tossing them inside. The warrior in the passenger seat did the same thing. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" \n\n\"Your cat needs to run, I can tell. Josh should come too. We can go up over this mountain and meet them at the Pack House. Don't worry, we're on Pack lands now and Charlotte will be safe.\" I looked back and Josh was getting out of his vehicle, looking at me for the OK. \n\n\"Oh, hell yes,\" I said as I pulled my sweatshirt off. In a few moments the clothes were in the back seat and I had shifted to my panther form. Josh ran up to me, nipping at my neck, so I batted him with a paw before wrestling him to the ground. Derek came over, his white wolf was big and intimidating. We sniffed each other, then I greeted his warrior, before Derek raised his head and let out a howl. He was quickly joined by two voices, then answering howls from higher up in the mountains. The second time I let them sing, then joined them with my roar. A few of the howls stopped, unsure of what just happened, but Derek wasn't concerned. We couldn't talk together since we were in different packs, so he chuffed and led the way into the trees. \n\nMy panther was in her element, moving quickly and quietly through the mountainside. Josh was running around, smelling things and leaving his pee-mail behind, while Derek just trotted along. The sun was starting to set, and the shadows were taking over. I had moved ahead of the others, so I took a moment to climb. Finding a large pine that was isolated from the others, I leaped up high and dug my claws into the side. I moved up the side quickly until I was high enough to see clearly the valley we had just left. It was amazing. I moved along a branch, picking my spot I leaped for a branch in the next tree. I watched as Josh ran below me, his nose was up and he was searching for me but was having trouble with the scent. I grinned to myself before moving down and dropping silently behind him. I batted his tail, growling a little as I took off running. He yipped and chased after me. \n\nHe was faster, but I was more agile, so I took advantage of that. I weaved through the trees and under the fallen logs, forcing his larger body to slow down. I was starting to leave him behind, I took a moment to look back and that's when I was hit and rolled. I got back on my feet quickly, but Derek was already running away from me. I growled in annoyance and took off after him. He was bigger and slower than Josh, so I caught him near the top of the hill. Leaping onto his back, I forced him to face plant before I jumped off him. ",
        "The play ended when we crested the hill, Josh and I both stopped to take in what we saw. The Johnson Pack compound was huge, and construction was everywhere. There were cranes and lifts and scaffolding all around the building, which looked about half done. It was going to be freaking HUGE when completed, it was the size of a large hotel. Howls of greeting came from down below, and an excited Derek led the way down to his Pack. \n\nGunny's POV \n\nAlex went out and came back a few minutes later with a luggage cart and a big duffel bag. \"What's that for?\" \n\n\"Get in.\" I looked at him like he had three heads, but he ignored me and unzipped it. It was made for carrying hockey or football equipment, it was going to be a tight fit, but I could see why he was doing it. I put my feet at the base, then sat down and scooted so I was on my side with my knees up near my chest. \"Stay still,\" he said as he zipped it up. I heard the door open and I was being wheeled out into the hall, then down the elevator and into the parking garage. A door lock opened, and I felt myself being lifted up and not so gently moved across the carpeting. \n\nI stayed quiet, waiting for the car to start and pull out before I said anything. \"Thanks for the extra bounces, boys.\" \n\n\"Just keep quiet, Gunny, and stay put,\" Lars said. \"We still have to pick up my stuff.\" They stopped a few seconds later, and the back window of the SUV was opened, and I could hear bags and cases being loaded. The window closed, and we started moving again. They kept the bag closed, talking to each other as we drove out of town. \n\nFinally, Lars unzipped the bag and I sat up on the seat. \"My stuff in the back?\" \n\n\"Yep, on the bottom. Don't mess with my stuff, bitch.\" I flipped Lars the finger, I wouldn't touch another sniper's stuff. It was personal, his pride and joy, and we were possessive of it. \n\nI turned around and started to move things aside. One of the cases was huge. \"Lars, did you bring a fifty?\" \n\n\"Nope, that's my Barrett,\" Alex said. \"After the attack on our Pack, and seeing the Johnson Pack guys use them, we bought a bunch of them. We brought in instructors and a dozen of us qualified on them. They make a big bang, but shooting twice is silly,\" he said. \n\n\"Hit the right place and you don't ever have to shoot twice,\" I replied. \n\n\"True, but you never know when you have to take out a vehicle. The fifty cal will punch through an engine block or defeat any bulletproof glass out there, and it can reach out over a mile and still hit like a sledgehammer. We even have armor piercing and explosive rounds we picked up on the black market. I love that thing.\" \n\n\"I'm into the classics, Alex. Nothing beats a bolt-action Remington with a three-oh-eight. Light enough to hump through the bush, accurate as all hell and effective out past a thousand.\" \n\n\"You're both wrong,\" Lars said. \"One is too big, the other is too small. My three thirty-eight Lapua, though, is just right. 300 grain low drag bullet, higher muzzle velocity, insanely accurate out to a mile and a half. You can't argue with the world record holder for a sniper kill, plus my baby looks GOOD.\" Lars broke with the USMC on this one, they had gone with a .300 Winchester Magnum, but the Canadian and British snipers he trained with after I left had convinced him. \n\n\"Hey, we do have to go over a few things before we arrive,\" Alex said. \"I made up backpacks for each of us- three days of water, food, extra batteries. Gunny, I packed your night vision equipment and spotting scope in your gear. Add in some extra clothes, sleeping bag and tarp, and you're set.\" \n\n\"Sounds like freakin' paradise, right Lars? A sleeping bag?\" \n\n\"Hey, I'm the only HUMAN here. You guys just fur up and you're nice and warm.\" I had a little chuckle at that. \"So Alex has the fifty, are you setting him up to the south?\" \n\n\"Yep, I want him on the rocks on the opposite side of the road, fairly close to it. That way he'll be able to cover approaches from both sides out to a mile.\" Alex nodded. \"Lars, I want you on the north side, covering the back of the house. I'll take the southeast corner, here in these bluffs, and cover the front.\" \n\n\"Are you expecting a frontal assault on the house, Gunny?\" \n\n\"I doubt it, Lars. There is Maitea and maybe one other sniper. I'm more worried about someone sneaking in within range and waiting it out. That's why this is a counter-sniper scenario. We need to watch the roads, but we also need to be taking time to watch the terrain so no one sneaks up on us.\" \n\n\"All right, boys, dropoff in five minutes. Lars, we'll drop you off about two miles from the turnoff. Gunny and I will park a few miles south and work our way back up. Here's your comm gear.\" He handed out some radios and headsets from the console. \"Make sure they work before we go.\" \n\nAlex pulled to the side of the road, and Lars got out. He pulled on his pack, then took his rifle out and cradled it in his arms. \"Keep your heads down, boys,\" he called over the radio as he walked away. \n\n\"Shoot straight,\" Alex said. \n\n\"Time to get some revenge,\" I responded. LONG past time. \n\nCh. 36 \n\nAlex continued down the road, pointing out the home that Josh had given the address of when he sent Maitea the fake text from her brother. It was set among the sand and the rock formations, hidden from the road by a formation maybe a hundred yards long and fifty yards from the roadway. You could just catch a glimpse of it before the next set of rocks blocked it again. \"There is nobody living there, right?\" \n\n\"There is,\" he said. \"The Gila pack bought the property yesterday, we needed a target that would be remote enough humans wouldn't get caught in the crossfire. One of our warriors, a man who looks something like you, is holed up inside.\" \n\n\"Are you kidding me? You're going to get him killed,\" I said as I looked back towards the house. \n\n\"We took precautions, we're not stupid,\" he said. \"He's a volunteer, with strict orders never to leave the house or take his body armor off. He's wearing it under his clothes, multiple plates on his chest and back. He's complaining like a little bitch about how uncomfortable it is, but he'll live.\" I chuckled a little, the armor WAS a pain to wear. \"Plus, we brought in pieces of ballistic glass and reinforced the windows she would have to take her shots through. He'll be fine. We needed a target who wasn't you since you have to be a shooter.\" \n\nI thought about it for a while as he pulled off the road on a trail that was barely visible. He continued until we were out of sight, then parked in between some large rocks. We got out and went to the back, pulling out our gear. I changed into my reliable desert camouflage, which had served me well in my tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. I took my rifle out of its case, loading the magazine and checking the scope mount to make sure it was all secure. I pulled the foil pack out of a side pouch, tearing it open I took out the unlubricated condom and pulled it over the barrel before securing it with a rubber band. \"The fuck is that for,\" Alex said. \n\n\"Sniper trick from Vietnam, it keeps the water and dust out of the barrel,\" I said. \"Here.\" I tossed him an extra, he had to work it to get it to roll over the huge muzzle brake that his Barrett had. I slung my pack over my shoulders, then slung my trusty M40 rifle over a shoulder. I tested the comms again. \"Lars, you in place?\" \n\n\"I found a good spot, I'm digging in now,\" he said. \n\n\"All right, we're starting to move to our positions now.\" I grabbed Alex's shoulder. \"Keep your eyes open, all right? And stay safe.\" \n\n\"You too. I don't want to have to explain to your mate how you got hurt.\" I laughed as we went different directions, him staying to the opposite side of the road, while I crossed over and made my way through the rocks and sand towards the house. We hadn't wanted our truck to be spotted, so it was a good couple mile hike to the area I had selected on the satellite image. I kept the rock formation between me and the house, hiding my approach from anyone who might be in the area. \n\nI climbed to the top of the rocks and worked my way to the front, searching for something that had the elements I looked for in a good hide. I wanted a good field of view, while still having enough cover and concealment to hide my body. I also wanted to make sure my back side was protected, and ideally have protection from the sun. I passed up a couple possibles, they were too high and could silhouette me. I got lucky on the front side; a large chunk had fallen off, leaving a flat ledge about eight feet deep in between two protruding vertical ridges. Some loose rocks were near the edge that would help hide me from the front. It was perfect. \n\nThere was no safe way to climb my way down the near-vertical rock face in human form. Instead, I used paracord from my pack to lower my rifle, backpack, comm headset and clothes down to the ledge. I then shifted, shaking out my fur before moving down the rocks. My cat was a much stronger climber, and I worked my way below the ledge before moving across and back up. I shifted as I got there, pulling open my pack and getting dressed again. I laid the sleeping bag down first, moving the loose rock away so I'd be fairly comfortable. I'd be here for a long time, days potentially, until she showed up or we gave up. \n\nThe first thing I set up was my spotting scope, which had an integral laser rangefinder. I started drawing the scene, showing distances to the house and other rock formations and points of interest. The ranges were from four to nine hundred plus yards, all well within my abilities. I set my rifle up in front of me, on its bipod with the scope covers on. I chambered a round and removed the scope covers, checking the field of fire. I pulled out my ballistic computer and entered information for elevation, air temperature, humidity, elevation difference and range to the house. The house was a six hundred and twenty-two yards, which was a good medium point to adjust my scope to. I set the scope for the house, and wrote down the adjustments for other targets. \n\n\"Gunny's set up, six hundred southeast of the house, halfway up the rocks,\" I called out. \"Can you see me?\" \n\n\"I watched you climb up there, Gunny, and I still can't see you,\" Alex said. \"I'm set up on top of the tower, two hundred yards off the road and four hundred from the turnoff. You find me.\" \n\nI located his rock tower and started searching. He was decent, but he was no sniper. At the school I ran, students had to move without detection over half a mile while three instructors looked for them. Then they had to find a shooting position and hit a target, all while we looked for them. They only passed if they could stalk and kill without us finding them, and many couldn't pass. The washout rate was high. \"Your ass is sticking up,\" I told him, \"and your rifle barrel is too damn shiny. Use some loose rocks, pile them up to give you some more cover. Wrap the barrel with strips from your camo shirt, mix in some grasses or other vegetation.\" He got busy, and twenty minutes later he was much tougher to pick up. \n\nLars was much tougher to find, after twenty minutes with a spotting scope I still didn't have him. He had to wave his hand for me to pick him up, and I had to do the same for him. We settled into a routine; five minutes focused glassing of the countryside, break a minute, repeat. Along the way, I would repeat the scope adjustments to the various points I had sketched, memorizing them for later. \n\nThe sun was going to set in twenty minutes, and we still had nothing. Alex had stayed fairly busy watching the traffic, using his spotting scope to look for Maitea. \"Wait a minute,\" he called over the radio. \"Possible contact. Southbound, older model F-150, red.\" \n\nI had a view of some parts of the road, so I waited for her car to appear. It looked like her, she had her hair back and a cap on, but the face was right. We watched as she drove past, I could see her looking towards the target house and then back to the road. She didn't slow down, she just kept driving and was soon out of sight. \"Do you think she made us,\" Alex asked. \n\n\"No way she saw us,\" I said. Sure enough, five minutes later her truck was back, this time she pulled into the driveway. She stopped just before she could be seen from the house; as she got out, she checked her pistol before easing the door closed. \"Alex, link your guy and let him know what is going on. Remember, we want her alive.\" \n\nI had my rifle up and was tracking her as she walked up the drive. She was dressed in Wranglers and a plaid shirt with a ballcap, matched with heels. I watched her move slowly along the rocky drive. \"Going for the damsel in distress routine?\" \n\n\"I think so,\" I said. \"Alex, I want you to disable her truck when Lars takes his shot. Lars, we want to wound her. Can you do that?\" \n\n\"She won't go anywhere on one leg,\" he said. \"I'm ready on your signal.\" \n\n\"Alex, tell your guy to turn a light on and show his silhouette in the window, draw her in.\" \n\n\"Got it.\" I saw the light, and she moved towards the house, one hand behind her back as she gripped the pistol in her belt. Lars wasn't the kind of guy to get excited, his voice stayed even as he counted down. \"Four, three, two, one, send it.\" I heard two shots nearly at the same time, a loud boom from my left followed by a bang from the front. Maitea's leg exploded in a red mist, blowing her left calf into a jagged stump as the high-powered round blasted through. Her truck caught on fire as the big fifty-caliber round tore through the gas tank under the bed. \n\nThe Scrabble Killer was rolling on the ground holding her leg, but she didn't give up. I watched her raise her pistol and point it at the house, just before another shot from Lars hit her hand. The pistol shattered along with her fingers. \"Target is down,\" Lars said. \n\n\"Good shooting,\" I said just before another shot rang out. This one was from my right, and I didn't see from where. \n\n\"Fuck I'm hit,\" Lars groaned. I looked at his position, he was holding onto his left shoulder and I could see blood on the rocks behind him. \n\n\"We've got a shooter on the east side,\" Alex said. \"I can't see him from this angle.\" \n\n\"I'll get the shooter, you get to Lars,\" I said. \"Have your guy keep her alive after I stop him.\" I ripped my clothes off and shifted into my panther, there was no time for my human. I leaped down the incline before taking off across the open ground towards the bluffs on the other side. Since neither I nor Alex had spotted him, I had a decent idea where he was set up. My cat was forward in our mind as I scented deeply, my ears forward to listen for any sounds of our prey. I leaped from rock to rock to get to the top of the formation, pausing at the edge to search and finding nothing. I moved quickly across the top, the wide pads of my paws moving me silently towards the far edge. \n\nI smelled him before anything else. I moved to the edge, nearly invisible in the gathering shadows as I peered down. I could hear him breathing now, he wasn't below me yet but it didn't take long. \n\nI stopped about twenty feet above his position; he was set up on the house, waiting for the door to open. I let my claws extend, and roared just before I leaped down onto him. He barely had time to register my presence before my front paws landed on his shoulders, breaking bones and ribs as I drove him to the ground below. He screamed, I roared into his ears. \n\nHe pissed his pants. \n\nI batted him with a paw, knocking him out. I quickly shifted. \"SHOOTER DOWN,\" I yelled. I grabbed his rifle and tossed it into the rocks far below, then rolled him over. \n\nI stilled as I saw who it was. I knew this man. I had trained this man. Hell, I had FOUGHT with this man and it felt like a knife to my gut. Gunny Clayton Matthews, USMC Scout Sniper Instructor. Medically retired after an IED took off his right arm and filled him with shrapnel during fighting in Colorado in the Were War. \n\nHe had taught himself to shoot left-handed. \n\n\"GUNNY, I NEED YOU,\" Alex yelled. I looked up, he was stuck at the bottom of the rock formation. He was naked, having run there in wolf form, but wolves weren't climbers. I left my former buddy behind and picked my way to the ground, then ran across to him. I didn't slow down, I leaped high onto the rock and started my climb up. It only took seconds before I was next to him. \n\nHe was in rough shape. The round had hit him in the left shoulder and moved through his chest, exiting near his spine. \"I'm fucked, Gunny,\" he whispered. \"I can't move my legs, and I'm bleeding out.\" \n\nI pulled a shirt out of his backpack and applied it to the exit wound, trying to stem the blood. \"Hold your fucking shoulder, we'll get help here.\" \n\n\"Don't bullshit me, buddy. I won't last until an ambulance arrives.\" \n\nMy mind knew he was right, my cat didn't like it. \"Let me change you,\" I begged him. \"Let me give you a chance.\" \n\n\"Do it,\" he said. \"I always liked cats.\" Shifting back into my black panther, I watched as he closed his eyes and looked away. I pulled the shirt away from his injured shoulder and bit down, my saliva going directly into his system near the entry hole. I shifted back, resuming the pressure on his wounds, praying to God for a miracle."
