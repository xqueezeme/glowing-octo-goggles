        "Author's Note: \n\nWhew! So glad to be back writing! Well, it seems that most of you all liked the last story, now let me answer some questions 1. No...you may not have my love child! As flattering as it is to have people say they want to have my children, I require that you at least take me to dinner first. Possibly some dancing will be involved. 2. My inspiration for the story comes from the same place all inspiration comes from...too much caffeine, my own personal life, the lives of friends and family and an overactive imagination. 3. Yes, I will write this story all the way to the end. I have my outline all the way written out to the words \"The End.\" It will happen.\n\nMy poor editor, Real Life really pulled their attention hard! So this story has some, only some of their editing help and the rest was done by a good friend who knows more about words than I do. \n\nSo thank you for reading, I hope you continue to enjoy my story.\n\nThis part of my story is dedicated to bearslady, for more than one reason and bearslady only knows two of the reasons why. There are three more reasons but I will never tell! \n\nChapter 27: Feelings\n\nI walked quickly through my fence's gate and crossed the front yard in a straight line for the front door. I could hear Lucretia clumping quickly behind me to keep up. It always made me smile in the past to hear her try to keep up without running when I walk fast. It annoyed her to no end that she had a hard time keeping up with me when she was in her human form! Especially when she was so much taller than me in her battle form. The events that just happened a minute ago in the Gatewatch's house curved back to the forefront of my mind and I grit my teeth while my grin disappeared...\n\nJudge Michael Roberts is Hildy's father!\n\nI slammed open my door and for the first time I ignored all the changes that had been taking place in my home. The carpet in the living room where there once had been plywood floors. Drywall now painted and clean, bookshelves on two sides of the living room with a flat screen TV on the opposite side. I walked through the living room back through Lucretia's room, which was now furnished as a guest room. She still called it \"Her Room\" but spent most of her time with me in my room. She only used it now when she didn't want to go to work with me at night, or when she just wanted some time to herself, which didn't seem to often.\n\nI walked past her bed and her desk that she insisted on having. Lucretia never read on her bed, she insisted that was for sleeping and a desk was for reading. I absently noticed that she now had four shelf stereo systems set at the four corners of the room. Four! After she got two of them, I asked her to explain why she needed more but I still didn't really understand. I opened the sliding glass door and walked out onto the back porch that was newly made out of recycled plastic. It never needed paint, and I could pressure wash it easily to clean it. Also after our first meeting between Lucretia and I, she seemed to feel a mild sense of discomfort on wooden porches, especially when I would lean on the railing. \n\nI walked off the back porch and slowly paced in the back yard. The fruit trees had been pruned, the leaves raked, the grass cut, and the storage shed painted. The house itself had been covered in vinyl siding that was a mild blue and then trimmed in white, and the roof had been repaired. Everything was really coming together; it didn't look at all like the dilapidated wreck of a couple months ago...\n\nAnd I wanted to burn it down! I wanted to run around it with a gas can and touch it off and watch it cave in on itself and become a smoking pile of rubble! Then I wanted to blow a hole the size of a tangerine in Judge Michael's forehead and shit in the hole! Then I wanted to hunt down every single person that so much as gave me a cross-eyed look and give them a bitch slap with a brick! I want them to suffer and hurt! They need to hurt...They need to HURT...THEY NEED TO HURT AND FEEL WHAT I HAVE HAD TO...\n\n\"Master...?\" I heard Lucretia say my name urgently behind me. I snarled as I whipped my head around to stare at her. She had changed to full battle ready. Six feet tall, at least two hundred pounds of lean frame that was immensely stronger than it looked. Black claws and long talon like spurs, her wings flexed and almost shivered as her mouth opened in a silent pant. Her head was tilted, almost bird-like, as she regarded me with a mixture of curiosity, apprehension, and excitement.\n\n\"...Who do we...kill...Master?\" Lucretia asked between slow breaths. Her tongue licked her lower lip and her right hand squeezed her breast before sliding over her stomach. My eyebrows raised and all thoughts of violence fled in surprise at her question. Who do we...what...kill? I don't want to kill anyone, well, honestly I was letting those thoughts rage out of control for a little bit there, but I would never actually want to kill anyone. I had planned on going down to the basement and working out to get rid of those aggressive feelings. That followed by a good shower and a nap then go to work and come home with maybe a pizza or something. Lucretia liked the all vegetarian with white sauce and bacon instead of tomatoes. Truth be told I liked it too. However seeing Lucretia all ready to declare war kinda killed those emotions in me. And now she is looking at me like...like...\n\n\"Gregory you are so...RAAH!\" She almost wailed in frustrated rage. She eyed me, looking me up and down from the toes of my shoes to the hair on my head. Then turned and stalked back into the house, changing as she walked without even bothering with clothes and I saw her cute rosy ass cheeks as she opened and then slammed shut the sliding room door to her room while giving me a baleful look over her shoulder. Then she closed the curtains and I heard another faint yell of frustration. I could just see her flopping on her bed and clutching a pillow to her face as she yelled into it in my mind's eye!\n\nNow what got her tail tied in a knot? I walked up to the sliding door and gently knocked on it.\n\n\"Go away!\" Came the immediate reply. I thought about forcing my way in but a couple of things stopped me. Yes, this was my house and I make the rules and I don't appreciate being kept out of somewhere in my own home. This was Lucretia's room though; I had given it to her for her to use and to have space to herself. I had to respect that and give her space if she needed it. She had done very well in obeying me and in learning all the little lessons I had been teaching. As bad as I wanted to find out what was wrong and fix it, I needed to let her come to me. Or...is this a test? Does she want me to go in and try to talk to her? Or...\n\nA man could go crazy understanding women...and Lucretia is a succubae! I decided to go downstairs into the basement and work out.\n\nMy basement was left alone during the remodel. The workers were told not to go down, and the door was kept locked at all times. For some reason I enjoyed using my homemade workout equipment, and scavenged mirrors. I fell into my regular routine of running in place, stretching, isometrics and then using my weights. Then I began practicing my forms...some people call them \"Katas\" but I have never really been big on ceremony in that regard. I was really working up a sweat so I took my shirt off and then caught my reflection in the mirror. I looked different, very different! I must have lost at least 10 pounds!\n\nA shiver ran up my spine as I realized my extra camouflage weight was slipping. I guess working out with Lucretia was a good weight loss program, but I can't afford this. I need my extra padding so I look soft and doughy, if I am attacked I need that element of surprise. I was just heading up the stairs to raid the freezer for ice cream when Lucretia met me on the steps and pushed me back with a hot stare!\n\n\"You can't do this to me Gregory!\" She snarled through gritted teeth. Her eyes were black in her human face and her claws on the tips of her fingers kept trying to grow.\n\n\"I have been good, haven't I?\" She asked as she began to pace in my basement. I just watched her, letting her spout. She came up to one of my hanging bags as she stalked by and negligently hit it...hard! The canvas strap tore loose with a pop from the stitching and the bag fell from the chain to hit the floor. Lucretia kicked it, sending it rolling and tumbling to the far wall.\n\n\"I haven't killed or drained anyone...though I had cause. I followed your rules...but you can't tempt me like this!\" She told me in a frustrated tone. Her eyes turned back to look at me and the black began to fade, and then it rushed back in until they were dark inky pools. She shuddered and clutched her stomach. I came closer and filled with concern I put my hand on her shoulder. She backed away quickly and then stood with fists clenched.\n\n\"Don't touch me! Not yet...you are my ...friend, my Master. But not...not right now!\" She panted. \n\n\"What is wrong? Lucretia if you don't tell me what's up I am still in the dark over here.\" I asked in exasperation. \n\nMy succubus fidgeted and then used both hands to rub her arms crossing them over her body as if she was cold.\n\n\"I feel your emotions, and I have new emotions to add to the few that I do have...\" She paused, considering her words.\n\n\"I am surrounded by food, I can just reach out and drain anyone I see. I have been distracted from it by having all of these new feelings to explore and understand.\" \n\nShe took several steps closer to me and looked me right in my eyes. \"I end things, I destroy...it is who and what I am. I have suppressed that with all of the distractions but feeling what you felt, the white hot heat of it...I...I...oh GREG!\" She turned and began pacing again her fists clenched and rose squeezing the sides of her head.\n\n\"I want to kill something!\" She moaned. \"I need to sink my teeth into an enemy and feel that energy slither down into me! I need to do it! And when I felt your rage I thought I was going to be able to satisfy that need...and then, it went away! IT just LEFT!\" That last sentence ended in a wail as she punched my heavy bag and broke the seam along its side and saw dust began spilling out through the tear.\n\n\"I don't know how to turn it off Greg! Master...I don't know how to put it away!\" Her hands clutched her throat, stroking it and then squeezing. \n\n\"Help me...please?\" she whispered.\n\nHow in the...? Hello! You are going to ask the guy with a Door that for all intents and purposes I locked myself away from, I guess myself? I am sooooo not the right person to field this. I am a case study myself for bottling tendencies, how can I help her. I hurt for her, because I know what it is like to suppress and ignore yourself. Wait, does that mean this entire time....\n\n\"Lucretia?\" I asked, and she looked at me. \"If you want to, why haven't you, uhm...killed anyone? Is it because I told you not to? Is it because of the mixing thing Gwen was talking about, you having my morals?\"\n\nShe shook her head fiercely, \"No, I have free will. I don't because you would be mad at me and...and...because I want to see what happens next.\" \n\nMy mouth fell open, \"See what happens next, what do you mean?\"\n\nShe shuddered and fell to her knees. \"If I went and started drinking up all the energy I could you would hate me and not want me and then the Gatewatch would destroy me or send me home...\" She panted a few times and then grimaced, still clutching herself. \n\n\"I like it here! I like the air, I like the people, and I like having a place that feels like it's mine! I like having a Master who is not a Master, I l...I like you Gregory Bastion Brooks, and I want to stay. But it is so hard and I don't know how to make it stop!\"\n\nI dropped to my knees in front of my friend and held her tight. My mind was whirling and jumbled like two mice trying to run on the same wheel in opposite directions. Human emotions pushed into a succubae who is only equipped with the bare necessities of feelings, that must feel like trying to carry Jell-O in a paper napkin. You can do it, only very carefully.\n\nI thought about emotion, what do we do with it? How to control it or channel it? As humans we have a ton of emotions. Guys tend to think more with their heads than their hearts, while gals think more with their hearts than their heads, generally speaking. Would a girl better be able to help Lucretia?\n\nNo, I am the one who is here, and I am her Master, Lucretia is my responsibility and my friend. No way am I going to foist her off onto someone else. So what was I originally thinking about? Emotions...channeling...got it. Before all of...THIS happened to me, what did I used to do? My Door inside started to give me grief as I pressed against it. Then suddenly from the back of my mind an old memory long forgotten came to me and it made me smile. I had an idea.\n\n\"Lucretia?\"\n\n\"WH...what?\" she responded, still shivering in my arms.\n\n\"You never had a problem with your feelings before...why now?\" I asked.\n\n\"I had so few before, now I have many...so MANY!\" she blurted the last, almost yelling it.\n\n\"You are still you right? You just have more options than you did before.\"\n\nShe pulled back a little and looked into my face, it was so weird to see black eyes crying.\n\n\"All the...options keep crowding in, it's a tangle! I can't pick just one!\" she said in a tired voice.\n\nI put my hands on her shoulders and then lifted my left hand to cup her face, my thumb gently trailing along her cheek sliding through her tear tracks.\n\n\"Repeat after me...okay...I will help you.\" I said. I actually wasn't sure if this would help or not, but it was worth a shot, and my heart ached seeing her like this.\n\nWhen I was younger I loved poetry. It would lift me up and I loved the way the words sounded saying them out loud. If you think about it the poets' way back in the day were the original rap stars of their time. They just didn't have enough of a bass beat to put their words too!\n\nLucretia's hand came up to hold mine against her face; she closed her eyes and bowed her head. Slowly her hair dissolved and her horns showed and she changed into all grey skin, tail, and wings. Her voice was low and soft but I could hear it even though her head was bowed.\n\n\"Speak...my Master.\"\n\nThen I spoke to her, a poem that helped me a lot when times were hard back in high school. Also later on in my life with work and relations with other people. Maybe it could help my succubus with her troubles.\n\n\"Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole.\n\nI thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.\" \n\nI said it with a slow rolling cadence, carefully enunciating each word. She paused, and then repeated it. I kept on until the last verse, and I could feel her shivering begin to subside. It actually quit completely and her head rose to look me in the eyes again, a small fierce smile on her face as she spoke.\n\n\"It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll.\n\nI am the Master of MY fate. I am the Captain of MY soul!\"\n\nHer finger's trailed my face and her eyes seemed to stare at me searchingly.\n\n\"Did you write that, my Greg?\" She asked softly.\n\n\"I wish!\" I chuckled. \"It was written by some guy named William Henley who was kind of a sick kid growing up. He wrote it to show that though stuff may beat on you and make you feel bad you are still the one in control of yourself...no one else. I memorized back in school and it has helped me before, I thought it might help you.\"\n\nLucretia took her hand from my face and closed her eyes, thinking. \"I would like to meet this...Henley. It would be interesting to see what I could learn from him.\" She looked at me questioningly, \"Does he live near here?\"\n\nI coughed into my hand, \"Actually he is dead, died back in like 1900 or around there. There's books about him, we could go to the library or you could use the Internet to look him up?\" Lucretia froze when she heard he was dead, and her eyes began to tear up, then I saw her mouth faintly form the words of the poem and no tears fell. She looked at me in surprise and then threw her grey arms around my neck and kissed me!\n\n\"It worked! I am the Master! Not my emotions!\" She growled in triumph. I was stunned too. I didn't know if it was going to work, it just felt right to offer it. My next idea was to play Monopoly or Scrabble...anything to take her mind off of what it was on. She scampered back up the stairs and I picked up my shirt. I had just walked up the stairs and decided to take a shower when the doorbell rang. Honestly I really wasn't sure who it would be, but I had a sneaky suspicion Hildy was coming over. If it was her, I didn't know if I wanted to talk to her yet about her dad and all. The problem is that I took so long thinking about it Lucretia opened the door anyway before I could tell her to ignore it.\n\n\"Hi!\" I heard her say brightly. \"Who are you?\" \n\nChapter 28: Judge\n\nI moved to the living room where the front door was and I saw, Judge Roberts. He was standing in the doorway still in his turtleneck and grey suit looking Lucretia over from head to foot.\n\n\"Succubus...\" he said it in a skilled way that I don't know how to recreate. It was both a greeting and put down all in one. Then he saw me and I could feel, something. Maybe it was because my emotions were still a jumble from helping Lucretia or maybe it was the fact that Hildy and I were getting along again or maybe I still suck at getting my head on straight but I had no idea what I was feeling when I looked at Judge Roberts. I felt pride, fear, annoyance, anger, regret...and a whole bunch of other things. Made no sense to me so I called up my Sight and took a peek.\n\n\"May I come in?\" the Judge asked calmly. \n\nMy Sight told another story. I saw a hulking brown wolf at least a head taller than Hildy's form and it looked like it wanted to take a \"Bite out of Crime!\" Namely, my chest or neck. As I scanned him I started to see why he was Alpha though. I had also been practicing with my Sight, and I started to recognize different things that it showed me. I could see hundreds of little threads that wafted in from all directions as far as the eye could see and some even from the direction of my neighbors. He was the leader of a very large pack of wolves and that means he is connected to them all. I would have to ask Hildy later about the particulars, but it did seem kind of interesting.\n\n\"Are you going to attack me, or try to hurt me like you did in Hildy's home?\" I asked dryly. I was mentioning how he had tried to do the hand squeeze in shaking my hand. He shook his head in the negative.\n\n\"Speak up Judge, just like in court. Doesn't count unless you say the words your Honor!\" Okay, so I was not really all that calm. I couldn't keep all the irritation out of my voice. What the heck was he doing here? Why would he even WANT to be here?\n\nI saw his jaw firm and he said, \"I will not harm you or yours while I am in your home or on your property...will that suffice?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"That's fine, come in...want some coffee?\" I was turning into the kitchen when I heard Lucretia growl. I looked over my shoulder and saw her, still in human form standing in the doorway staring up at the Alpha. His eyes had tightened and he had started snarl in return when Lucretia spoke. \n\n\"Greg trusts you to keep your word...I do not. I have smelled your kind before Were, and I know how much you value your word!\" She spat that last sentence like she had when she spat out a dip of wintergreen tobacco she snuck from my can of chew.\n\n\"I am watching you...\" she finished quietly and then stood aside for the Judge to pass. He just gave her a toothy grin and stalked passed her to the kitchen where I was pouring a cup of coffee for him.",
        "\"Cream and sugar?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just some cream.\" He replied.\n\nIt was surreal, just last night, or early this morning depending on how you look at it, I had served Lucretia's dad coffee and now it was Hildy's dad. Trouble always seems to come in groupings like this. Actually, just having a judge in my house was trouble in and of itself, no need for groupings here. He looked around my kitchen and then up at the ceiling, sniffing every now and then.\n\n\"Your home is lovely...\" he began, and Lucretia interrupted, loudly.\n\n\"Say one bad thing about MY home and I will tear your hide from your body to make slippers for MY Greg!\"\n\nHe blinked at her; I tried not to smile so I concentrated on making Lucretia her cup of coffee and placed in front of her, then smoothed her hair back from her ear and gently rubbed her earlobe. I had found out it did the same thing as when I rubbed the base of her horns in her other forms.\n\n\"Excuse me, Judge Roberts?\" I got his attention and he looked at me instead of my roommate. \"I can assume you came over here to talk to me, so no offense...could we talk and you go. I honestly do not feel comfortable having you in my home.\"\n\nHe slightly narrowed his eyes at me and took a sip of coffee; he glanced at it, and took another slower sip with a murmur of appreciation. I had been tempted to mix him up a cup of flavor crystal Folgers coffee, instead I had served him a well brewed pot of 100% pure Kona. Just because I would not piss on the Judge if he were on fire doesn't mean I should be rude to him while he is in my, I mean, our house.\n\n\"Then I will get right to the point...\" he began, and set his mug on the table after polishing it off in one long swallow. \"I want to know how you got this house.\" He folded his hands and waited for my response. I just shrugged. \n\n\"I had been looking for a place to live since I didn't really want to live with my parents anymore, this house showed up with the owner desperate to sell for some reason. My Dad paid for it and gifted it to me...I still am making payments back to him. I had told him I didn't want it as a gift and he could hold the mortgage, but he insisted saying I needed a place of my own.\" That had really surprised me, but I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth!\n\nJudge Roberts nodded and then reached inside of his jacket, Lucretia growled and I got ready to put up my shield. He just calmly pulled out his checkbook.\n\n\"How much do you want for your house?\" He said, lifting his head to look at me, his pen poised.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I said in surprised.\n\n\"How much do you want for your house? I will offer you two million dollars and thirty days to vacate the premises.\" He started filling out the check, but left the amount blank.\n\nI shook my head and his lips thinned a little. \"Very well, two and a half million...\" I waved a hand to cut him off.\n\n\"Wait...no. I understood you; you want to buy my house. But why?\" I asked. \n\n\"It should be obvious to you, I don't want my daughter living so close to undesirable elements.\" He glanced at Lucretia, and pinned me with a hard stare.\n\nLucretia looked like she was going to pop her top! I was surprised as well. Trevor and Suzanne Gwen and Jemima's parents or patron or Sires or whatever didn't seem to have a major issue. So why....\n\n\"Explain please...?\" I asked quietly. Judge Michael Roberts sighed and drummed his fingers on the table.\n\n\"I don't have to explain anything, but I will since you seem to be a bright young man. I don't want my daughter living next to a felon who summons outsiders. She is a good woman who will someday take my place as leader of our pack and I do not want your or that thing's influence on her.\" \n\nIt took me a second to get what he meant by that \"Thing\" and when it did I got a little hot under the collar. I had my own bone to pick with him though.\n\n\"My roommate aside...felon? You have a hard time thinking about your daughter living next door to a sex offender? Or is it you have a hard time explaining to Hildy how an innocent man in your courtroom got smacked with a guilty verdict when you knew the truth?\"\n\nGive the man credit he didn't bat an eye, \"Both. You may have been innocent before, but you certainly aren't now. How many people have you hurt Mr. Brooks? Hmmm? I have six different hospital medical reports of people who you put in there. As for having a hard time explaining things to my daughter. I just told her what I had done was for the good of the pack.\"\n\nI stepped back from the table now, standing with my back to the counter. Lucretia was holding eerily still watching the events unfold swiveling her head back and forth to keep us both in view.\n\n\"Wait, how is my becoming a felon good for the pack?\" I was trying to keep my voice level, but a quiver of rage was starting to come through. This man was telling me that he...\n\n\"Think back to your trial Gregory...it took place during an election year. We all have to be seen as cracking down hard on crime at that point in time. It makes us look good. I have hundreds, no; thousands of people that look to me for leadership in my pack alone, and I need to be in a position of authority to do what is best for my people. I need to be able to protect them, look out for them. They are my family you might say, and I will do much to protect my family!\"\n\nI was having a hard time breathing as I tried to comprehend the enormity of his words. \"You mean...to tell me...you sold me out to get a few more points to keep your position as judge?\" My voice was tight and my words wheezed.\n\n\"Not completely. In a case of he said she said like yours was, and the fact that you were an honest sort who told the cops everything so they could use it against you. It was too close. Maybe if you had cried more than she did on the witness stand I could have swung it your way because of sympathy.\" He gave a malicious little grin. \"Honestly Greg...telling everything to the police without an attorney present? Believing that you were innocent would protect you? I figured getting you out of the gene pool would make all humans a little bit smarter. You know, survival of the fittest?\"\n\nI wanted to KILL him! But I took a deep breath and offered him a little smile in return.\n\n\"Well, thank you for answering that question for me. The reason I couldn't rent an apartment and can only get shit jobs and get attacked randomly by strangers is I was just one of the many innocents sacrificed to keep your position for the good of your pack. Nice to know.\"\n\nHe shrugged, \"Not many inncocents, last election year there were only about 7 or so.\" I clenched my jaw and then took several deep breaths. He seemed to be enjoying watching me get angry, I glanced over at Lucretia, and she was deathly still, her eyes black and still watching us both. I wondered why she wasn't flying off the handle yet!\n\n\"So...Mr. Brooks, two million and a half to buy your house? It's a little over twice the asking price even with it all being refurbished.\" Judge Roberts asked.\n\n\"No.\" I said, and my voice was calm, it didn't shake. Not even a little...well maybe a little but give me a break I am trying to keep my cool here.\n\nThe muscle in his jaw tightened and he glared at me. \"I watched this neighborhood carefully. I monitored who came and who left. I made sure that this area was full of good people for my daughter. There was never any mention of you. Now I find out you lived here for over a YEAR and just now I find out about you? I am offering you a chance to get out of here peacefully and gain a great deal financially. The next time I ask, I may be a bit more rude than I am now...do I make myself clear?\" His voice was quiet and cold. I did not doubt that he could make my life hell if he wanted. Well I had been through a kind of hell before, but I wasn't going to be pushed around anymore.\n\nI leaned forward onto the table and said, \"Bring it on Cujo. Or should I say Benji? I will think about those threats you just made at the next barbeque your daughter invites me too. I will remember it and laugh to myself as I see her take a bite of homemade elk sausage I am going to bring over just for her.\" I gave him a broad wink and a smile. \n\n\"Now get your hairy ass out of my chair and out of my house...I don't like the scent of wet dog.\" I grinned showing my teeth and kept my eyes on his. Like HELL was I going to blink first! His face rippled and I saw his eyes gleam amber light, it made me smile wider.\n\n\"Please, oh please change Mister Zulu Wolf. I would love a chance to beat you down. Lucretia and I could double team you and I could have a new rug in front of the television to clean my shoes off on!\" I mock pleaded.\n\nHis face calmed and his look of disgust was so palpable I could almost physically feel it! \"You are a small, little boy. Do remember that I tried to be peaceful about this.\" With that said he got up and collected his checkbook and headed for the door. Just before he walked out Lucretia spoke and her voice sounded dreamy, but intense.\n\n\"Were Alpha...\" Judge Michael Roberts turned to look at my roommate. Her horns were showing through her hair and her black eyes stared hard at her hands that were growing black nails on the fingertips. She had his coffee cup in one hand and used her long pointed tongue to lick all around the rim. Then she swallowed and grinned showing sharp pointed teeth.\n\n\"I have your scent!\"\n\nThe Judge left without a word or backward glance. I watched him walk out and close the gate in the door behind him. I stood there at the window thinking about what transpired and getting a handle on my rage when I heard a small grinding crack and whispering behind me.\n\n\"Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole...\" \n\nI turned to see Lucretia staring at the broken pieces of mug in her hand, then she made a retching noise and ran into the kitchen where I heard her throw up!\n\nI went after her slowly and heard her give a small choked sob. I came around the corner and saw her with her hair hanging down and back bent breathing hard into the sink. I came up behind her and put a comforting hand on her back and held her hair as she drank from the spigot to wash her mouth out.\n\n\"I suddenly realized that I had his taste in my mouth and that I...that I had swallowed it!\" She muttered thickly, and then coughed spitting again in the sink. \"I don't want that Were's scent or taste or presence near me!\"\n\n\"Yeah, he is not one of the good guys.\" I drawled as I rubbed a hand gently on her back. Lucretia shook her head and coughed again. \n\n\"He doesn't really see himself that way. He sees himself as a protector and champion for his people. He sees all others as less than what he is. That is why he spoke to you the way he did Master.\" She choked again, and then relaxed. She stretched her neck, tipping it from side to side then walked towards the bathroom.\n\n\"I'm going to go brush my teeth Greg, something tastes funny in my mouth and it's not what I left in the sink!\" \n\nI snorted, then looked in the kitchen sink and winced. Maybe I should install one of those waste disposal sink grinders in there. When had Lucretia eaten calamari? I cleaned up the sink and thought a bit to myself. I now had the judge as a threat in my life to add to all the others, I needed to warn my family. I sent my dad a text to make sure he and mom were home, they were. I thought about taking Lucretia with me, and then decided against it. I think dad and I needed to have a good father/son talk time. Maybe since I was meeting everyone else's parents it made me start to appreciate my own a little more.\n\nWho am I kidding? I appreciate them a LOT more!\n\nLucretia came out and smiled at me with a crest white smile and gave me a soft smooch and a hug.\n\n\"By the way roomie...\" I said to her, \"...you look, really good when you get scary like that! When you threatened the judge as he walked out the door, every other thing on this planet looked drab and dull to how hot you were then!\" She giggled and wiggled closer into my arms and gave me a longer softer kiss.\n\n\"I didn't like him saying those things to you. He talked like Seneca does, my eldest sister, she says things that don't mean exactly what you think they mean but expects you to know exactly what she means.\" She pulled her head back and stroked the fingers of one hand through my short hair. \n\n\"Kind of like how you talk sometimes but you do it in a way that makes me smile.\" She grinned and kissed my cheek. \n\n\"I need to go an visit my parents, and I would like to go alone. But before I go, your dad gave me something to give to you.\" Lucretia's ears perked, I swear they did. She followed me up the stairs to my room where I opened my sock drawer and pulled out the small stone of obsidian. I gently placed it in her palm and watched as she tapped it and rolled it around in her palm slowly. She took it to the window to let the sunlight play over it's every facet, then did the same thing with the light from my desk lamp. Then she did what I expected of her and she swallowed it.\n\n\"Does it have some special significance?\" I asked her.\n\n\"It's from my Papa...\" She replied. I waited for more but that was all she said. \n\n\"What is it you like so much about stones?\" I asked again. She shrugged. \n\n\"I just always have. When I was home with my Mother and sisters I loved exploring the castle and listening to the rocks and seeing the histories through different layers in each one. Sometimes a rock would break and then I could see all the different colors in them and read the stories of their lives.\" She put a finger to her chin and cocked a hip while thinking.\n\n\"It is like reading a book but you don't see words so much as pictures.\" She said to finish off her thought. \n\nI was flabbergasted...well, not really. It made sense to me, sort of. I'm human so I can't pick up on the subtle nuances of the language of rocks. I have a hard time learning even one human language, though it makes me curious if cement is actually considered a rock and if it had it's own language?\n\nI grabbed my coat and hat and boots since I would be going to work after seeing my family, Lucretia wanted to come with me, I said no. I didn't say it like that. I said I wanted some time alone with my family, and then I would go to work and be back in the morning. I even told her she could be in my room while I was gone this time. That surprised her and she asked me why the change in rules.\n\n\"You have shown you can be trusted and you also have remembered to put my things back where you found them, so let's see how you do with this, okay?\"\n\nLucretia got a little teary eyed again, how in the world had I missed that this woman is an emotional rollercoaster?\n\n\"You are so much more different than my old master.\" She said softly and then kissed the back of my hand.\n\n\"You know, one of these days we are going to need to talk about your old Master and see just how bad he was, I am just hoping I don't make any of the mistakes he made with you.\" I gave a smile to show her I was teasing but she didn't smile back.\n\n\"I am getting to know you very well Greg, I believe it would be impossible for you to make the mistakes that he did. You are just not that sort of being.\" I saw that this conversation was now starting to trouble her so I just patted her on the shoulder and told her to call me if there was trouble. I got into my little white truck and decided to call William while I was heading to my folks.\n\n\"Hello, This the Abernathy residence. This is Mr. Abernathy's personal assistant how may I help you?\" I heard a sweet voice say.\n\n\"Ummm...Nancy?\" I said.\n\n\"Oh hi Gregory!\" Nancy gushed into the phone. \"Do you need to talk to William?\"\n\nI wondered again how Nancy, my friend the talking rat could answer the phone with no thumbs. He must have it set up for conference call or something and she just presses the appropriate button or something. Heck, a rotary phone would be like a mini carousel wheel for her!\n\n\"No that's alright. If you could just take a message for him that would be great.\" I told her. I heard some scratching and her muttering quietly to herself the time and the date and then her voice piped up, \"Ready Gregory!\"\n\n\"Umm, Judge Michael Roberts the head of the local werewolf pack was the judge at my trial and now has it in for me. Tried to buy my house for over two million dollars and made some veiled threats, any advice would be appreciated.\" I waited and heard Nancy writing, seriously...how did she write? She is a rat for Pete's sake! Maybe she has an inkwell and dips her paw in then writes out the letters then has a little bowl of lemon water to clean off her claws...\n\nDude...that would be adorable!\n\n\"Okay, I have it written down...\" her voice stopped and I heard her mutter a little to herself, then she came back on the line. \"Gregory, you said a trial? Are you okay?\"\n\nI sighed; I wasn't going to get into this now.\n\n\"Ask me later Nancy...or just ask William. And physically I am fine but no, I am not okay.\" \n\nI heard her voice quaver a little. \"Is there anything I can do to help you? I owe you so much already, I would be happy to...\"\n\n\"Just make sure Will gets my message Nancy. I would appreciate it.\"\n\nI continued on out of the city, and down past large stretches of farmland. My parents live on some acreage by a river, been in the family a long time. Got some big huge trees and some quiet pastures. They once had been rented out for farmland but after Dad won the small lottery he had turned back into pasture. He lets our neighbor's cows feed on it as well, that way he doesn't have to mow it.\n\nI let my mind wander, as I drove, not to the point where I was not watching where I was driving, of course. It just gave me time to think a little. As a person I can only stay mad for so long, it's against my nature to constantly dwell on something negative that keeps me angry. Anger as we all know, takes a lot of energy to maintain. Sure it is a great source of strength, like when I bring back the dumpsters after a long shift and as I do a drive by to check the others that weren't full...I find out that while I was emptying the others the late night shifts were putting in overtime over the holidays and filled the other twenty! Then I get angry and finish the last dumpsters then the anger goes away and I sleep like a rock!\n\nI guess a better way to put it is that I have learned to set my anger aside over the years; it's still there waiting for me, like today meeting the judge. I have a literal metric crap ton of rage waiting for me to pick it up and use it! I just choose not to...why you ask?\n\nI am afraid that once I put it back on again I may not take it off!\n\nA righteous anger is when you are in the right on one end of a situation and the other is clearly wrong. You are justified to take the stance you are and that fuels you to fight on and push your cause or whatever. Knowing that I am innocent I have what to my mind is a righteous anger. Thing is, I know from what the judge told me, he feels that he was right to do what he did as well. Like that old saying says, \n\n\"No one is a villain in their own eyes.\" \n\nTo break that down further think of it like this. We all love our cat when it is hunting mice, but I bet the mice hate that mean ol' pussycat! It's all a matter of perspective. Now I kind of regret what I said to the judge. He may be a mean, hardhearted son of a gun, but there was no excuse for me to attack him verbally the way I did. I can't change what he did to me, and how he tarnished my good name in front of others. I can be civil and not...\n\nMy front wheels blew and my car started to list! I frantically tried steering but it was sluggish and non responsive! I took my foot off the gas and began to coast to a stop, my wheels making horrid noises as I wrestle my truck to the left side of the road. I put my car in park, turned off the ignition, and put my keys in my coat pocket. I looked around and saw some rolling hills with trees dotted here and there on them in small groves. I guess I was about 4 miles or so from my folks. I pulled out my cell phone to tell them I would be late when my driver side window burst in and I reflexively threw up my arms to protect my face!",
        "A hand grabbed me and ripped me out of my truck. It broke my seat belt and I felt something tear in my shoulder at the same time making me scream! Then I was sent flying and tumbling across the road. I rolled into the deep ditch, narrowly missing bashing my head into a culvert. I lay there, stunned, trying to get my breath back. I heard a chorus of growls around me; their deep bass thrum echoing in my chest making it even harder to breathe than before. I looked up and saw four faces staring down at me, all long muzzles and exposed teeth from lips pulled back into snarls. Then one spoke,\n\n\"Gregory Bastion Brooks. The Alpha Michael Roberts says Hello!\"\n\nChapter 29: Fight\n\nThe first thing going through my mind...I couldn't tell you. It was all a jumble. I kept on waiting for my fight or flight response to kick in, but I guess I was too stunned.\n\n\"This is what the Judge was so worried about? This thing?\" I heard one of them say. He bent down, smelled me and I recoiled back from him making him give a barking laugh that sounded ugly.\n\n\"I smell magic on him, why isn't he using it?\" One of them muttered. His hand, or paws...are they hands or paws when they are all human-wolf shaped? Funny what actually does go through ones mind when scared and hurt, nothing useful that's for sure.\n\n\"Wha...wha yoo wan...?\" I wheezed, and then took a deep breath to get some oxygen back into my blood. It hurt to breathe in that deep, I wondered if I had broken something in my fall? Wouldn't be surprised, it all had happened before I could focus to get my shield in place. I thought about bringing it up now, but right then my shoulder really started to make itself known! My mouth opened up in another groan and then a grimace of pain.\n\n\"You turned our Alpha down, from selling him your house. We are going to make sure that you understand it would be good for you to do what he wants.\" The one who ripped me out of the truck said. \n\nI sat upright in the ditch and stared at all of the faces around me in surprise and I just blurted the first words that came to me.\n\n\"Already? He is starting with the terror tactics already? We just spoke like an hour ago in my kitchen!\"\n\nThe one furthest from me cocked an ear. It was the first time he heard me speak, well, the wheezing and the groans don't count. He leaned in closer.\n\n\"Hey, I know this guy. He was at Miss Robert's barbeque once when I was there. You sure this is the right guy?\"\n\nThe one closest to me snarled and said, \"Get your head back in the hunt! What the Alpha says we do, got it!?\"\n\nThe first speaker hushed, but didn't look so enthusiastic before. Huh...I wonder...\n\nI activated my Sight and now I saw things reversed. Before, I would see the animal past the human as a specter type image of some sort. Like a ghost if that helps you better to understand. Now it's the human image taking the back seat to the animal form. The first three I didn't recognize, the fourth one who seemed unsure, I knew him. Not his name, but I knew his face!\n\n\"Wasn't it a pain in the ass digging out the swimming pool?\" I said. \"I brought over some lean ground chuck that we made some awesome burgers out of. For some reason I remember you eating more hotdogs though, why was that?\"\n\nThere was a pause then I heard him say, \"I was hungry, the hot dogs were done faster.\" I smiled and then when I shifted I felt something \"pop\" inside me about halfway down my chest. I felt something warm trickle in my body and I knew that was bad. I coughed and spat out blood...that was really bad!\n\n\"Hey man, he's hurt bad! Weren't we just going to rough him up some?\" my nameless buddy said. The first one growled back as a response.\n\n\"We have our orders, I have mine. If he lives or dies, the Alpha gets what he wants. He is already prepared to call the others to deal with the outsider for when he passes.\" I turned bleary eyes to him.\n\n\"What did you say?\" I asked and spat more blood onto the ground. He looked down at me in the ditch, eyes narrowed. \n\n\"I said, when you die, he is going to get the old members of the Gatewatch to deal with your outsider. Then we can put this whole sordid mess behind us.\"\n\nHe was going after Lucretia? MY Lucretia? Why? She hadn't done anything to him! I was the one he wanted; I was the one in the way! Well Lucretia could handle herself; she could tear his hide off and make it into a trampoline. Then I remembered when Gwen, Hildy and Jemima had shown up at my work, and nearly banished her. The only reason they hadn't been able to was because of my interference. If he got Trevor and Suzanne to help him...he could...\n\nNo...she is mine, they will not touch her.\n\nNo...She is Mine, they will not touch her!\n\nNO...SHE is MINE!\n\nSHE...IS...\n\n\"Hey boss...what's he saying?\" One of the wolves tipped his head closer down to me taking a sniff...I realized I had been muttering to myself. A cold pressure was flowing into me, a heat that chilled me to the bone. A loud pounding silence that throbbed in a discordant cadence timed to the trip hammer beating of my heart. I looked directly into the wolf's eyes and smiled. I could feel my own blood dripping from my teeth as I whispered...\n\n\"...MINE!\"\n\nMy shoulder screeched in protest as my left arm shot up, wreathed in the light blue pulse of my power. I didn't care! These assholes were going to hurt my friend, so I was going to hurt them, how dare they! I heard his snarl cut off into a whine, then a few loud cracks as I crushed his throat and vertebrae in my grip. I let him go and his lifeless body flopped down, unmoving except for nerve twitches. The second wolf leapt on top of me, either trying to smother me or just get in close to use his claws and teeth. His blows couldn't get past my shield, but suddenly he was giving yelps of pain and jumped out of the hole with me clinging to him.\n\nWith him being that close I didn't have to reach out and grab him. My range is about two inches over my entire body. I gripped two inches into his body wherever he touched me, so now my chest and arms held firm to him! He crawled out of the ditch taking me with him. I braced myself and used my power to yank myself away from him, ripping off muscle and skin wherever I pulled back and away. He fell to the ground and began scratching the dirt, and then started scrambling away. \n\nI couldn't have that! The power carried me across the ground before my brain had time to register what I was doing and I dropped kicked his head so hard and so fast I forgot to fully harden the shield around my foot. I dimly felt things, a lot of things shatter at the point of impact, but I didn't care. They had to die...They All Had to DIE!\n\nThe leader gave a long loud howl that carried on the still air, and then the werewolf roared as he rushed me.\n\n\"Bring it! Bring it you FUCK!\" I screamed at him and zipped right into his charge. My shield was so strong it was opaque, I didn't need to see I could feel my target. I dug my fingers into what felt like his chest, the strength of my power rushing through me. My enemy's roars turned to pained yelps as his powerful blows impacted my shield. It didn't matter, I had a hold on him and I was not going to let go! I heard terrible cracking noises as I pulled my arms apart and the screaming cries of my enemy suddenly went silent. I let my shield weaken so I could see again and the gory ruin of my enemy lay at my feet, his blood seeping into the earth.\n\nI heard a noise and turned my head to see a naked black man staring at me, and looking a little queasy.\n\n\"You killed them, you killed them all!\" He put his hands on his head and stared at the carnage on the ground. I exhaled and I could see my breath condense into vapor. Then I coughed and spat blood again. \n\n\"Leave, tell your Alpha what happened. You will not take what is mine. I have given enough and he's taken all that I am going to give. He tries to do this again to me and mine I will bring a storm down on him that will make him beg for death...do you understand me?\"\n\nHe nodded and turned and began to change, and then he stopped and looked back.\n\n\"I don't know all of what happened to who and for what reason but...\" he looked around at the dead bodies of his partners. \"...but I am really sorry man.\" He looked past me and then he finished changing before taking off at a run through the field towards the low hills and their trees.\n\nI didn't know what he was so sorry about until I heard a howl come from behind me. I looked back the opposite direction the wolf was running and saw six more wolves coming towards me from the other side of the road! The howl that leader gave must have summoned reinforcements.\n\nI was shaking, I guess my adrenaline or whatever had run it's course and I was crashing. I felt tears coming to my eyes; of sadness or anger I don't know. Maybe both now that I think on it. I braced myself for the attack, planning on which I would take first. The big one in the middle looked like a good candidate. Grab him with a hardened shield, though I wasn't sure how long I could maintain it with how hurt I was. Tear him a new hole to breathe out of and hope the other wolves give me enough time to...\n\nI heard a piercing shriek from high overhead. The wolves stopped as one and turned to look around to see what had made the noise. A dark shape fell like a piece of broken lightning into the middle of the group with a boom that I felt from the other side of the road! Wolf bodies and dirt sailed for a good few meters around the impact site. As the dust cleared I saw my Lucretia in full glassy black armor ,her teeth bared. She was on all fours one clawed hand lifted slightly and tail lashing behind her folded wings.\n\n\"Dead! You are all DEAD! RAAAH!\" She screamed in a full-throated shriek Then she disappeared...\n\n...And reappeared right next to the apparent leader of the group. She grabbed his head and kissed him hard! Then she disappeared again...\n\n...And I saw her flicker next to another wolf and kiss him as well. Then she vanished leaving a streak of pale yellow light issuing forth from the two wolves mouths. \n\nRinse and repeat, she did this to all six of them and then stood in the center of the group one hand held out in front of her. There was a tumbling cloud of roiling sickly yellow light in her hand that she watched grow bigger. I could hear the moans and cries from the werewolves as more and more of whatever the stuff was flowed out of them, some began changing back to human form, but it didn't help as the color just changed to white and added to the cloudy shape floating above her hand.\n\n\"Know PAIN! Know it for what you have DONE!\" She shouted as her other hand rested over the top of what looked liked a sick storm cloud. The bodies began twitching faster and writhing along the ground like worms just pulled from the soil. I heard human screams mixed with inhuman bellows from animal like throats.\n\nThen Lucretia slammed her hands together and all the noise stopped and the bodies fell silent. She opened her hand and I saw something glisten like a bright gem in her palm. She smiled at it, and then swallowed whatever it was and gave herself a shake. She turned in a circle to view the carnage around her. Then I heard her snap her fingers and hot fire appeared around each body, even those on my side of the road! I stared at it dumbly, enjoying the feel of heat. I coughed again and spit blood out into the flames hearing it hiss in the heat. Suddenly Lucretia was at my side holding me and I slumped against her, closing my eyes.\n\n\"Greg! My Greg! What have they done?\" she asked, her voice breaking on the last word. I felt myself being laid down on the ground, when my eyes opened again I saw grey cloudy sky and a dark grey face peering down at me in concern. My succubus was so beautiful, I really should tell her more how beautiful she is. She takes such good care of me, I should get her some flowers or something, or a case of Hershey chocolate bars. I felt my mind drifting and my body didn't want to respond to anything I told it. I opened my mouth and tried to speak.\n\n\"Lucretia...I...\"\n\nShe got right down in my face and I heard her growl through tight lips as she began wiping my mouth, I saw red on her hand and she showed her teeth in a grimace at it.\n\n\"I...\" My eyes closed, it was too much trouble to keep them open. My mind was starting to shut down.\n\n\"Master...what do I do Master? I don't know what to do! Your leaking and I don't know what to do!\"\n\nMy fingers touched, I think her knee...and her hand came down to hold it. Her skin was always cool to me, but now it felt very warm. \n\n\"S'okay...\" I murmured. I had never taught her medical stuff beyond an icepack and band-aids. Looks like that was biting me in the ass now.\n\nI looked up at her and I saw she was crying now, or at least tears were falling. I tasted one on my lips.\n\n\"Don' cry sweetheart...Don' cry...I l...I...\" and then I knew no more.\n\n(Lucretia's Side of the Story.)\n\nMy Master is not moving. \n\nHis hand is not grasping mine, nor is he wincing when he breathes. Is he sleeping?\n\nIf he is it's a very strange sleeping.\n\n\"Wake up! You cannot sleep while you are leaking! You need to tell me what to do!\" I shouted at him. \n\nHow dare he do this to me! Why is it that humans don't heal quickly? I have been hurt worse than this and repaired myself in a few minutes with hardly a thought. With all of that energy that they have in themselves, why can't they do the same?\n\nI needed to stop his mouth from leaking, he has blood in there, I opened his mouth and saw that there was no wound. Then he breathed and I saw blood bubble in the back of his throat. So it must be farther down inside of him where he is broken!\n\nI was pleased with myself that I had figured this out, then a small Worry came to me...\n\nGreg was hurt! He was hurt bad! What if he died? I would be all alone here, no one to turn to, and no one to show me things! I felt those tears come again to my eyes, such a strange human way to show an emotion of Sadness, or Anger. I myself wanted to see clearly right now so I banished those feelings away from me.\n\nI rolled him onto his side so he didn't breathe in blood and thought about what to do. The only person I knew of who could heal was Gwen Malfour of the Gatewatch. However, these Weres were of Hilda and the man who came to threaten us today. They could not be Trusted.\n\nA small emotion came to me that said the Gatewatch probably did not know about this nor would they approve it. I coldly silenced it.\n\nI wanted to kill every Were I found! I wanted to make them howl and scream and BURN for this! Damn them for doing this to my Greg!\n\nI felt another emotion, I believe it was Shame and I froze as a thought formed. \n\n\"And Damn me for not being there to protect him!\" I muttered fiercely.\n\nThis was not helping, I can't fix my Greg, and the witch cannot fix him either since it isn't safe. I had heard of doctors from movies and on television programs but had never met one. I could fly Gregory to William, but it was going to be hard to get in and out of the city like this without being seen. I couldn't stay here since more Were's would come looking for their missing pack when they failed to report in. Also my Master's truck is parked on the side of the road, more people would be attracted by that. \n\nGregory didn't Trust many people outside of his family and a few friends so would...?\n\nHis family! I had met them twice, once at our home and once at something called Thanksgiving where we ate a large bird and a tasty thing called \"pumpkin\" pie made of something that tastes terrible by itself. He was going to see his family, so they should be expecting him. I prepared to fly to the Brooks home, and was about to gather my Greg into my arms when something chirped in his pocket. \n\nI pulled out the square thing, a cell phone he calls it, and saw the name Jonathon Brooks on the screen. I tapped the green button like I had seen Master do that held it up to my ear.\n\n\"Hello...?\" I tried to say Pleasantly.\n\n\"Is this Lucretia?\" I heard Mr. Brooks ask.\n\n\"Yes, I need to bring Greg to you now.\"\n\n\"Is he alright? About twenty minutes ago I got a bad feeling and I have been on edge ever since. Where are you? I will come pick you up!\" He said quickly.\n\nI looked around, \"We are in a field by some trees by a road on the way to your home. I will bring him to you since I can fly faster than a car drives.\"\n\n\"We will be ready, can I talk to my son?\" He asked.\n\nI looked down at my Master, \"He is asleep so I don't think he will hear you.\" \n\nMr. Brooks was quiet then said, \"Hurry Lucretia...\" Then he hung up.\n\nI stood, with my Master, my friend...My Greg in my arms and rubbed my nose against his forehead. He smelled of sweat, blood, and pain. I Hoped that his family could help him.\n\nI just realized something then, he had called me \"Sweetheart.\" What did that mean? It made me feel...I don't know. I felt warm in myself, Greg better not die or I would KILL him!\n\nChapter 30: Brooks\n\nI never told Greg all of my abilities, and he had never asked. This had Puzzled me for a while, when we had been sitting in his kitchen and I waited for him to start asking me what I could do and figuring out how to use it for himself he had just asked if I was tired. I had been so Scared and Angry at him, I am not sure even now as to why...\n\n...Yes I do know why! Even after a century, I still remember the cold chains looped over my shoulders and around my hips!\n\n\"Out of the night that covers me...\" I whisper to myself and the emotion flees. I have no idea which one that is called but it likes to trouble me when I am Sad, or feeling off balance. I will have to ask Greg when he wakes up. I Hope his parents have an alarm clock, that always seems to make him wake up!\n\nNo, he never tried to see what I could do for him, he even made himself vulnerable to me! He held me, my claws and teeth ready to shred him into pieces, and just held me! I almost did it, I wanted to drain him just as I swore I would then destroy his body and return home free. Two things stopped me. Mother had whispered to me before she left,\n\n\"Daughter. There is much one can learn as a student. This man has bound you to himself, with no restrictions, cherish it. You have both freedom and protection Become...Grow...Learn...Surpass!\"\n\nThe other was the way he felt. He was warm, and...and...safe. I felt safe! Was this how it was supposed to be? Was this what it meant to have a Master? Not a master...but a Master?\n\nI flew faster...Gregory was held tight in my arms, and I could see his parent's home. There was a large gravel driveway in front of it. I tried to remember what I was supposed to do when entering someone else's home. The Gatewatch I just knocked and entered since they gave me permission. But what did I do the first time? Ah! Ring the doorbell and wait for...\n\nOh, I see them out front waiting for me. \n\nI swooped low and raised up to land on my feet, crouching on the rock, still holding Greg in my arms. Mrs. Brooks came running up to me as well as Mr. Brooks. I hissed at them, but cut it off in the middle. They looked like they wanted to take my Greg from me. Which made sense, I told myself. They probably know more about fixing a human than I did. My Protective side curled back down, satisfied for the moment. \n\nMrs. Brooks ran up then and laid her hands on Gregory's chest and ran fingers over his face. I wanted to tell her to quit touching him like that when I saw her own face. She was always apple cheeked and smiling. Now she looked pale and her cheeks hollow. Did she feel Sad? Or was it different? I couldn't tell. I heard the thrum of a vehicle. The things that smelled funny, but people who can't fly use them a lot. Mr. Brooks was backing up the truck.\n\nHe motioned for me to come closer and opened the tailgate. I saw that he had a pad of some sort with pillows in the back of it.",
        "\"Please, put him on the mattress gently.\" He asked. He helped me do so, and we propped him up on the pillows. He paused a moment and placed his hand on Greg's forehead and eyes and began muttering something. I strained to hear it, but I couldn't make out the words. Maybe he had a poem to say when he was full of emotion. I would ask him later. He helped Mrs. Brooks up into the back of the truck and she sat beside my Master, then he looked at me, and really LOOKED at me!\n\nI felt like I was in front of Mother again when I had broken her favorite reading chair because I had wanted to hear the stones tell me of their life. Mr. Brooks eyed me and for the first time I felt naked in front of a human. It felt Uncomfortable.\n\n\"You did not hurt my son?\" He asked finally and I snarled at him claws flexing. He nodded in affirmation. \"I had to ask, please sit in the back and ride with him. We are taking him to the hospital.\" He turned and headed to where you steer the vehicle, the truck. Like Greg's but bigger, and green. I climbed in the back with Mrs. Brooks who was sitting next to Gregs side and gently running her finger's on him.\n\n\"It's okay baby...Mommys' here, I'm here and you're going to wake up soon and we will all put this behind us, like a bad dream. I love you, my baby boy.\" She looked over at me and did a double take. I think that is what it is called. Greg says guys do it when they see an especially good looking female. It is where you look once then after looking away you look back again. It seems silly to me, why not just look one time for a long time?\n\n\"Lucretia...?\" She asked in surprise. I had tucked my wings around my body and my long fingers gently held Greg's arm, my claws tucked neatly into my fingers.\n\n\"Yes...Mrs. Brooks?\" I answered. I think she was trying to ask me a question.\n\n\"You look very...\" Her voice trailed off as she looked me over. I watched as she reached out a hand to touch my arm. Her fingers trembled for a moment then I felt them firm as she grasped my forearm.\n\n\"You look very fierce, and cold. Aren't you cold with no clothes on?\" She said in, I think, Surprise?\n\n\"I don't wear clothes like this, no I am not cold.\" I answered. Then I remembered she said I looked fierce. That made me smile a little and my Worry over Greg dissipated and I remembered the manners Greg had been trying to teach me.\n\n\"Thank you for the compliment Mrs. Brooks.\"\n\n\"What dear...?\" She sounded distracted.\n\n\"The compliment? Saying I look fierce, thank you.\" I clarified, now unsure if she had complimented me or not.\n\nMrs. Brooks gave me a small smile. Then her eyes went back to her son.\n\n\"Who did it?\" She asked softly. I shuffled a little bit in place.\n\n\"Some werewolves.\" I answered quietly.\n\n\"You weren't with him.\" Her voice was flat when she said it, but I felt Rage and Shame trying to talk to me and something that wanted to weep that wasn't Sadness but was close to it. Like Astar, my sister, is to me.\n\n\"No, he wanted to meet with you both alone, and I was at home...listening to music.\" I said finally. I pushed the emotions away with a snarl. Mrs. Brooks quickly looked up to my face and then she quickly reached out her hand to cup my cheek and it held me fast as if I had been wrapped in those chains again. I couldn't look away from her eyes as she stared into mine.\n\n\"It's not your fault sweetie.\" She said softly. I blinked. She repeated herself, more emphatically and continued. \"Bad things happen, and we never know when they will happen. How could you know he would get hurt? The important thing is when he got hurt you came to help him...didn't you?\" I nodded my head. I'd had all four of my stereos playing music while I was standing in the center of the room. Linkin Park, Nine in Nails, Barry Manilow, and Beethoven blaring all it once. The vibrations and noise just washing over me. Then that wrenching sensation in my stomach of my Master being hurt had yanked me to him. I might have broken my glass door getting outside to fly to him.\n\nHer small finger's gripped my cheek and she pulled my head a little closer to hers so we were both leaning over Greg's body that was still oddly sleeping.\n\n\"Did you get them? Did you get those gobliny people who hurt my baby?\" She whispered harshly. My mouth opened in surprise! Mrs. Brooks was a...Happy lady. She was always Happy, I had never her seen her like this, she was...Vengeful? Is that what this is? I tried to make sense of what I was seeing...this female had gone from sadness to, whatever this feeling was and seems to be handling everything alright. I needed to watch her, figure out how she does this. Then I remembered she asked me a question.\n\n\"Yes, I drained and killed them all then burned the bodies.\" I said. She patted my cheek and pulled me closer to kiss my opposite cheek.\n\n\"You are a true friend sweetheart!\" She told me. \n\nHow can human's do this! Jumping right from one emotion to the next so easily? Wait, she called me sweetheart. That was what Greg had called me right before he fell asleep and wouldn't wake up. I wanted to know what this word meant! Master couldn't tell me maybe his mother.\n\n\"Lucretia, we are at the hospital. Can you look like a person again and wear clothes?\" Mrs. Brooks asked, I was a little Offended that she didn't consider me a person until I thought that she must be under some emotional strain, so I said nothing and turned human with my favorite hooded sweatshirt and pants and boots. I climbed out of the back of the truck and two men in identical clothing ran up to us. I didn't know who they were so I stepped in between them and my Greg with arms wide and snarled out, \"Back off!\"\n\nThey stopped and looked past me, I kept my position until a large hand settled on my left shoulder.\n\n\"Easy, they are here to help. Gentleman, this is my son. His left shoulder has been dislocated and his right foot is shattered, also I suspect there is internal bleeding...\" I ignored whatever else he had to say, but remembered the word bleeding. So when something leaks blood they call it bleeding. So water leaks, but blood bleeds. Good to know.\n\nThey called for a stretcher and used the blanket that Greg was laying on to pull him out of the truck and take him inside of the hospital. I didn't like it! I didn't like it at all! I saw strangers touching my Master. Many of them. One tried to stick a needle in his arm! I was bout to stop him when I was surprised by strong arms around me, holding my right side. I looked and saw Mrs. Brooks holding onto me, holding my arms down.\n\n\"It's okay...it's okay Lucretia, they are helping him. This is what we do.\" She told me. I watched as they quickly wheeled him to another room and I stood there, watching my Greg roll away from me...away from me. Oh, Empty Void...away from me! I felt something twitch and then break in me and I dropped to my knees crying in the entryway of the hospital. I didn't know what to do, and Mrs. Brooks held me as I cried. I saw Mr. Brooks walk through the door and talk to a female at a desk in front before the paths turned. At the time though I was distracted by my own tears and for some reason I was trying to comfort Mrs. Brooks and it felt like she was trying to comfort me. \n\nShe would tell me everything was alright while I told her everything was going to be alright...and...and...I don't remember much.\n\nWhy am I writing this Gregory? Why are you having me re-live this? I didn't like it then and I don't like it now! Can we skip this part? They don't care about it! Whoever reads this doesn't care about how I felt for this piece here. \n\nWhat? FINE! I...fine. \n\nMr. Brooks came back and helped us both to our feet and into chairs by the wall. He gave us both a paper cup of water. He kissed his wife then knelt down in front of me as I stared into the paper cups of water. He bent to see in my eyes and then once he had my gaze on his he spoke to me softly.\n\n\"This is what it means to be human...Lucretia. You are stronger than us, faster than us, and live so much longer than we do. Yet in many ways we are more than your kind.\" I stared at him, waiting to hear what he said next.\n\n\"We humans are...how to help you understand?\" He scratched the side of his head in thought and his voice and the way he spoke sounded so much like Greg it made my throat tighten. Was I going to lose him? We have only been together a few months! \n\n\"Humans are I guess you could say...amphibious. Amphibians can live in water and in the air. We are both physical and spiritual...\" he said finally. \"You can split a person up into three main pieces, at least this is my belief and so far it has been proven to be true. You have your body, your spirit and your soul.\" He paused, watching my eyes to see if I was still following him. I guess I was because he put his hand on my knee and continued.\n\n\"Greg is a soul. His thoughts, feelings, his experiences...all of it are bound up in his soul. His body, the thing that you see hurt and bleeding, that is only a shell that he uses on this Plane. His spirit is what goes on to the next Plane. His soul, what he truly is...that will remain intact. Do you understand?\"\n\nI thought about it. It actually made sense. I come from a place that is mostly spiritual. I need to be given a body to be here, on this Plane. So, if humans are like that as well...that gives me more questions than answers!\n\n\"You are saying that Greg will still be who he is even if his body dies?\" I asked. Mr. Brooks nodded. I bristled at him, water sloshing over my human fist as I crushed the paper cup. \"But I want his body alive and well so I can hold him and tell him...!\"\n\nWhat? What did I want to tell him? There was a word that kept wanting to come to me but it kept on eluding me. Like when I tried to squeeze a watermelon seed. No matter how hard I tried to crush it it would always squeeze out between my fingers. Greg laughed at me trying to crush it until the seed hit him in the eye....then he told me to stop playing around.\n\nMr. Brooks grabbed my arms and then hugged me. \"I didn't mean it like that Lucretia, I...never mind me. I am just a little off right now. Let's wait and hear what the doctor's say.\" \n\nWe were in something called a \"Waiting Room\" which seemed appropriately named except that...I hate to wait! If I am hunting, that is different, one must have patience for their prey. Also, waiting, when it is quiet...gave me too much time to think. I kept thinking about what I could have done differently. Should I have killed that Alpha Judge person? Would that have made a difference? Or what if I had demanded to go with Greg, I would have been there for the attack and would the outcome be different? A voice kept speaking to me, loud and insistent telling me this was all my fault. If I had never come to this Plane, if I had never fought Greg, if I had said, \"No!\" to being bound, if had just done something different...!\n\n\"Shhhh...\" I heard Mr. Brooks croon to me. I was sitting between him and his wife. His arm was around my shoulders with his hand on his wife's neck gently stroking her skin. At first I thought he had been talking to her, then I saw he was watching me. His eyes were kind, warm, and yet hard...no...that's not the right word. They were strong, not hard. Stone is hard, but it breaks. Wood is strong, but it will bend before it breaks. \n\n\"Greg is in good hands Lucretia, now we just wait and pray.\" He told me. Pray? Were we going to eat? It wasn't bed time so if we are going to pray we must be getting ready to eat.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" I asked Mr. Brooks. He blinked down at me then looked at his wife who had her hands folded and was murmuring to herself quietly. He waited until she was done and then asked her my question.\n\n\"No, but I should eat.\" She put her hand on my arm and smiled, a little Sadly, but I could see her Happy countenance begin to overshadow it. She took my hand in hers and we all walked to a place called the \"Cafeteria.\" There were no calves there, or cows, or any animals, but the smells of food were strong so I assumed they must keep them outside so they were out of the way of people who were eating. I took a tray and chose a sandwich from a box and a small bag of chips that looked a lot like the bigger ones they have at the \"Wal-Mart\" store Greg goes to. Then I selected a can of Mountain Dew and grinned thinking I would not have to sneak it like I do with Greg's stash. Thinking of Greg made the Sadness return and I muttered the poem again. I had to get to the third line before it left and let me think clearly once more.\n\n\"What was that you were saying?\" Mr. Brooks asked as he paid for our meals. \n\n\"It is part of a poem Greg had me memorize this morning.\" I told him. Had it been only this morning? Had all this really only happened in the space of a few hours? He had just been going to see his parents then go to work and...go to work...WORK! Who was going to do his job? His job was important to him, it's a \"Responsibility.\" Responsibilities are very important.\n\n\"What is wrong?\" Mr. Brooks asked. I guess my face was showing what I was feeling. \n\n\"Who is going to empty the dumpsters if Master is asleep?\" I asked. Mr. Brooks paused and thought for a moment.\n\n\"I guess I will.\" He said. Then he sat down with his wife and motioned for me to sit across from him. I did and began to mechanically munch on my sandwich.\n\n\"You know how to do it?\" I asked with my mouth empty enough for me to speak clearly. \n\n\"Yes, I sometimes went to help and to see what his job was. I just never thought I would have to do it for him.\" He took a bite of salad and considered his next words. \"Responsibilities have to be maintained. If Greg cannot do it, it falls to me to help make up the difference. It restores balance.\" Then he gave me a little grin that made my chest ache, since it reminded me so much of Master!\n\n\"Besides, don't want my boy to lose his job do we?\" Then he went back to eating his salad. Mrs. Brooks was eating with gusto and she took a drink of water before talking to her husband.\n\n\"It will be getting dark soon, honey. Why don't you and Lucretia go to Greg's work and I will call you if there is an update?\" \n\nMr. Brooks frowned down at his meal, \"I want to be here in case anything changes...I might...\" his voice trailed off as his wife held his big hand in hers.\n\n\"It's out of our hands now, you and I have done all we can. No we have Faith, and we pray.\"\n\nFaith...I have heard that word before. I had asked Greg what it meant and he had faltered in his explanation. He said that it was believing in something without any proof, but that you just believed it to be true. Which makes no sense to me at all! He told me it was like gravity, we see it working all the time but we can't truly understand it. So I immediately went on to the internet and found proof of it for him to read.\n\n\"So, now seeing this proof does it take away your Faith?\" I had asked him. That made him laugh. \n\n\"No! It just means I need to explain it better...\" He told me. He never got around to telling me. I really want him to explain those things to me. Not just about Faith, but other things, like why old women like cats when dogs seem to be a much better pet.\n\nMr. Brooks stood and said, \"Lucretia, will you please come with me? We are going to go to work.\" I shook my head, I wasn't leaving my Greg alone again, not after what happened last time! He came around the bench to crouch down in front of me.\n\n\"He is your master?\" He asked.\n\n\"He is my Master.\" I replied, letting him hear the difference to my words.\n\n\"Then come with me so we can fulfill the duties of your Master...\" He told me, and glanced from Mrs. Brooks then back to me.\n\n\"...his mother is more than enough to keep him safe. Have a little Faith Lucretia.\"\n\nThere was that word again!\n\n\"Faith in what!\" I growled. I was tired of these words I didn't understand! I was tired of feeling lonely! I wanted my Master! I wanted my Greg! I didn't know who to turn to...\n\nMr. Brooks leaned in and held me firmly but gently...it so reminded me of Greg, but also of Papa! Unconciously my arms went around him and I burrowed my nose into his chest. The smell was similar to Greg but very different, the arms the same but different. It felt...Good.\n\n\"Have faith in Greg. I am sure he doesn't want to leave you alone. I am sure he misses you too. Let's make sure that everything is running smoothly so when he wakes up it will be just like he never left...okay?\" He said quietly.\n\nThat I can do, I am still not sure what Faith meant, but I can believe that he will wake up. That is easy, I don't want to think of what would happen if he didn't wake up. I refused to think of that!\n\n\"Okay.\" I said softly. Mrs. Brooks was on the phone calling someone \"Pastor\" and I heard a man's voice say he would be over as quick as he could. From the tone of voice I could tell he was concerned and a friend. I let it go that another stranger to me was going to be around. Then Mr. Brooks took my hand in his and we walked out to where he had left his truck.\n\n\"We need to stop by my home first, I need to change clothes for work and pick up a few things...alright?\" He asked me. I just nodded to him and stared out the window. Normally I would be asking Greg about things I was seeing, but now...could I ask his Dad? I cleared my throat, then asked.\n\n\"Why are motorcycles called motorcycles...they are just like a bicycle, but they have a motor instead of pedals. Shouldn't it be called a bimotorcycle?\" \n\nHe thought about it, \"It's too much of an awkward word, and there is more change than just a motor. It is an entirely different thing when it's all said and done. Look at a gas-powered bicycle, that is more of what you're describing.\" \n\nI smiled while looking down at my hands. I knew it was a silly question, but I wanted to see if he would try to answer me, or brush me off. \n\nWhen we got back to his home I followed Mr. Brooks into the house until he told me to stop. I looked around and saw we were outside of a room I had never seen before.\n\n\"Wait here please, Lucretia.\" He told me.\n\n\"What's in that room?\" I asked, pointing at the door. He almost brushed me off then seemed to think better of it.\n\n\"This is my wife and my personal space, our bedroom. No one but us goes in here unless it's an emergency.\" Then he walked inside, closing the door behind him.\n\nI could hear some movement and some clanking, then the door opened and my eyes went wide as I saw something I had only seen vaguely in movies.\n\nHe had a gun! Two of them...well sort of. He had something that Greg called a shotgun but different. It had two long tubes of metal that were hollow, one on top of the other. The other end was made of what looked like some type of plastic that you hold against your shoulder. I saw him put two rounds in it, why do they call them \"Rounds\" when they are long? Is it because the bottom is round? I guess that makes sense.\n\nThe other I think is also called a gun. It was in a container made of leather that sat on his hip under his work coat. It had a smaller handle that looked to be made of plastic, and I think you only use one hand to hold it.\n\nHe saw me looking at his guns and said, \"Just in case...\" and then walked past me to the door. \n\nWe got to the industrial complex after the sun went down and normally I am Happy to help with the dumpsters, I like finding all of the hidden treasures inside of them! Now the thought reminded me again, that Greg was hurt. As if I needed to be reminded! I kicked the side of one of the dumpsters and it left a dent in the metal. I saw Mr. Brooks look over at me and frown.\n\n\"I'm sorry...\" I muttered Angrily then reached inside and popped the dent back out so it was mostly smooth again. I got back into the truck and Mr. Brooks put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"You are handling this a lot better than I thought you would have.\" He said to me. I looked down at my hands. Not trusting myself to speak. He sounded Proud of me! I liked hearing it, but also it pulled at something below my chest and just above my belly. It hurt but it felt good at the same time! I picked up his hand and held it against my cheek, Greg would do that sometimes. It felt like Greg's hand and it pulled harder on that something inside me. Would Greg's hand feel like this when he got older, would...would Greg get older? Was my Master going to die? Was....Grrrrrrr!",
        "I heard Mr. Brook's voice push past those thoughts in my mind.\n\n\"I think that you should come with me when we are done with the dumpsters.\" He said with a smile. It wasn't a really Happy smile. More like the smile Mother gets when she is doing something fun. \n\n\"We need to pay a visit to some werewolves.\" \n\nChapter 31: Paladin.\n\nI was surprised when we pulled up late at night to my neighbors. No lights were on in the Gatewatch's house. I watched as Mr. Brooks opened his door and stepped out into their driveway. \n\n\"It's late, and they are probably all asleep...\" I started to say, then remembered that Jemima was a vampire, and probably still awake. \"...Greg told me it was rude to call on people in the middle of the night.\" I finished.\n\nHe paused, looked up at the few stars that could be seen above us, then bowed his head and laced his fingers together. I heard him speak softly, and wondered again if he had a poem to say as well to himself. Does every human have a poem of their own? \n\nI watched Mr. Brooks face harden and carefully said, \"Hildy's pack is the one that attacked Greg, but she didn't do it. I think her father was the one to send the Weres since she really likes my Greg. I don't think she did anything wrong, she is his friend.\"\n\nHe nodded his head once and then continued walking to the front door. \"This is important, if we are going to visit Hilda's father, then we should tell her why we are going to do so.\" \n\nI stepped in front of him and put a hand on his chest. He stopped and contemplated me in the streetlights. I was surprised at my own...brashness? I think that's the word. \n\n\"If we do go to see the Alpha, Hildy's father, and we tell her that we are, she will warn him. He is her papa! She will be more loyal to him than she is to a friend.\" It made perfect sense to me, as a hunter I would isolate my prey so I could take them down easily. Sure, sometimes a big fight is a lot more fun, but I wanted to make sure we killed this beast! Having him be warned ahead of time before we got there could make things tricky. \n\nBesides...Mr. Brooks was human, and he maybe has a couple of guns, but what could he really do? I was sure the fighting would all fall to me.\n\nMr. Brooks nodded in agreement with me. \"That is all true, but also it is what I am counting on. Now...let me by, Lucretia.\" His voice was warm and I caught the hint of a small smile on his face, and for whatever reason I let him pass. Though I don't remember why I had gotten in front of him in the first place...strange.\n\nHe knocked on the door and it slowly opened after a few beats to Jemima, looking at him in confusion. \n\n\"Hey Lucky, and...Mr...Brooks! You're Greg's dad. What can I do for you?\" Jemima asked. She noticed the gun on his hip and kept him on the porch instead of inviting him in.\n\n\"I need to get a message to Hilda Roberts please.\" He said politely. Jemima glanced at me, and I nodded. \n\n\"Wait right here.\" She told us and closed the door. I bounced from one boot to the other, waiting, and Mr. Brooks just smiled and hummed quietly to himself. Hildy appeared at the door with a sleepy Gwen rubbing her eyes and Jemima was standing close by the little witch. Hildy had a baggy T-shirt and loose gray sweatshorts on and her hair stuck up in places.\n\n\"Lucretia...Mr. Brooks? What are you doing here? Is everything okay?\" She asked. Jemima put a protective arm around Gwen causing the witch to look up at Jemima and rub the side of her face into the vampires shoulder. She was wearing a fluffy pink bathrobe and her mussed hair made her look like one of those raggedy dolls.\n\n\"My son...\" Mr. Brooks began, then stopped as if his air had stopped. I glanced at him and I could see he was struggling. With what I didn't know. I put my hand in his and he turned to look at me. I remembered how Greg would smile at me, and it made me feel Comforted. Even Mr. Brooks smiling at me helped me feel better. So I smiled at him as well. He gave me a nod, then turned his attention back to the three Gatewatchers who were now all wide awake.\n\n\"Gregory was attacked and hurt badly by some werewolves on the way to visiting my wife and I. He is in the hospital right now after suffering some severe injuries. Last I heard he was still unconscious.\" He delivered it all in a flat tone of voice that felt very cold to me.\n\n\"I have reason to believe that it was members of your pack Hilda that attacked him. I came as a courtesy to you to let you know that I am going to be visiting your father and letting him know of my displeasure. You may want to stay home tonight.\" He said. I saw Gwen's hands cover her mouth and her eyes go wide as she squeaked. She sounded a lot like Nancy when she did that. I wondered if I should call William and Nancy? They are friends, is that what you are supposed to do, call friends when someone is hurt?\n\nHildy looked Shocked, and her words confirmed that. \"No! My Dad wouldn't do that! I just saw him this morning and he knows about Greg. He said he was going over to apologize to him and let him know that his hands had been tied! He hadn't wanted to declare him guilty. He would never do...what you said, he wouldn't!\"\n\nMr. Brooks nodded. \"I understand. I am just going to go talk with him at his home and see what he has to say. I will not escalate things unless he does.\"\n\nHildy shook her head and reached for Mr. Brook's arm. \"Please, you're just a human and...\" She stopped as her hand landed on thin air. I blinked and saw Mr. Brooks was no longer standing beside me. \n\n\"What does my being...just a human...have to do with anything?\" Mr. Brooks asked. He was standing on my other side and I hadn't seen him move! Neither had the others as they turned to look at him and stare when he spoke. \n\n\"How...did you...?\" Jemima began to ask when Mr. Brooks interrupted her.\n\n\"I can do what is needed when the time comes for it...I just have to be there and be willing and available,\" He said simply. Then I felt his large hand on my back and he gently steered me around and we walked back towards his truck.\n\n\"Wait.\" I heard Gwen call out. I stopped and so did Mr. Brooks. She came running down the steps wearing jeans, backpack and a coat. I could smell the scent of her magic on the air.\n\n\"I want to help...\" she began but Mr. Brooks interrupted her. \n\n\"Tuality Hospital, second floor, room N23. My wife is there already.\" \n\nGwen's mouth opened and closed a few times then she turned and whistled. Her bicycle came rolling out quickly from behind the front porch and she hopped on. Then with a few muttered words it's back wheel spun quickly leaving streaks on the asphalt and she shot off down the street, her hair streaming out behind her.\n\nMr. Brooks was smiling as he watched her leave. \"I always liked her! I had thought...\" His voice trailed off as he glanced at me and then chuckled. \n\n\"Thought what Mr. Books?\" I asked, wondering what he was going to say. He paused, considering, then finished his thought.\n\n\"I had thought something might happen between Gwen and Gregory...\" I scoffed. He raised and eyebrow in question as he climbed into the truck and I had settled myself into the passenger seat. \n\n\"That would never happen!\" I said. \"First off, she is much too nice and secondly she doesn't like the same things Gregory likes. She doesn't like Mountain Dew and doesn't like to get dirty. She is very...what did Greg call it...? Ah! She is too \"Girly\" is what Master called her. Also she concentrates too much on \"Tree hugging\" did I say it right?\"\n\nMr. Brooks laughed as he pulled out of the driveway, and we saw Hildy get into her car and take off the opposite direction on the highway. I watched her in the back view mirror...rearview? I can never remember.\n\n\"Wouldn't we get there faster if we followed Hildy?\" I asked Mr. Brooks.\n\n\"Yes, but I would like something to eat first. Besides, we need to give her time to talk to the Alpha first.\"\n\nHe pulled into the parking lot of \"The Canyon Caf\u00e9\" ordered two burgers, fries...a Coke for himself and a chocolate milkshake for me. \n\nI sipped on the milkshake and he watched me with slightly puzzled eyes. \n\n\"How do you feel about my son?\" He asked suddenly. \n\nI shrugged, \"He is my Mast...\"\n\n\"I know all that, but how do you Feel...about my son?\" He asked again and I heard the difference in the words this time. So I thought about it. I remembered the words we spoke to each other, my promise to him. I thought about my reactions to him being hurt. I remembered his soft kisses, and how I almost lost control that one time kissing him in his truck and how he kissed me again right after. How he told me that he just really liked kissing me! I never told him how in the early morning I would lay snuggled up with him in our bed and how tempted I was to feed from him. I didn't want to worry him, though knowing how he is, he would just smile or make a joke. \n\n\"Lucretia...\" I heard Mr. Brooks say. I looked up from my milkshake to see him patiently waiting for my response.\n\n\"I care about him Mr. Brooks. He calls me his friend and he trusts me. I feel for him like I do for Mother, or my sisters, or like my Papa...but different.\" I frowned and drank some more milkshake. I Hoped he wouldn't ask me any more questions, because I didn't have the words to answer them. I didn't understand it. Words...\n\nOh Yeah...\n\n\"Mr. Brooks...what is a Sweetheart?\" I had forgotten to ask earlier. He took a sip of his Coke and studied me.\n\n\"It depends on how it is used and by whom...the circumstances around the word use.\" \n\nI sighed. Just like all the other words I had been learning. Like the word \"Dough\" had a lot of meanings. It could be a female deer, money, or the stuff used to make cookies! Greg just had to call me sweetheart right before sleeping. Then not wake up to tell me what it means!\n\n\"My Greg said it to me, right before he couldn't talk anymore. I didn't know how to help him and I told him so, he said that it was alright \"Sweetheart\" and I don't know what that word means.\" I thought for a moment, \n\n\"Is it like when I am called \"Sweety\" by Mrs. Brooks or Jemima?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head. He was now staring at me thoughtfully. \"No, that just means they think you are nice, or cool, or hip or whatever the youth of today call it.\" He waved a waitress over for a refill of his drink, and when she left he said quietly. \n\n\"It means he cares about you, really...truly cares about you. Not just your physical needs but about your inside, about what makes you Lucretia.\" \n\nHe sighed and I could smell the salad he had for dinner and the coke he had just been drinking. \"Lucretia the word \"sweetheart\" means literally this. That you have a sweet heart. That you are kind, generous, and likeable.\"\n\nMy mouth dropped open in Surprise! \"I am not any of those things!\" I almost shouted. \"I like to...to...I am not a SWEETHEART!\"\n\nMr. Brooks smiled quietly, \"That is how Greg sees you. That is how my son sees you.\" \n\nI gritted my teeth and growled low in my throat. \"How can he see me that way? Is he blind?!\"\n\nHe shrugged and took another drink of his Coke. \"How do you see Greg? That should answer some of your questions...\"\n\nI grimaced and thought about it before answering.\n\n\"Master is very gentle, and funny. He likes to include me when he does things and he works very hard. He likes to answer my questions. He likes to teach me things, and kiss me.\" I smiled at that.\n\n\"I really like his kisses! His lips touch mine and I want to feed on him, I really do...\" I said this last one with a small whine creeping into my voice. Mr. Brooks just arched an eyebrow at me. I didn't notice.\n\n\"Even after I started to feed he still kissed me again. He trusted me. I want to be...I like to be trusted.\" I looked Mr. Brooks in the eye with my brow furrowed.\n\n\"I care for Greg beyond a friend and like family but I don't know what to call it.\" I said finally. \"Do you know what it is called?\"\n\nHe nodded and my heart jumped in my chest! \n\n\"Can you tell me?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \n\nMy heart fell down into my stomach!\n\n\"Why not?\" I demanded.\n\nHe grinned at me. \"You will know it when you hear the words, and if I have to tell you, then you aren't ready to understand it yet.\" \n\nI was about to snarl and tell him what I DID understand and make him understand how I don't like to be toyed with! Then I thought about how nice he had been, how accepting he was of me. There were things about him I did not understand, like how he could do some of the odd things he could do. It seemed to surprise Hildy and Jemima and Gwen. I still didn't know everything that humans could do. Mr. Brooks seemed to be able to move very fast, is that something that was rare among humans? Greg could move fast, very fast using his power. But I didn't smell any magic on Mr. Brooks. I chalked it up to one more thing I didn't know about humans and decided to shelve the thought for the time being. \n\nBack to my \"nice and accepting of me\" thought, I would have to trust that Mr. Brooks knew what he was talking about. Master trusts him and so I shall, simple as that.\n\nTwo burgers were put before us. Mine had bacon and avocado. I don't like avocado by itself. It reminds me of the chjorzit back home. They are about the same size and color. But avocados don't have legs and eat our waste. But on food the vegetable tastes wonderful! I was surprised it is considered a vegetable, when it grows like the apples and pears do on the trees in the backyard. \n\n\"So, you want to meet the Alpha Were and talk with him about why he hurt my Greg?\" I asked. Mr. Brooks took a bite of his burger then munched on his fries.\n\n\"I planned on it, but I think I know what is going to happen...\" he said with a cold smile. I matched it with one of my own. I could feel my eyes begin to change. This is what I do! He was speaking my language! I could feel it from him, he was going to let me carve a path to the Alpha to \"talk\" and let me drain, burn tear, rend, and kill! I could feel my muscles bulge as they pushed at the limits this human skin put on me! IT wanted out...I WANTED OUT! He just smiled at me and shook his head a little.\n\n\"Only if they resist us coming into talk. Settle down Lucretia, it is not the time...\" He thought for a moment and held up a finger. \"...it is not the time yet.\" He amended.\n\nI had been about ready to scream in frustration! It was like Greg all over again getting me worked up then switching his emotions to being relaxed and being concerned for me and then work and his neighbors. Never even thinking of what he was doing to me. Then to have him say that last part helped...quite a lot actually.\n\n\"So...\" I began, my voice becoming calm. \"How do you see this going? What do you think will happen?\"\n\nHe chewed, thinking it over. Then dipped a French fry in Ketchup and held it out to me. It made me gulp a little. I wasn't used to someone who wasn't Greg treating me as casually as this. But I leaned over and ate the fry, waiting for him to speak.\n\n\"Judge Michael Roberts lives on the outskirts of Portland, close to Highway 26 before you go through the tunnel. There are a lot of woods there that he and his pack roam on. He has a very nice home, a mansion really. Are you familiar with mansions?\" He asked. I nodded my head.\n\n\"A house big enough to be a castle and almost costs as much to maintain but it isn't very defensible so it is basically worthless.\" I told him. He chuckled.\n\n\"Close enough! We will drive up to his gate and request to see him. We will go in, and talk with him. I will tell him to leave my son alone. He will agree. If he does not agree I will take away what is most precious to him.\" I grinned at that, I wanted to be the one that killed him! He had hurt...wait...\n\nMr. Brooks was watching me carefully. I felt like I did when I was young and Papa had been trying to teach me something. He always seemed to have me try to find out the answer for himself.\n\n\"His life is not most precious to him?\" I asked. Mr. Brooks shook his head. \"No, he takes life to readily and plays with other peoples lives too much for life to be important. Try again.\"\n\nI thought about it. He was a judge, decides right and wrong. Likes money and uses it to get what he wants. Does not like being questioned and...\n\n\"Power?\" I guessed. Mr. Brooks smiled and waggled his hand back and forth over the table. \"Close, good thinking.\"\n\nI smiled at the praise and started thinking while finishing my burger and eating my fries. I was halfway done with my milkshake when it hit me. Power wasn't precious, it was a means to an end. It wasn't influence, it wasn't money or prestige. He as much as told Greg straight out at the table when he came over to drink coffee and threaten us. He said, \"I have hundreds, no; thousands of people that look to me for leadership in my pack alone, and I need to be in a position of authority to do what is best for my people. I need to be able to protect them, look out for them. They are my family you might say, and I will do much to protect my family!\"\n\nMy eyes were wide as I looked at Mr. Brooks and he slowly smiled. \"Do you see it...tell me?\"\n\n\"It's security. He wants to be secure. That's why he plans so much, and what makes him ruthless. I said the same thing to Greg after I swallowed his saliva.\" His eyebrows shot up into his hairline. I shook my head and chuckled. \"I was getting his scent from the mug he used.\" He nodded and snickered at me.\n\n\"So how are you going to take his security away?\" I asked. He just kept smiling and didn't answer. I wasn't sure if he wanted me to guess or not, so I just stayed silent and waited as he used a piece of his bun to clean off his plate. Then he left a tip on the table and stood up. \"Ready to go?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why don't you answer my question?\" I asked in mild Exasperation.\n\n\"Because you wouldn't believe my answer.\" Came his reply.\n\n\"Why wouldn't I believe your answer?\" I retorted.\n\n\"Because you don't believe in what I am.\" He said over his shoulder.\n\nI hurried to keep up with him. In human form my legs are smaller than his and I Hated that! In my true form I could keep up easily without having to run!\n\n\"How can I believe in you if I don't know what you are...well, besides being human!\" I called to him as he opened up the passaenger door of his truck for me. I guess that is where Greg learned it from. I buckled my seat belt and winced only a little as memories of cold metal chain holding me down onto a pedestal came back to me. I pushed those thoughts aside as Mr. Brooks sat down in his seat behind the turning wheel. Or is it called steering wheel? I think it's steering wheel.\n\nI waited, watching him as he started the truck and back out of the parking space. \"Mr. Brooks?\n\n\"Yes Lucretia?\" he said, eyes on the road. I thought carefully how to ask this next question. I went through all of the lessons on manners Gregory had discussed with me, and decided how to best phrase my request.\n\n\"Will you please tell me what you are? If we are going into this situation together, I need to know this so we can work together.\" I said it slowly and clearly and politely...to the best of my knowledge.\n\nHe glanced at me out of the corner of his eye and then focused on the road ahead. He was silent for so long I thought he had either not heard me or was just not going to answer. I was just turning to look out the front window when he answered.\n\n\"I will answer your questions later...but for now....\" He sighed. Then he reached over and patted my shoulder.\n\n\"I am a Paladin.\""
