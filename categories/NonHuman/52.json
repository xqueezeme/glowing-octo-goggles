        "Author's Notes: This happens a few months after the events in \"Vampiress, Mine \u2013 Omnibus 02\", \"The Snow Maiden \u2013 Omnibus 02\", and \"The Prison Creature\" \n\nLike \"Snow Maiden 02\", I got hung up on this one and it required a lot of reworking before it got to the point that I was satisfied with it. First, I just didn't like how it turned out. Then I didn't like how the protagonist turned out. Then I was drawing blanks. When I finally hit upon a bout of inspiration from looking at more pics online, the story seemed to write itself from there. It also helped that I had the Minotaurs to draw from this time to provide me a bit of an out at the end of the story. So, once again, I apologize for the long wait but I do hope that it's worth it. I went down some new tangents on this one that has opened up the possibilities for more plot lines in the ongoing saga of the Supernatural War. \n\nUnlike in past installments, I'm not going to hint as to which the next chapter of the series is going to be as I have a few options as to which one I'm going to be publishing next. My options include, but is not limited to; \"Amazon of Mine\", \"Maiden of Summer\", and \"The Sirens\" with these names being working titles at the moment. I'm also exploring an option about writing about the Magi that I introduced in \"Vampiress, Mine 02\" and more about the Minotaurs as I'd introduced in \"Snow Maiden 02\". If any of these titles interest you more than others, please let me know. I welcome constructive feedback on this series that has gone on some interesting twists and turns over the years! \n\nTo date, the recommended reading order is; \n\n\"The Crimson Tithe\" (Optional) \n\n\"Vampiress, Mine \u2013 Omnibus\" \n\n\"The Snow Maiden \u2013 Omnibus\" \n\n\"The Creature Below \u2013 Omnibus\" \n\n\"The Creature Below \u2013 Omnibus 02\" \n\n\"Vampiress, Mine \u2013 Omnibus 02\" \n\n\"The Snow Maiden \u2013 Omnibus 02\" \n\n\"The Prison Creature\" \n\n\"The Creature Below \u2013 Omnibus 03\" \n\nTo recap, there are three women currently imprisoned inside the Prison Creature: \n\nMary - former mayor of Newhaven \n\nKimberly - former Assembly Councilwoman of Newhaven. \n\nKaitlyn - Caretaker of the Crystal Lake Lurker that was killed by the Hunters. \n\n* \n\nThere will be times on this journey all you'll see is darkness. \n\nBut out there somewhere daylight finds you if you keep believing. \n\nSo don't run. Don't hide. It will be all right. \n\nYou'll see. Trust Me. I'll be there... \n\nWatching over you. \n\n-Phil Collins, \"Look Through My Eyes\" (2003) \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 1: The Plan \n\nSomething was wrong... for the first time in centuries, the being known to both its caretakers and its own kind as The Ancient One was in distress. The mortals that did not belong to it were systematically hunting down and destroying its race and it had lost all contact with the genetic legacy of the thing now referred to as the Prison Creature. Those that were not killed off were being psychically cut off. This could not be allowed any longer... not with the final, and largest, colony ship approaching. Natural Selection was to be expected but something on this scale was unprecedented. Something had to be done and it had to be done now. \n\nStretching out its mind, The Ancient One called forth the conclave. One by one, others linked their minds until it was fully convened. They saw The Ancient One's troubles and worries, quickly identified the problem, and agreed that a solution had to be reached soon. \n\n'If only...' rumbled the mind of one of the original landers known as StarSeeker, 'If only our warrior caste had survived the great impact and the warriors from the second colony made plantetfall... then these mortals would still be in awe of us...' \n\n'What might have been or what could have been is irrelevant...' one of the younger of the kind that called itself Skulker added in. 'What matters is that, according to our caretaker, we have been hidden and on the defensive for far too long... we must go onto the offensive and become warriors of our own until the last ship arrives...' \n\nThe Ancient One regarded Skulker. It was of the newer generations that had matured into adulthood; a mere millennia old. It had been born of this planet and had developed language and turns of phrases akin to that of the humans that cared for it. Even still... the idea was not without merit. Even The Ancient One had avatars running around, calling themselves Sirens, but three did not an army make. 'Does our caretaker that aids you have a plan...\" \n\nAmusement radiated out from Skulker. 'We could say that... This does... however... mean that we might need to bend or break a few rules...' \n\n'So long as it interrupts the machinations as the one known as Tillis... we are all for it...' StarSeeker agreed with Skulker.  \n\nThe plan was then presented, formed, agreed upon, and the trap set. \n\n* \n\n[Inquisitive]This plan of yours will work, yes... \n\nBrad frowned in irritation as he worked at his computer. \"It's not a hundred percent foolproof,\" he replied verbally instead of telepathically to his Lurker in the Lake that he called Skulker. \"After all; no plan survives first contact with the enemy.\" \n\n[Pointed] You do realize that this will result in the enslavement of many males and females in the village below... \n\nBrad shrugged as he furiously typed commands into his program. \"I've been telling you all that if you're going to fight a snake that you're going to have to send your own into the nest. Besides, if all goes to plan, they won't be imprisoned long.\" \n\n[Sardonic] And yet you are not willing to be one of them... \n\n\"Ugh...\" he grunted as he rolled his eyes. They'd been over this point before. \"And what good would that do any of us? Hm? I'm both the brains and the brawn of this operation...\" \n\n[Irritable] The Sirens are on their way... \n\n\"And they're more than welcome to help me kick in the gates wherever Tillis has the Prison Creature stored at,\" Brad countered. \"Provided they get here in time. We're a bit far from Newhaven and even with them running like The Flash, it's a stretch on even their limits. So we're kinda stuck with what we have.\" Now it was Brad's turn for a pointed look although this one was out the window into the night where he knew by heart where the lake was at even though he couldn't see it right this moment. \"The real question is; are you ready to do your part?\" \n\n[Pride] We are prepared to become the first of a new warrior caste... the first of such since the days of old when the original colonists first walked this world... [Sorrow] We will miss our home that has been here for so long... \n\nBrad grunted again. \"Eh... from what I'm told; the lake up at Newhaven is large and deep enough to house four of you all with still room to grow. Buck up, buddy, you're about to become The Ancient One's personal bodyguard.\" He typed in the last of the commands into his program and hit 'Execute' on the computer screen. \"Alright... it's done. Tillis will think that we've slipped up. I expect we'll see a few spies slip in at first before the main force gets here. I figure about a day or two.\" Brad stood up, stretched, and yawned. He'd been at this for hours. \n\n[Inquisitive] Would you enjoy a donation... Skulker's mental voice, normally male, switched to a beautiful, melodious female voice [Seductive] We have been experimenting and could fashion a feminine reproduction for you based on the images that you enjoy on your screen there... \n\n\"Hmmmm...\" Brad considered it as he caught the image of a lithe, green, translucent, plant-like woman beckoning to him in open invitation. It reminded him a bit like an Anime Forest Nymph meets Poison Ivy. The idea had appeal but he had more important matters at hand. \"I'll take a rain check on that one, Skulker, I'd intended in going down to the camp to see Jen tonight and let her in on the plan. \n\nSkulker's mental voice went back to normal. [Pointed] The female's village will be ruined and she will lose monetary value... \n\nAnother shrug. \"Again, if all goes to plan, she'll have all the business she could want up in Newhaven.\" \n\n* \n\nMinutes later, clad in nothing more than his shorts and a pair of running shoes, Brad was slipping into the window of Jen's cabin that she kept unlocked for his visits. It was part of their on-again, off-again liaisons that they've had over the years. Despite Skulker's constant nagging for them to do so, they held onto their friendship rather than making things awkward by formally getting together and getting married. Neither one of them wanted that and they respected each other for it. Whatever significant other they might get in the future would have to be accepting of the kind of friends-with-benefits that Brad and Jen enjoyed with each other. \n\nBrad snuck up to the top floor to the master bedroom loft where Jen was sleeping soundly in her bed with nothing more than a sheet over her voluptuous body. Her being a nudist certainly made things easier for Brad whenever he did sneak into her home. Pausing at the door, he slipped his shoes and shorts off, his large cock already rock hard for her. He closed his eyes and let out a long, deep breath, allowing his pheromones to be let loose into the room. On the bed, Jen moaned, subconsciously rubbed her thighs together, and rolled so that she was on her back once she inhaled his musk. The sheet shifted when she rolled, giving him a good look at her naked body; her legs and shaved sex now open for the taking. \n\nHe darted in and jumped onto the bed. Jen's eyes shot open in surprise and he clamped a hand over her mouth while driving his cock into her now wet pussy. She squealed as she was roughly penetrated by his hardness. Then she moaned as her pussy molded around his cock and she brought her thick thighs up around his waist to squeeze him as he settled onto her body. He took possession of her mouth with his. His hands came up to rest on her lovely Triple Ds that stayed youthful and defied gravity thanks to the monthly sessions that she took with Skulker. His thumbs worked up and down, brushing across her now hard nipples with each stroke. \n\nSubconsciously sensing her need, Brad fucked her harder and faster. Their bodies rocked together as one. Jen started whimpering as she grabbed at his wrists and brought them up to her throat. He placed them where she wanted, holding her neck in a domination manner yet in a way that he wasn't actually choking her. She moaned again and got lost into her own fantasy of being ravished by an intruder. Brad leaned back in such a way to get the angle just right so that he was looking down at her, enticed by her bobbing breasts. He wanted to blow right now but held off until she was ready. Once she was, he unleashed a torrent of cum deep inside of her, reveling in the look of pure bliss that he got as she groaned while her eyes rolled back into her head. \"Holy fuck...\" she breathed at long last, bringing her hands up to spread her dark red hair out from underneath of her body. \n\nBrad slipped out of her and slid to the side, laying down beside her. Jen rolled to face him, giving him a friendly peck on the nose. \"Well this is a pleasant surprise. What brings you down here tonight?\" \n\n\"The sex is a perk, tonight,\" Brad admitted. \"I wanted to give you the heads-up that we're going to need you to move a youngling here soon. Probably within a week, maybe sooner if some unexpected friends show up.\" \n\n\"Ugh... God...\" Jen let out a disgusted sigh. \"Again? You know I hate doing that. I have to wear clothes when I leave here.\" \n\n\"Skulker will make it up to you like he always does. We're also expecting you to be followed when you do it. If you happen to see someone following you, don't make any indication of it. We want them to come here.\" \n\nHer eyes narrowed. \"What's going on? Is this something to do with that little feud that's going on between you people and that Hunter-guy you've been lamenting about?\" \n\n\"Raymond Tillis and yeah; it has everything to do with him.\" Brad admitted. \"He's killing off Lurkers like it's going out of style and he's gotta be stopped.\" \n\n\"And me moving a young is going to help do that?\" She arched a skeptical eyebrow at that. \n\n\"No,\" he shook his head. \"That's the fail-safe in case Plans A through F go under.\" \n\n\"Okay, fine, whatever,\" Jen sighed, rolling her eyes again. \"Just leave me out of your future plans.\" \n\n\"Time's coming when you're gonna have to pick a side, Jen,\" Brad pointed out, \"sooner or later; we're all going to have to choose sides before they're chosen for us.\" \n\n\"Whatever,\" she mumbled, reaching down and grabbing his cock. \"Since you're here I might as well make use of you. Now get this thing hard again, fuck me senseless, and then get outta here. I want to enjoy my time before we get invaded.\" Brad proceed to do just that, this time standing her up and bending her over the side of her bed so that he could pound her round ass from behind until she was screaming for him to stop after giving her multiple earth-shattering orgasms in a row. \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 2: The New Prisons. \n\nRaymond Tillis looked at the thee naked women who were each suspended in their individual glass tubes, side by side, that were filled with the clear, nurturing nectar of the Prison Creature. Pink and Purple biomass filled the tops and bottoms of the ten-foot-tall tubes, encasing the women's legs and keeping their arms stretched above them. Blue light from the top and bottom of the tubes ensured that their bodies were properly illuminated, making them look like they were in some extraterrestrial science experiment tank. This was reinforced by the machines that both held up the tubes and powered them with an array of wires and conduit pipes that ran up and down the sides that were responsible for circulating, scrubbing, cleaning, and filtering the nectar inside like it was a giant automated fish bowl. \n\nEach of women had a new creature, that they'd each birthed inside of the Prison Creature, wrapped around their faces and necks; Facehuggers. The creatures were named aptly after the things found in the Aliens movie franchise and they were working perfectly acting as both a feeding and breathing tube for the women while they were submerged in the liquid while at the same time keeping them mostly paralyzed and tame. Occasionally they could overcome the paralytic poison that the Huggers excreted when it became diluted within their systems. Then the creatures would just give them another dose. They kept the women alive while submerged and in turn the women kept the creatures alive by leeching off of their life force. Per his own instructions in making the new creatures; each of the women were conscious and aware of their surroundings yet unable to do anything about it. It was the perfect eternal torment cell for them while his Prison Creature reworked itself into a bigger and deeper cavern that was off site. \n\nRight now the two redheads, Kaitlyn and Kimberly, were asleep. The third, an older brunette named Mary, was awake and glaring daggers down at Raymond. Raymond gave her an evil smile and a wave. \"Anytime you want to come out, surrender, confess your sins, and be my personal slave, just let me know,\" he chortled. Mary closed her eyes and turned her head in disgust. The Facehugger, sensing that it's poison had worn off, pumped another load down Mary's throat. Mary's eyes shot open and then rolled back into her head before her eyelids fluttered close and she became docile once again. \n\nRaymond let out a harrumph of amusement as he feasted his eyes on their large, round breasts full of nutritious milk for the creatures to feed off of as well as their pregnant bellies that were gestating more Huggers. One of the fatal flaws with the Seekers had been that they were rushed to production. The Seekers were inherently weak in their exoskeletons as a result, making them susceptible to gunfire and blunt objects. They still had their uses and his scientists were reengineering them to be more resilient, but the Huggers were already far more superior by gestating longer within the women in order to develop a thicker hide. Unfortunately, the production of new Seekers was stalled until the Prison Creature finished setting up its new lair as there simply was no room inside of these tubes to birth one. \n\nHe peered at the bottom of the tubes where the second Hugger lay dormant at. Every so often they'd wake to carry out their function on the women; wrapping themselves around the women's loins to withdraw the waste from their bodies and to pump more liquid up into their uteruses to care for the growing young inside. That action alone would give them a powerful, yet painful orgasm to the point that the women will probably eventually learn to hate sex. Then the Huggers will latch onto the breasts to feed and then go dormant once again. Raymond had watched the process one time and the Huggers would feed, much to the discomfort of the women, while it fucked them with their whip-like tails. Once the young were birthed, they'd take over that function, impregnate the women and the cycle continued. The older Huggers would be removed and kept in storage containers until such time they were needed in conjunction with the Seekers for the next major attack. \n\n\"Mister Tillis!\" One of his scientists cried, running up with a sheaf of papers and a map. \"We believe that we've located another Lurker stronghold,\" he gasped, out of breath from running. \n\n\"Calm down, son,\" Tillis reassured him. Good news was always rewarded, in his book. If they found another Lurker, then this would be exceptional news. \"Take a deep breath and collect your thoughts.\" \n\n\"Yes sir, thank you, sir,\" the man, barely out of college, gasped. He took a puff from his inhaler, straightened his glasses, and delivered his report. \"It's not too far from your own beach resort, sir. It wasn't easy to find and, in fact, it had been overlooked as a potential site since it was high in the nearby mountain and the lake seemingly small for one of the creatures.\" \n\n\"Huh... nudist camp just like our beach...\" Raymond grunted as he reviewed the data. \"Clever... and close by too so it's basically hiding in plain sight.\" He eyed the scientist. \"How'd you come about this information?\" \n\n\"It wasn't easy, to be honest,\" the young man admitted. \"I was doing a logistical comparison of Newhaven and had written an algorithm to search for similarities to other sites. This just now flagged for me and I've been pouring over it for the past few hours. This, right here,\" he pointed out one memo in particular, \"grants Federal protection over the lake and the access is restricted to a single resident that lives there year-round.\" \n\n\"Big deal,\" Raymond grumbled. \"We have the same under Homeland Security.\" \n\n\"Yes, but their protection comes from the Department of the Interior. Same as Newhaven.\" \n\nThe light went off in Raymond's head. \"Which is how Newhaven got their protected status to begin with by identifying a new species, logging it, and getting top secret clearance to keep it out of the public eye...\" He looked at the map and papers with renewed interest. \"Fucking hell... that close to us all this time. No wonder they've been all over us with their intel recently.\" He clapped the man on the shoulder. \"Good work. What's your name?\" \n\n\"Bruce, sir.\" \n\n\"How long have you worked for me?\" \n\n\"About a year now, sir.\" Bruce said. \n\n\"And you have no convictions whatsoever about what we do here?\" \n\nBruce was shaking his head. \"No sir. Any enemy of humanity deserves to be punished.\" His eyes flickered towards the ladies in the tubes, then at the row of tubes beyond that were here in the basement waiting to be filled. \"Just like them.\" ",
        "\"Indeed.\" Raymond found himself liking this man. \"You need to be rewarded for bringing me this information as it will help us bring more breeders to justice and help us kill another alien. There's a girl who works for me as a maid upstairs; Erica. Short, mousy brown hair. Just turned nineteen. Petite build. Have you seen her?\" \n\nBruce considered it and then nodded. \"Green eyes and she keeps her hair in that anime style that kinda covers one eye, right?\" \n\nRaymond nodded. \"That's the one. Anyway, I suspect that she's a breeder spy and her work here has been less than desirable lately anyway. You may take her to bed with you and then you may put her in the next tube down the line. See to it that she's impregnated with a Hugger before the day is out. \n\n* \n\nErica was finishing up her daily chores in the Tillis Estate. She only had one room left to go and it was the big room itself; Raymond's Master Suite. Parking her cleaning cart outside the door, she checked to make sure that it was empty before sliding inside. When she started this job a couple months ago, she thought it odd that his wife, Rebecca, didn't sleep with him in this grand room. But then she shrugged it off when she heard that she stayed with the children in the remote wing of the mansion away from all of the normal business that Mister Tillis conducted in the main portions. \n\nThat, and him fucking a different maid each night, was probably a turn-off for the Mrs. Tillis. \n\nNone of the women on the serving staff were safe from Raymond's machinations. Even Erica had to give up her body to him every so often but stayed under the radar enough not to be considered one of his favorites. She kept on telling herself that she was insane for taking this job on but she also kept on telling herself that this work was important and that what she was doing was protecting people and supernaturals alike. \n\nWhich is why she took the chances that she did. \n\nHer primary mission, given to her by Mayor Parker himself, was to keep tabs on where Raymond had the Prison Creature and how many people were inside and what creatures, if any, were being birthed. The last she was able to get down to the basement level, the former Mayor Mary, Councilwoman Kimberly, and Kaitlyn were inside the thing still in the pool. They'd been pregnant with something new inside of them but she had no idea what. But then the sub level of the basement was permanently closed and sealed off. Something was going on but she didn't know what. Her secondary mission was to find the Key of Solomon that Raymond had stolen from a University. She had yet to find it. Her tertiary mission was to keep tabs of anything juicy that was going on and report back. Her assignment was set to last just for six months before she'd be pulled out. \n\nAs she set about snooping in the Master Bedroom, Erica took great care in covering her tracks just how she'd always done. She tried putting herself into Raymond's mindset, thinking about where she could hide things at that she wouldn't want found. When she started snooping here she did the customary search around the desk and office areas of the suite, finding nothing. Then the bookshelves, that also turned up nothing. Then the drawers and end tables... nothing. She hated wasting her time in here but orders were orders and she put her trust into Mayor Parker. \n\nShe went over to the bed and laid down, staring up at the wood covered top of the four post bed. Erica had spent time here both tied up and just lying here as Raymond took her. She'd even faked a few orgasms here to make Raymond think that he was sexual god that he thought he was inside his own head. Then she paused and saw that there was a panel off. She stood up and moved it aside. It wasn't the elusive Key of Solomon but it did have some juicy information in it. \n\nErica fished out her iPhone from the apron pocket of her maid's outfit and pressed the hotkey that had been programmed in. It went to instant FaceTime with the Mayor's office in Newhaven. Aden picked it up. \"What do you have?\" his voice asked. \n\n\"I found something,\" she spread the documents out across the bed and started putting the camera over each one. Then her head snapped as she heard someone out in the hallway. \"Shit! Someone is coming!\" she said in a panicked voice. \n\n\"These are more important,\" she heard Councilman Brock's voice say. That was her boyfriend's father. \"Quickly pan over each one. We're recording here.\" Erica did as she was told while scanning and reading what they had. What she saw made her sick to her stomach. \n\n\"Erica,\" Aden's warning tone said as she did her job. \"I know that we were trying to avoid this but we did plan this. You're going to be captured. You know that, right?\" \n\nShe swallowed hard at that dose of reality. \"Yes... but... if I'm lucky, all they're going to want to do is fuck me and I can handle that,\" Erica said, making sure she got each page. Then, when she got the last one, she hastily put them back into a stack and shoved them back into the hidden compartment and shoved her phone into her pouch. \"Keep quiet and maybe they'll say something. People here talk all the time.\" \n\nShe was off the bed just in time for the door opening. It wasn't Raymond. It was one of the scientists, Bruce, with a backpack slung over his shoulder. His eyes narrowed onto her. \"Are you supposed to be in here?\" he asked in a tone that suggested that she was in trouble. \n\nThankfully, she had an alibi and that was her job. \"I've finished my rounds which includes Mister Tillis' rooms,\" she replied with a dignified sniff. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room now,\" she said, heading past him. \n\nOnly, he stepped in her way. \"Finished your rounds that required you to leave your cleaning cart outside?\" he shook his head. \"I don't buy it. What I do buy is that you're a spy and a traitor for sniffing around where you're not supposed to be. His favored maid of the evening is supposed to clean his room.\" \n\n\"And how do you know that he didn't select me for tonight?\" Erica challenged him. \n\n\"Because he just told me that I could come up here and fuck you instead.\" Bruce smiled down at her and the color drained from her face as she realized that she had indeed been found out. \n\nThis was not going to end well. \n\nBruce grabbed her by the arm and hauled her over to the bed. He then bent her over the side and proceeded to pull and rip her clothes off until she was naked. She put up a good fight in the process but the end result was the same as their wrestling took them down to the floor and she wound up underneath of him with her arms pinned to either side of her head. He then pinned her wrists underneath of one hand as he grabbed at his crotch to free his hard cock. \n\nDuring the fight, Erica had been going through the mental exercises that Aden had taught her to prepare her for this. She'd done it with Raymond and now she'd do it with Bruce. His average sized cock speared into her, making her gasp involuntarily in the process as he burrowed deep inside of her pussy. She grunted uncomfortably as he proceeded to fuck her hard and fast, his free hand groping her left breast the entire time. Erica put up a good show of being an unwilling participant and even being forced to orgasm until she felt him spill into her. Then he relaxed and moaned with pleasure as his sexual release sated him. \n\n\"What the hell is going on in here?\" Raymond demanded, looking at the two of them on the floor; her naked and him with his cock still inside of her. \n\n\"You said that I could fuck her, sir,\" Bruce protested as he jumped to his feet. \"I found her in here!\" \n\n\"Not in my room, you dumbass!\" Raymond yelled at him. Then he paused. \"Wait... you found her in here?\" his gaze settled onto Erica and he motioned for Bruce to stand her up. He did so, keeping her hands pinned behind her back. \"Why are you in here?\" \n\n\"I was cleaning, sir!\" Erica cried, adding a hint of desperation to her voice. Maybe she could get out of this by just being fired. \"That's what you hired me to do!\" \n\n\"I caught her coming off of your bed, sir,\" Bruce said calmly as he stuffed his cock back into his trousers, alternating hands to do so as he kept hold of Erica. \n\nRaymond's head snapped right to where Erica had found the documents and then came back to her. He then walked over to where Bruce had dropped his backpack, opening it up to remove a metal cylinder. He unscrewed the top and showed Erica the small, slimy creature inside that was coiled up like a ball. \"You like this?\" Raymond smiled at Erica. \"They're Facehuggers, right out of the sci-fi movies. These, however, won't kill you like they will in Aliens but they will make your life a living hell.\" He let the information sink in as he looked at her expectantly. \"Now, what all do you know and who have you told?\" \n\n\"Nothing! No one! I swear!\" Erica was shaking her head and protesting. \n\n\"Erica!\" the panicked voice of her boyfriend, Bobby, came over the speaker of the phone from the shreds of her French maid's uniform. Erica let out a long, resigned sigh as she closed her eyes and silently cursed her boyfriend for saying anything. She could hear the scuffle on the other end as people were obviously trying to shut him up. \n\nBut the damage had been done as Raymond obviously heard it. He put the container down, spied the phone, and scooped it up. \"Who is this?\" he demanded as he brought it up to his face. \n\n\"Who do you think?\" Aden Parker snapped right back. \n\n\"Aden...\" Raymond smiled broadly as if Christmas had come early. \"So good to talk to you again. Is this lovely thing yours?\" he asked, reaching out to stroke Erica's cheek. \"She's a pretty little thing. a bit rusty and mechanical in bed. Tell me; did you have her too?\" \n\n\"So what if I did or didn't?\" Aden replied dryly. \n\n\"Hmph...\" Raymond snorted. \"Doesn't matter, I guess. I'm going to throw her to my pets and you're going to listen to her screams. Or, if you wish to save her, you can just surrender to me now where I promise to try, convict, and hang you like the traitor you are and I'll let all of your people go.\" He held the phone up to Erica so that she could talk to her boss. \"Go ahead; beg him to save you. Tell him how much you want to avoid your fate because I guarantee you that you will not enjoy it.\" \n\nErica swallowed hard, a tear trickling down her face as she was faced with reality. This whole thing was bigger than she was. \"Mister Parker...\" she said, her voice sounding small and fearful. \n\n\"Yeah, Erica?\" Aden asked with a resignation in his voice. She could tell that he was bracing himself for the inevitable. \n\nHer eyes flicked up at Raymond with a sudden fiery defiance in them. \"The Prison Creature has gone somewhere else and is replaced by new creatures in huge glass tubes!\" she blurted out, giving him one piece of key information that she got from the documents in case he didn't see them yet. \"Tell Bobby not to wait for me!\" Then, while Raymond recoiled in shock at her sudden change in demeanor, she headbutted the phone out of his hands, and reared back and elbowed Bruce in the ribs, forcing him to let her go for a moment. The second the phone hit the floor she stomped on it with her heel, destroying it so that no one at Newhaven could hear what was about to happen to her. \n\n\"YOU BITCH!\" Raymond howled, backhanding her in a sudden rage of fury, sending her tumbling to the ground. He let out a high-pitched whistle and pointed towards her prone body. \n\nTwo Huggers leapt out of the container by Bruce's backpack and skittered across the floor at breakneck speed. Erica was on her feet and running for the bathroom where there was another way out when the first one launched itself at her, hitting her right above the butt and causing her to stumble. She grabbed the thing, dragging it off of her, and throwing it away. The second one jumped, smacking her on the back of the head. She stumbled even more, now off center, as she grabbed at that one to yank it off. This one was already sliding over the top of her head towards her face as it wrapped its tail around her neck. \n\nAs the second Hugger was using its tiny legs to grab her face and pull itself closer, the first Hugger skittered back and jumped at her again. This time it succeeded in knocking her back down to the floor when it took her knees out from under her. It then attacked her crotch, wrapping its legs around her thighs and its tail around her waist. \n\n\"NO!\" Erica cried out in vain, this time in true fear and terror as she felt the thing mold itself in between her legs and start probing up inside of her pussy and her ass. When she grabbed for it to pull it off, she realized that she'd made a fatal mistake as the Hugger on her face now locked itself into place with its legs now latched around her head. Its fleshy underbelly launched out a tendril that filled her mouth and nasal cavity up and continued filling up until she felt part of it go down her larynx and the other down her throat. There was a juicy burst that slid all the way down to her belly, coating the inside of her stomach. She let out a pathetic gurgle as she felt the life drain from all of her limbs at the same time. Her eyes rolled back into her head as she lost all control of her own body. She'd been prepared to fight those damn Seekers... not these things. \n\nThen she felt the Huggers start to pulsate. She found that she could still breathe through the Hugger on her face. It was acting as a respirator since it was over her mouth and nose but she could feel it pumping its own nectar down into stomach. The Hugger between her legs was blowing load after load of liquid up into her womb until she felt fuller than she'd ever had in her life. Oh God... she thought as her abdomen began to slowly swell. She felt her sides twitch and she knew that her ovaries had been forced to ovulate by the creatures. They had total control of her body now. The Hugger between her legs then blew something up into her that made her feel like she'd been gut punched. Seed... she thought, somehow either instinctively knowing what it was or maybe the Huggers were telling her body that. \n\nRegardless of how her brain was coming about the information, she knew what was happening in real time. The seed from the Hugger spread like warmth through her loins and out into her tubes, seeking out the two released eggs. In the meantime, the tendril that had filled her pussy up was sucking out Bruce's cum to store and mutate for later. At the same time, her breasts started to feel heavy and full as her nipples puckered up to full erection. She could tell that her body was now producing milk. Down in her belly, the Hugger's mutated seed found her eggs and enveloped them and fertilizing them at once. They traveled at record speed back towards her womb, which was still slowly filling up with the nectar from the Hugger, to imbed themselves into the walls on either side. \n\nErica's world went white and she screamed from behind the Hugger on her face. The orgasm slammed through her body hard and she flopped around on the floor like a dying fish out of water. Ooooohh... Goooooddd... she moaned inside of her own mind as tears trickled from her eyes back over her temples. The orgasm was so powerful that it hurt. It made her clit sensitive and that damn Hugger down there was still pulsating against it. In fact, now that she thought about it, the accursed little thing had her labia spread wide open so that the tendril up inside of her vagina overflowed to cover every intimate fold down there. \n\nHer eyelids grew heavy and she could see Raymond and Bruce hovering over top of her. \"Get used to your new life, breeder,\" Raymond was saying. \"Now stand up and follow,\" he ordered her. Erica's body promptly responded and she stood and fell into step right behind him despite her mind screaming to run away from them. As they walked, both Raymond and Bruce took the opportunity to feel up her now plump They took her down to the sub-basement, though the sealed doors that she couldn't get through before, to a room that was dark save for three illuminated large tubes filled with water. No... not water... that's Lurker nectar... she clinically thought to herself. Inwardly she gasped as she saw the three women of Newhaven who were trapped inside of them. \n\n\"Enjoy your new accommodations, traitor,\" Raymond sneered at her as he pointed to the fourth tube in line. Bruce had moved over to the thing's stand, manipulating the controls so that it came down at a ninety-degree angle. The top opened like an iris and Erica's body dutifully walked itself over to the opening. Raymond and Bruce lifted her up and slid her into the glass tube feet first. Bruce then grabbed two large pink and purple blobs; throwing one down towards her feet and sticking the other one up over her head. Then the top irised close and the tube promptly rose back up to its upright position. Erica slid down to the bottom of the tube in the process. \n\nThen the tube lit up all around her as the biomass at the top and bottom started to expand and fill the surroundings. Erica could only stand and watch as her legs were enveloped up to her knees. The biomass forced her legs wide apart and even rose her up a foot or two within the tube. Above her, the biomass was doing the same thing, tendrils coming down to wrap around her wrists and pull her arms straight up so that she was suspended spread-eagle for all to see. Indeed, Raymond and Bruce were outside leering at her predicament. \n\nThere was a bubbling, trickling sound. Erica's eyes flicked up and she saw that clear nectar was now flowing into the tube. It quickly filled up in the bottom and continued filling up the tube. She willed herself to mentally relax and she focused on her breathing through the Hugger on her face. The Hugger seemed to sense her distress and it blew another load of it's paralytic liquid down her throat to calm her down. A wave of euphoria swept over her and she stopped caring about the rapidly filling glass tube that she was in. The liquid came up over her hips, past her naval, and was soon covering her breasts. She closed her eyes and waited as she felt it rise up her shoulders, collar bone, neck, and finally face and head. The world seemed to become muffled around her as she was now totally submerged within the nectar that she knew from the instruction that Aden had given her that would keep her youthful and alive for practically forever. \n\nThere was a tapping on the glass and Erica opened her eyes to see Raymond grinning smugly up at her. \"Have fun, bitch.\" he chortled as gave her a little wave. He then motioned toward Bruce, who manipulated the controls and then left with his boss. The Hugger between her legs vibrated and pulsated to life as it did its programming; voiding her bladder and her bowels and then blowing more nectar up into her womb to feed the two new Huggers that were now growing inside of her. She arched her body within its living bonds and screamed as the painful, intense orgasm was forced upon her once again. Then she was thankful as she mercifully passed out. \n\n* \n\n\"Look at this here,\" Donald Brock was saying, pointing at one of the images on his laptop that Erica had managed to snag. \"These little bastards will be hard to shoot and according to this they're wickedly fast.\" \n\n\"Hey!\" Bobby, his son, protested amid the hive of activity. \n\n\"That's nothing,\" Councilman Robert Griffin, the former Sheriff of the town said over at the wall monitor where he studied another image, \"take a gander at this thing that Tillis has plans for.\" \n\n\"HEY!\" Bobby protested even louder. \n\n\"Anything that Tillis can birth, we can fight,\" Aden said. \"I'm more worried about THIS thing! Where's he going to get this damn thing at? No way he can grow it in secret.\" \n\n\"Maybe he doesn't have to,\" Donald said, looking at it. \"Look here, here, and here. Summoning Circles? Runes, perhaps?\" ",
        "\"There's no way he can hope to control this...\" Aden muttered. \n\n\"HEY!\" Bobby slammed his hands down onto the Mayor's desk. The three of them paused and slowly turned towards him. \"Are we just going to ignore the fact that Erica just got put into the Prison Creature? When are we getting her back?\" he demanded to know. \n\n\"Bobby...\" Aden said slowly and cautiously, \"we have bigger concerns right now than the livelihood of just one woman.\" He held up a hand to cut Bobby's retort off. \"Yes, I realize that Erica's been caught. Yes, I realize that it must be all kinds of suck for you. However, any rescue attempt right now would be both foolhardy and futile as Tillis will be expecting it. It would result in the needless loss of life and would jeopardize the lives of her, Mary, Kimberly, and Kaitlyn as well. You and I both know that Tillis isn't going to kill her so she's safe for right now even if she's being tossed into the Prison Creature or if she's just kept as a prisoner to satisfy Tillis' sick and twisted whims.\" \n\n\"So we just leave her there for now?\" Bobby asked incredulously. \n\nAden nodded. \"She knew that this was more than likely going to be a one-way trip and that immediate rescue would be highly unlikely, if not impossible.\" \n\n\"And you ordered her to go anyway?\" Bobby was shocked. \n\n\"No,\" Aden shook his head. \"She volunteered for it. Look,\" Aden's voice was sympathetic, \"I know that this is hard to process but she came to us about this assignment. She knew that we needed people on the inside to keep tabs on Tillis and she knew that we couldn't send any of our supernaturals in as Tillis would sniff them out in a heartbeat and execute them. It had to be a human that went in.\" \n\n\"But you still sent her...\" Bobby's tone was cold and accusatory. \n\nAden shrugged. \"I was against it to begin with and I tried talking her out of it. She was adamant and, to be honest, I'm thankful for it.\" He gestured to the screens where the images of Tillis' documents were displayed. \"This by itself is pure gold and worth it, let alone all the information she's been giving us for the past few months. I'd actually held out hope that we'd be able to get her out but it seems like her luck has run out.\" \n\nBobby shook his head, willing the tears out of his eyes. First his mom... now his girlfriend. It was too much to bear. \"We can't leave them in there...\" he reiterated. \n\n\"We won't, son,\" Don said, putting a hand on his son's shoulder. \"One day, we'll get them all out of there and have plans to do so. But until then... we soldier on.\" \n\n\"Fuck you all,\" Bobby hissed as he bolted out of the room. \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 3: The Colony in the Woods \n\n\"Well, this is it!\" Will said with a flourish of his hand as he and his girlfriend, Lucy, got out of the car. They were at the front gates of a rustic gated community up in the mountains. The surrounding area was well manicured forest area that was ideal for hiking, biking, and various other leisure activities. Being in the shade of the canopy was a welcome relief from the summer sun that blazed overhead. This year was already going down in history as the hottest on record and being in the woods would certainly cool things down for them a bit. \n\nLucy nodded appreciatively, her vibrant red hair wafting a bit with the gentle breeze that came down the mountain. \"Better than that beach resort that we tried out last month.\" She then caught sight of some of the guests that were inside. \"Oh no; you didn't!\" \n\n\"What?\" Will asked innocently. \n\n\"Another nudist resort? Really?\" Her blue eyes zeroed in on what was shaping up to be her soon to be ex-boyfriend if he pulled another fast one on her like he did at the beach. She gave him such an icy glare that permafrost threatened to form on the roof of the car. \n\n\"Oh come on; you promised!\" \n\n\"Yeah, that was before I was gang banged at the last one while you went gallivanting off friends along with a couple of blonde floozies!\" Lucy yelled at him. \n\n\"This one isn't like that! Sex here is completely voluntary!\" he withered under her gaze when she arched an eyebrow at him and crossed her arms. \"I swear! Look; let's just make the most of it, okay? Just you and me... naked... in nature... in the cabin... I'll make it up to you, okay?\" \n\nLucy continued to glare at him. It wasn't that she was upset at the surprise gangbang down at the beach. In fact, she'd enjoyed getting thoroughly pounded by a lot of hunky men and made a point of showing her 'boyfriend' just how much she liked it. She fucked the whole lot of them like a porn star and was walking bowlegged the week after. What pissed her off was the fact that Will had sprung it on her and took her totally off guard, especially when the resort rules had a little caveat in them that said that no one could refuse sex; man or woman. It was some bullshit about 'natural, holistic, sexual healing' or some other nonsense that prevented anyone from running to the local authorities and crying 'rape'. True enough; she did (technically) agree to one more getaway week with Will to try and iron out their problems but the way he'd been acting since the beach cast doubt onto their relationship. \n\nShe flippantly waved her hand towards the check-in cabin and Will beamed broadly. Giddy, he hopped up the stairs to go inside while Lucy just rolled her eyes and followed behind him. Inside there was a naked, curvy redhead that looked to be in her mid-thirties, behind the counter. \"Ah, you two must be Will and Lucy!\" she said, checking her reservation schedule. \"Welcome! I'm Jen, your hostess. We have your cabin all ready for you; it's at the end of this first row where the trailhead is at. You can settle in and then come back out whenever you feel like.\" She handed over a couple of keys, a map, and a few brochures of the activities of the camp. \n\nWill started looking over them while Lucy eyed the keys. She dangled one up. \"And where do you expect us to keep these at?\" \n\nJen smiled politely. \"Like I haven't heard that one before. We have fanny packs and backpacks in the cabins for your use whenever you decide to go out and enjoy yourselves. We have a communal dinner at six in the main hall. Meals are available in buffet style throughout the day that you're welcomed to come and go as you please.\" \n\n\"I don't have to put out for it, do I?\" Lucy mumbled, going through the leaflet of the rules with extra scrutiny. \n\nWill frowned as he was looking at swimming activities. \"You have a pool here but why do we have to wait for the end of the week to go to the hot spring lake for?\" \n\n\"Because of the agreement that we have with the landowner,\" Jen said, \"You see; he owns this entire mountain. It's been in his family for generations. We just rent from him. The lake is on his personal property and he's graciously entered into an arrangement with us that gives us access to the healing power of the lake for one day out of every week.\" Jen pursed her lips as she became somber. \"Now it is extremely important that you do not go up there. There are postings along all of the trails when you get close to his property line. To trespass onto his property can bring about all kinds of legal liabilities that can possibly get us thrown out. So we ask that you respect his property and respect our privilege to be here, please.\" \n\nLucy was looking through the legal part regarding the boundary lines. \"What does this mean that crossing marked boundaries implies consent to any machinations that the property owner has, protection guaranteed by Federal Law?\" \n\nJen's nostrils flared as she inhaled deeply. \"He works for the government and there are sensitive projects that he works on out of his home as the location is ideal for it. He has the right to detain any individuals that he feels are a threat and hold them for questioning. Please; don't tempt fate and please do not jeopardize our relationship with him.\" Jen pleaded. \n\n\"Do you give this spiel to everybody?\" Will asked with a snort of amusement. \n\n\"Yes,\" Jen said simply. \"It's for your own safety. Now, I'll show you to your cabin now if you'd like to collect your things and follow me, please.\" \n\n* \n\nA few hours later, Will and Lucy were walking up the trail through the woods to the scenic overlooks that were highlighted in the hiking pamphlets. It was a short and easy walk so they'd opted to leave the backpacks in their cabin and wore only their socks and shoes to protect their feet. Will had the key to their cabin tucked into the side of his shoe. Will was excited but Lucy just had a 'when in Rome' attitude about her. The nature views were beautiful, Will found that he was looking at Lucy even more. Her supple curves and her nice, round ass swaying back and forth as she walked the trail was arousing to the point that Will was sporting a hard-on by the time they made it to the first overlook. He wanted nothing more than to wrap his fist in her long red hair, bend her over a boulder, and pound her into oblivion. \n\nLucy smirked as she caught Will gaping at her. Her eyes darted down to his erection. He wasn't the largest she'd ever seen, but he could put the average male to shame. \"You look like you want something,\" she commented playfully. \n\n\"Yeah, I want to be bad,\" Will said as he walked up to wrap his arms around her. His thick cock ground up against her bottom. \n\nSwatting his arm, Lucy pulled away. \"Oh come off it,\" she said, \"Someone could come up here at any moment. What would they say?\" \n\n\"From what we've seen already? Probably 'can we join in'? There ain't anyone around for miles.\" Will said. \"The last people we saw on the trail were heading back to the resort. Come on, babe, live a little,\" he said, nuzzling back up against her. \n\n\"I thought that we were waiting until tonight?\" she murmured, sighing as she felt his lips brush the nape of her neck. \n\n\"Who can wait when there's a beauty like you here with me now?\" \n\nLucy let out a harrumph at the cheesy line, but decided to reward him at the spontaneous romance. It was something new from him and she admitted to herself that she loved the newfound attention. Who knew, this little trip just might be the thing that salvages their relationship. Lucy turned around in his arms, her breasts pressing up against his chest. She cupped his face with her hands and kissed him deeply before slowly sinking to her knees, trailing her fingers down his chest. \n\nShe stroked his hard shaft a couple of times before bringing the head up to her ruby red lips. Then, rolling her tongue around his cock a few times, she took him into her hot mouth. An impromptu blowjob was not what Will had in mind, but he went with it anyway thankful that he was getting that from her. He closed his eyes and sighed as she started bobbing her head back and forth along his length. \n\nWill felt his legs turn to water as Lucy sucked him hard and fast. \"Oh God,\" he moaned as he gyrated his hips forward slightly. \"I'm gonna blow,\" he breathed. Normally he had a decent staying power but he had been staring at Lucy's fine, bare ass for hours now. Not to mention all the fine eye candy that was back at the resort. It was a miracle he'd made it to the lookout this long. \n\nLucy pulled back the moment she felt his cock become engorged in her mouth. She attempted to dodge to the side but Will blew his load clear across her ample chest. \"Shit,\" she muttered while his cum splattered her tits and dribbled down. \"Dammit, Will,\" she complained. \"We don't have any towels!\" \n\n\"Sorry babe,\" Will said, a bit resentful that Lucy had yet to swallow with him. \"Look, we can go over the ridge and cut down to the river. You can get cleaned up there.\" \n\n\"Better be a quick walk 'cause I don't want to be caught out here with dry cum on my chest.\" Lucy complained. \n\nThey cut off the path in the direction of the river. Will led the way as he remembered the direction from the map they read back at camp. They went down into a small gulley where the 'river' that he thought was there was nothing more than a small stream that was far too shallow to do anything. After splashing what little water she could up towards her body, Lucy stood up and stomped a foot down impatiently. \"Gah! This is getting me nowhere, fast.\" She looked around in hopes of spotting a pool or something. \"Some river,\" she muttered, putting her fists on her hips. \n\n\"Let's head up stream,\" Will suggested. \"Surely to God there's going to be a small pool or something that you can get a better scoop of water.\" \n\nHeading off in the direction that he pointed out, the two of the walked over large rocks and boulders, under fallen trees and through some shrubs. After a half hour they came to a pair of trees that flanked the old riverbed that had bright orange rings painted on the trees at about eye height, orange flags tied around the trunks, and posted signs that said 'Private Property: Keep Out'. Lucy huffed, blowing a puff of air upwards that blew her red bangs back. \"So much for that idea. We might as well head on back and use the shower in our cabin.\" \n\n\"We must be near the lake.\" Will said, craning his neck to look in both directions. \"There's no fences, just more marked trees every hundred yards or so. Hell, I can even see the trail from here.\" \n\n\"No,\" Lucy shook her head. \"Don't even think about it. Remember what the resort director said; we can't go up here.\" \n\n\"Who the hell is going to know?\" Will asked, giving her a disdainful look. \"Come on; we can run up to the lake, jump in, get cleaned up real quick, and run out. We'd be in and out before anyone would know we were here.\" \n\n\"What about the guy who lives up here?\" Lucy crossed her arms and glared at him. The wording on the resort pamphlet came back to her and she really didn't want to test the theory that there might be some nutcase up here who'd actually do something to them. \n\nWill spread his arms wide, indicating the woods. \"These are some really big fucking woods, dear,\" he said. \"There ain't no way in hell that he'd be able to police them all and even if he did manage to find us in all of this square mileage then he deserves to catch us.\" \n\n\"Famous last words.\" \n\n\"Come on; live a little. It'll be a fun thrill,\" he said, practically begging. \n\nLucy let out a huff of air and sighed at Will's expectant, if not pleading, look. \"Equally famous last word. Fine. Stop looking at me like that. Let's just go and get this over with. I'm starting to itch anyway from your cum drying on me and I don't want to walk all the way back to camp like that.\" \n\n\"Atta girl!\" Will pumped a fist into the air. With renewed enthusiasm, Will took the lead, guiding her back to the trail and past the markers. Whoever kept to themselves up here didn't deserve such a beautiful place if they didn't put fences up. A good five minutes later and the forest broke into a beautiful clearing of a grassy field at the center of which was a crystal clear lake. \"Huh,\" Will commented, pointing in the direction of where the stream was at. \"No wonder there's no river anymore; someone built a dam over there. We would've ran into it had we stayed in the riverbed.\" \n\n\"Whatever,\" Lucy said, making a dash for the water. It took her a couple of minutes to clear the distance at a full run. She was anxious to get cleaned up and out of there before anyone noticed. Damn Will for making her come up here. Damn him for shooting across her chest that led to the need to be here. \"Wow, those are some fucking big lily pads,\" she muttered as she reached the shore. Not caring about her shoes, she ran into the water until she was about knee deep and sat down. \"Oooh! This water is really warm!\" she said with pleasure. Her body seemed to hum and relax instantly. She splashed the water up onto her chest in droves so that it then streamed back down; washing her off. She rubbed her hands across her collar bone, her sternum, and her tits to make sure that she got it all. \n\nStanding back up she turned to Will, who was walking up while gaping at the beautiful lakeside meadow that they were in, and gave a performer's flourish with her arms splayed up and one leg slightly cocked. \"Ta-da!\" she said proudly. \n\nWill's cock twitched to life and he went hard almost instantly at the sight of her standing there in the lake. With her standing proudly like that and the water dripping off of her body from her shoulders all the way down to her now soaked red curls that covered her pussy, he couldn't resist. \"Come on, let's do it right here and now.\" \n\n\"No, you don't have a condom.\" \n\n\"Oh please; you're on the pill.\" \n\n\"Fine, then how about: I don't want to stay here. I said no; we're outta here!\" Lucy said, sour that the moment passed. Granted, she was proud that her boyfriend finally got hard at the sight of her but she didn't want to tempt fate any further. She waded out of the lake and walked past him, shaking off his attempt to grab her hand and ignoring his pitiful begs. \n\n\"Don't make me chase you!\" Will said. He'd had enough of her cock teasing. \n\n\"You don't have the balls,\" Lucy called back over her shoulder. She looked back and Will was charging after her. With a playful squeal she started running but Will had too much of a head start on her. He tackled her with ease as he made them both tumble into the tall grass. \"Get off of me. Okay, okay! You do have the balls after all. Now let me up!\" \n\n\"Fuck no,\" Will growled. Something primal in him snapped and Lucy's eyes went wide as she saw the change in him. \"I want a fucking and a fucking you're going to get!\" \n\n\"We'll be caught!\" \n\n\"There's no one around here!\" \n\nLucy turned onto her stomach and tried to scramble away. Will caught her ankle easily and pulled her back. He then flattened her to the ground by putting his bulk on top of her. His cock ground into the cleft of her round ass, making him moan. Reaching under with one hand while keeping the back of her neck pinned with the other Will brought his hard cock up to her waiting pussy. \"Will, no! This isn't funny anymore.\" Her self-defense training started kicking in. Intellectually she knew that she could easily grab his hand that held her neck and bring her forearm up from the opposite side to hit his. If his arm didn't break, it would certainly bruise to the point where he'd probably let go and that would give her other options. But there was something more, deep in her gut and her loins that kept her from doing that to Will. \n\nShe found herself going wet at the prospect of being ravished just like she'd been at the beach. \n\nInstead she put up a token struggle by rocking back and forth in an attempt to dislodge him. She still wanted him off but she also really didn't want to break her boyfriend's arm either. A moment later the point was moot as she felt the head of his cock nuzzle against her wet opening. \"I think that you might actually want this,\" Will said as he shoved his cock inside of her. Lucy clawed the ground and cried out half in pain and half in pleasure as she felt his manhood spear her. Tears that were a mixture of pain and humiliation flooded her eyes and fell down her now flushed and burning face. Her breasts were pressed flat into the ground causing the grass to scratch at her ivory skin and pale pink nipples. \n\nOnce he was fully entrenched inside of her. Will placed his hands onto the ground on either side of her breasts and plowed into her again and again. Lucy laid her head down into the grass and sobbed softly as Will ruthlessly fucked her from behind. Her pitiful cries soon turned into muted grunts with each thrust into her. Her body moved back and forth over the ground as Will pounded her hard from behind. Soon he let out a sigh of contentment as his cock started to pulsate inside of her pussy. His hot cum covered her inner most folds and flooded her womb. \"Damn,\" he breathed as he kept himself jammed up inside of her to his hilt. \"That felt good.\" ",
        "\"You could've at least got me off too, jerk.\" Lucy spat. \"Now get the fuck off of me!\" She pushed him off of her. \n\n\"Shit, attitude!\" Will said as he stood up. \"What's your problem? I thought that you wanted more spontaneity in our relationship?\" \n\n\"I don't want to be caught up here, asshole!\" Lucy shouted, getting up and into his face. \"I was going to lead you back into the woods, past the markers, and let you take me there!\" \n\n\"We're not going to be caught!\" \n\nThat's when they both heard the crack of a hunting rifle that caused them both to duck. Something whizzed though the air past them. They both look in the direction of the dam where now they noticed a small cabin just inside of the tree line. There was a man with a hunting rifle of some sorts and he had it pointed in their direction. Lucy shot will a dirty look while they started to run. \"You were saying?\" she snarled. Will didn't get a chance to say anything back to her as the mysterious man fired a second time. Lucy jerked as she felt something hit her right in the ass. She managed to look back in time to see a dart protruding out of it before her world went black. \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 4: The Cabin in the Woods. \n\nAs Lucy slowly came back to consciousness she became aware of a man shouting. By the time she blinked her eyes rapidly and got them to focus she could hear what he was saying. \"Well I don't give a damn what the hell they think right now. So? Let them hate so long as they fear. Him? Keep him at his cabin.\" Lucy groggily lifted her head up and looked at the man. She blinked when her formerly downcast eyes were bombarded by light from above her. She blinked some more and looked up to see a skylight above her that bathed her in a ring of bright light. She then looked in the direction of the man who was shouting into a cell phone. He was tall, that was for sure. She couldn't make out any details as he kept to the dark shadows around her. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Fluff him up or outright fuck him if you have to but just make sure that he stays put until I can get more information on him and his girl here. Just make sure that you're here an hour after sundown.\" He pushed the screen of his phone, apparently ending the call as he put the phone on a nearby table. \n\nWas he just talking about Will? Lucy's wondered. Her adrenaline shot through her body as the man's attention turned to her. \"Finally awake I see. Good,\" he said, looking her up and down. Lucy then became aware that she was tied to a chair that had armrests as her wrists were firmly secured to them. She flexed her hands and rotated her wrists, testing the bonds. She tried standing but quickly found that her ankles were secured to the legs and that the chair was not budging an inch. \"Save your energy,\" her captor told her. \"You'll need it. Suffice to say; you're my prisoner and you're not going anywhere until I get answers. The chair that you're in is bolted to the floor. So don't try something stupid like you see in the movies and try to break it like you're the Black Widow or something.\" \n\n\"Where,\" Lucy croaked out. Her voice felt like she'd been gargling with razor blades. \"Where am I?\" \n\nThe man sighed. \"I would've hoped that we were past this part by now since you were the one who has trespassed on my property. You're in my cabin,\" he said. \"And to answer your next inevitable questions; I hit you with a tranq dart. Your boyfriend tried to haul you away but gave up on that prospect the closer I got. He turned tail and ran back to the resort.\" \n\nLucy wasn't sure what to think. She didn't know if she should be grateful or pissed that Will got away. \"You're not a very good shot, are you?\" she asked. \n\n\"Hmph,\" the man snorted in amusement. \"You try hitting a couple of human sized targets with darts from a rife at five hundred yards and then we'll talk about marksmanship.\" He picked up something on the table and walked forward so that he was barely in the light. Lucy could see his tall, very hard and muscular body that implied that he worked out on a regular basis. He was broad in the shoulders and thick in the thighs, probably from a lot of running. He wore a pair of tight, black boxer-briefs that wasn't leaving much to her imagination judging by the bulge that she could see. The only other thing that he wore was a simple pair of black martial arts slip on shoes and a black ski mask so that she couldn't see his face; only his hazel eyes. \n\nIn his hands he held a combat knife of some sorts. He twirled the handle with one had while the butt of it was resting in the palm. At the tip he held it by a single finger while he twirled. Her eyes went wide at the slight trickle of blood on his own finger as he spun the knife in place. Shit, she thought, if he's willing to do that to himself in just casual talk, what's he going to do with me? \"What do you want with me?\" she voiced the fear, swallowing hard in fear. \n\n* \n\nBrad smirked behind his mask as he caught her mental question. Violence Perceived is Violence Achieved. He silently thanked his mentor for that little gem of information. There was never any actual need to hurt anyone if you could avoid it. The girl was hot, that was for certain. The cascade of vibrant red hair down to halfway down her back and the equally vibrant red curls between her legs stood out in stark contrast to her pale ivory skin. She had nice round breast that, in his opinion, were the perfect size; not to large and not too small. He estimated that they were a good handful for him with just a little spillover. Pale rosy pink nipples stood like little nubs surrounded by just a little puff of areolae. In the bright light of the skylight, she seemed to glow like an angel and he could make out pale freckles all over her body; a true redhead. \n\nIn the back of his mind he heard a voice talk to him. [Amusement/Irritation] The female's pheromones are elevated along with rapid heartbeat and increased blood pressure. Mate with the female already... \n\nLet's see what she's really here for first, Brad responded. He flipped the knife in his hand, catching it by the blade, and then threw it down hard. It made a swish/thud sound as it embedded itself into the table with his phone on it. The girl jumped and stiffened in response. She then turned her head away, blushing furiously. Brad caught a new scent in the air and caught a glint of light play off of her pussy. The girl squeezed her thighs together as much as possible. Sonofabitch... she's wet. \n\n[Pride] Told you... \n\nBrad walked forward and then circled around her once like the predator he was. She averted her gaze and turned her head away from him as much as she could. \"Who are you?\" he asked. \n\n\"L-Lucy,\" the redhead replied, trying to regain her composure. Her eyes went back to his knife where it was still vibrating on the table. \"What do you want to know?\" \n\n\"I want to know about you,\" Brad said calmly. \"I want to know all about you. I want to know about what goes on in a day in the life of Lucy. Namely; today.\" He started circling around her again. \"I want to know where you're from, what you're doing here, who you were doing out by my lake. Everything.\" \n\n\"Or else what?\" Lucy demanded, \"You're going to cut me or something?\" \n\nBrad stopped and smiled, leering down at her again. \"I'm thinking more in the 'or something' category.\" \n\nLucy got the implication at once. \"That'd be rape!\" The ravishing at the beach was one thing. This was something completely different. \n\n\"Not according to the consent forms you all signed down at the camp.\" He walked over to his table and grabbed something off of the printer. \"Crossing marked boundaries implies consent to any machinations that the property owner has, protection guaranteed by federal law,\" he quoted from the legal paperwork from the camp. \"This consent form means that I can do whatever the fuck I want to you, so long as I don't kill you, and there is not a damn thing you can do about it.\" He showed her the paper and pointed down at the bottom. \"This is your signature, is it not?\" He smiled at her. \"My dear, I can waterboard you from here until doomsday and there's not a damn thing that you or anyone else could do about it.\" \n\n\"I-I could go public,\" Lucy gulped, now realizing how much in trouble she was and why the camp director was desperate to keep them away from the lake. \n\n\"Sure, provided I left any memory of the encounter in your head,\" Brad retorted. He smiled when he saw her tense. \"Yes, I do have the ability to wipe your mind if I have to. But I'd rather not do that as it is really inconsiderate to guests. So... start talking.\" \n\nWith her defenses crumbling, Lucy spilled her guts about this last-chance getaway with her boyfriend that she was quickly becoming estranged with. She talked about how he'd convinced her to come up here and how she was trying to become more pliable to his needs and everything but she was quickly losing interest in him. \"The problem is,\" she was now shouting at him out of anger towards Will, \"is that he fucking expects me to cater to his every fucking whim while he screws everything in existence. We weren't even in the camp for five minutes and he was already ogling every pretty piece of ass that walked by including the director! Hell, I've been with you for only a short while and you've listened to me more than my own so-called boyfriend has!\" \n\nThe voice came back into Brad's head. [Informative] Truth so far... \n\nNo shit, Brad mentally snapped back. I got this, do you mind? \n\n[Irritation/Boredom] Fine, wake me when you are done and you're ready to breed the female... [Amusement] Even if she has the stench of Hunter on her... \n\nWait, what? \n\nLucy was still going on, now ranting and raving about her boyfriend, Will, and his lack of sexual prowess. \"I was starting to get into it with him being all forceful and everything. Hell I fucking enjoyed it! But no, the damn bastard had to leave me hanging twice now! I should've left his ass already! He never once gives ME an orgasm. It's always about him! And now he's probably is down back at camp fucking your little fluff bunny! This is what I fucking get for going with him to another nudist camp again!\" \n\n\"This was supposed to be torture, not therapy,\" Brad groaned under his breath, massaging his temples. His Lurker, who had been listening in, was correct though; she was being completely truthful. He also picked up from her that she was fearful as to what might happen to her but at the same time turned on at being tied up. \"Enough!\" he snapped, finally done with her bitching and moaning about her lack of love and sex life. It was time for a change in tactics. Lucy's blue eyes went wide at his sudden outburst. She leaned back in the chair as much as she could when he advanced on her. \n\nBrad grabbed a fistful of her fiery red hair and wrenched her head back hard. Lucy let out a passionate gasp as she closed her eyes and opened her mouth... and stayed in that position with breathless anticipation. She let out a small moan as her nipples hardened and her pussy went slick. She rubbed her thighs together and pictured him ravishing her. Part of her wished that he would. \n\nThis was all apparent to Brad who could not only read her mind but read her body language. On impulse, he leaned in and took possession of her mouth with his. His tongue probed deep into her mouth, causing her to let out a squeak of surprise at first that turned into a full, lustful moan. Even more surprisingly to him was the fact that she was kissing him back with equal furor. His hand came up to maul her left breast as he continued to forcefully make out with her. Then that same hand shot down between her legs to cup her sex. There was some token resistance on her part until she relaxed her thighs just enough to allow him to finger her. \n\nHis hand rubbed at her swollen clit hard with his hand moving across her bush at the same time. Lucy started letting out a series of short whimpers as the fire in her loins was rekindled in no time at all. What is it with me? She wondered as her chest started heaving and she felt herself get inexorably closer to climax. This man shot me and dragged me into his shack and is now holding me hostage and I'm getting off by this? Ohhh God... that feels good... right there... yes... keep fingering me hard like that! Ohmygod... I shouldn't enjoy this so much... What is it about this man? I just met him! He abducted me! But his scent is soooo intoxicating! \n\nKeeping up with the mental barrage, Brad anticipated her sexual needs and responded in kind to what she wanted. He slipped the tip of his middle finger into her pussy and continued to rub her mound with his hand. Lucy arched up against him and cried out into his mouth, her scream muffled by him as she came hard in an earth-shattering orgasm. Her arms and legs quivered uncontrollably as they strained in their bonds. Her cry turned into a throaty, guttural moan as Brad prolonged it by continuing to finger-fuck her while she rode it out. \n\nBy the time she was done and he'd stopped, her head swam as she felt like she was drunk off of the pheromones in the air. Oh. My. God... She thought as she moaned. Best. Orgasm. Ever... and he hasn't even touched me with that raging hard-on of his... I wonder what that'll be like? \n\nBrad chuckled as her thoughts came through to him as if she were talking out loud. The smell of sex now hung in the air and he wasn't even remotely through with her. He grabbed his shaving kit from the bathroom and came back out to her. She was looking more coherent now that she was coming down from the sexual high she'd been on. It was an after-effect of his enhanced pheromones and he'd nailed her with a full blast of it right when he got her off. \"Now we're going to take it from the top,\" he said, taking out a can of shaving cream and spraying a generous amount into his cupped hand. \"Who are you?\" \n\n\"Yours if you give me another orgasm like that...\" Lucy panted, her eyes still wandering and not focusing on any one thing in particular. \n\n\"Cute,\" he said, dipping his shaving cream filled hand down between her legs to spread it all over her mound. Lucy let out a long \"Mmmmm,\" as the cold cream covered her privates. She whimpered and shook in her bonds in protest as he removed his hand. \"Now; who are you?\" \n\n\"Lucy Alleyn, what's yours?\" \n\nRealizing that he failed to make introductions he smiled. \"You can call me Brad,\" he said. \"Now why are you here Lucy?\" \n\n\"Right now? To be your little slave if you just touch me like that again!\" she whined, now desperate for his touch again. She jumped up and down in the seat as much as she could for emphasis. She didn't know why, but she just had to have another orgasm from him just like the first! \n\n\"All in due time,\" he said soothingly, caressing the side of her face with his clean hand. \"You get rewarded when you answer my questions. Now; why are you here?\" \n\n\"I answer this already! Vacation. Trying to patch things up with my... boyfriend, I guess you could call him,\" Lucy repeated with obvious distaste. What the fuck is the matter with me? Why am I craving his touch like some love-starved teenager? \n\n[Amusement] Because you are one... Another voice seemed to intrude upon her thoughts. \n\nBrad shot an irritated thought towards his Lurker to shut up before continuing on. Oh, can it; she's twenty-one according to her driver's license... \n\n[Inquisitive] What is it that you humans say... Po-tay-to, Po-tah-to... \n\nBite me. \n\n[Amusement] We think that the female will be doing that for us... sometime tomorrow the rate that the two of you are going we figure... \n\nWith his back turned to Lucy, Brad rolled his eyes. Out of all the Lurkers in the world he had to get the one with a sarcastic streak. He'd moved back to the table to wipe the rest of the shaving cream off of his hand and to retrieve his razor. \n\nLucy looked apprehensive, but expectant when he returned with it, knelt before her in between her splayed knees, and slowly dragged the razor down her abdomen into the cream. With careful precision he lopped off the red curls between her legs until she was as bare as the day she was born. He then applied some lotion, rubbing it into the skin to prevent razor burn. Lucy gasped and panted under his touch and then whined again when he withdrew. \n\n\"Now; do you know what a Hunter is?\" Brad asked, changing his line of questioning up and carefully avoiding the subject of her boyfriend. \n\n\"Uhm... someone who goes out to kill and cook Bambi?\" Lucy asked, wondering where that question came from. \n\n\"Why did you come here?\" Brad continued on. \"Why not go back down to that hedonistic resort down on the coast?\" \n\n\"Hey! You owe me some attention! I answered your last question!\" Lucy complained. \n\n\"True,\" Brad walked around to behind her. There he placed his hands onto her shoulders and then slid them down to cup her breasts. Then he gave them a gentle squeeze and flicked her still hard nipples once. \"Now answer my next question,\" he whispered, his breath hot on her neck. \n\n\"I... I... I didn't like the fact the guards would have to cavity search us and I didn't like the fact that any man could have his way with me if I wanted to or not... not that I'm complaining about such event happening now, mind you, as you're much better than they were,\" Lucy breathed, closing her eyes again and rolling her head to the side so that he'd have easy access to her neck. Brad obliged her by kissing and sucking on her nape while moving one hand back down to her now shaven pussy. \"I... I also wasn't thrilled about being gangbanged... while Will watched...\" \n\n\"You enjoyed it... Don't deny it... I can read you like a book.\" \n\n\"Yeah... I did...\" Lucy admitted while he cupped her sex. She tried to gyrate against his hand but he held it just out of reach for her to find any satisfaction from it. \"Touch me!\" she whined. \"Fuck me!\" \n\n\"What didn't you like about the resort?\" \n\n\"Nothing! I liked it! I enjoyed it! I wanted to be banged like a salvation army drum!\" Lucy cried out while trying to find release from the sexual torment that was going on. \"I was more pissed off at Will for springing it on me the way he did!\" \n\nAs a reward, Brad rubbed her bare mound, getting her to hum in response. \"Now... Who told you about the beach resort?\" \n\n\"Mmmm... Will did... he found out about it from some friends.\" Lucy purred, reveling in his touch. \"He's got friends that work there...: \n\nBrad sucked on her neck some more before standing up and moving back around to her front. \"Who? I want names.\" \n\n\"Oh don't stop now! Some guy named Edward!\" \n\n\"Keep going. I want more information than just that.\" \n\n\"I don't know his last name! Please, I swear! Just Edward and that he's some kind of researcher who works outside of Metro. Will took a class of his back in college a few years back and they were friends.\" \n\n\"Oh okay, I guess I can work with that,\" Brad playfully conceded. He knelt back down in front of her and dragged his tongue once up her slit. Lucy shuddered in response. \n\n[Amusement] We find this form of... torture... highly entertaining with yielding much better results... [Wonder] Why does your armed forces not employ such techniques... \n\nIt's a little something called the 'Geneva Conventions', now will you shut up already? I'm working here! \n\nMeanwhile, Lucy was lost in bliss as Brad's tongue worked up and down the length of her opening while pausing every so often to swirl around her clit. This is insane! I shouldn't feel like this in the presence of someone who has me tied down against my will, her mind screamed in protest while her head swam with the intense pleasure she was receiving. \"OHHHHHH!\" she cried out when his finger then invaded her most intimate passage. She began to buck against her bonds before her body started to quake in her arms and legs as the orgasm built within her like a volcano before releasing. Lucy became delirious from the second intense orgasm in the space of minutes. She'd never cum in that short amount of time with anyone, including herself and her toys that she had at home. Bradly put all past lovers to shame. ",
        "The last thing she remembered before passing out was the darkness of a hood being put over her head. Who is this man? \n\n* \n\nWill was pacing around his cabin nervously. What the fuck just happened up here? That was supposed to be a researcher up there, not some lunatic with a gun! Why the hell was Jen acting so weird the moment he got back? Why hadn't Edward answered his phone or got back to him already after leaving a message? And why was he just standing here in this room like a moron? \n\nThere was a knock at the door that made him jump. Will opened it and there was Jen, standing there in all her curvy, naked glory with a smile on her face. \"I figured that I could keep you company while the thing with your girlfriend gets sorted out?\" she said with a hint of lust her in voice. \n\n\"Who is that man up there and where does he get off shooting a gun at us?\" Will demanded. \n\nJen turned to close and lock the door before approaching him. \"Shhh, relax,\" she said in a soothing voice as she placed her hands on his shoulders and pressed her ample breasts up against his chest. The way his cock immediately sprang to attention to hit her belly told her that she had his attention. \"Lucy will be back in due time. Until then, I'll keep you company.\" \n\n\"Well... uh...\" He stammered sheepishly, not sure what to say. He had been ogling her earlier and now that she was pressed up against his body, who was he to turn her down? \n\nSliding down his body, Jen pressed her breasts up against him, making sure to envelop his cock within her cleavage in the process. She settled onto her knees, lifting her breasts up to rub on either side of his manhood that was now rock hard. Then she dipped her head forward to suckle on its head, eliciting a lustful moan from Will in the process. \n\nWill's hand clamped onto the back of Jen's head as he shoved his cock further into her mouth. His sex drive took over as he wrapped her hair around his hand and face fucked her. Jen took it all in stride, relaxing her jaw and keeping her mouth open as his cock slid in and out of her lips like a steel piston. When she felt his cock swell, she sucked on him hard. \n\nHis cock blew almost immediately. It was so intense for him that he pulled away from her and shot his load across her face and her massive tits. Will had to backup and sit down on the bed as his legs nearly gave out on him. \"Daaaaaammmnnn...\" he breathed. \n\n\"And we're not even done yet, big boy,\" Jen said, rising to her feet and taking him in hand. To his amazement, she stroked him back to instant hardness before climbing up on top of him and sinking down onto his cock to go again. \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 5: Breeding Time. \n\nJen knocked on the door to Brad's cabin, her guts in a knot as she waited. \"Hey,\" he said softly as he first cracked the door to see who it was before opening it all the way. \"Come on in.\" \n\n\"Thanks,\" Jen said, not feeling good about this meeting. \"So... where is she?\" \n\n\"I got her in the back,\" Brad said, jerking his thumb off to the left. \"She's in my den off to the side of my bedroom.\" \n\n\"Hmmmm,\" Jen commented noncommittedly, hugging herself as she walked in. It had been some time since she'd been up here. \"What'd you do to her?\" she asked as Brad led her downstairs to the basement. \n\n\"The same thing I did to you all those years ago when you stumbled onto my cabin,\" Brad commented. \"I'm not thrilled that I have visitors up from your camp.\" \n\n\"I told them, multiple times, not to come up here!\" Jen complained, fearing the punishment that was coming as they walked down the stairs. \n\n\"What'd you do to the boyfriend?\" \n\n\"What you said; I gave him a blowjob and then fucked him multiple times until he finally passed out. He doesn't know what's going on up here. Your secret is safe. Please, you have to believe me!\" It wasn't that she didn't want to be here, it was more of the fact that she'd have to go out into the world with clothes on with the possibility of being attacked at any time. \n\nBrad shrugged. \"Either way, this is the agreement that you personally entered into when you set your camp up here.\" He grabbed a piece of paper off the nearby desk as they got down to the lower level and handed it to her. \"You'll be impregnated with two young this time to be delivered to these locations. Don't worry; they'll be small enough that if you wear baggy enough clothes outside of the camp no one will suspect that you're carrying. There will be protection setup for you along the way. Once you reach lake number two there will be a vehicle with supplies waiting for you. Obtain the items listed at the bottom and bring them back to me.\" \n\n\"TWO?\" Jen's eyes went wide. \"I've never had to do more than one in the past! That's not the deal that we made originally!\" she shouted as she stood up and leaned on the table. \n\n\"The deal is subject to alteration. Pray that I do not alter it any further.\" Brad's eyes narrowed as he looked at her, making her shrink back into her chair. \n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"Why, what?\" \n\n\"Why the change?\" \n\nBrad half-shrugged. \"I guess you deserve that much. It's the new protocols that are being put into place now that the Hunters have stepped up their activities. For each Lurker that they kill every location is to birth two more to ensure the survival of the species.\" \n\nJen mentally did the math. \"At that rate you'd overrun North America at the very least.\" \n\n\"You'd think so, would you?\" Brad gave her a wan smile. \"The problem is that these Hunters are very well informed, well... were very well informed. The Caretakers for the Ancient smoked a spy out.\" Now he leaned on the desk to look down at her. \"However, that was after the Hunters killed a Lurker just outside of Metro and hauled its body off. They then used it to birth some aggressive creatures of their own to attack us. And now they have something new and scarier. We lost a spy to get that information out. Now you tell me; of the two factions, which would you rather have in charge?\" \n\n\"Good point,\" Jen sighed. At least with the Lurkers she benefited from their care. The veritable fountain of youth was one such perk. She stood up and splayed her arms out wide and jutted her tits out for him to get a good look at. \"So are you going to just take me now?\" \n\nBrad shook his head with regret. \"As much as I would like to right now, no. I'll give your fine body the proper attention it deserves when you return,\" Brad added with a quick wink. \"I need you to get moving as soon as possible so that you're out the back trail before nightfall.\" He jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the door that Jen knew all too well what lay behind it. \"Now get going. Skulker is waiting for you and if you're going to get any kind of mind-blowing pleasure from him before you leave, you better get out there. I'll have your clothes waiting for you in your car by the time you get back up.\" \n\n\"Thanks,\" Jen nodded as she headed through the door. \n\nWhen he got back upstairs, back in the bedroom, he heard Lucy's sharp intake of breath. Ah fuck, she's awake. How much did she overhear? \n\n* \n\nJen walked into the wading pool that was in the back of Brad's home. As usual, the water was warm and pleasant to be in. Already the green vine-like tentacles were in there waiting for her. Taking a deep breath, she immersed herself into the water and splayed her arms and legs wide. Before her body could naturally go back to the surface, the tentacles gently wrapped themselves around her limbs to keep her submerged. A single tentacle came up to her lips to probe her mouth. She opened up and it easily slid down her throat, splitting off to enter her lungs while parts of it expanded to cover her face so that she could breathe. \n\nThe tentacles pulled taut, reeling her into the central black tube in the far wall. This was the part that Jen hated the most as with her curvy body she always felt like she wasn't going to fit. The tentacles pulled her arms behind her back so that she was essentially tied forearm to forearm while her legs were wrenched back so that she looked like she was hogtied. Once she was through the tube and into the darkness of the cave lair of the creature, her movement stopped and she felt like she was floating in nothingness. \n\n[Apologetic] The other female human is awake... [Urgent] Time is of the essence... The creature said directly to her mind. \n\nShit... I was hoping to have a lot of fun while we were at it... Jen thought. \n\n[Amused] You may return to us once you have delivered our young... [Humor] We can, as you humans, say, 'owe you one'... \n\nI'm going to hold you to that! Jen told the creature in her mind. \n\nJen's knees were taken by two vines to splay them out wide. At the same time, two more tentacles snaked their way between her thighs to burrow up inside of her pussy and her ass. Behind her tentacle mask, Jen let out a husky breath as the tentacles fully penetrated her and then expanded to fill her up completely. Two more came out of the darkness to latch onto the tips of her breasts, encasing the nipples and stimulating her glands. Her already large breasts immediately felt heavier as the nurturing milk was created and then mutated to become the life-giving nectar that would help feed the young that she was going to carry. \n\nThe tentacles inside of her pussy and ass throbbed and pulsated to life. Jen's eyes fluttered and then rolled back into her head as the intense pleasure built inside of her. She tried simulating the sensation one time and the closest she got was with a double-penetration attachment on a sybian turned up as high as it would go. \"Oh God...\" she croaked in pleasure around the tentacle in her mouth as her body was erotically charged from head to toe. \n\nThen she felt the first bulge in the tentacle reach her pussy, pushing its way into her. She thrashed and screamed her head off in pleasure as the fluid inside blew into her womb, filling it up with the liquid that the young would be in as they traveled. Her belly started to swell, making her look like she was a couple of months pregnant. Then the second bulge blew into her, expanding her belly again. By the time the last one came that would impregnate her, Jen was delirious from the orgasm that was already wracking her body. \n\n[Informative] We are finished... The creature proclaimed. \n\nAnd I thought some men were fast finishers... Jen complained in her mind. \n\n[Amused] We still maintain that you should mate with our caretaker, you two suit each other... \n\nSorry, but I've sworn off men for anything more than sex... \n\n[Sorrow] Pity... [Informative] Come back to us on your return and we will make it worth your while... \n\n* \n\nLucy was on the verge of hyperventilating. Impregnation? Lurkers? Hunters? What the fuck was going on here? She had the sudden urge to get out of there and be anywhere but there. Her head whipped around, looking up at her wrists tied to the headboard. Fuck! Brad was good at tying knots! They won't give, she thought in a near panic as she jerked against them. \n\nHer head turned sharply and her vibrant blue eyes were as big as saucers when Brad came in with a scowl on his face. \"How much did you hear?\" \n\n\"Nothing!\" she blurted out, perhaps too quickly. \n\n\"Bullshit.\" Brad hissed. He didn't need his Lurker-enhanced abilities to spot that lie. \"Try again.\" \n\nShaking out of fright, Lucy tried to keep control of herself. \"Something about lurking and hunters and someone getting knocked up,\" she said in a small voice. He was mad and quivering with anger, she could tell. \"And... uh... who's Skulker?\" Brad swore under his breath at that admission. \"Uhm... what are you going to do to me?\" \n\n\"Escalate things...\" he growled, stalking over to her chair and cutting the ropes with his knife that he'd left nearby. Lucy felt the tension ease off her limbs from being freed from the chair. Then she squeaked when he grabbed her by the hair and led her through the house and down into the basement. \n\nShe started to squirm in his grasp. \"No! Please! I don't want to know! Whatever it is! I swear that I won't tell anyone! I promise!\" \n\n\"I'd like to believe you, I really do,\" Brad said, almost apologetically. \"However, I have to look at the bigger picture here and that's the protection of this lake and its inhabitant.\" \n\n\"What kind of a Forestry Ranger or Eco-Freak are you?\" Lucy asked as she was dragged down the stairs. When she saw the basement, she realized that there was more to Brad's cabin that met the eye. It looked more like a lab out of a sci-fi movie than your normal basement. Brad kept on pulling her inexorably over to the single door in the wall. Lucy guessed that was the door that Jen went though, willingly, just a few minutes before. \n\nBrad opened the door and they were blasted by a wave of heat. Inside was a huge lit pool that was steaming like it was a heated jacuzzi. The pool was so large that it looked like it could feed into the lake outside. Lucy got a better look and her suspicion was confirmed when she saw what looked to be like three dark tunnels that led from the area. \n\n\"Where's Jen at? Didn't she come in here?\" \n\n\"Give her a minute,\" Brad said. \n\n\"I-I don't want to be here anymore.\" \n\n\"Should've thought about that before crossing the marked boundary,\" Brad said, his steel grip tightening on her forearms. \n\n\"How... How about you just fuck me and let me go? Please? You can even keep me tied up!\" Lucy pleaded with him, still writhing in his arms. \n\n\"The problem is,\" Brad glared down at her, \"is that you reek of Hunters. Their scent is all over you.\" \n\n\"What? What are you talking about? How can you-\" \n\n\"I have abilities that allow me to tell. So, either knowingly or unknowingly, you've been with them. I'm going to have to find out everything that you know. To do that, we have to talk to Skulker.\" \n\n\"Who...\" Lucy started to ask when she then caught sight of something moving in the water. She gasped when she saw the larger, curvy body of Jen coming out of the central passageway. She was still naked but her belly looked bigger, almost like she was pregnant. But how could that be? Lucy just saw her earlier today and she didn't look like she was knocked up. And were those vines entangling her? But no, Lucy saw that the vines were breaking away from her wrists and from around her waist and head to let her go. \n\nJen jerked as if she were coming awake. She twisted in the water, kicked and pulled once, and surfaced at the stairs. She sputtered and looked up at them. \"What's she doing here?\" Jen demanded. \n\n\"The same as you, but probably won't be as enjoyable.\" Brad jerked his head to the side. \"I had Skulker speed things up due to this development.\" \n\nLucy was too busy looking at the vines. \"What are those?\" she asked, \n\n\"Skulker.\" Brad said as he pushed her in. She screamed all the way down to the water where the vines quickly ensnared her and pulled her into the passage that Jen had just come out of.\" \n\n* \n\n\"Enjoy yourself?\" Brad asked, helping Jen up out of the water once Lucy was gone. \n\n\"Yeah, but it was WAY too quick this time,\" she complained. Brad grabbed a nearby towel and helped dry her off before handing her a bundle of clothes. \"You owe me!\" \n\n\"I'll make it up to you tonight. Promise.\" \n\n\"Damn right you will,\" Jen snorted, \"And then I have a date with Skulker.\" \n\n\"Fine, now get going. I need to get in there with the girl.\" \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 6: \"Interrogation\" \n\nLucy thrashed about in the water as the vines wrapped around her wrists and ankles. She let out a scream and another one of the vines shoved its way down into her mouth, making her gurgle. Then, to her amazement, it then stretched to cover her entire face. What the hell is happening? She wondered, in a near panic. I need to get out of here! I need to get free! AIR! I NEED AIR! She then thought with alarm as she then tried to claw her way to the surface. \n\nThe only problem was that she was being dragged into that dark tunnel that Jen was in. She watched with horror as the light from the pool room dwindled into a small pinprick of light before winking out of existence. Oh my God! I'm gonna drown! \n\nA voice entered her mind, loud and clear. [Commanding] BREATHE! \n\nLucy gasped for air and was surprised that she could breathe. The vine, or whatever it was, acted as a breathing tube. She greedily sucked in the precious oxygen. It gave her time to look around to... nothingness. It was pitch black and all she knew was that her body was being held out spread-eagled in the water by the vines. \n\nThat's when she saw two, massive, glowing red eyes open up in front of her. Lucy screamed in terror as the eyes radiated out enough light for her to make out the shape and form of... whatever the hell that thing was. It looked as if it stepped right out of a horror movie and mated with something out of hentai and anime. Lucy hyperventilated as she frantically tried to pull her limbs free to swim away. She heard a loud rumble that seemed to reverberate all around her, deafening her. The glowing eyes seem to glare at her, studying her as if she were an insect. She screamed again as it drew her closer to continue its inspection of her naked body. \n\nThen there was a buzzing inside of her head and it started to ache. Lucy twitched her head and tried to shake it off but it just continued in intensity. Soon she was crying in pain and she just wanted it to stop. Images flashed through her mind about her home, her family, her boyfriend, her friends, and then shifted to her and Will as they arrived at the nudist camp, then shifted again to when they were at the nude beach resort. Why was she thinking of this now? Was she going to die? Was this what happened when your life flashes though your mind prior to death? \n\nIt'll stop once he gets the information from your mind... A voice said inside of her head. She recognized it as Brad's. Lucy managed to open her eyes and she could see Brad floating in the water off to her side. He was naked and had a really impressive cock standing on end. He had his arms crossed as he too studied her and she noticed that he also had a vine stretched across his face like a breathing mask. \n\nWhy is this happening to me? She whined inside of her mind. \n\n[Informative] It is the male she came with... he has colluded with our enemies... The commanding voice from earlier said now. \n\nBrad looked at the creature. Is she one of them? He asked it. She then realized that it was the creature that was talking to her and they were all doing it via telepathy. \n\n[Informative] No... She has seen them and been around them but is not of them... \n\nWhat is this all about? Lucy wondered. \n\nBrad sighed and rolled his eyes. This creature is what we call a Lurker... he explained, turning his full attention towards her. While we were swinging in trees and picking around in caves while the dinosaurs ruled, they came from the planet of a dying star to make their home here on earth. They were the scouting party. When the first colony ship came in, something went wrong and it crashed, killing the dinosaurs and plunging the planet into an ice age. The resulting radiation burst, since they were all nearby to welcome their fellow Lurkers to their new home, sterilized them. They can't breed on their own anymore. So, they went dormant to await others of their kind, emerging when humans started to really evolve. They found that they could use the humans to perpetuate their lines by injecting their DNA into human sperm and ova. They incubate into a human female and boom, instant Lurker. Over the millennia, they've perfected the process so they can incubate one or two in a human inside of a day. ",
        "That's disgusting! Lucy recoiled at the thought. Then she paused. Shouldn't they own the planet by now? \n\nYou'd think so, but finding willing caretakers and hosts are hard. For a time, they had to snatch unwilling participants to continue their line when they were desperate. Then, take into consideration that their young are very vulnerable until they reach full maturation which takes a good half-century. About ninety percent of them are wiped out before they can get into just the adolescent stage after a decade. Half of that number will survive to adulthood. Brad gestured towards the creature. The truly badass of them will survive until they get to be the size of a small apartment building but only if they remain hidden because of your boyfriend and his buddies who would actively hunt them down and kill them. \n\nHold on, Lucy interrupted him. You said that they were waiting for others? Out of all this time no one has come. \n\n[Corrective] Others have come... some have made it... not many survived... the creature interjected. Lucy then had images of the Siberian Fireball and other asteroids that had burned up or had blown up in the air. [Sorrow] The one you call the 'Siberian Fireball' in your history was the second colony... Others were much smaller vessels that were transporting our people... \n\nThere's another colony ship on its way and is about to enter the solar system, Brad added. People like me are trying to pave the way for them to land safely and create a haven for them. But people like your boyfriend have declared open season on them with no bag limit. \n\nOkay, so saying for a moment that this is all true and these creatures are intelligent enough for DNA mutating and space flight, how come they haven't left yet? \n\nAmused, Brad regarded her. You're a college student, right? He said into her mind while reading it. You're a pharmacy major? \n\nYeah... \n\nSo that means that you can mix medication. Does that mean that you can build a spaceship? \n\nUh... no. \n\nSo then what makes you think that these creatures can do the same? The ones that survived were scientists and surveyors. They even had a couple of pilots and navigators. It doesn't mean that they can build the ship or even the launch facilities they needed in order to leave the planet even if they wanted to. \n\nThen why subjugate humans like they have with you? Lucy asked. Why not share their knowledge with us to live in peace? \n\nBrad snorted in derision. They tried that with the natives of north, central, and south America and were successful for a time... until the European Invasion. Then they realized that they needed to spread out across more of the world and start giving their caretakers inoculations for more than just the diseases that were native on this half of the globe. They taught the Native Americans all they needed to survive and to live in peace with the world, eager to avoid the mistakes made on their homeworld. \n\nLucy eyed him. Why do you help them? Are you brainwashed or something? \n\nIn a way, he conceded with a shrug. Three words; Mind Blowing Orgasms. \n\nYou're serious... \n\nDon't knock it until you've tried it. \n\nLucy eyed the creature cautiously. Outside of the occasional comment, it had been silent the entire time to allow Brad to explain things to her. She had to admit to herself that she was curious and intrigued by the process. Lord knows that she'd watched tentacle porn before and wondered what it would be like. But now fantasy was reality. She then realized that at any time this creature could've literally ripped her limb from limb or even impregnate her against her will instead of just holding her here while it scanned her brain. In fact, outside of keeping her suspended here by her wrists and ankles, it had yet to touch her. \n\nSo you could, like, do the thing right now? She tentatively asked, wondering how it'd feel. \n\nMind blowing orgasms, the fountain of youth, and being a sexual god or goddess among mortals comes with a price, Brad conceded. Lucy then realized that the reason why he'd been able to get her off so hard and fast earlier was because of the creature and the powers it bestowed upon him. You'd have to birth one of the creatures. Now here's the thing; we can't risk exposure. So at any time if you decide to back out we will let you go. But if you do so, we're going to wipe your mind so that you have no memory of us. You'll wake up back at the camp with a spot of amnesia. We can go for a 'trial run' and if you're still into it later, well, we can always use another caretaker. \n\nWhat about Jen? \n\nWhat about her? \n\nIsn't she a caretaker as well? \n\nBrad's head bobbed back and forth as he considered the question. She's more of an occasional helper rather than a dedicated caretaker. We allow her to run her camp here and she sometimes comes up to help spread the Lurkers around. \n\nLucy pondered it for a moment. Okay... I'll do it just once for you... just to see what it's like. She looked at him. Are you going to be doing this as well? \n\nYes, Brad said with a nod. It's more efficient when they have a male/female pairing. They can store male sperm for a long time if they come across a single female host, but they prefer to have a male and a female at the same time so that they don't have to dip into the reserves. As he was explaining, he was stretching out his arms and legs so that the tentacles could wrap around them. \n\nWhy are you doing that? Aren't you a willing participant? Lucy asked, watching as then tentacles inserted themselves up his anus and wrapped over his cock and balls. \n\nBecause after I'm done I'm going to be out of it until nightfall at the very least. The Lurkers do this to keep us safe, warm, and secure. They take care of our bodily functions while were out too. His body then jerked and tensed before going limp. His hips started gyrating and Lucy watched as the tentacles stimulated him both inside and out. Two attached to the nipples on his chest and started sucking. \"GAH!\" Brad then cried out as his body thrashed about in the water. His abdomen, thighs, and hips were quaking so hard that Lucy wondered for a moment if he was a professional porn star. She saw blobs travel down the length of the tentacle from his cock, extracting the sperm as he ejaculated. From the number of blobs that she saw, it appeared that the creature was making him cum by the bucket loads. Then his head rolled back and he went limp, apparently totally spent. The tentacles then wrapped around him like a cocoon before pulling his body in close to the Lurker. \n\nThen it was Lucy's turn as tentacles came at her pussy, ass, and breasts. She tensed up, and her heart fluttered in apprehension as they burrowed into her and covered up her womanly curves. The ones that latched onto her already hard nipples then continued to mold around her breasts. The one inside of her pussy molded itself to every contour of her innermost folds, even sticking up into her cervix. It was a weird, but pleasant, sensation for her. Already she was panting and gasping with pleasure as the tentacles worked their magic. Then she saw blobs coming up the tentacle that was entrenched within her pussy. The first blob seemed to pause right at her opening before squeezing in. Lucy's eyes rolled back into her head as the wave of pleasure swept over her and then she screamed in ecstasy as she felt the thing cum up inside of her. It was with such a force that she literally felt the stuff gush up inside of her womb, filling her up to a point that she never felt possible. \n\nBut it didn't stop there as blob after blob blew inside of her, expanding her belly. At the same time the tentacles attached to her breasts were sucking and stimulating her nipples far better than any sex toy ever could. Holy fuck... that feels good... \n\n[Pride] The best part has not been experienced yet... \n\nThe last blob to travel up the vine was larger than the other ones. This blew up into her pussy and womb and she swore that she felt something latch up inside of her. The sensation made her orgasm harder than she'd ever thought possible. She screamed her pleasure to the heavens and beyond. When she finally came down from the best climax in her life she felt sated and sleepy. Mind blowing orgasms indeed... \n\n*** \n\nCHAPTER 7: Delivery and Capture \n\nJen exited her car, waddled up to the water, and shucked her maternity clothes off. It was the second and last time she'd be doing this tonight. It was already pitch black outside and the only light that could be seen was the stars twinkling overhead with the moon just now starting to peek over the mountains. Properly nude once again, she stepped into the frigid water and shivered. The creature inside of her warmed her body up to the point that she'd be able to stand the cold. She waded further into the lake until she could comfortably sit down with just her head above the surface. \n\nThe contraction came immediately once she settled. Gritting her teeth, she bore down, trying to expel the tiny creature out of her. She felt its tentacles slide out from her pussy to wrap around her thighs to pull itself out. It's a good thing that this feels good once it slides out, otherwise I'd be grossed out by this, she thought as she bore down again with another painful contraction. The contractions hurt but it was the release that was the payoff. It was the reason why humans like her continued to do this for the creatures. \n\nThe creature slid out of her body and Jen threw her head back, mouth open in a silent scream as her body shuddered from the sudden orgasm that came with the birthing of a new Lurker. It wasn't as good as when she got knocked up by just one, but it was a good orgasm nonetheless. \n\nWhen she came to, the young was already attached to her chest, suckling off of one breasts to get it's nectar. She let out a husky breath of pleasure as the fluid was taken from them and her chest shrank back down to their normal size. Once it was done feeding, the small creature wrapped a dozen of its tentacles into a tight mass the size of a large dildo, shoving it back up into Jen's pussy. \n\nJen cried out and gasped in ecstasy as this one then spun the tentacles inside of her as if it were a drill. She was screaming from the second orgasm within seconds. \n\n* \n\nOff in the bushes, the Hunters watched Jen birth the lurker before getting out of the water. \"What is it with these breeders?\" their leader, Edward, asked as he watched with a mixture of disgust and desire through his low light binoculars. He couldn't see anything but the back of the redheaded woman as she sat in the water, thrashing around in ecstasy. The woman was pretty enough but the fact that she was birthing another Spawn of Satan was enough to turn him off. Maybe I can fuck her back to her senses... he mused to himself. He'd heard of that kind of reeducation being done before with breeders. \n\n\"Got me, boss,\" one of his men said with a shrug off to his side. They were whispering to keep from being discovered. \"You want we should go get them now?' \n\n\"No, we're after bigger game here,\" Edward said, shaking his head slightly. The woman was crying out in the throes of another orgasm now. \"Besides, once that Spawn lets go of her, we'll never find it in these waters. It can hide underneath of a rock for months before it comes out or gets big enough to make a cave of its own. I want to know where this breeder came from so we'll play it like we did at the first lake; tag the lake for us to come back later and we'll continue following the breeder until she gets home. She'll take us right to papa.\" \n\nThey watched in silence as Jen finished feeding the thing while getting off. Then she stood, donned her clothes, and returned to her car. They got a good view of her plump, curvy body as she dressed, making the squad groan in discomfort from the erections in their pants they were now sporting. \"All in good time, fellas,\" Edward said with sympathy. \"Soon we're going have more breeders for our own creature to fuck until the end of days.\" \n\n\"Still can't believe all those got away from the compound,\" one of them mumbled. \"I had a thing for that blonde co-ed.\" \n\n\"You and me both, brother,\" another quipped with him. \n\n\"Can it and focus. Back in the cars.\" Edward ordered. \n\n* \n\nJen immediately went up to Brad's cabin, getting to the pool right as he was coming out. \"Have you been in there this entire time?\" she asked. \n\n\"Yeah...\" he grunted as he slowly stood up. \"How'd it go?\" \n\n\"I was followed. Two teams at least,\" Jen reported. \"And two more hanging out near the entrances. They weren't exactly being subtle about it. \n\nBrad swore under his breath. \"Goddamnit... and the Sirens aren't even here yet.\" The Hunters were moving faster than he anticipated which meant that they were getting ready to attack. Plans were developing faster than he'd made allowances for. He eyed her. \"Have you made a decision as to whose side you're on?\" \n\nShe hesitated as she thought about it. \"I guess that I always was one of you guys. So, whatever you have in mind; I'm in.\" \n\n\"Alright...\" Brad nodded. He looked back at the pool. \"Lucy's in as well. We convinced her to join our side and she'll be out soon.\" His gaze settled onto Jen and he blew out a long breath. \"Hypothetical Question, real quick: if you were to be trapped in something like Skulker for an extended period of time, would you mind?\" \n\nJen shrugged. \"I guess not. I could think of worse fates.\" \n\n\"The Hunters have something called a Prison Creature. It's made from the bodies of Lurkers that they've killed. Part of all this was to lure Hunter teams out of hiding to wipe them out and deter others from joining. The other part is to find this thing so that we can rescue the other girls that the Hunters have prisoner inside of it and then destroy it.\" \n\n\"Let me guess... you want me to go in as bait?\" \n\n\"Something like that,\" Brad conceded. \"I don't want to go into details since they might have the ability to extract the information from your mind. However, I do want Skulker to put something like a mind-block and a telepathy enhancer on you so that you can retain control of your mind and communicate with us on the outside. Kind of like tossing a radio inside of a cartoon cake so the inmates can take it out and talk to us. Mind you, this is not my first plan but right now it's all I got to work with. I'd expected reinforcements by now.\" \n\nJen was nodding as he went over the plan for her to get caught and taken to the Hunter stronghold and what she could possibly expect. \"So are we down to Plan F now?\" she snorted with amusement. \n\n\"Plan F?\" Brad scoffed. \"More like we're down to Plan O...\" he turned to the pool again. \"Skulker! Implant both Lucy and Jen and then get Lucy out there! We gotta move!\" \n\n[Determined] As you like to say; way ahead of you... Skulker replied as Lucy's body was coming out of the tubes. [Informative] We did that when we gave her the experience... \n\nAt the same time two tentacles shot up out of the water. One kissed Jen on the back of the neck, burning a mark into her skin there while the other shot straight up her pussy without much fanfare and blew something up inside of her uterus so hard and fast that it took her off guard. \"What the hell was that?\" Jen yelled at him, wincing as she doubled over in discomfort. \n\n\"Again, not telling for when you're captured,\" Brad said as he fished a delirious Lucy out of the water. \"Take her back down to the camp with you,\" he said, pressing Lucy into Jen's arms. \n\n\"What...\" Lucy asked, loopy. \"What? No! I'm staying here and helping.\" \n\n\"Trust me honey; you'll be helping a lot whether you know it or not. When your boyfriend shows up, call me. The number is in the camp directory under emergency contacts,\" Brad said hastily as he showed both women to the door. \"I have preparations to make.\" \n\n* \n\nBy the time Jen and Lucy got down to the camp, the Hunters were already there. Their floodlights and vehicle headlights turned night into day within the center amphitheater. Men armed with assault rifles grabbed them both and hauled them over to the line of men and women that were being put down onto their knees, tied with their hands behind their backs, and hoods placed over their heads. Lucy saw Will rushing over to her, pulling her away and hugging her tightly. \"Thank God you're alright! I've been worried about you!\" he gushed. \n\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Lucy asked, pushing away from him. \"Who are all these people?\" \n\n\"My friends,\" Will beamed with pride. \"I called my friend Edward while you were gone and we were just about to come up and rescue you.\" He gestured. \"We are known as The Hunters.\" \n\n\"Holy fuck...\" Lucy gasped. \"He was telling the truth about you.\" Off to the side, she saw Jen being put onto her knees and tied up like the rest of the people of the camp. \n\n\"What...\" Will asked cautiously. He then grabbed Lucy by the back of her head, forcing her down to her knees. He roughly grabbed her hair and yanked her forward so that he could see the back of her neck where the hairline was. \"Oh my God,\" he breathed when he saw the tiny little mark just underneath the roots of her hair. \"You fucking pimped yourself out to that...that thing?\" he shrieked, shoving her down to the ground hard. \"How the fuck could you?\" \n\n\"It's not what you think, Will,\" Lucy said defiantly, getting back to her feet. \"The Lurkers are harmless. They're fighting for their own survival and they take whatever help they can get!\" \n\n\"They fucking brainwashed you, Lucy, just before they...\" Will shuddered at the thought of it, \"before they used you to breed.\" He suppressed a gag. \"That's just fucking sick and gross.\" \n\n\"Oh please,\" Lucy rolled her eyes, \"I've seen you jerk off to tentacle porn before, dumbass. You thought it was hot then. Now, if you would just think for a moment,\" she reached out for him to try to get him to see reason. \n\n\"NO!\" Will backhanded her, sending her sprawling to the ground. Lucy felt the coppery taste of her blood well up in the corner of her mouth as she heard Will's heavy footsteps behind her. \"The Hunters are right; those things are stealing our women. I just didn't think that you'd be so dumb and na\u00efve enough to be duped by one of their so-called 'caretakers' long enough to be brainwashed.\" \n\nWill grabbed her by the hair and wrenched her head back so that he could look down into her big green eyes that now welled up with tears. The sight was damn sexy as hell to him. \"When this is all over, I'll save you Lucy. Although, I must admit, seeing you like this, I think that I'll just save you now.\" He jerked her head towards him and gave her a brutal, crushing kiss hard on the lips to show her just who was in charge. \n\nLucy managed to pull back enough to claw him across the face. Will cried out in pain and backhanded her again. \"You little whore! I'll make you fucking pay for that and then I'll make you beg for my cock!\" he yelled at her, reaching down to grip his hard cock in his hand to start stroking it. \n\n\"Will! Enough!\" Edward's voice called out through the bustle of activity around them. Will's eyes narrowed as the head Hunter came walking up to them. \"There will be time enough later to fuck your little girl there into submission.\" Edward took the coil of rope off of his shoulder and tossed it to him. \"For now, tie her up in your cabin to keep her separate from the other breeders. She'll be fine locked in there until we're done. Then get into your camos. We're going hunting for Lurkers.\" "
