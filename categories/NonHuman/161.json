        "Duluth Police Captain Mark McCluskey\u2019s POV<br >Duluth, Minnesota\n\nWith the storm rolling in, the Chief had canceled all vacation and put the Duluth Police on mandatory overtime. I\u2019d been working since noon, and it was now one in the morning. I tossed my jacket onto the hook on the door, and removed my gun belt and put it in my desk drawer.\n\nWe were no strangers to bad storms up here, but this particular storm was nasty. The winds now sustained over forty miles an hour, heavy snow, and dropping temperatures were making travel difficult. I\u2019d just turned over to my night shift counterpart before returning to my office. I wasn\u2019t planning to risk the drive back to my lonely apartment on the West Side of town, I was going to stay warm and sleep on the cot I kept for times like this.\n\nI pulled a Subway sandwich and cookies out of the fridge behind my desk, along with a tall Diet Coke, and sat in my desk chair. Not everyone listened to the warnings to home, and the plows had been pulled off the roads at five in the afternoon. The snow now coated the steep roads leading up to the bluff above Lake Superior. Once you started sliding, there was no stopping; the storm was turning cars into balls and streets into Pachinko machines, bouncing off parked cars and curbs until you got to the bottom. We had responded to five dozen accidents since three in the afternoon, and nightshift was dealing with four \u2018accident with injury\u2019 calls when I handed over the duty.\n\nI streamed the late local news on my computer, listening to the storm coverage as I ate my Spicy Italian sandwich. I was halfway through when the phone rang; it was the Desk Sergeant. \u201cMcCluskey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m off. Kelly has the nightshift.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, Captain, but he\u2019s busy, and this sounded important. Can you talk to her?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes; I was dumb enough to answer the phone, and now I was stuck. \u201cSure.\u201d There were a few clicks. \u201cCaptain Mark McCluskey, Duluth Police,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHi Captain, this is Lucy Johnson, assistant manager of the Dew Drop Inn Motel up on 61? I think I have some, I mean they say if you see something, say something, you know? I\u2019m not a racist or anything, but this isn\u2019t right. The other guy brushed me off, but I had to tell someone, right?\u201d\n\nGreat. I get the weirdos. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you relax and tell me what you know, Lucy. Facts only, I don\u2019t want to know what you think about them yet. Once we have the facts down, we can talk through your suspicions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Where to start... OK, this morning just after eleven, a man came in to rent a room for two nights. He was in his thirties, Hispanic, and heavily tattooed. When he parked, the cameras showed there were another five guys out in the SUV he drove. I have to scan in his driver\u2019s license and credit card, plus get his Colorado license plate number.\u201d She gave me the information, and I wrote it down. \u201cHe was nervous; he wanted to pay in cash, but I told him we needed to hold a credit card on file. If he wanted, he could pay in cash when he checked out, and I\u2019d refund the amount. He didn\u2019t like it, but he took the room. As he turned around, I\u2019m pretty sure I saw a pistol in his waistband, but I can\u2019t know for sure, you know? He and the guys parked in front of their room and haven\u2019t come out since. They had pizzas delivered, I mean a LOT of pizzas, about a dozen for six guys?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not seeing anything criminal, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more. Four more groups like this showed up before two in the afternoon. One group from Houston, one from San Francisco, one from Las Vegas and one from Laredo. Each group in one car, four to six people, and rough looking. Tattoos, scars, and some of them looked ill-prepared for the weather. We\u2019ve got a winter storm coming, and one guy shows up in a short-sleeve shirt and a leather vest. It looked weird, and when he turned around, I figured out why. It\u2019s a cut, a motorcycle gang cut, turned inside out. I could see the stitching for the patches, and the label. He had this big tattoo on his left arm, a big spotted cat crawling down a branch, and words in Spanish on his right. I\u2019ve been watching on camera as guys will run out of one room and go into another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call earlier?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any proof, you know? I can\u2019t just call the cops any time I see someone who makes me nervous. I\u2019ve been watching the cameras, though. When one of the guys went to another room about twenty minutes ago, I saw a man holding a rifle as he opened the door. I don\u2019t feel safe, so I called.\u201d\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be. \u201cDo you have information on those other men?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I have it all right here.\u201d\n\nI gave her my email address and got her direct phone number back. \u201cSend me copies of the driver\u2019s licenses and the license plate numbers, and I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d I hung up and opened my computer, logging in to the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center database. I put the first man\u2019s name in, and alarm bells started to go off in my mind. Lucy was right; he was a member of the Denver Sons of Tezcatlipoca, and the FBI had an active warrant for his arrest.\n\nI saw the email notification, clicked on it, and printed it out. Checking the other names, each showed up as affiliated with the Sons or had active warrants out. I printed those out; all listed the contact number for the Sons of Tezcatlipoca Task Force the FBI was running. I leaned back, wondering why the hell a Mexican biker gang would be showing up in Duluth, in force, in the middle of winter.\n\nI logged out and called Lucy back. \u201cLucy, I need you to listen carefully to me. You were right; those men are armed and dangerous. Do not go near them, and do not contact them. How many other people are in the hotel right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re full from the storm, have been since four,\u201d she said.\n\nShit. Armed and violent gang members, hiding out after they avoided the coordinated FBI raids on their Clubhouses, now holed up for the storm in my back yard. This wasn\u2019t good. \u201cI want you to copy and send anything you can find on them to my email. Surveillance recordings, photos, anything you can get me without endangering yourself. Under no circumstances are you to seek them out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if they call or show up at the desk?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemain calm and act like a manager. I\u2019ll call you when I know more.\u201d I hung up, then called down to the FBI field office in Minneapolis. That went as I expected; they didn\u2019t have any agents in Duluth, but I should call the Task Force. Thanking the duty officer, I made the call to the number listed on the warrant.\n\n\u201cFBI, Special Agent Kinnick,\u201d a woman answered.\n\n\u201cThis is Captain Mark McCluskey of the Duluth Police Department. I\u2019ve got a bunch of your fugitive Sons holed up in a hotel up here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, WHAT? Hang on.\u201d I heard her yell for the office to be quiet and then the background noise changed. \u201cYou\u2019re on speakerphone, Captain McCluskey. Deputy Commander Virgil Solozzo is the senior member present.\u201d\n\n\u201cShort version is I received a call from a manager of a hotel at the north end of town off Highway 61, the Dew Drop Inn. She reported five separate groups of Hispanic males arrived during the day; the men who rented rooms looked dangerous, had extensive tattoos and one appeared armed, while another was wearing his cut inside out. Eight rooms rented, twenty-four men. She saw a man with a rifle on camera in one of the rooms, and she called me.\u201d\n\nI could hear a flurry of activity in the background. \u201cDuluth, Minnesota? Holy shit, this is bad. Have you identified any of the men?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me an email, and I\u2019ll forward what I have.\u201d I typed it in and hit send. \u201cI ran the names through NCIC, all showed affiliation with the Sons, and three have active warrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get Minneapolis FBI up there, Hostage Rescue Team, right now,\u201d someone said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not happening, folks. We\u2019re in the middle of a bad winter storm; airports are shut down, roads are emergency only, and it won\u2019t let up until tomorrow afternoon. You can\u2019t get here by land or air, don\u2019t even try.\u201d There were groans and more talking in the background. \u201cThat isn\u2019t all. The weather left the hotels packed. I\u2019ve got no way to get the civilians out, and nowhere else to put them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, this is bad. I\u2019ll alert Hostage Rescue and have them on standby for when the airports open again. How are your local assets?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got sixteen officers on patrol tonight, and an eight-man SWAT unit with an armored vehicle if I can get dayshift back in here,\u201d I said. \u201cCounty might get me another six to eight men, including two snipers. I can\u2019t pull everyone off patrol, either. We\u2019re dealing with a lot of accidents and emergency calls. We barely have numbers even if I get the whole department in on this.\u201d\n\nThere was silence for a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re right; it\u2019s a bad situation to try and effect an arrest. If you can keep track of the men until our teams arrive, that would be a big help.\u201d\n\nI thought about it; I could do that. \u201cI\u2019ll start moving men into position around the motel and planning for a contingency raid. What I want to know is what the hell these guys are doing way up here? Are they trying to get out of the country?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think they are going after Chase Nygaard and Rori King, two members of the Steel Brotherhood who they blame for some of the deaths in the Orlando attacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d heard of it but hadn\u2019t been following the story; all the stuff going on in Florida and California was far away from my problems. \u201cI had no idea the Steel Brotherhood was up here. We\u2019ve seen them touring through in the summer, but they didn\u2019t cause trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on; I\u2019ll send you some information. Neither has a police record, but we\u2019re running into lots of roadblocks on their backgrounds, and they have a lot of money we can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nI looked down at my computer, an email notification popped up, and I opened it. Two pictures were attached; they were from a public event because I could see people sitting in the background and American flags. As I looked at her, I saw a young woman I\u2019d seen before. Her hair was different, she had matured, but those eyes and her face I could never forget. \u201cOh geez,\u201d I said as I pinched my nose. \u201cHer name isn\u2019t Rori King.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe suspected that, but we can\u2019t find any records from more than three years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t. Rori\u2019s real name is Treasure Olson, daughter of the late Captain Mark Olson of the Minnesota State Patrol. His wife was Dawn Olson, a nurse who worked here in Duluth. Treasure\u2019s father died three years ago in the line of duty near Rochester. Shortly after that, she and her best friend were assaulted and nearly raped in the woods by her house. The men who did it went after her in the hospital; at least one of the men involved is still at large. Treasure and Dawn disappeared after that. I heard a rumor that she was given a victim protection identity change and left the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder we can\u2019t find anything older,\u201d someone said.\n\n\u201cHer father was stationed out of this town for years before he moved to Rochester. He was my friend, and I used to go to their house and hang out. Is Treasure, I mean Rori, is she involved in something illegal?\u201d\n\nThere was another long pause. \u201cWe have suspicions, but nothing concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to make sure she isn\u2019t hurt,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the Sons are up here to harm her, I can pass the word to the County. The Sheriff can put a cruiser outside her house or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d the Deputy Commander finally said. \u201cForward everything you have to us, and we\u2019ll do what we can. Do you have surveillance video?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting it soon,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll pass it along.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I need to know who all is up there, Captain.\u201d He gave me a website and a passcode. \u201cThis is a secure videoconferencing system. It\u2019s now 25 minutes after midnight Pacific time; we\u2019ll convene again in 95 minutes, at 0300 Pacific. There will be a lot more people involved than just us, Captain. You should invite your Command as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll call you back if anything changes.\u201d I hung up and dialed the Sheriff\u2019s Dispatch; I explained the situation and didn\u2019t like the answer. The roads were impassable; visibility was not much better than your hood ornament, and you couldn\u2019t even see where the pavement was with all the blowing and drifting.\n\n\u201cLook, Captain, if they are in Duluth, they won\u2019t be coming up here until the plows clear the roads tomorrow. I\u2019ll get a car out there when I can, but don\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Sergeant.\u201d I checked my email; Lucy had sent me a half-dozen emails with stills and video picked from their security system. I forwarded them all to the Task Force, then called the number. \u201cI just emailed the surveillance video to you. I talked to the Sheriff\u2019s Office but didn\u2019t have any luck getting a squad to sit on their house. They are reporting near-zero visibility and impassable roads. That also means I won\u2019t get assistance tonight from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of warning Mrs. King,\u201d the Deputy Director said. \u201cTalk to you at three.\u201d\n\nDeputy Commander Virgil Solozzo\u2019s POV<br >LA Task Force Headquarters\n\nI hung up the phone as the others looked at me. \u201cNobody contacts Rori King or Chase Nygaard,\u201d I said.\n\nA few of the agents looked at each other. \u201cWhy? They are in danger, and they\u2019re unprotected!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know they are subjects of an investigation, and until we have officers at the door serving search warrants, they don\u2019t hear a thing. If they get wind the Sons are up there, they will bolt, and we might lose them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Director Grimes? We know he\u2019s up there, we could warn him,\u201d our CIA rep said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not supposed to know we\u2019ve got him under surveillance.\u201d I glared at them for questioning me. \u201cYou heard what the Captain said about the weather. Nothing is moving up there until the middle of the day tomorrow. Look at the damn map! The hotel is at the edge of Duluth, Rori\u2019s house is almost thirty miles away. They aren\u2019t in danger, and they won\u2019t be. We need to focus on getting assets in place so we can take down the Sons at this hotel. Taylor, see if Defense can get a helicopter that can fly in that weather. Rodgers, get an update on Hostage Rescue. The rest of you, get back to your background searches on Rori King aka Treasure Olson. Find out where the money is coming from.\u201d I stood up to go back to my office as they scrambled to get results. Irene was already pissed about the Dead Presidents being strung up on the fence; this news would send her over the edge.\n\nCh. 67\n\nColletta Nygaard\u2019s POV<br >Arrowhead Alpha House\n\nI woke up as he moved out from under me, and I rolled into the warm depression he had left on the bed. I smiled as I felt the pleasant soreness of my sex; last night had been amazing, more than I had hoped. \u201cFrank?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust going to the bathroom,\u201d he said. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmmm.\u201d I pulled his pillow closer, letting the scent of the man in my bed surround me. My wolf was neutral on this whole thing; she had been through so much, first with losing her mate, then with losing whatever connection she had been forming with Charles. She was sulking, spending most of her time curled up in the back of my mind. I needed to let her out to run today. She needed to be with the others, to feel the exhilaration of a Hunt.\n\nI\u2019d see if anyone wanted to go when the storm abated a little. I could hear the wind howling through the trees and the windows vibrating with the gusts. My bladder made itself known, and I got out of bed and walked towards the bathroom. Frank opened the door just before I got there, his body silhouetted by the night light on the wall. My human part loved his look; he was still in good shape for his age, with a body that wasn\u2019t bulky but fit. I put my arms around his waist, as his hands moved from my shoulders to my hips with a light touch that made me shiver. \u201cGood morning,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s six in the morning, and it\u2019s dark as midnight,\u201d he said as he pulled my hips closer.\n\nI kissed him and moved past, my bladder making its demands. \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of time to sleep later, so get back to bed. I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBaby please, I am NOT from Havana!\u201d\n\nI snorted as I caught the reference. \u201cJust give me a minute to freshen up.\u201d I closed the door to the bathroom, relieving myself and washing up before brushing my teeth.\n\n\u201cColletta, are those men outside with guns yours?\u201d\n\nI ran out to the bedroom with the toothbrush still in my mouth, joining him at the window. I could see three people with rifles moving up from the shoreline. \u201cHOSTILES BY THE ALPHA HOUSE, WE\u2019RE UNDER ATTACK,\u201d I blasted over the link. Unfortunately, since I wasn\u2019t Pack here, I could only reach my son and daughter and their mates. \u201cWe\u2019re under attack,\u201d I said as I ran to the closet.\n\nI heard an explosion downstairs, and the sound of men coming in. Gunfire erupted as I opened the safe. \u201cMom, they\u2019re already inside, we can\u2019t make the safe room. We\u2019re protecting the babies.\u201d I\u2019d been briefed on their defensive strategy, part of which assumed they would have some warning of the attack so they could reach their tunnels and safe rooms. That didn\u2019t happen in the storm. \u201cHold them off until the warriors arrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cover the hall.\u201d I grabbed an AR-15 and tossed it on the bed for Frank. He was on the phone, calling the 911 line. I grabbed another, making sure the magazine was seated and a round chambered. \u201cCan you use that?\u201d\n\nHe nodded as he picked it up with his free hand. \u201cStay here and talk to them, I\u2019ll cover the hallway.\u201d\n\nI was already heading for the door. \u201cWe have to protect the babies.\u201d Cracking the door open, I could hear the battle downstairs. There were loud growls, gunshots, and screams of pain. \u201cLeave the phone. I\u2019ll take the back stairwell and you take the main. We can\u2019t let them get up to this level.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay safe,\u201d he said as he kissed me before moving down the hall towards the stairway thirty feet away. The lights were off, and I heard the whines of a wolf silenced by a gunshot before it was quiet again. \u201cChase, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe three babies are with Rori and their nanny, we\u2019ve moved them to the cast iron tub to protect them from stray rounds. Keith, Coral, Warrior Lance and I are guarding the room. Stay put and wait for the warriors to arrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtect the children, I can hear them moving up the stairs.\u201d I dropped to the floor, crawling towards the stairway with the rifle in my hand. The carpeted stairwell and hallway would muffle sounds, there was a landing halfway down, and a wooden railing guarded the overhang on the right. I moved next to the wingback chair that was facing back down the hallway, a place for a guard to sit when needed. Kneeling up, I put my rifle between the balusters and hugged the wall as I saw the shadows moving.\n\nA man dressed in a snowmobile suit with a pistol in hand was coming up, taking the stairs two at a time. I let him get to the landing before I opened up, the AR-15 putting two rounds rapid-fire into his chest. He turned and fired wildly, three shots hitting the walls as he fell back. I ignored him and moved to the next man, getting off one shot before he ducked back down. The man on the landing tried to raise his pistol again, so I shot him once in the head. I heard multiple shots from behind me and glanced back; Frank was leaning over the balustrade, his rifle sounded like popcorn as he rapid-fired. I backed away from my firing position to the doorway back to my left, remembering my training to shoot and move.\n\nIt was a good thing I moved because the man downstairs opened up with what sounded like an AK-47. High powered rifle rounds penetrated the ceiling and floor easily, spraying wood and carpet and plaster as my old hiding place got shredded. \u201cOne down, at least one more at the back stairs,\u201d I sent.",
        "\u201cHelp is thirty seconds out, get back in your room, Mom!\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late.\u201d I opened the door to the spare bedroom, using the doorway as cover. I heard something hit the wall, then thud against the floor; it was round and had a lever. \u201cGRENADE,\u201d I yelled as I dove into the room. The explosion came before I hit the ground; I rolled to a stop against the bed, cursing as I got up again. I grabbed my rifle and ran back to the doorway, kneeling with my rifle pointed towards the stairs. The drywall dust and smoke hid the man as he ran up, but I could still hear him. I started to rapid-fire towards the top of the stairs, then a second later, I got a clear enough view to take a snap-shot at his head. The .223 caliber bullet hit him in the left eye. It blew the back of his head out, and dropped him like he was hot. His body rolled back down the stairs.\n\nI heard two more explosions at the other end of the hall, the house shaking as I ducked back into the room. I looked out and saw Frank\u2019s body lying face-down on the carpet. My wolf was furious and she wasn\u2019t going to be held back any longer. I shifted into my animal form and raced down the dust-filled hallway towards the threat. They had hurt what was mine, and I would kill them for it.\n\nA man was coming up the stairs with his rifle up, but at full speed, I was on him before he could get a shot off. My jaws went for his neck, but he moved enough that I caught his shoulder instead. I bit down as my body crashed into him, knocking him over as he screamed in pain.\n\nI ignored the pain of hitting the wall on the landing; I tore my teeth free and lunged forward again. This time I got to his vulnerable neck and my wolf ripped his throat out in a heartbeat. I heard a shot and felt the pain in my right foreleg. I let out a whine and turned towards the sound, then I heard more shots coming from downstairs. I turned just in time to see another attacker fall to the ground.\n\n\u201cCEASE FIRE, CEASE FIRE,\u201d I heard from downstairs.\n\nI heard doors opening from the bedrooms, and Brent and Laura appeared at the top of the stairs with rifles in their arms. They must have been the warriors protecting Cheryl tonight.\n\n\u201cSpread out, and verify there aren\u2019t any others,\u201d Chase yelled out.\n\nI turned and limped back up the stairs; I had to see if Frank was all right. I held my injured leg off the carpet as I went to where Chase was kneeling as he gently examined Frank. Shifting, I ignored my bloody arm as I leaned down, surprised to see his eyes open. \u201cYou\u2019re a wolf,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA beautiful wolf and they hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk, Frank. We\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down, Mom. Laura, hold pressure on that bullet wound for me until I get to her,\u201d Chase said.\n\nCoral was coming out of the bedroom with Chase\u2019s black medical bag; he took a flashlight out and checked his pupils, then worked down his body. \u201cHow is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cPossible concussion from hitting the door, multiple shrapnel injuries from the grenades. We need to move him to the clinic,\u201d Chase said as he turned to me. \u201cLet\u2019s see that.\u201d\n\nI sat against the wall as he took my arm, looking at the hole through my forearm about three inches below the elbow. \u201cThrough and through, the bone is broken though. You get to go to the clinic too.\u201d He pulled a combat dressing out of his bag, opening it and wrapping my arm before tying it tightly. \u201cHe saw you shift,\u201d he broadcast over our link.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, when I saw him go down I lost it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him, he\u2019s still a DEA Director. We can\u2019t handle the blowback that would result.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could make it look like he was killed in the attack,\u201d Coral sent.\n\nMy growl was vicious. \u201cNO. Frank is MINE, and I will handle it.\u201d I shook Coral off as she tried to help me up. \u201cFrank was calling 911 before we came out here. The police know about the attack,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the phone,\u201d Keith said.\n\nBeta Ron came up, looking at the destruction the grenades had wrought. \u201cTrainee Warrior Vicki and Omega Patricia were killed in the initial attack. We neutralized five hostiles; from the tattoos, they look to be members of the Sons. All are human.\u201d He looked at Chase, who was wiping off the blood on his hands with a towel. \u201cThere\u2019s another problem. They came from across the lake in a pair of ATV\u2019s. There\u2019s an identification plate on the ATV\u2019s with a name and address; it\u2019s a human, his house is six houses down the lakeshore from the Oxbow cabin.\u201d Rori and Chase had built and gifted a cabin to their Aunt and Uncle back when they built all these homes; it was in between the entrance to their Pack lands and the human developments. \u201cIf they are using it as a base, there could be more.\u201d\n\nWe moved down the hall as two men had arrived with a stretcher to retrieve Frank. He had been listening in. \u201cThere might be hostages,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you think will happen if their men don\u2019t return?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can let the police handle it,\u201d Keith said. \u201cI told them the attack is over and we have multiple dead. They will get here as soon as they can, but they have to get a plow to clear their way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are our neighbors, we can\u2019t wait,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSend men over there and check it out. Use discretion as to whether you go in or wait for help. If possible, let the police handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get them together. Meanwhile, everyone needs to get dressed because we\u2019re going to have company. Pass the word, and I want a count to make sure no one is missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about these guys?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave them, don\u2019t make it worse by messing with a crime scene,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAnd give me my damn phone.\u201d\n\nKeith handed it back to him; Frank had fought bravely to defend his family, and I knew he and his wolf considered him a friend now by the way he moved. Keith looked over at Chase. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of settling the Pack and getting ready for the police. You go patch these two up.\u201d\n\nRori stepped out of the room, the crying baby getting louder as the door opened. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said as she hugged me. \u201cDoc is going to meet you at the clinic, my Mom too.\u201d\n\nThe men lifted Frank in the stretcher and took him down the stairs, carefully avoiding the dead men and the damaged areas from the grenades. Chase looked at me. \u201cCoral, help Mom get dressed and to the clinic before shock sets in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d I let my daughter lead me back to my room, which reeked of sex. I pulled on underwear, track pants, and a pair of hard-soled fur-lined moccasins. Coral helped me put on a short-sleeved flannel shirt. \u201cI need to see the babies first,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThey are fine; I wouldn\u2019t be out here if they weren\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy wolf is on edge; she needs to see for herself.\u201d We stopped in the nursery, which was quiet now. Rori was rocking Mark, while the Hope and Cheryl were back in the crib. The three were always together since they didn\u2019t sleep well otherwise. I moved over, my wolf forward as she sniffed them and made sure they were all right. I leaned down and kissed the two in the crib, then took Mark from Rori and smelled his head before setting him down. \u201cThey are safe,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, we never would let them be harmed.\u201d She looked at me as we walked back out; I could tell she was mad. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to go out there, Mom. We had the room barricaded and were ready for them. Help was seconds away.\u201d\n\nWe picked our way down the stairs as she kept a hold on my good arm. \u201cEveryone in your room is mated and had a future, unlike me. Those babies are more important than an old widowed Luna, Coral. I couldn\u2019t stay out of it.\u201d\n\nShe stopped and turned to me, her wolf forward. \u201cYou are NOT disposable, Mom. We all love you. Your grandchildren need you. You need to to be here to see Rori\u2019s baby being born.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, WHAT?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh shit. He didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I sent a mental call to Chase and Rori. \u201cWas there something you two were supposed to tell me last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Mom. You and Frank left before we could talk to you privately. I\u2019m pregnant again, due around Labor Day. When my wolf refused to shift, I had Doc confirm it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder you kept everyone in the room. Congratulations, I\u2019m happy for you. Do your parents know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we told them before you arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you both.\u201d  I closed the link and looked over at Coral. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a week, baby.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head as we entered the tunnels. \u201cIt\u2019s not fine. You got hurt, Frank got hurt, and now he knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried to tell me to hide in my room too, and you can see how well that worked.\u201d\n\nWe got to the Clinic, where Doc was waiting for me. \u201cLuna Nygaard, lie down on the table, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo general anesthesia, Doc.\u201d I needed to be here for Frank, and for the Pack.\n\n\u201cI need to settle the Pack down, I\u2019ll check on you later,\u201d Coral said from the door.\n\n\u201cGo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d A Pack would be unsettled; the attack was far closer to being a success than it should have been. They would be mourning the losses and questioning their safety. \u201cHow\u2019s Frank doing?\n\n\u201cFrank\u2019s in good hands. I can\u2019t say as much for the person on the other end of that phone whose ass is being chewed out in a thoroughly professional manner. We can\u2019t put him under with a concussion, so everything is being pulled out with locals.\u201d He gave me an injection at a spot near my elbow, and a few minutes later, I couldn\u2019t feel it as he started digging around in my arm. It took thirty minutes before he was closing. \u201cBedrest for a day. Your arm is to remain in a sling for three more. You can shift again in a week.\u201d He helped me to sit up and handed me a bottle of water, then brought a wheelchair over.\n\n\u201cDoc, It\u2019s my arm. I can walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuna, you have been injured and need to rest. If you don\u2019t like the wheelchair, I can restrain you to the bed.\u201d I growled at him; my wolf hated that idea. \u201cYou can\u2019t intimidate me, or my wolf; I\u2019m not your Pack.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, but I need to see Frank.\u201d He helped me sit and wheeled me into the next room. Frank was lying on his stomach, with Chase and Mom working to remove a shard of wood from his thigh. \u201cHow is he doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour human pincushion will be fine,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind company on bedrest.\u201d\n\nI smiled as I reached out and held his hand. \u201cNot at all.\u201d\n\nCh. 68\n\nBeta Ron Carlson\u2019s POV<br >Arrowhead Pack House\n\nI gathered the warriors around me as Coral and Keith directed the rest. Many of us were still naked, having shifted during the attack to come in behind them in wolf form. I had clothes on, only because I was augmenting the security control team at night. I was still pissed about the lack of warning; the blowing snow made the motion detectors useless on the cameras. We couldn\u2019t see much, and they must have snuck between what we could see. I should have posted men around the house, no matter how cold and miserable it was.\n\nHindsight is always 20/20, and we lost two Pack members. We owed it to them to learn from this.\n\nThe warriors were gathered in the living room since the kitchen was a crime scene. We were going over to check out the home the attackers had based from, while the rest of the warriors from both Packs would secure our territory. \u201cFour of us will go in human form. I\u2019ll be the one in contact with the Sheriff. Charlie, Bonnie, you\u2019ll drive one of the ATV\u2019s back. Peggy, you\u2019re with me. You six will go in wolf form. I want you to run ahead and scout out the neighborhood and the home before we arrive. I need to know how many men are in there, and whether Jerry and Marge Lundergaard are inside.\u201d The six stripped and shifted, taking off out the door while we armed up. \u201cPistols and rifles, and dress like we\u2019re going to be out there for hours. Meet me outside in five minutes.\u201d\n\nWe split up, and I took the tunnels back to our home. I dressed in warm clothes, adding a shoulder holster for my .45 caliber Smith and Wesson M&amp;P pistol. I ran to the mudroom, putting on my winter snowmobile suit, boots, and helmet. I grabbed one of those old-fashioned ear flap fur caps and stuffed it in my pocket, then put on the gloves as I walked out the door. I jogged back along the shoreline to where the ATV\u2019s were. Both were still running from when the attackers had left them.\n\nAs soon as Peggy was behind me, we were off. I knew which house it was, and I used the GPS on my phone to point the way as we went across the lake. It didn\u2019t take long to reach the shore again, and we parked the ATV\u2019s on the beach, leaving our helmets there. \u201cWe\u2019re here. How are we doing, boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cJerry and Marge are in the living room, he\u2019s got a bandage on his head but they appear to be all right. We can see one man, early 20\u2019s with a pistol, holding them. Two SUV\u2019s in the driveway, covered with snow, so they\u2019ve been there a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep back far enough to watch, but stay out of sight.\u201d We moved across the frozen yards to the neighbor\u2019s house, which was dark and vacant. I found a spot out of the wind, pulled out my cellphone, and dialed 911.\n\n\u201c911, What is your emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Ron Carlson, following up on the attack earlier.\u201d I gave the 911 operator the update that five attackers and two residents were dead. Then I gave her the Lundergaard\u2019s address. \u201cWe saw they were using our neighbor\u2019s vehicles, so we came over to see if they were all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, we don\u2019t need you to get involved, we have officers on the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss, I\u2019m not a stranger to fights and I happen to like my neighbors. I brought a few of my friends out here with guns. We took a peek through the windows; Jerry and Marge are hostages, there is one man with a pistol with them. There are two SUV\u2019s out front with California plates, they sure as hell don\u2019t belong to Jerry.\u201d I gave her the plate numbers as they were relayed to me by the scouts.\n\n\u201cCharles, take your knife and cut the tires on those SUV\u2019s so they can\u2019t leave. Be careful, we don\u2019t want to set off any motion-sensitive lights.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn it, boss.\u201d\n\nI kept talking to the 911 operator as we waited. \u201cMr. Carlson, the snowplow and the Deputy\u2019s cruiser will be there in about ten minutes.\u201d\n\nThat was good. \u201cTell them not to turn onto Lakeshore Drive. The kidnapper has a view of the front yard, and if he sees a cop, he might kill them. I\u2019ll send someone to meet him at the turnoff from the highway. I have to go.\u201d I hung up and put on my fur hat; it must be below zero already.\n\n\u201cPeggy, take one of the females with you and wait for the Sheriff\u2019s Deputy at the main road. Bring him back here and stay out of sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Beta.\u201d\n\nNow it was a waiting game. \u201cEveryone, we will wait for the Sheriff to arrive, then back him up as he goes in to rescue the Lundergaard\u2019s. We play this straight up, so all wolves stay out of sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if this guy starts doing something more than just watch them,\u201d Bonnie asked.\n\n\u201cCharles and Bonnie, take up sniper positions behind the house. I\u2019ll take the front. If you have to shoot, shoot and we\u2019ll deal with it later. I\u2019m not going to let more innocents die because of these bastards.\u201d\n\nI moved far enough away from the house that I could barely see it, then moved until I had the SUVs blocking the view of me from inside. I took up a position behind the second SUV. I rested my trusty 30-06 Remington 700 bolt-action deer rifle on the bumper and looked into the house. I\u2019d chosen it instead of one of those black rifles for a few good reasons. It was accurate as hell, reliable, and the bigger bullet wouldn\u2019t deflect as much as it went through the windows. I had a good view of the guy with the gun; he was young, maybe twenty. \u201cAnyone else who thinks this guy is a prospect?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as scared as the Lundergaard\u2019s are,\u201d one of my men said.\n\n\u201cScared isn\u2019t good for us. I\u2019d rather have a calm professional than an unpredictable kid.\u201d All it took was one loud noise and he might shoot one of them.\n\nA few minutes later, Peggy sent to me that she heard the plow. \u201cBring him to me behind the Suburbans, and stay out of sight,\u201d I told her. I kept my eyes on the guy inside, not even turning as the Deputy came up behind me. \u201cDeputy Parker,\u201d he said as he knelt down beside me. \u201cSituation the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but this kid doesn\u2019t look stable. Take a look.\u201d He stood and used a pair of compact binoculars to look inside.\n\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I looked at him, he was in his mid-twenties, and I doubt if he had been on the job more than a few years. \u201cWhat were your instructions?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet here, size it up and call it in,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else was pulled to assist Duluth. There\u2019s a few dozen Sons at a hotel there, they are supporting Duluth Police with a raid. Sorry to hear you lost people, I figured with the warning, you guys would be all right.\u201d\n\nI barely bit back the growl. \u201cWhat warning?\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck, you guys didn\u2019t know?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cOur Captain got a tip about one AM about a bunch of Sons of Tezcatlipoca who were meeting at this Duluth hotel. He talked to the FBI Task Force and found out they might be here to go after Chase Nygaard and Rori King. That was hours ago; they\u2019ve been trying to move Deputies down to Duluth since then.\u201d He spent some time looking, then sat down. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call this in.\u201d\n\nI opened the link to our Pack leadership. \u201cAlphas, we\u2019ve got a problem. The cops have known for hours that there are a few dozen Sons in Duluth, and they never warned us. The fuckers are using us as bait.\u201d\n\nChase answered quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ll handle that later. I\u2019ll let Frank know; maybe he can find out who is doing it. Keep your head in the game, Beta.\u201d\n\nThe sun wasn\u2019t going to rise for another forty minutes. I looked into the scope; he was making calls with the Lundegaards\u2019 phone. No one answered, and he tossed it aside and stood up. Gesturing with his pistol at the couple, he made the two get on their knees, then moved behind him. \u201cFuck, he\u2019s going to kill them,\u201d I said. \u201cHe can\u2019t look in their faces when he does it, that\u2019s why he\u2019s moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he starts to aim, I\u2019m taking the shot. Get ready. If I don\u2019t take him down, you fire right behind me after I break the glass.\u201d He was carrying an AR-15 patrol rifle, which was too small a bullet to trust for a first shot. I didn\u2019t have a chance to hear his reply; I saw the guy extend his arm and raise the pistol towards Jerry\u2019s head, and I squeezed the trigger of my rifle. The shot penetrated the window, hitting him in the chest and knocking him backward. I heard two more shots as I got up and ran to the door, kicking it open with the Deputy and Peggy right behind me.\n\nMarge was screaming in Jerry\u2019s arms as we came in, followed by Charles through the back door. The bad guy was dead, one shot in the chest and another in the face, his pistol on the floor next to him. I checked his neck for a pulse to be sure. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d I announced. \u201cBonnie and Peggy, take them into their bedroom and make sure they are all right,\u201d I said. \u201cAll wolves return home. Good job, everyone.\u201d\n\nI opened the action on my rifle, leaning it in the corner by the front door. I pushed it back closed as best I could with the frame broken and the door bent. I started to take off my winter gear, hanging it on the hooks before taking my winter gear off. Charles did the same at the back door, and we all moved to the kitchen and sat down.\n\nWe were going to be here a while.\n\nFrank Grimes (DEA-Suspended) POV<br >Arrowhead Pack Clinic",
        "The adrenalin had worn off, and I hurt like hell from all the places I\u2019d taken shrapnel.\n\nI saw the grenades flying up and turned to run, but I didn\u2019t get far enough away. The blast knocked me into the door frame, making me a little loopy. The stretcher-bearers had moved me onto the operating room table, and a woman in pink scrubs started taking my vitals. \u201cHow are you feeling, Mr. Grimes,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cLike I should have retired earlier,\u201d I said. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the Doctor tell you,\u201d she said as she injected me with something. \u201cIt\u2019s a sedative, not strong enough to knock you out but it should dull things a little. There\u2019s a lot of little pieces in you, this might take a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to make a phone call,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting operated on, phones aren\u2019t happening in a sterile zone,\u201d she countered.\n\n\u201cPut it in a bag. I\u2019ll use Siri and speakerphone, so I don\u2019t touch it. I wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t important; the Task Force needs to know what\u2019s happened here.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the man talk,\u201d Chase said as he walked in. He\u2019d taken the time to dress in scrubs and a surgical gown, and went to the sink to scrub up. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep his mind off the pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Doctor,\u201d she said. She put the phone in a clean bag, putting it by his head. Pressing the button, she brought up Siri for him.\n\n\u201cCALL IRENE LINDSTROM,\u201d he said. The call was placed, rang five times, and went to voice mail. \u201cIrene, this is Frank Grimes. I\u2019m with Chase Nygaard, and we just repelled an attack by members of the Sons of Tezcatlipoca at his home near Two Harbors. It\u2019s imperative that I talk to you immediately,\u201d he said. He nodded to Possum, and she ended the call. \u201cHit the Siri again, please?\u201d\n\nThis time he called Frank Donovan. The phone rang four times, and a very sleepy Frank answered the phone. \u201cFrank, It\u2019s Frank Grimes. I need your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus, Frank, it\u2019s four-thirty in the fucking morning, you\u2019re not my boss anymore, and you\u2019re on vacation. What possible reason could you have to wake me up?\u201d\n\n\u201cChase and Rori\u2019s home was attacked by the Sons a half-hour ago. We killed five of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSONOFABITCH!\u201d There was noise as the phone dropped. \u201cI\u2019m up. What do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to talk to the Task Force, but they\u2019ve moved. I tried calling Irene Lindstrom directly, and she didn\u2019t answer. I need to talk to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have them call you. Are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. The attackers were tossing grenades, and I\u2019ve got a bunch of metal in my ass. We lost two dogs in the defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cShit. I\u2019m not on the Task Force anymore, but I\u2019ll have them call you ASAP. Take care of yourself, Frank.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou too.\u201d She hung up the phone, and I groaned in pain as Chase started digging around in my back. \u201cHow bad is it, Chase?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be here a while, and you\u2019ll have lots of new scars,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got lucky; you were far enough from it that most of the wounds aren\u2019t deep, and the rest missed vital organs. You\u2019re lucky you were turned away from it and bent over when that grenade blew.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe important stuff is still good, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cChrist, Frank, that\u2019s my MOTHER you\u2019re sleeping with, the one I heard you banging last night like a broken screen door in a tornado. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t neuter you while you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take away her happiness, Chase.\u201d She hadn\u2019t shared much, but I could tell she was happy being happy again.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t. You\u2019ll be in a lot of pain as I remove all the shrapnel, clean out the wounds, and sew them up. I can\u2019t use a general anesthetic, and locals can\u2019t do much, so we\u2019re going to strap you down and see how tough you are.\u201d\n\nPossum leaned down. \u201cI can give you something to bite down on if it gets too bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck. Can\u2019t I just drink half a bottle of whiskey like in the movies?\u201d This night was going to suck.\n\n\u201cNope. I\u2019m going to start injecting the sites with lidocaine, you\u2019ll feel some pokes, but you\u2019ll thank me later.\u201d He had been working on me for about half an hour, and I still hadn\u2019t heard from the Task Force when the door opened and Colletta was wheeled in. I smiled, then grunted as Chase dug around again.\n\n\u201cHow is he doing,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYour human pincushion will be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind company on bedrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said with a smile. She held my hand, and I relaxed into her touch.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about some things,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cLater. Let\u2019s get you sewn up first.\u201d\n\nChase and Possum were in a rhythm, working wound to wound. The pile of junk they\u2019d pulled from my body kept growing; he was on my thighs and working down. Suddenly, Chase stopped working and growled. \u201cThose BASTARDS,\u201d he yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened,\u201d Possum said as I wondered how he could learn anything with no radio on and no phone call.\n\n\u201cRon talked to the Deputy over at the neighbor\u2019s house, where they are holding the Lundergaard\u2019s. A Duluth Police Captain got a tip last night that the Sons had a few dozen men meeting at a hotel down there. When he called the Task Force, he found out that the Sons were up here to go after Rori and me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no one warned you,\u201d I finished.\n\n\u201cYeah. Locals have surrounded the hotel, but they didn\u2019t bother to give us a heads up.\u201d He had to step away from the table and take a few breaths; I could see his hands shaking with rage. \u201cI lost two Pack members because we didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAt that point, the phone rang. \u201cFrank Grimes,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cMr. Grimes, this is Deputy Commander Virgil Solozzo with the FBI Sons of Tezcatlipoca Task Force. I understand you were involved in an incident?\u201d\n\nI just got quiet; my woman and her family could have died, and he was treating it like it was nothing. \u201cCommander Solozzo, were you told a few hours ago that the Sons of Tezcatlipoca were gathering in Duluth tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was told of this, but also that the weather was such that they couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We have Hostage Rescue and other assets ready to move in as soon as they can. We are coordinating with local law enforcement so we can take them into custody without endangering civilians.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right. Like the two trained guard dogs here who died because you didn\u2019t warn Chase Nygaard there was a threat? Or the retired couple kidnapped in their own home across the lake? You fucked up, Solozzo. You know it, and your team knows it. Quit digging around in my business, and stop poking around in Rori\u2019s past too. You are endangering good people, and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\nThere was a laugh on the other end. \u201cYou\u2019re on suspension, Grimes, and you\u2019ll be in jail by the end of the week. We don\u2019t owe you a fucking thing, not after you tipped off people that the raid was coming and good men died. As for Chase Nygaard and his crazy-ass wife, we don\u2019t owe them anything either. I\u2019ve seen her medical records; they make for fascinating reading. What will the Medical Board say when they find out Chase was fucking a mental patient just weeks after he signed her release from the looney bin?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get a warrant for her medical records, Virgil?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need warrants; this Task Force can do whatever it needs to do to take both gangs down. Chase and Rori are dirty, and I\u2019m going to find out how she got her money and take her down. If the Sons kill them first, that\u2019s even better.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Virgil. I\u2019m going to enjoy watching your career end, along with anyone else who went along this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out, Grimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you on the news; they will LOVE this recording.\u201d I gestured to Possum, and she ended the call. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by a long shot,\u201d Chase said. He drank a bottle of water, scrubbed in, and started poking around in my legs again.\n\nCh. 69\n\nHawk\u2019s POV (SoT Patched Member)<br >Arrowhead Lake\n\nThere were only two ATV\u2019s and no snowmobiles, so Loco told us we\u2019d have to walk. \u201cWe\u2019ll lead you there, just follow the engines,\u201d he said.\n\nAsshole.\n\nWe left a Prospect in charge of watching the old couple, and the rest of us armed up and headed out. It was colder than a brass toilet seat in an outhouse; it hurt to breathe. The snowmobile suits and boots we had on were warm enough, but they didn\u2019t cover everything. My eyeballs hurt, my nose started running, and the tears and snot were freezing in my beard before we even got to the damn water. It was so cold you could spit, and it would freeze before it hit the ground. We reached the lake, went maybe a hundred steps out onto the ice, and we couldn\u2019t hear the engines anymore. \u201cFuck, anyone hear them,\u201d I asked. Fucking Loco was so eager to kill people he couldn\u2019t even stay with us.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t hear anything but the wind. Our group was huddled together in the dark, where you couldn\u2019t see five feet in front of you. I had my left hand in my pocket as my right shined the flashlight back and forth, the wind gusting in our faces. It was too dark for sunglasses, and the snow and wind made it impossible to look up. I got lucky; the beam of my flashlight showed a tire track from the ATV\u2019s. I yelled for everyone to follow.\n\nIt was tough going; the lake would have patches of slippery clear ice, then a snowdrift three feet high. We were going at the speed of smell, and the wind soon erased any evidence of ATV\u2019s ahead of us. Fucking Loco had told us not to bring phones on this trip, so I couldn\u2019t call him, and I didn\u2019t even have a compass. I promised I would beat his ass when my flashlight died too.\n\nEveryone gathered close, huddling behind me to let me block the wind. \u201cWhere the fuck are those guys,\u201d one man asked.\n\n\u201cKeep the wind at our two o\u2019clock, and we\u2019ll make it to the Point,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving. Grab on to the guy in front of you and don\u2019t let go. You\u2019ll fucking die out here if you get lost.\u201d\n\nI kept walking the way I had been going; my feet were freezing, I couldn\u2019t feel my face, and I couldn\u2019t see five feet ahead of me. We kept going, a frozen chain gang on a godforsaken Minnesota lake. The Prospect was crying, Reaper was praying out loud to Mary for deliverance, and the others were just quiet.\n\nGunshots rang out, somewhere off to our left. \u201cMotherfucker couldn\u2019t wait for us,\u201d I cursed. \u201cCome on.\u201d We took our rifles off and ran towards the noise. The battle was brief; a few explosions, screams of pain, and a lot of growling and howling, all before we could get close enough to do anything.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got fucking dogs,\u201d Reaper said.\n\n\u201cThey also won,\u201d I said as we huddled together. \u201cHear that? They\u2019re organizing patrols.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we attack now?\u201d The Prospect was so cold, he would probably give himself up just to get in the house.\n\n\u201cLook, we have no vehicles, no surprise, and we\u2019re heavily outnumbered. We need to go back to the cars and get the fuck out of here,\u201d I said. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nThe sound of dogs and people died away quickly in the howling wind, as our group death-marched back in the direction I hoped the house was in. \u201cWe have to stop,\u201d Reaper said. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my feet.\u201d\n\nI looked at my watch, it was seven-thirty. \u201cSunrise will be soon, we have to keep moving.\u201d\n\nBy eight, the sun was up. It didn\u2019t help; instead of a black snowstorm, it was a dark grey snowstorm. We couldn\u2019t see, and we couldn\u2019t keep walking. \u201cSit down, boys. Nuts to butts, back to the wind, hold on to each other and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\n\nThe storm won, I thought an hour later before I fell asleep.\n\nHeather Rhodes (Harleigh Ryder\u2019s) POV<br >Alexandria Safe House\n\nFor almost two days, nothing moved outside the house as the winter storm tore through. As I woke up in Greg\u2019s arms, I didn\u2019t hear the wind howling, and the sun was out.\n\nI moved his arm off my left breast, giggling a bit at how obsessed he was with them even in his sleep. No matter where his hands started, one or both always ended up cupping one of the girls. It was like a magnet, one that I didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019d paid a lot of attention to them in the last few days, and I\u2019d enjoyed every minute. Once we finally went all the way, there was no going back for either of us.\n\nI slowly swung my legs down to the floor and sat up. My gunshot wound still hurt, but it was improving daily. I put on my fuzzy slippers, then stood and grabbed my soft bathrobe on the way to the bathroom. The room was cold, and the window was frosted over. I pulled my robe tight around me after I finished my business and brushed my teeth. I was a Florida girl. I hated the cold, and couldn\u2019t understand how people could live in this crap.\n\nGreg was still sleeping as I came out, and since it was almost eight-thirty, I figured I\u2019d work on breakfast. I moved into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. Looking in the fridge, I found some blueberries and a can of whipped cream. An idea came to mind; I grabbed those plus the bacon, milk, and eggs and put them on the counter, then found the pancake mix in the cupboard. I pulled out a bowl and made up a large batch, knowing just how much Greg could eat in the morning. I didn\u2019t put the blueberries in; my Mom had taught me that if you do, it just smushes them up.\n\nI got the bacon going in one of the pans and checked the other skillet was at the right temperature. I poured out three pancakes using a small measuring cup. Before they hardened, I dribbled a half-dozen blueberries into each pancake. I smiled as I cooked; I realized I was happy again after all that had happened to me. I went through a lot, but I found Greg because of it. His love pulled me out of the pit, and I loved being his.\n\nI pulled out a plate, stacking up the finished ones as I worked, and another for the bacon. I was finishing up the last two pancakes, both of which had smiley faces made from carefully-placed blueberries when he came into the room. \u201cThat looks amazing, baby.\u201d\n\nHe moved in and wrapped his arms around me, one of his hands moving inside my robe and cupping a breast. Of course. I leaned back into him, and he gave me a deep kiss. When his hand started drifting down towards the tie for my robe, I smacked it. \u201cBreakfast is ready. Set the table, Greg. We\u2019ve got all day for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill not enough time,\u201d he said with a grin. He put out plates and silverware and poured us coffee and orange juice just as I brought the plates of food over. I went back to get the butter and syrup, then took my three pancakes while I stared at his pile of six pancakes and a handful of bacon. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look very efficient,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you put enough syrup on for six pancakes, how does it reach the ones near the bottom?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cut them up, and dip them in my syrup,\u201d he said as he buttered pancakes inside his stack so it would melt.\n\n\u201cYeah, but then you drown your bacon. Three pancakes max, and bacon draped over the edges to keep out of the way. Learn from the Master.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I like things dipped and sticky,\u201d he said as he sprayed some whipped cream over the top of his stack. \u201cMmmm... so good. What a great morning wakeup.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as good as a few days ago,\u201d I said with a grin. \u201cHard to top that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe hard, you top,\u201d he replied, nearly causing me to spit my juice out.\n\n\u201cBehave! I\u2019m trying to eat!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo am I, but you are VERY distracting when I know you\u2019re naked under that robe.\u201d I pulled the top of the robe together and tightened the belt so I wasn\u2019t showing so much cleavage. He looked out the window. \u201cClear skies means cold weather,\u201d he said. \u201cThings will be moving again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think I can go outside?\u201d I\u2019d been cooped up for days.\n\n\u201cI think when I open the door, you\u2019ll squeal and run back to the fireplace. It\u2019s got to be ten below out there.\u201d We talked about our plans; it was time for me to get serious about an exercise routine. \u201cI\u2019ll get the exercise bike put together today, and we can do a light workout together. Stretching, jump rope, basic calisthenics. We\u2019ll do exercises that don\u2019t twist or bend your torso while you heal.\u201d\n\nI nodded as I finished my bacon. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling better every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to push it; there\u2019s no doctor around and no need to rush your recovery. Listen to your body, it will tell you what it needs.\u201d He finished as I did, and he packed the leftovers into baggies as I took the dishes into the sink. The rental place didn\u2019t have a dishwasher, so I filled up one side with soapy hot water and started putting all the stuff in there. He wiped off the table as I was cleaning the plates and setting them into the drying rack by the sink.\n\nI was starting the pans when I felt a rush of cold air on my bare butt, then a pair of hands grabbed my thighs. I squealed \u201cGREG!\u201d as his tongue flicked across my core. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything. He just kept licking me as one of his fingers moved over my clit. I bit my tongue, not wanting him to stop. \u201cFinish the job,\u201d he said as he lightly smacked my butt. I groaned and went back to scrubbing the pan as he pressed his face to me again. I put the last fry pan in the rack and turned around.\n\nHe stood and picked me up, setting me on the kitchen counter before pulling the tie from my apron. He pushed it off my shoulders, spreading it behind me before he laid me back onto the hard surface. \u201cI\u2019m not done eating yet,\u201d he said with a grin as he grabbed the can of whipped cream he\u2019d left by the stove.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with that?\u201d\n\nHe sprayed some of the whipped cream on my exposed boobs, making the nipples harden with the cold. Then he sprayed more between my legs. \u201cI told you, I like things dipped and sticky.\u201d He moved over me, opening his mouth wide to suck the cream off my left nipple.\n\nI moaned in pleasure as he sucked and licked to get it all before moving to the other. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like it?\u201d\n\nHe looked up at me and laughed. \u201cListen to your body. What is it telling you?\u201d\n\nI could feel my pussy was wet and ready for him. He grinned, knowing my answer, and moved down to start licking up the rest. He held my legs up and apart as he attacked my core, and didn\u2019t stop until the whipped cream was gone and I\u2019d cum hard twice. After the second, while I was looking at the ceiling and catching my breath, I felt his cock rub between my lips and push inside. \u201cGREG!\u201d I said as he sheathed himself in one long push.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so hot, baby,\u201d he said as he started to fuck me. He put my legs over his shoulders as his hands squeezed my tits, and his thumbs flicked over the nipples. It felt amazing, and my body loved it. I came on his cock, squeezing it hard, but he wasn\u2019t ready to cum just yet. He moved one hand down to play with my clit as he started pounding into me harder and harder. The combination pushed me to a higher peak, and I screamed his name again as a stronger orgasm hit me like a freight train.\n\nHe pulled out just in time, fisting his big cock until he sprayed his seed over my body. The first shot reached my neck, and the next ones left lines of white down my breasts and stomach. We both caught our breath, just getting our minds back again after a mind-blowing session. \u201cYou know,\u201d I said with a grin, \u201cYou might be right about this dipped and sticky thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look great like that, but we should clean up and get going,\u201d he said. He helped me to my feet, and we walked naked to the shower together. Well, naked except my fuzzy slippers. The floor was COLD, you know.\n\nPocket\u2019s POV<br >Duluth Dew Drop Inn Motel\n\nI was hungry, and none of the delivery places were open this early. The storm was winding down, but the city of Duluth wasn\u2019t moving yet at eight AM. Almost all businesses and government buildings were closed again today. The news lady said it would be early afternoon before the winds would die down enough to clear all the streets.\n\nThe others started to filter in, closing the doors quickly behind them to keep out the wind. I had men from four other Chapters who had arrived up here after receiving the message from the Oracle. I was the only Vice President, and the only one the Oracle told why we were here. That left me in charge. \u201cWe\u2019re staying put and out of sight for another day,\u201d I told them. \u201cCall down and extend your stay another two days. The Oracle said that more are coming, they got stuck in the storm along the way. When everyone is here, we\u2019ll move.\u201d",
        "\u201cMove where,\u201d one of the guys asked.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know yet. Just keep out of sight and wait until I tell you it\u2019s time to move. Trust me; this is going to be fun. We get to take out people who have hurt and betrayed our Club.\u201d That seemed to satisfy them for now.\n\nCaptain Mark McCluskey\u2019s POV<br >Duluth Police HQ\n\nI\u2019d only gotten an hour of sleep last night, and I was exhausted. I\u2019d been on the phone all morning with the Task Force, the FBI in Minneapolis, and my boss. We\u2019d managed to keep the attacks up in Arrowhead Lake off the news, and investigators from the Sheriff\u2019s Department had finally made it to the crime scenes. We still had units surrounding the Dew Drop Inn, and the FBI\u2019s Hostage Rescue Team was expected to arrive at the airport at noon.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t done anything but watch the hotel for a few good reasons. One was the difficulty in getting enough men; with multiple hotel rooms to take down at the same time, we didn\u2019t have enough SWAT to do it right.\n\nThe second was the fact that the motel was full of guests. We were working with the dayshift manager to move people out of the way. I\u2019d authorized moving people to a hotel downtown that still had room. One of our undercover men was calling the guests next to those the Sons were in, asking them to be ready to check out quickly and quietly when we had transportation arranged.\n\nThe last reason was they showed no signs of leaving. Our man reported that two of the rooms had already called down and extended their stays. We all agreed that it would be better to arrest them while they were on the move, on a deserted stretch of road, instead of in a city. We knew what their target would be, and we could plan accordingly.\n\nWatch and wait.\n\nCh. 70\n\nRori\u2019s POV<br >Arrowhead Pack Clinic\n\nI made sure the babies were fed, safe, and protected at the Pack House before I joined my mate at the Clinic. There were no other signs of attack, but Beta Ron was stuck at the Lundergaard\u2019s until investigators arrived, and we would have a parade of law enforcement at our place soon. After a brief mental talk with my mate, we agreed to have the meeting in the treatment room that Frank Grimes now rested in.\n\nWe\u2019d already done some things in preparation for the law enforcement arrival. Vic and Spider Monkey moved to Teri\u2019s extra bedroom, where they would remain until we could move them to Oxbow Lake. We didn\u2019t know if either of their faces would show up in front of the Task Force, but he had left blood behind. Teri thought it would be best so she could continue working with the gifted hacker on keeping us out of trouble.\n\nI talked to Michael and Margaret, who were concerned about their people being caught up in this mess. They decided to have most of their people return to their Pack in wolf form, while they would stay behind with some of their warriors, just in case. The party was over, and the cops didn\u2019t need to see a pool filled with naked people. A group of forty wolves led by a Beta was working its way through the woods towards home, taking advantage of the weather than kept helicopters and aircraft grounded.\n\nThe Omegas serves breakfast before everyone left, then packed up the rest of the food. We would shut down the Pack House until the police were gone.\n\nFinally, I had the bags that Chase, Spider Monkey, and Vic returned with moved into the safe room at Beta Ron and Teri\u2019s house. It couldn\u2019t stay in our home with all the cops coming, and my Mom and Dad were members of the Brotherhood. Ron had no ties to the Brotherhood, so they had no cause to search there. I was shocked when I saw what was in them, more so that his brothers had refused to take more than a bag for each of their Packs. It was a lot of money, and we could do good with it, but not now. Too many people would be watching us.\n\nThe room slowly filled with people. Frank was on the bed, lying on his right side, the dozen or so bandages covering his lower back and legs hidden from us. Colletta was sitting at the head of the bed, with Frank\u2019s head in her lap while she held his hand. I saw what Chase had told me; she was smitten with him, and her wolf was protecting him.\n\nTeri sat at the foot of the bed; she would be linking Ron during the meeting while he waited. Michael had Margaret in his lap in a chair at the foot of the bed. Coral and Keith were standing near the door, and Roadkill had Possum in his lap on a chair by the sink. Doc had returned home with the rest of the Pack, so Chase was sitting on the rolling stool, and I perched in his lap. \u201cA lot of stuff has happened, and we haven\u2019t been able to talk about it all with everything going on,\u201d Chase started. \u201cFirst off, some good news.\u201d\n\nHe nudged me, and I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant again. Doc confirmed it, and I\u2019m due around Labor Day.\u201d Our parents already knew, but my Aunt and Uncle and Teri did not. They all got up to congratulate and hug us, then sat back down. \u201cYou know that my mate is going to be insanely protective of me now, and I can\u2019t shift. Security is going to be even more of a concern after these attacks.\u201d\n\nChase recapped what had happened with the Sons and the Brotherhood; the attack on the Ryders, our taking of Harleigh to protect her, the losses at the Orlando Clubhouse and the deal he had made with Frank Grimes. \u201cFrank has learned our secret this morning, and I\u2019ve explained to him how we deal with these things. He has agreed to protect our secret as he has protected my family, and that is why he is here.\u201d Everyone nodded at this; he wasn\u2019t the only human who loved people in this Pack. \u201cThe deal was simple; I would help Frank and the DEA take down the Sons, and I\u2019d convince the Brotherhood to stay out of the way so it didn\u2019t spill over into a gang war. I went to San Francisco with Vic to meet Spider Monkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a gifted hacker, a biker, and a Steel Lady. She helped us save Possum when she was kidnapped, and has contacts we don\u2019t have,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cShe had started hacking the Sons of Tezcatlipoca right after they hit the Ryder\u2019s home. It was her and her friends who found out the offshore account information, and the list of member\u2019s phone numbers. She also hacked the Los Angeles chapter computers, which is where we got the list of compromised law enforcement agents and judges,\u201d Chase continued.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the source you were protecting,\u201d Frank said.\n\n\u201cYes. We have no one inside the Sons, but we needed you to believe it, so you didn\u2019t figure her out. That\u2019s one reason we told you to warn us so we could get our man out.\u201d\n\nHis mind was already working ahead. \u201cYou wanted the warning for yourself.\u201d\n\nThis is where we had to trust Frank with a secret that could destroy us. \u201cWe did,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSpider had figured out the Sons owned a building through a shell company two blocks away, and we watched as cars from different Chapters drove in, and drive out lighter. We hit the building when you hit the Clubhouse, killed six of their men, and drove off with a pallet full of their cash.\u201d\n\nFrank\u2019s eyes got wide as he took the news in. \u201cI figured it was money, we knew it wasn\u2019t drugs, and guns weren\u2019t valuable enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know about the tunnel, and that\u2019s how Vic got shot twice. A guy came up behind us as he was leaving and got him in the back. I patched him up, and he\u2019s recovering here now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the cash,\u201d Frank asked.\n\n\u201cOur share is hidden away. We took away the Club\u2019s income source, savings, and cash in less than a day. At the same time, the information we gave them allowed you to build a RICO case and arrest every patched member you can tie to the drugs. I thought we did enough, but the Sons aren\u2019t done with us yet. Frank, what you don\u2019t know about the Sons is that they aren\u2019t all human. Their Presidents are Jaguar shifters; like us, they are strong, live long lives, and are hard to kill. They use humans to accomplish their work for them. They know Rori and I are werewolves, and our Pack is involved. That is why they are moving members up here, to go to war.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense last night then,\u201d Colletta said. \u201cThe attackers were all human. Why not wait until they had numbers to take us all on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Chase said. \u201cMaybe they had people in place, and with the storm, they thought they could take out the leadership. It\u2019s not like we can ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour Jaguars attacked us last week and we killed them all in the tunnels. This morning was their second try to kill Heather and our Alphas,\u201d Teri said.\n\nChase looked around. \u201cThat catches us up on the Sons, unless you have anything else to add, Frank.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Presidents are jaguars, they are all on the loose and backed by the Sinaloa cartel. Cleaning up the clubs won\u2019t be enough.\u201d He rested back in Carlotta\u2019s lap. \u201cI\u2019m officially suspended, and Frank Donovan is no longer on the task force. The Task Force didn\u2019t warn you about the Sons being in the area, and that was intentional. I don\u2019t think we can trust them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d I said. \u201cNow we need to talk about what has happened around here.\u201d I told them all about the surprise visit from Chairman Coffey, and how the Council was coming down on our Pack in particular. \u201cThere is only one other Pack that has a Trusted Affiliate; we have the other eleven between my parents, our lawyer, and the Steel Ladies. Our visible support of the Brotherhood is another risk they are no longer comfortable with us taking. He insisted that we must withdraw from human interactions, stay out of the news, and keep our nature from humans. The Council will not approve any more Trusted Affiliate requests. They will demand humans who discover us be killed immediately, as our laws require.\u201d\n\nI looked over at Colletta as I said this; her wolf was coming forward to protect him. I gave her a minute to gain control again. \u201cWolf problems?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cFrank is not our mate, but he has proven himself to my wolf. She will protect him to protect my human side.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSpider Monkey doesn\u2019t know Vic\u2019s secret yet, but he has claimed her just as Colletta has claimed Frank. Then we have Harleigh, I mean Heather, holed up somewhere with Greg. What if she learns what we are?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not allow the Council to dictate what happens to our Pack members,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat could be dangerous,\u201d Michael replied. \u201cThe Council is the ultimate law, and you accepted their rule. If you refuse to do what the Chairman demands, and the full Council backs him, other Packs are bound by law to remove you as Alphas and restore order.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely you wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d I said to my Uncle.\n\n\u201cI would not, I imagine your brothers would not, but it would be a real mess. Many of the Packs agree with the Chairman. They find your actions reckless, those of immature Alphas endangering us all. The worst-case scenario is that sides are chosen, and civil war breaks out between the Packs. It could be a long and destructive war, one that we might not win.\u201d\n\nColletta turned pale. \u201cSurely we could find a way to avoid war.\u201d\n\nMichael shook his head. \u201cWhat happened today is only going to harden these attitudes. Instead of retreating and avoiding notice, you\u2019re front and center in the biggest story of the year. Not only will Law Enforcement be all over this place soon, so will the Press. If Coffey has the backing of the Council, they could already be working on sanctions. If you don\u2019t eliminate the humans who know of our nature, they may do it for you.\u201d\n\nNow several of us were growling, me among them. These humans were family and had proven their loyalty.\n\nHe looked over at Frank. \u201cIf I had a do-over, I would have told you to leave Orlando alone and cut ties with the Club. The Chairman is right; the more close contact you have with humans, the greater the chance of exposure and complications.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back now,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need to figure out how we\u2019re going to handle this problem we have in my kitchen and stairways.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hide what happened here without inviting more suspicion,\u201d Teri said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got a Deputy across the lake, and more will be here soon. Frank is right, if we try and hide anything in the scene, they\u2019ll figure it out. Short of burning your house down, I don\u2019t know how to hide it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a question,\u201d Frank asked. \u201cCarlotta told me your wolf nature comes from a blood curse passed down to your descendants. Can it be detected in your DNA?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, our DNA is the same as a humans,\u201d I said.\n\nHe thought for a second. \u201cIn wolf form, it\u2019s still the same DNA?\u201d Chase nodded. \u201cYou have a bigger problem than you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Michael asked.\n\n\u201cCrimes scene is going to be all over this place, and there\u2019s blood from the fighting everywhere. The two Pack members who died, were both in wolf form?\u201d\n\nCoral answered for me. \u201cVicki emptied her pistol then shifted, while Patricia shifted immediately. Both are in their wolf forms, as we can\u2019t shift without conscious thought.\u201d\n\nHe lifted his head slightly off her legs. \u201cYou guys are behaving as if you have a secret to protect, and you don\u2019t even realize that your secret is already gone.\u201d I gasped, not understanding yet.\n\n\u201cThe blood,\u201d Chase said.\n\n\u201cYes. The police will sample all the blood, expecting some to be canine, but all will be human. The bodies, including the \u2018dogs,\u2019 will be evidence. You can\u2019t explain away a wolf with human DNA.\u201d\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d Coral said. \u201cWe need to remove the bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t work. The blood won\u2019t match the victims, and Crime Scene will easily pick up the removal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe burn down the house then,\u201d I said, hating the thought.\n\n\u201cDo that, and you\u2019ll never get the police out of here,\u201d Frank said. \u201cYou can\u2019t cover up evidence and be treated like a victim. They\u2019ll discover the tunnels, and they will dig into the lives of everyone who lives here. Hell, the Task Force is already doing that. They\u2019ve been given your old identity as Treasure Olson. Right now, teams are digging through both of your backgrounds, looking for how you got your money, and who your associates are. Give them a week, and they\u2019ll pull enough strings they will have a list of every Pack and every Werewolf in the country, just based on their record and phone searches.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve endangered you all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost all of you are guilty of something. I won\u2019t speak of a woman\u2019s age, but with your long lifespans, you must have changed your identities a few times?\u201d They all nodded. \u201cFelony identity theft. Fraud. Tax evasion. Filing false affidavits, birth, and death certificates. Insurance fraud. Once you start pulling strings, it all comes down. Your kind thinks that they can withdraw and keep your secret, and I\u2019m telling you that your behaviors are inevitably going to expose it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Colletta said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder to manage identities all the time, and it\u2019s no longer possible to live outside the system. What do we do?\u201d\n\nFrank laid his head down and looked up at her. \u201cWhen you have a secret you don\u2019t want to come out, but you KNOW it is going to come out, what would you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell the secret myself, so I could manage how it happened,\u201d Colletta said.\n\n\u201cAnd that is what you need to do here, and quickly. Do it before the Task Force blows your lives apart.\u201d\n\nI leaned back against my mate\u2019s chest, the enormity of it all finally hitting. Frank was right; the horse was out of the barn, and the door was locked closed. \u201cHow do we do this?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuickly,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need to call an emergency Council meeting. We can\u2019t do something that affects every Pack like this without warning them first.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me help you with the Government,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI have contacts in Homeland Security and Justice. Let me talk with them, see if we can limit this to the highest levels of government. It\u2019s the only way to pull the Task Force back before it all blows up.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowhead members got a mental send from the warrior at the gate; a snowplow had arrived with three Sheriff Department cruisers following it. Our time was up.\n\n \n"
