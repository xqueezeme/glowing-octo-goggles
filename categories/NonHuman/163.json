        "Welcome back!\n\nI have made up a chart for Who's Who in TRC!\n\nMore info on that is on my Bio page along with progress and chapter updates if anyone is interested.\n\nFor those of you reading The Runesmith Chronicles for the first time I recommend going back and starting with the first book The Runesmith Chronicles (it's actually Oni and the Farmer but it's too late to change it here :P). Mostly so you have a better understanding of how things like the magic system works and what's going on as I often reference earlier chapters.\n\nAs always, don't forget to vote and don't forget to leave a comment! I may not respond to every one but I read them all and they are greatly appreciated!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBlu\n\n--\n\nEdited/Proofread by - oldfart and 2muchdiggity\n\n--\n\nChapter 20\n\n\"Quit yer fuggin' laughin' ye arsehole!\" the gorgon yelled up at Kal.\n\nWith his lips tight and teeth clenched in poorly contained mirth, the mage said, \"You're... slithering along the floor. How am I supposed to not find that funny?\"\n\n\"It ain't funny an' it fuggin' itches!\" snapped Sera. She was lying on her back and using her feet to scoot across the carpet in an attempt to relieve the intense prickly sensation as her new skin beneath pushed off the older layer above.\n\nKal wanted to offer his help but she was currently very annoyed with him and was in no mood for his assistance. A short time ago when she realized what was happening, he had thought to lighten the mood since she was more irritated than alarmed by this turn of events.\n\nSince she was naked when he found her out by the firepit, and he knew that she really liked having her breasts played with, he reached out and tweaked a nipple. She hadn't gotten the chance to tell him that her face and the more sensitive parts of her body were the first to begin the molting process along with her patches of scales.\n\nLike slipping the peel off a blanched apple, the thin top layer of skin on and around her areola came off in his fingers. Kal was surprised and mildly disgusted for a moment, but Sera was mortified. He flicked the thin piece of old flesh off onto the floor and looked back at the gorgon.\n\nHorrified by what just happened, she slapped a hand over her breast, which turned out to be as bad of an idea as Kal's. She already enjoyed rough nipple play and the skin there was now brand new and extremely sensitive. On top of that, she was planning on some passionate goodbye lovemaking before Kal left and her body was already primed with anticipation. The sharp impact of her hand felt like a lightning bolt that ran straight from her nipple to her sex.\n\nUntil that moment the gorgon had no idea she could almost climax from just her breasts. After recovering and catching her breath, Sera was deeply embarrassed by both events. In her ire, she told the mage he was no longer allowed to touch her. The gorgon realized it wasn't totally fair since he had no idea that might happen, but she was too annoyed with the situation to care. Even as she launched into a grouchy tirade, Sera already knew she was going to be begging his forgiveness later for being so bitchy.\n\nMinutes later when she was calmer, Sera assured him that there was no danger to her when molting here in the tent, unlike when it happened in her old home. Her human skin produced a small amount of moisture to slough off the older top layer. This tended to attract predators at a time when she and the serpents on her head were nearly blind and she was mostly powerless. Kal suppressed a shiver as she told him this, he hadn't realized that she had a transparent layer of skin covering her eyes. He also realized that she hadn't blinked once since this all started, it was making his own eyes feel dried out just thinking about it.\n\nSince there was little he could do for her, they decided to continue with their plans, just without the morning of lovemaking in preparation for his departure. As he had promised, Kal cooked her a nice big steak that morning, only to turn around and end up eating most of it. The gorgon sheepishly explained that she didn't eat while molting since hunting was so much more dangerous. What started as a habit turned into a complete lack of appetite until she was finished.\n\nAfterward, Kal dressed and gathered the scant belongings he felt he might need for this journey. He wanted to disappear within the thousands of people living within the city while not looking destitute.\n\nGone was the nice cloak with the red trim, as were the fineries crafted by Telsin's tailor from the best fabrics available and some of the less expensive, but still highly sought after, materials from Ikuno's bag of holding. He replaced it all with garb more fitting for a lower noble or merchant. A commoner with a bag of holding on his hip might raise a few eyebrows.\n\nAlso missing were his vambraces. Previously, he had just flipped them over while visiting cities like Carriston. He didn't feel comfortable doing that here and had also realized that it was out of sheer luck that he hadn't had to use his shield while they were upside down, the magic disc would have likely split his arm down the middle had he activated it. Instead, he copied all but the shield, haste, and magic arrow spells to a wide strip of leather which he wrapped around his back and fastened above his belt so it would be hidden by his tunic.\n\nUsing magic within Lantaris was already 'last resort only,' even so, he would have to be careful if it ever became necessary. The stiffer leather of his vambraces could take a lot more punishment than the soft and supple piece of hide now pressed up against his lower spine. If he pushed a spell too hard and burned the leather the rune was effectively lost to him, unless it was one of the few he also knew in their drawn form.\n\nPeople overly curious how someone like him would have a bag of holding was a concern, but he also knew he wouldn't be able to keep it a secret. Especially since he had forgotten to replace the travel pack Ria gave to the woman she sent off to Telsin. Those with sharp eyes were going to wonder how he made it so far with just the clothes on his back. In each of his new trousers, he sewed a loop inside the waist where he could tie the laces to Ria's bag. She could come and go as she pleased, appearing in front of where the bag hung inside his pants, but he would need to fish out the small satchel and open the neck where it was cinched for her to store or retrieve anything.\n\nThe sprite was having a heyday with all of this. Teasing him about rubbing her sack against his and threatening to come directly out of the bag into his pants and giving him a fondle at embarrassing and inopportune times. While she could appear inside the bag, she couldn't do it with the bag tied closed. However, she did demonstrate that it wasn't difficult for her to shrink slightly and fly up his pant leg. Whatever she did to his balls for the next few seconds felt extremely good and Kal groaned in disappointment when she vanished and returned to the leather sack.\n\nSince their encounter with the will-o'-wisp, the little bit of play at the crossroads inn had been the most they'd done together. She was still a constant part of his and Sera's lovemaking, either as a spectator or helping in some way. The sprite always gravitated toward helping out the gorgon, whether it was teasing the woman's clit as Kal stroked into her or the sprite grinding her sex into Sera's nipple while casting sultry looks up at him and rubbing her own breasts. Only on rare occasions did she use her hands or mouth on him in some way, and those times were always frustratingly brief.\n\nRia's teasing got progressively worse as they approached Lantaris. He suspected that she had something planned for when they were alone in the city, but became exceedingly coy and dodged the subject whenever he brought it up.\n\nKal stuck his head into the library and the alchemy room, checking to be sure that he had everything. He frowned for a moment at the glass tubes and vials he'd received from Ikuno. In a stoppered, round-bottomed flask was the milky toxin that came from Sera's fangs. Once they were well beyond the church's city, they would need to stop for a couple of days so he could distill and test the gorgon's venom as well as purify the vial of Aradelle's nectar he brought back with him.\n\nRemaking his vambrace after the fight with Kogen, making the messenger parchments for Perra, copying the runes from the butcher's cooling unit, then making the strip of leather for his trip into the city meant he was running much lower on ink than he was comfortable with. Thankfully neither of his bracers was in need of replacement but if for some reason that changed, he didn't think he had enough left to make another.\n\nSera's venom seemed to hold the potential for another base to make ink for more permanent runes to join the three that he had. Unfortunately, the liquid was very fickle and naturally lost its magic within days. The sample sitting there might as well be thrown out since it would be worthless by the time he returned. In an attempt to make the toxin safer to handle, he used the cure poison on it only to find the spell destroyed any of its magical properties . The tiny bit he managed to distill one night, after multiple failed attempts, appeared to keep its magic but that brought up another possible issue. If Sera froze someone with her gaze then bit them, it turned the person to stone. This was the reason she had the snakes on her head do the biting when it came to her food. Kal was slightly worried that a purified and highly magical distillation of the venom may turn him to stone if he attempted to use it. He felt the probability was extremely low, but it was still there.\n\nNot seeing anything in the room that he felt he needed, Kal turned his attention back to the gorgon. Sera was curled into a ball facing away from him on the carpet beside the marble flooring. The gorgon whimpered as she tried to keep from scratching the skin that wasn't ready to come off but itched like mad as it prepared to. Kal's heart went out to the girl, the only thing he had to compare it to was an extremely bad sunburn he got when he started taking over some of the farming duties from his mother. The burn started out only being annoying because of the constant feeling of nausea and uncomfortable because he constantly felt like he was freezing, otherwise, it wasn't a big deal. He didn't understand why his mother had been so insistent he take some coppers into town and get a specific salve from Lady Nina along with some tea that his mother occasionally drank before going to sleep.\n\nThe second day after getting his sunburn, the sun-sickness passed but the itching started. He'd been bitten many times over the years by bugs that left insanely itchy welts, they were irritating but manageable. As he healed, Kal likened feeling to hundreds of tiny spiders on his back, but each of their legs was tipped with a pin his mother used for sewing instead of feet. He remembered being in much the same state as Sera was in right now. His mother smeared the numbing salve on his back and had him drink the bitter tea he had bought. They repeated this process three more times until he woke up and the itchy feeling was manageable.\n\nHaving that feeling on just his back had been torturous, and here Sera was dealing with it over her entire body. Unfortunately, he didn't have any of the salve or tea his mother had used. Kneeling next to the miserable woman, he gently rolled her toward him. Her eyes could still produce tears, which was a good thing, but the tears were getting caught between her eye and its old outer layer which had turned milky. The sight was... disturbing, for a human at least.\n\nHe lifted her head. \"Are you sure you will be alright?\"\n\nSera nodded.\n\n\"Then I'm going to leave. Before I head out, I'm curious if there any drawback to sleeping while you are molting?\"\n\n\"No,\" the gorgon sniffled, \"I'd try to sleep as much as I could since it made things go by quicker, but it was hard with predators around.\"\n\nKal scooped the woman up into his arms. \"I'm going to use a sleep spell on you before I go,\" he explained while carrying her into their bedroom. \"That way you can at least nap through some of it.\"\n\n\"I wish you could just put me to sleep until it's done.\"\n\n\"How long would that be?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I never had a concept of 'days' when living underground. This is all my own damn fault anyway.\"\n\n\"I thought you said this was normal for you.\"\n\n\"It is, but it's more common for me to do this when hunting is good and I'm eating well. If I hadn't gorged myself while you were gone, I might not be in this situation,\" she said as Kal laid her in the bed.\n\n\"Do we need to cut back?\"\n\nSera shook her head slightly and a couple of light cracks could be heard from the sides of her neck where the scales were dry and hazy. \"I don't think we are eating enough in a day to be a concern. Besides, I like your cooking.\"\n\nHer hands kept clenching and unclenching with indecision as well as forcing herself not to scratch. He was about to leave, possibly for weeks, should she say it?\n\n\"Okay then,\" he leaned over and kissed her lightly on the lips. Pulling away, he blinked a few times before smiling down at her, \"I hope you don't mind but I won't be doing that again until you are done.\" Parts of her lips were... loose.\n\n\"That's okay, it felt weird to me too,\" she said, scrunching up her face. Kal immediately wished she hadn't, some of it moved normally but there were patches that didn't quite match up and the look was disconcerting.\n\n\"Ria, one of the packets of sleeping sand please.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" said the sprite from behind him. Kal had brought her out when getting ready to leave and she had been quietly waiting for them to say their goodbyes before bidding the gorgon farewell.\n\nThe small satchel appeared in his hand and immediately began leaking the fine sand into his palm. Drizzling some over the gorgon's head, he returned it to the bag of holding.\n\n\"Didn't you just call this sleep sand?\" asked Sera. She was plainly annoyed that he just doused a part of her head in the gritty substance.\n\nKal formed the dark purple magic circle for the sleep spell in front of his hand.\n\n\"Ohh... that's a pretty colo\u2014\" The gorgon stopped speaking as Kal held the spell up to her face and activated it. At the same time, the serpents making up her hair stopped moving.\n\nThe mage was slightly creeped out. It was plain to see from the rest of her body that she was asleep, yet her eyes remained open.\n\nStraightening up, he glanced over at the sprite. \"Let's go,\" he said, turning towards the door.\n\n\"I think I should stay, Kal. At least until she wakes. I think she would appreciate not waking up alone her first day without you,\" said Ria.\n\nHe thought for a moment. They were about two days out from the city and he was hoping to make it there in one. That meant using the haste rune on one of his vambraces to get through the forest quickly and safely. After he reached the road, he'd planned on giving his bracer back to the sprite. He didn't have his good cloak that was set up for gliding so he couldn't go over the trees either. If he didn't make it into the city then he would be stuck outside without any shelter unless he could convince someone to take him in for the night.\n\nRia was right though.\n\n\"I'll need my staff, my old moneypurse, some silver and a couple of mana crystals...\"\n\n---\n\nKal got extremely lucky, the road was often clear for long stretches, letting him use the speed rune to make up time. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the time he lost traveling through the forest and back to the road. He watched in frustration as the city's gates closed off in the distance. The white walls were too high to jump over and too well guarded to scale. He wasn't getting in there tonight.\n\nThere was a small building that looked like a traveler's inn close to the gate. Judging by the line of people filing in who, like him, were shut out for the night, he would likely be sleeping out in the stables by the time he got there. Two covered wagons that had the look of merchant's carts pulled off the road up ahead and began searching for a place to make camp. Smiling, Kal stepped off the road to see if they might be interested in an extra pair of hands in the event some bandits showed up.\n\n---\n\n\"...So while I'm doing that, Bren comes in with Perra's brother, hauls him upstairs and... Crash! Slams him down onto the bed. Bren told me later that Ellis made him pay for a whole new bed because parts of it were in splinters.\"\n\nThe older man sitting across the campfire from Kal chortled. When Kal approached the wagons after pulling off the road, the elderly gentleman was wearing a green robe with swirling embroidery in copper colored thread. Before setting up camp he changed into his current tunic and slacks, effectively saying that he was done being a merchant for the day. His daughter did the same, switching from a shimmering purple dress to one like Perra wore. The plain brown fabric was meant for comfort, not to be showy. Though he did notice that she left on the little bit of makeup she wore.\n\nSitting between the two men, the woman smirked. \"Lucky he didn't end up killing the man and undoing all your work,\" she said. The daughter appeared to be just a couple years older than Kal and it seemed like she scooted closer every time he looked her direction. That was hardly a surprise considering the looks she kept giving him.\n\nThe woman excused herself and stepped out beyond the wagons. No sooner was she out of sight than the merchant jumped up and trotted over. Kal was worried he was about to be attacked for the daughter's interest in him, but the old man just leaned over and began speaking in hushed tones.\n\n\"If my girl approaches you tonight, I'd ask that you take her up on it.\"\n\nKal was stunned speechless.\n\n\"From your stories, your woman back home knows about your 'companion' and doesn't seem to mind. My daughter is sharper than I am. If I noticed it, then guaranteed she did about the time she started sliding toward your side of the fire.\"\n\nHe hadn't realized that he'd been quite so open about his relationships. Kal gave him a sheepish grin, \"Oops.\"\n\n\"You seem like a decent sort, better for her to take care of her urges with you before we get into the city than risk losing her to some silver-tongued noble wannabe.\"\n\n\"You just met me.\"\n\n\"I meet a lot of people. It's not hard to tell the decent ones, especially when they're talking about their loved ones. Just think on it.\" He hurried back to his seat on the other side of the fire just before his daughter reentered the camp.\n\nThe woman continued scooting toward him as they chatted. When she was sitting right next to Kal, the old man excused himself with a smile. Kal and the woman watched him wander off to the wagon where his bed was.\n\n\"Doddering old idiot,\" she said, chuckling. \"I'm going to be so sad when he finally passes.\"\n\n\"That seems appropriate since he's your father.\"\n\n\"There's more to it than that. My father decided to leave town after my mother passed away, he couldn't stand the memories of her every time he turned around. Once he passes on, it will be nearly impossible for me to continue doing this on my own. Women just don't command the same kind of respect the men do unless their faces are very well known. He and I haven't been on the road long enough for me to build up that kind of reputation. Of course, I wouldn't be out here at all if my husband hadn't turned out to be a cheating ass.\"\n\nShe cast him a sidelong glance. \"Your woman knows about the lady you're traveling with and is okay with it?\"\n\nKal nodded. \"Perra is actually looking forward to meeting Sera, and the reverse is true as well. She has our son to keep her company and a lady friend of her own to warm her bed until I get back.\"",
        "\"What will happen to this lady friend when you get back?\"\n\nKal smiled. \"We will need to get a bigger bed, Kuto is one of my women as well.\"\n\n\"Then what of this Sera? You keep calling her a companion.\"\n\n\"Correct. Though we've become very close lately, she isn't specifically 'my' woman.\"\n\n\"Is she unworthy of being one of your women?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Kal, chuckling. \"She just hasn't asked yet. They defer to my judgment as to who I bring into my inner circle, but I asked each of them beforehand and they've all given their approval should Sera ever approach me.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed in suspicion. \"That sounded like you were talking about more than just two women.\"\n\n\"Oops.\"\n\n\"Like the other two, they are all okay with this?\" her voice was tinged with disbelief.\n\nKal nodded. \"In fact, it was one of them who prompted me to start taking on more mates. She's from a land far to the east of here where a man having many women is considered a sign of status and power. Were it not for her, I probably would have stuck with one woman. All of them have very active libidos, it gets hard to keep up when I'm back home\"\n\nHer expression went from skeptical to curious, \"You aren't bragging.\"\n\nFrom her tone, Kal couldn't make out if it was a question or a statement. \"I'm... not?\" he answered uncertainly.\n\n\"No, you aren't, and that seems strange. Just strange enough that I think I believe you.\" Her hand slid over onto Kal's leg, her fingers lightly tracing the outline of his prick. \"You have your women and your companion. What about one,\" she gripped him through his pants, \"or maybe two dalliances?\"\n\nThe mage smiled. \"You were kind enough to invite a stranger into your camp and even make him a meal. If that's how you'd like me to show my appreciation, I won't mind a bit.\"\n\n\"Mmm, wonderful,\" she said standing. \"My father needs to learn to talk quieter, I overheard what he told you earlier.\" She hiked up her dress on each side, leaving the front hanging low enough to hide her sex as she hooked her fingers into her undergarments and pulled them down. \"He does have a point though. I often run off for a night or two and have a little bit of fun. He worries terribly during those times. If I can take care of this now, then I can save him the worry later.\"\n\nHe started undoing his belt but she waved his hands away then had him lean back and prop himself up on his arms before bending over and doing it for him. Kal had to admit, the look of pleasure in a woman's eyes when they first saw his cock was something he'd never get tired of.\n\nGripping his shaft, she positioned her mouth above his prick and let a dollop of spit fall from her lips onto the head. She then used it to coat his shaft before doing it a second time. Kal hadn't had a woman do that to him before and it seemed odd, though it was fun watching her get him ready.\n\nHiking up the front of her dress so it didn't drag over his spit slickened prick, she knelt down, reaching beneath the skirt with one hand to guide him to her entrance.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Kal, \"I don't know your name.\"\n\nShe thought for just a second before replying with a soft smile. \"I'm not looking to become one of your women or one of your companions. I'm just needing a man to scratch an itch for a night or two, so let's leave the names out of it. It'll make it easier when we part ways.\"\n\nAfter a few seconds, Kal nodded and the woman sunk slowly down onto him with a long moan.\n\nAs she started making small circular grinding motions, she looked down at him. \"It's been a while. Last time was in Carriston, I've been making do with my fingers since then.\"\n\nThe motions sped up slightly and Kal realized that she was rubbing her clit on the area just above his prick. He was a little sad that her dress was covering where they were joined. He liked to watch.\n\n\"I've been there, had a run-in with some of the more unsavory elements of the town.\"\n\n\"Hmph... Kogen and his slave trade, the worst kept secret in the city. If you ran afoul of them, be careful if you ever go back. I understand he has the backing of some of the lordship and a long memory when it comes to those who piss him off. Now hush,\" she commanded as she closed her eyes and focused on the sensations coming from her sex. Kal was happy to oblige, the subject matter was threatening to make him go limp. Maybe he'd tell her later that Kogen was no longer an issue.\n\nThe woman wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned forward, laying her cheek on his shoulder. Her hips sped up with their circular motion until she found a comfortable rhythm. Kal was enjoying this immensely, the swirling motion pressing on each side of his cock was extremely nice while still offering enough in and out movement. It only got better when the tiny moans started escaping her lips and the walls of her sex began squeezing him more frequently as she approached her release. After a slow buildup, she quite suddenly rose up until he was just barely inside her and slammed down onto him three times in rapid succession. Her fingers dug into his back and she grabbed the fabric of his shirt covering his shoulder between her teeth as she ground her clit into him. This only lasted a few seconds before she lifted up, her clit becoming extremely sensitive as her orgasm ran its course. Putting her forehead on his shoulder, she panted for a few minutes before looking up at him with a smile.\n\n\"Think you can go again or are you close?\"\n\nHe grinned back at her, \"I think I'm good for one more.\"\n\n---\n\nKal crawled into the other wagon after putting out the campfire. The woman had worked herself up to another slow, grinding climax before switching to sliding up and down on him until he coated the entrance of her womb with his seed. She then retreated to the wagon her father was sleeping in after asking him to stop by the market and let her know which inn he was staying at.\n\nThe mage hadn't decided if he was going to take her up on that offer. While the experience was certainly enjoyable, and surprisingly intimate because of the way she clung to him the entire time, there was something lacking that he wasn't entirely comfortable with. Then again, the acknowledgment beforehand that this was filling a need, along with her refusal to give her name, offered a degree of disconnect that allowed him to appreciate the physical aspects of their tryst without worrying about the 'after.' He'd make that decision if he happened to see her at the market. Given the size of the city, it was entirely possible he might never lay eyes on her again.\n\nHe set up the bedroll they'd given him to use and looked out into the darkness. Kal wasn't terribly happy about the lack of vigilance, but the old man assured him that this close to the gates of Lantaris, there was no need for a watch. He explained that if the patrols they saw on the road caught a bandit, they were put to death on the spot without trial or chance to escape. Ruffians and scoundrels had safer prey elsewhere.\n\nThieves and cutpurses were still a hazard but Lantaran punishments for thievery were severe by almost any standard. The author of Kal's book on the city had the misfortune of witnessing one of these punishments. The thief publicly had his hands bound to a chopping block then severed with the swipe of a large sword. He was then cast out into the street as a warning to others. Unless a loved one took steps to save them, it was almost guaranteed they'd bleed to death. More disturbing was that the clerics officiating the proceedings refused to help, even though a small healing spell would have been enough to save the accused man's life.\n\nApparently, the love and compassion of the Goddess didn't apply to those who broke the city's rules.\n\nAnd Kal was walking straight into all of this with runic tattoos on his back and a leather strip of spells hidden under his shirt. He must be insane.\n\nUnfortunately for him, the area beyond Lantaris was known as the Death Plains, and the area it covered was equally insane. It was officially known as the Lantaran Plains but had picked up the nickname because being caught trying to enter them was punishable by death. Even if someone managed to avoid the Lantaran guard they were never seen or heard from again.\n\nThankfully, getting in wasn't going to be as difficult or dangerous as the name implied. The rim of the plains had a low rock wall all the way around it with outposts manned by archers and a small cavalry at regular intervals. The sheer cost of maintaining the wall and manning the outposts resulted in large unguarded sections further away from the city. Much like with the areas surrounding Lantaris, the church made periodic sweeps of the area just inside the wall to clear out any trespassers.\n\nOnce on the other side, there were weeks of travel just to go straight across. The problem, of course, was that he wasn't going straight across. While he understood that the northern edge of the Lantaran Plains ran along the edge of the mountain range to the north, he had no clue as to how far down the southern border went. Lantaris could have claimed everything all the way to the Southern Ocean for all he knew. Without having some idea where he was headed, it could take a year or more to find Prentas's tower.\n\nThat meant he needed a map. Tomorrow he wouldn't just walk into the lion's den, but straight into the lion's open and waiting maw just to get it.\n\nKal didn't sleep well that night.\n\n---\n\n\"State your business,\" said the guard at the gate. The man looked bored already and they had barely started to let people in. Kal arrived early that morning and waited in line along with the father and daughter he camped with. Though they tried to get a jump on things, twenty or so carts and people were waiting to be checked by the time they approached the gate. If the guard was this exciting after only a few people, then Kal wondered what he must be like toward the end of his shift.\n\n\"I'm researching the area and looking to speak with the royal cartographers,\" replied Kal.\n\nThe guard nodded and began giving instructions in a dull monotone that people developed after saying the same things over and over hundreds of times a day. \"Stop at the headquarters of the town guard located at the entrance to the inner city. Pay a fee and they'll give you a writ of passage. Then go to one of the cathedrals and state your case to the priest. You will need to have another writ of passage from one of them to get onto the palace grounds where you can speak to the cartographers. Spire on the left,\" he said jerking a thumb over his shoulder.\n\nKal thanked the guard but he was already speaking to those next in line.\n\nThe merchant and his daughter passed through the gates already and, to his surprise, they parked their wagons just inside the city to wait for him. With the time-sensitive nature of their business, this was a little unexpected.\n\nThe old man told him as they were cleaning up their campsite that morning that he and his daughter would break down their shop and be back outside before the gates closed in the evening. In any other city, this would be foolish due to the threat of bandits and thieves. In Lantaris the threat of merchandise being stolen was actually far lower outside and away from the shadowy alleys between buildings.\n\nIt had its drawbacks though. Each morning they would have to make their way through the gate, which meant that all the prime spots for traveling merchants were normally taken by the time they arrived. It also led to them often setting up in different places each day, making it harder for someone to return and purchase wares they were interested in but couldn't afford at the time.\n\nThe daughter hopped down out of the driver's seat of the second wagon as he approached. \"I hope you'll come find me,\" she said, wrapping her arms around him. \"I told him I might spend a couple of nights with you while we are here.\" She shifted slightly and brought the hand nearest the wagon down to the front of his pants.\n\nLooking over the woman's head, Kal saw the old man giving them a beaming smile. \"Your father seems a little too happy that his daughter may be running off to spend the night with me.\"\n\n\"He's getting old, he likes you, and he knows that I like you. He's just thinking about my future.\"\n\nJudging by the look on his face, that seemed like a fair assessment. \"It's a big city and I've never been here before. As much as part of me wants to, I can't make any promises.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" With a smile and a final grope, she pulled away and climbed up into the driver's seat of the wagon. A wave to her father, a tap on the rump of the horse in front of her and they were on their way into the city.\n\nKal adjusted the front of his pants. There was most definitely one part of him that hoped they'd run into each other again.\n\n---\n\nAfter taking a moment to reserve a room for the next few nights at one of the more reputable looking inns, which coincidentally came highly recommended by his book's author, he made his way through the busy streets toward the gate to the upper city.\n\n\"A writ of passage to the upper city without a note of invitation from one of the lords, ladies or clergy is two gold,\" said the guardsman.\n\nKal was more than a little stunned by the steep price. \"It looks as though I'll have to return later. I brought money but nothing along those lines.\"\n\n\"Whatever,\" said the guard, in a tone that made it painfully clear he didn't think Kal would come back. \"We can't have the riff-raff and rabble strolling onto the estates of their betters.\" the guardsman looked him up and down, it was obvious where he thought the young man belonged.\n\nThe guard scowled when he noticed mage's expression. \"I'll be seeing you tomorrow,\" said Kal, smirking as he walked away.\n\n---\n\nThe cathedral was far larger than Kal was prepared for. It and the others in the lower city had been easy to spot when he and Sera got their first look at Lantaris, but from such a distance there was little concept of how large the buildings were. Four shining white towers, two on either end, matched the spires next to the palace. The inside of the massive structures sported rows and rows of stone benches. Until now, the largest city he had been in was Carriston and he had a feeling that a significant portion of its populace could fit inside this lone amphitheater.\n\nHis book explained that, up until a few years ago, the cathedrals were open to the sky. A roof was attempted decades ago with the assistance of some skilled geomancers, but they discovered no degree of stonework mastery could support such a structure. The rock used to bolster the roof was formed around steel reinforcements, but during construction the immense weight caused one of the supports to crumble. Within seconds the entire roof came down, killing two of the geomancers.\n\nThe church was understandably upset, swiftly judging the remaining mages and sentencing them to death. The geomancers resorted to begging for their lives, offering to rebuild the church to its former state. Because of the extreme cost of rebuilding with conventional means they were granted a stay of execution until the work was done. The earth wizards vanished days before completion. The quick reconstruction had swayed public opinion in the geomancers' favor and the church was tight-lipped about their disappearance. Rumors quickly circulated that a group of priests had rounded them up and quietly killed them. The church never confirmed or denied the allegations, even to this day. With his own knowledge of geomancy, Kal suspected that the earth mages escaped instead of chancing a second hearing.\n\nThe book went on to mention that Lantaris had been one of the first to adopt the new type of steel that was recently developed. The new material proved to be strong and light enough to be used for the soaring beams that held up the ceiling. \n\nKal vaguely remembered something about the tub Talin was born in being made out of this newer version of the metal. While interesting, steel and iron didn't get along with magic very well, so he hadn't given it much thought. Seeing the gigantic supports arcing overhead to create the domed roof made him think he had been too hasty in his dismissal.\n\nThe exterior of the amphitheater's covering was plated in gleaming copper, but the underside was painted white and lit by brightly glowing stones set along the beams. Kal asked the acolyte acting as his guide about how the stones or whatever they were produced so much light. The man explained that they were actually bubbles of glass, coated on the inside with a white powder that was laced with mithril. The mage tucked that tidbit of information away for later use when he started needing to light the caves up in the mountain. The stones he and Ikuno had scattered all over the floors up there were only slightly brighter than a torch.\n\n\"What business do you have up in the main church?\" asked the priest. He appeared to be around Ellis and Jurien's age and was dressed in his full white and gold regalia even though the daily sermon had concluded hours ago. His office in the back of the cathedral was lavishly adorned with various expensive-looking trinkets revolving around his faith. The large desk he sat behind was made from a dark wood with an expertly carved mural of the goddess on the front. Large bookcases that reached all the way up the ceiling had been set into the walls on either side of the room and were made of the same wood. The contents of the bookcases drew Kal's attention more than all the decorative baubles made of gold and ivory scattered about the room. He couldn't help but wonder what kind of interesting knowledge might be hidden within those pages. Behind the priest's chair, a stained-glass window depicted the goddess in flowing white robes looking kindly down upon the people at the bottom who all appeared to be praying. The window shone as if sunlight were striking it but Kal was certain they were facing east and it was well past noon already.\n\n\"I'm doing research on some of the local myths in the area and their origins,\" replied Kal. \"I'm especially interested in the lost city of Montar which used to be where Lake Montar now sits.\"\n\nThe priest's eyes flicked to the lid of a gold box he had opened as Kal sat down. The mage suppressed a frown as he guessed it was some means of detecting lies.\n\n\"Research of Lake Montar has been going on for many years, there was no city there.\"\n\n\"I've run across some accounts that say otherwise.\" Kal watched closely as the man glanced at the box again, a scowl momentarily flitting across his expression. \"I'm of the understanding that the Montaran army met its end out on the Death Plains. I'd like to speak with the royal cartographers to see if I can figure out where that occurred.\"\n\n\"I doubt the cartographers would appreciate me sending them someone looking for an imaginary city's imaginary army lost out on the plains.\" The priest leaned forward and his expression turned cold. \"Young man, I follow the Goddess, I love her, I praise her, I live by her ideals. Listen carefully when I tell you that there was no city where Lake Montar currently is and that repeating such nonsense within these walls will get you jailed... or worse.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" said Kal, shrugging. \"That was more or less what I expected but I wanted to take the more diplomatic route first. Let me ask a more honest question, whose palms do I need to grease to access the maps I need of the Death Plains?\"\n\nThe priest sat back, \"I'm not certain if I'm insulted or impressed by your boldness. The fact is that politicians might be swayed by such offers but you won't get as far with the clergy. The vast majority of our needs are taken care of by the church. Unless the amount you are offering is exorbitant, bribery won't get you very far. However, since you are interested in the Death Plains, I'm going to send you to the Revered Mother Elden in the western cathedral. She is the priestess currently looking into a problem we've been having out there. If you are willing to assist her, then she might be willing to help you out.\"",
        "\"What makes you think I could help her?\"\n\n\"Staves are the most common form of weapon for a priest. After so many years, it's easy to tell when someone is proficient with one,\" he answered while nodding toward Kal's staff which was currently being held by a young initiate back by the door. The girl appeared to be thirteen or fourteen summers and stood up straight when she realized they were staring at her. The priest's desk had a soundproofing enchantment so he could hear people coming in but those on the far side of the room couldn't eavesdrop.\n\nKal turned back to the old man. \"I'll have to think about that. Before I go, I want to apologize for offending you earlier. The intrigue and drama among nobles gets tiresome quickly and I was trying to cut through the banter.\"\n\nThe old priest's smile returned despite the change of the color coming from the golden box. The priest let it go. The young man was earnest in his apology and the part of his words flagged as untrue, about the intrigue and drama among nobles, was certainly accurate in his eyes. \"I suspected as much from your clothes,\" he said, \"it's why you didn't find yourself being escorted out.\"\n\nThe mage smiled in return as he rose from his seat. \"Good day to you, Revered Father, and thank you for your time,\" he said with a slight bow.\n\n\"Good day to you as well young man. On your way out, tell the girl by the door to fetch my usual assistant and send her in,\" said the priest with a dismissive wave.\n\nKal did as the man asked and no sooner had the door closed behind them than the girl rounded on him.\n\n\"Did he really have you tell me to get his assistant?\" she asked tersely while handing his staff back. She didn't appear to be happy about being traded out.\n\nKal nodded and the girl rolled her eyes dramatically. Thinking he was no longer needed, the mage began to walk away only to be stopped when she darted past and stepped in front of him.\n\n\"Hold up,\" she said. With a half-smile on her lips, she gave him an appraising once-over. \"I'm going to get her, wait here until she dismisses you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Kal, he wasn't terribly comfortable with a girl so young eyeing him up like a piece of meat.\n\n\"You'll be doing her a favor,\" she replied with another half-smile before running off down the hall.\n\nOnly a couple of seconds after the teen disappeared down a connecting hallway, a buxom woman closer to his age with sandy blonde hair came walking his direction.\n\nStopping in front of him, she gave Kal a similar up and down look. While the younger girl's expression had been more of an appraisal, this woman's was filled with interest. \"I could kiss that girl,\" she said, \"this will be so much easier now.\" Noticing the staff in his hand, she asked, \"Adventurer?\"\n\nKal nodded.\n\n\"Quick question for you then. When you were talking with him, did he mention Priestess Elden?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm supposed to go see her.\"\n\n\"Be careful around her, she has some... interesting... tastes and a great deal of contempt for those who aren't soldiers, clergy, or at least from the city. If you'll pardon me, I have an old man to take care of,\" she stepped in close and rubbed a hand over the front of his pants, \"but now I have this to think about as I do it,\" she said with a sly grin.\n\nKal was slightly startled, not just with how forward she was being but also with what she implied she was about to do. \"That's allowed?\" he asked, trying hard to ignore what her hand was doing. He wasn't succeeding.\n\nThe woman giggled. \"The Goddess places no restriction upon what we can do with our bodies and even prefers that were don't allow our natural urges to build up and cloud our judgment.\"\n\n\"But he's your superior.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"It may seem like a demand, but I always have the option to decline and pass the request off to one of the other girls he calls upon. Taking care of him has its benefits, so I don't mind.\" With a final grope, she stepped back and looked him over one last time. \"You're dismissed,\" she said before entering the priest's office.\n\nHe looked down at the bulge straining against the front of his pants that was now screaming for attention.\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\n---\n\nKal wandered about the city for a little while before heading back to the inn. The mage briefly considered heading back to the market to search out the daughter he'd spent the night with, but guessed that they would be packing up for the day to get outside before the gates closed at sundown. Besides that, he still wasn't sold on the idea of inviting her into his bed just for the sake of getting his dick wet and not sleeping alone.\n\nApart from his indecision about nameless trysts, he also had another reason not go looking for the woman at the market. Checking into his room, he unlaced the bag of holding from the loop inside his trousers and threw it onto the small table.\n\n\"Ria.\"\n\n---\n\n\"He's calling me.\"\n\nSera groaned. When she awoke on the day he left, she and Ria both were expecting Kal to recall the sprite that night. The extra day had been greatly appreciated since the avatar was able to help her with the hard to reach places on her back. She also appreciated the extra company, probably more than the help with her molting.\n\n\"Will you be okay?\" asked the sprite. \"I'm sure it would be a pain for Kal, but we could get out of the city long enough for me to come back until you go to sleep.\" The sprite's outline blurred slightly, a second, fainter image of the avatar stretching off in the direction of her bag.\n\nSera shook her head. \"No, I'll be okay. By tomorrow I should have all of this done,\" the gorgon indicated the patches of old skin left on her lower arms and legs, \"and the day after all of these should be done,\" she said, pointing at her scalp. \"I'm not excited about going to sleep hungry, but there's little we can do about that now. Thank you for staying with me, Ria.\"\n\nThe sprite flew over and kissed the gorgon on the nose before vanishing.\n\nSighing heavily, Sera looked around. The tent suddenly felt much colder without the small woman's presence. She smiled as she started heading toward the restroom and the large tub inside. Time to warm things up with a nice hot bath.\n\n---\n\nOnce the sprite appeared, she took a moment to nuzzle his cheek before assuming her normal place on his shoulder. \"How is she?\" Kal asked.\n\n\"Doing well now that most of her old skin has come off. She said that the parts left are always the last and don't itch nearly the much as the rest of her body. Some of the snakes still had some spots left to go down by her scalp but, other than that, her skin is as new and smooth as a baby's.\"\n\n\"Nothing exciting the last two days then?\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't say that. Getting soaked in girlcum was pretty interesting.\"\n\n\"Say what?\"\n\nRia giggled. \"Remember what happened with her nipple?\"\n\nKal suppressed a shiver and nodded.\n\n\"Now think about what happens down there,\" she said, pointing at her crotch.\n\nKal's eyes widened, \"I guess I just thought that part wouldn't... you know... shed.\"\n\n\"And you would be very wrong, that comes off too, all the way down to the pink parts. She gets so sensitive there that she asked me to help. I managed to get her all cleaned up but then...\"\n\nKal noticed out the corner of his eye that her face had gone transparent in embarrassment. \"Then?\" he prompted.\n\n\"With everything she had gone through, I thought a little relief might be in order. Once I was done, I gave her pearl a quick rub. Let's just say, 'exploded' isn't a strong enough word. She squirted all over the place. Unfortunately, my head was in the way and she started out by shooting me in the face. Then,\" she pointed out in front of her with both hands, one over the other, then moved them in a circle with a whistling noise until her fingers had switched places, \"I wasn't flying at that moment and she bucked her hips toward me as she came. When I landed, my head was damn near inside her.\n\n\"She came so hard she passed out, then kept on cumming while she was unconscious. The poor girl was exhausted when she finally woke up. Thankfully, she wasn't upset with me for not warning her first, but that could have been because I hadn't gotten to clean up yet and she was too busy laughing. What about you, anything interesting happen?\"\n\nKal gave her a quick version of not making it to the city in time, his night with the merchant and his daughter, and meeting the guard at the inner wall as well as the priest.\n\nRia looked around, \"No daughter?\"\n\n\"I thought about it. I think I've been spoiled lately with going back home and seeing the girls then traveling with Sera. Last night was interesting and exciting, but it felt like something was missing. Besides all of that, I wasn't sure what you might think of me bringing a strange woman to bed after our conversation the other day.\"\n\nRia laughed, \"You've been given a degree of freedom from your women that most men can only dream of, take advantage of it. You're a young, handsome, intelligent, rich and powerful man. Some women will be drawn to you for nothing more than those reasons. They may have only just met you and see the traits they want in their children. Some may throw themselves at you in hopes of tying you to them. There may even be times that a woman demands that you sleep with her in return for something of value, something you are already familiar with from your experience with Silma. I truly appreciate you thinking about me, Kal, but if you are interested in a little fun with some strange woman who wants to open her legs for you, then go ahead and enjoy yourself. Also, you really don't need to take my opinions into account if you want to play around with some girl while we are out and about. You've spent more time with me than any of your women since we left Telsin. That will probably stay true until we find Ikuno. Don't cheat some girl out of a night of fun because you are worried you'll miss an opportunity with me.\"\n\n\"If it was Perra or Gerda instead of you I would make the same consideration before inviting the woman from last night into my bed.\"\n\nThe sprite flitted up in front of his face. \"Is that what I am to you now? One of your women?\"\n\nKal smiled, \"Ria... I own you. Though it's slightly different than the rest of the girls, you belong to me. Even if it was only briefly, I've been with you. Your advice has been invaluable, and I truly enjoy having you around. Unless you have some kind of objection, you are most definitely one of my women.\"\n\nRia glared at the mage, though the corner of her mouth twitched in a way that indicated she was trying not to smile. \"I may not remember them all, but I know for a fact that if the vast majority of my past masters had stated that they owned me like you just did, it would have severely pissed me off.\"\n\n\"Then... what about me,\" he said uncertainly.\n\n\"You... you treat me like a bag of holding when you need me to be one. Any other time you treat me like a friend and, lately, as a lover. At the moment, it's making me think you have too many clothes on.\"\n\nKal held his arms out. \"You are more than welcome to take them off.\"\n\nRia flitted forward and pressed her lips to his. The scene was comical until she waved at the bag behind her and a stream of tiny specs of light came floating out, stopping in the middle of the sprite's body before releasing their contents. With each mote, the avatar grew in size until she was again just slightly smaller than Kuto. At some point, her tongue pushed past his lips and she wrapped her arms around his neck. A flick of her wrist and Kal found himself nude, the specks of light that were once his clothes quickly flowing into the bag on the table.\n\nThe sprite's wings quivered as she floated up against the mage, wrapping her legs around him. Ria scooted down until she was brushing the head of his prick with her sex.\n\nPulling back, she looked up into his eyes. \"Are you sure you are ready for what comes next? I warned you about being made like a sprite, that thing I told you about riding in your pants so you can fuck me as you walk down the road will become a definite possibility.\"\n\n\"I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea of having sex with you when you are small.\"\n\n\"Less 'having sex' and more like having a cock-sleeve that moans and enjoys every second. You'll understand soon enough.\" Ria leaned back, using her natural ability to float to stay upright. She reached out and grasped the shaft of Kal's dick then guided it toward her entrance. \"Watch, Kal. We both missed this the last time.\"\n\nWhen Kal was looking, she slowly slid down over the head of his cock, the lips of her sex gripping his prick until the head finally popped inside. The sprite let out a happy gasp while a low moan escaped the mage. Damn, she was tight. Once past her lips, she became impossibly smooth inside, negating any need for a natural lubricant. That was a good thing since she couldn't produce any. It was curious being able to see a faint outline of his cock inside the woman as the avatar slid further down his shaft.\n\nAs she took him all the way inside her, she looked up at him. \"Watch me,\" she whispered. Kal was confused for a second since they were the only two in the room but quickly dismissed the thought. \"Watch me fuck you, Kal. I've been watching you for more than a year now. This time I want you to watch me.\"\n\nHe was momentarily reminded that her wings were for little more than decoration. She leaned back until she was sticking straight out from his waist and began moving back and forth while roughly kneading her breasts. Any time his eyes strayed from where they were joined or what her hands were doing to her chest, she would beg him to watch her. He certainly didn't mind doing as she asked, seeing his cock disappear into her glowing body over and over looked amazing and felt just as good.\n\nFor a long while, Kal was passive as the sprite's movements very gradually gained speed. He held out until his need reached its peak before grasping her hips and pulling her back onto his prick. Ria squeaked with surprise and delight as he picked up the pace but then focused on making herself even tighter for him, which did wonders for her as well.\n\nA few seconds of rough thrusting and the sprite threw her head back in a silent scream, her fingers viscously pulling at her nipples as she found her release.\n\nKal smiled, she was the only woman he'd been with who got looser as she came, her form was based on a mental image and orgasm kept her from focusing on staying tight. He didn't mind because that meant he could pound into her as fast as possible, ramping up her climax until a second hit her before the first faded. The mage relented after that, slowing his pace to allow her to recover.\n\nUnlike living creatures, recovery for the avatar was extremely quick and only a few seconds passed before she looked up at him. \"Did you watch me?\"\n\n\"I did, and you were beautiful.\"\n\n\"Now you. I want to watch you cum in me.\"\n\n\"With pleas...ure?\" Thinking that she was going to watch his face as she had been, Kal was confused when she partially sat up and looked down where they were joined. Following her gaze, he saw that the area just above her sex had become transparent. The walls of her pussy showed up as a light gray outline around his prick and he gave a couple of experimental thrusts. Yup, that was definitely his dick in there. What was odd was the lack of anything else. The channel he was in continued up into the parts of her body that were still opaque.\n\n\"Does that...\"\n\n\"Yes, all the way up to my mouth. I'll explain later but now I need you to cum in me.\"\n\nKal nodded and began thrusting into her again, only taking a couple of slower strokes before setting a driving pace that was sure to grant the sprite's wish soon.\n\nRia nearly missed it as she threw her head back and climaxed again, she'd barely recovered before he drove into her a handful of times and held himself tight against her sex. The mage only just managed to keep an eye open as he rode out his orgasm. He had to admit, actually seeing his seed shooting into the sprite was very different and he was surprised how much he enjoyed it.\n\nThe avatar found the sight to be nearly orgasmic when combined with the feeling of him inside her and the way he was grinding himself against her clit.\n\nRia's body pulsed.\n\nKal was still looking down when it happened and noticed immediately that some of his seed appeared to be missing. Her body pulsed a second time, and she was now clean of any trace of their lovemaking.\n\n\"Ria\u2014\" His question was interrupted by a long wail of pleasure as the sprite threw her head back as another unexpected orgasm washed over her.\n\nIt took her much longer to recover this time. When she finally regained her senses, she sat up and held him close, her eyes wide and showing a hint of fear.\n\n\"Any idea what just happened?\" asked Kal.\n\nRia looked up at him. \"Nope.\"\n\n\"Was it good?\"\n\n\"No, it was amazing,\" she said with awe.\n\n\"Everything I put into you disappeared when your body flashed.\"\n\nShe looked down, her lower abdomen was still transparent and, as Kal said, there was nothing inside her. She was a little disappointed, the sight had been extremely arousing. \"Did I absorb it?\"\n\n\"It looks that way, do you think there's any harm in it?\"\n\n\"Not that I can tell, I don't feel any different at least. You don't think I took some of your lifeforce, do you?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't see anything like that when your body\u2014\"\n\nKal was interrupted by loud footsteps in the hall followed by banging on the door. \"Miss?! Miss?! Are you alright in there?!\" came a female voice from the other side.\n\nKal shook his head and chuckled, wondering why it was always a woman who came to check on them in these situations.\n\n\"I'm just fine dear,\" Ria called out. \"Things were feeling a little too good and I couldn't keep quiet.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. \"You two are having sex?! I thought someone was getting murdered!\"\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" said Kal, loud enough for them to hear him clearly.\n\nA gruff, male voice came through the door next. \"Put her face in a pillow the rest of your stay would ya? I don't need my wife runnin' up here every few hours because of your shenanigans.\"\n\nKal and Ria were looking at each other, both of them trying hard to keep a straight face. \"Will do sir!\" the mage called out. They listened as the innkeeper and his wife walked away before bursting out in a fit of laughter.\n\nOnce they'd settled down, Kal slid out of the sprite with a groan.\n\n\"Kal?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nRia fidgeted in front of him, her face turning clear with her form of blushing. \"I know that you can't claim me or bond me like Ikuno and the rest. But I was wondering, since you consider me one of your women, if you would do something like that with me?\" \n\nHe wasn't certain exactly what she was asking. \"As in... an initiation?\"\n\nThe sprite nodded.\n\nGrinning wide, Kal walked over to the bed and grabbed one of the pillows off it before tossing it at the floating, winged woman. \"You're going to need that.\""
