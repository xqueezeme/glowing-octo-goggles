        "John's POV \n\nI climbed up the ladder, feeling bad about leaving her alone. I could hear Sven talking, so I followed the sound to the dining room where he was sitting at the table. \"Alpha Stan,\" I said as I spotted him at the table. \"Betas Peter and Abigail, I did not expect to see you up here.\" \n\n\"This is where the action is, John. I understand your mate helped out a bit.\" \n\n\"She did, Abigail. She's passed out downstairs, I was hoping I could get someone to sit with her in the safe room, just in case she wakes up.\" \n\nAbigail stood and smiled. \"I'd be happy to stay with her, John. My mate can keep me linked in so I don't miss anything.\" She came over and gave me a hug, then kissed my cheek. \"Congratulations on your mating. We'll have a proper party when the time is right.\" \n\n\"I'd like that.\" \n\n\"We'll host, of course, as we consider Jessie to be a member of our Pack. Now get in there and figure out how to get Linnea back.\" \n\nShe walked down the hallway and I took her place at the table. A large map dominated the table, with lines marking the search area. \"How bad is it?\" \n\n\"Even with the help, and allowing for some margin in direction, there's hundreds of square miles to search. All that is assuming they are between here and Duluth, but it's also possible they went farther south into Wisconsin. It's a lot of land to try and cover by scent,\" Sven said. \n\n\"It's getting dark,\" I said. \"Looking for a green deck and white cabins isn't going to happen at night.\" I looked up with an idea. \"Aircraft. Rent a plane or a helicopter, fly them along this path with a few Pack members in there. We know we're looking for a pattern of three on the west side of a lake.\" \n\n\"I'll set it up,\" Stan said. \"There has to be a place out of Duluth, if not I'll get someone out of the cities.\" \n\n\"I don't care if you have to buy the fucking plane, I've got the cash to do it,\" I said. \"Jessie and I kept some of the money from Yuri's reward in an account here, not all of it went to Patrick.\" \n\nSven laughed a little. \"Hell, I'll buy a helicopter, it could come in handy. No matter, just get some people in the air.\" He looked out the window. \"Anything we can do in the meantime?\" \n\n\"Google Earth,\" Peter said. \"We'll get every person not on patrol or sleeping to start searching the satellite images along the way, looking for a pattern of three identical cabins on the west side of a lake. Any hits, we pass along to the guys out looking. Instead of driving around with the windows down, let's find them some targets they can go check out.\" \n\nIt was a solid plan. \"I'm sure they'd rather do that,\" I said. \"Who do we have available?\" \n\n\"I've got most of my Pack up in Alpha Pine's pack, sitting around wishing they could help. I'll get them on this right away.\" He pulled out his phone and went to make a call. \n\nPeter looked at the map and drew a line. \"Tell them we'll look everywhere south of County 52 with our Pack.\" He got on his phone and called Luna Larissa to set it up. \n\nWe spent another hour poring over maps before I gave up. \"Gents, I'm going to go rest with my mate. Wake me if we get any good leads.\" I went back down to the safe room, where Abigail smiled at me. \n\n\"She hasn't moved, but she seems to be resting comfortably,\" she said. \n\n\"Thank you. And thank you for the Google Earth idea.\" She looked up, surprised. \"I know it was you, Peter can barely operate his phone, much less understand what is available on the computers. You need to smack him for taking credit for your idea. I could tell when I first met you two that you were the brains behind the operation.\" \n\nShe laughed. \"Well, he brings the brawn and a couple other things to the table, so I'll keep him. Keep close to her, you know mates can help each other recover.\" She climbed out of the safe room, and I removed my clothes and tucked into the bed. I rolled her so she was tucked into my side, then fell asleep. \n\nI woke to Jessie moving her hand over my chest, I rumbled low in my chest in pleasure as I pulled her close. \"You're back,\" I whispered. \n\n\"How long have I been out?\" She rolled off me and sat up. \n\nI looked at my clock. \"It's six twenty, so about twelve hours. You must be hungry.\" \n\n\"Yeah, and I need to use the bathroom.\" She turned on the lights and looked at the composting toilet int the tiny bathroom. \"Not THIS bathroom.\" \n\nI laughed as we both pulled our clothes on, then she went up the ladder ahead of me. \"Are you feeling all right?\" \n\n\"I'm tired, John, but I'll be fine with a big breakfast.\" I watched her climb out, then joined her in the closet. I took her hand and led her into the kitchen. \"Any progress?\" \n\nSven looked up and smiled. \"She's back,\" he said as he got out of his chair and pulled her into a hug. \"Thank you for... for what you did.\" \n\n\"Do we have a location?\" \n\n\"Not yet, but we have a list of possibles. Our men are checking them out one by one. It's a lot more than we knew before.\" \n\nI moved over to the kitchen, Sven had clearly been up all night. Allison was busy making a huge pan of bacon. \"Anything I can help with?\" \n\n\"Pancakes,\" she said. \"Mix is there, griddle is heated up.\" I started pouring it out and grabbed a spatula. \"Stan is sleeping, and Peter drove down to run one of the teams that is checking out the possible hideouts. Since we know they have at least five wolves there, we didn't want search teams of less than twelve, even if it takes longer.\" \n\nI nodded. \"Makes sense, we've already lost three men to these guys. Have you been up all night?\" \n\n\"I got a couple hours in earlier. We'll sleep after six tonight,\" she said. The two of us worked through the breakfast quickly while Jessie set the table and poured drinks. Stan showed up as we were serving, looking like he'd been up half the night. \"Eat up, boys, lunch may not be happening.\" \n\nWe had made a bunch of food and we ate it just as fast. We had three dozen possible locations identified by satellite, and we had a helicopter and a small aircraft coming out of Duluth this morning to continue the search. We only had three search teams of twelve men each, and they had to approach each target carefully. We were hoping the airborne view would help us sort them out. \n\nAs the morning went on to noon and still no luck, tensions were rising. If we didn't find her soon, it would be too late. \"What happens when you don't produce me or the money,\" Jessie finally asked. \n\n\"I hope they don't figure it out until I've killed their leader,\" Sven said. \"I just wish I could take out that fucking alpha.\" \n\n\"Cops are doing a good job getting him to hide,\" I said. We'd been watching the news in the background, the Russian authorities were still trying to figure out how he escaped, and a nationwide manhunt was underway. There were lots of photos of masked police officers standing in front of drugs, guns, stolen merchandise and what really pissed me off, young women freed from sex slavery. \"I don't know if I'd rather have him captured by the police or the European Council.\" \n\n\"I think Yuri would prefer either one to the Sicilians,\" Stan said. \"With no money from us and his illegal operations under pressure, he's not going to make the interest payments. They'll cut their hundred million out of his ass a nickel at a time. The cops would just lock him up, and the Council would give him a quick death.\" \n\n\"So what happens to your Pack?\" Jessie wasn't going to let it go. \n\n\"My Beta is taking over defense plans. We've had reinforcements arriving quietly all morning from allied Packs. This is bigger than just us now,\" Sven said. \"We got information from a rogue who works with us sometimes that the Russians are offering good money for a day of mercenary work, plus a cut of the spoils. He's building an army out there, and so are we. I'll have a hundred warriors from allied Packs here by three. Snipers, explosives experts, whatever my friends can spare.\" \n\n\"You have me as well,\" Jessie said. \n\n\"No, you're going to be down in the safe room. We can't risk you in battle,\" I said, instinctively standing in front of him. \n\n\"I'm not going to hide underground while my family and friends are getting killed, either. I'm an Alpha, but more than that, I'm a witch. I bring talents to the table no one else has, and I can fight in a way people don't get hurt.\" \n\n\"You could pass out, Jessie. It's happened before, it just happened last night!\" \n\nShe stared me down. \"Then you will be by my side to take me to the safe room when I can't fight any more, but by God I will not hide while my friends are dying! You got that?\" The dominance her wolf was putting out was high, and I knew she was right. My wolf and I just didn't like it. \n\n\"I got it. You fight by my side, though, we stay together.\" I pulled her into my side, my wolf and I united in wanting to keep her safe. \n\nPeter's POV \n\n\"Beta, I've got confirmed werewolves in the compound. The cabins are just like she described, all the same with green painted decks facing the water. I can scent at least five, plus Luna Linnea.\" \n\n\"Stay back and downwind, I'm calling this in and then we will get set for the rescue.\" Finally. We were parked a mile away from the lake cabins we had identified, and my patrol up the south side of the lake had borne fruit. The wind was out of the north today, the wind cold and the sky a robin's egg blue. I pulled out my cellphone and dialed my Alpha. \n\nHe answered on the fourth ring, a little groggy. \"Peter?\" \n\n\"Yes, Alpha Stan. We found them.\" The phone dropped, then he picked it up. \"You there?\" \n\n\"Yeah. I was napping, give me a second and I'll put you on speaker.\" I heard the phone being set down. \"Go ahead, Peter.\" \n\n\"We're at the cabins identified on Caribou Lake, east of Twig. Our scouts have positive scent on five plus wolves plus Luna Linnea.\" I could hear paper shuffling and keystrokes. \"We have a good surveillance position downwind of the cabins.\" \n\n\"How many men do you have,\" Sven asked. \n\n\"Twelve of us total.\" \n\n\"Peter, I'm going to send you the other team we sent up. They are up by Shaw, so they should be there in an hour or less. Stay back, but don't let anyone leave. If you have to go, go.\" \n\n\"Beta, I have full confidence in you and your team. You're our best chance to get her back alive, so if you have to move, do it without hesitation,\" Sven said. \"May Luna guide your steps.\" \n\n\"Thank you, Alpha, we'll do our best.\" I ended the call and gathered my men around my computer, where I had a map pulled up. The guys had unwittingly set themselves in a poor defensive location, probably not expecting a fight. They were on the west side of the lake, but it was only a few hundred yards before the shoreline turned almost due west for a couple of miles. The lake ice was thin, not able to support an adult werewolf, and still had a lot of open water. I marked positions I wanted my men, covering the access roads to the cabins and homes along this side of the lake. My plan was simple; set men to prevent an escape, get a bunch of men as close as we could without detection, then attack quickly and without mercy. \n\nMy men were in position and waiting, most in human form and still in vehicles, but four hidden in the woods in wolf form. We were using spotting scopes to keep an eye on the cabins. It looked like only the center one was being used, and there was one man walking around outside. He was staying close to the cabin and seemed more interested in smoking and staying out of the wind than security. \n\nAn hour later, the other squad arrived along with a surprise. \"Alpha Sven... what are you doing here?\" \n\n\"I brought the helicopter, and I needed to be here for my mate,\" he said. \"Any changes?\" \n\n\"No sir, it's quiet.\" \n\n\"Beta, we've got a car and a panel van approaching from the west, two minutes out. They have guns visible and I have eyes on four, there could be more.\" \n\n\"No time to wait. Snipers, take them out as soon as you have a shot. Attack teams, GO GO GO.\" I told two of my men to escort the Alpha to the cabin while I drove my Expedition to intercept. The driver of the next car was right behind me; we pulled in front of the road leading to the cabin, just around the corner they would have to make to follow the lakeshore as it turned south. I had men take cover in the trees on both sides, while the rest of us took cover behind the big SUV's. I could hear howls, gunshots and screams from the cabin behind me and the road to my left. \n\nThe lead truck took the turn at speed, the driver fighting a skid as the front right tire had been shot out. We opened up on him, my rifle slamming into my shoulder as the .308 round was sent into the windshield. I saw the blood explode from the back of the driver's head, and the car went off the road to the right and hit a tree. My men followed it in, a few shots later it was over. \"Where's the panel van?\" \n\n\"We took it out, all secure.\" \n\n\"Car's secure, falling back to the cabin. Status?\" \n\n\"We're in a standoff, Beta.\" I jumped into the Expedition, turning around and stopping by the driveway. I ran up to the cabin with my pistol out, joining the others, just as a man came out with a knife to Linnea's throat. \n\nCh. 55 \n\nAlpha Sven's POV \n\nBeta Peter had already given the order to attack, then he waved for me to join while he ran for the cars. \"What's going on,\" I asked the warriors flanking me as we ran at full speed towards the cabin. My escorts were in wolf form, one huge silver-grey wolf and a smaller white and grey wolf. \n\n\"Two hostile vehicles approaching so he had to move now,\" the man said as we made the turn into the driveway from the road. Wolves were swarming the cabin, jumping through windows and crashing through doors. A werewolf tried to run, but one man was biting his rear leg while another jumped for his neck. They had him beat, but he kept struggling and his throat was torn out. We ran around to the front where I could still hear shouting. As I rounded the corner, I saw something that made my blood run cold. \n\nMy mate, my Linnea, was being dragged out of the house in the arms of a huge man. She was helpless, her legs chained, and her hands bound behind her back. A large knife was at her throat and it was already cutting in as he moved her. A thin line of blood ran down to her chest where it was absorbed by her blouse. I dropped to my knees, we weren't fast enough. \n\n\"Let her go,\" Peter said. \"You're surrounded, your men are dead. If you release her, we will turn you over to the American Council where you will get a trial and a chance.\" \n\nHe laughed as me pushed her forward to the edge of the deck. \"Foolish Americans. You think I fear you? Fear dying? The only one I fear is Yuri.\" He glared at me. \"If you don't want your mate to die, back off now. We're taking a car, and if anyone tries to follow us I'll kill her.\" \n\nI looked over at Peter, he was frustrated. All these men, and he had nothing. If one of his men had a clear shot, now was the time to take it. When he lifted his hands and started to back off, I knew he didn't. \"Back off,\" he ordered. His men backed away from the lake, retreating with us towards the south. \n\nHe was so busy staring at Peter that he didn't see what was happening. A mist started to rise from the lake, forming a trail as it came up to the deck behind him. The mist moved until it covered the knife, and there I saw ice starting to form. It only took a few seconds before the knife was encased in a block of solid ice and the mist was moving to his hand. \n\nHe looked down in shock as his hand cooled and ice formed around it. He pulled the knife back, trying to cut her neck but only the edge was still exposed, and it barely cut her skin. I ran forward, Peter reacting at the same time, and we crashed into them. I pulled Linnea out of his arms and rolled away, letting my body take the impact with the deck and the cabin. When I looked up, Peter was crouched, facing off against the large Russian who now had an ice club for his left hand. \n\nWe watched in fascination as the mist grew in intensity, now swirling around his feet as he swung the ice-covered knife against the cabin wall to try and break it. He looked down, his feet were frozen to the deck, the ice holding him fast as he struggled. \"WHAT IS THIS?\" \n\nBeta Peter stepped back, watching him get more and more frustrated as the ice held him fast. \"Where is Beta Shura?\" \n\n\"Fuck you.\" I watched fascinated as the mist changed; looking back to the lake, I could see ice blocks forming in the water. Once they became the size and shape of bricks, they floated up to the deck and started placing themselves around his feet. He bent down, trying to stop them, but as soon as they were in place they fused themselves to the others, making a solid wall of ice blocks up to his shins. \"What sorcery is this?\" \n\nPeter just smiled. \"The kind you can't fight. We need information, and you have it.\" More bricks flew up from the lake, the box-like structure was now up to his knees. With one good hand and his feet frozen in place, he couldn't stop them from building the wall higher. \"You will die if you don't tell us, but there are different ways to die. There are the deaths of a warrior, a death you chose not to take and you do not deserve. There are clean, painless deaths, and then there is what awaits you.\" \n\nHe tried beating his club hand against the outside of the wall which was now to his thighs, succeeding only in breaking his arm just above the ice line. He screamed in pain as it hung at an angle; it was useless at his side now. The ice blocks continued to stack and fuse together, now enclosing the knife. \"I'll never tell.\" \n\n\"Perhaps. And perhaps as this ice coffin closes above you, as we watch you struggle to breathe through the clear ice, perhaps then you will regret not speaking while you had the chance. Being buried alive is a bad way to go. Being buried in ice? The air just on the other side, you can see the sun and watch the wind blow the snow the whole time? All of us watching you struggle? That is going to be a bad death for you, but a fitting death for a man who hides behind a woman instead of fighting like a warrior.\" The blocks continued to fly in and stack themselves, now it was up to his waist. \n\n\"Wait,\" I said. The bricks stopped flying, hovering in the air. \"Restrain his arm.\" A few men moved forward, grabbing his arm and pinning it behind him. \"Get the keys.\" One reached into his pocket, pulling out a key ring. He brought it over, and I unlocked the silver handcuffs from Linnea's wrists, then unlocked the padlock that held the chain on her legs. \"Put them on him.\" \n\nHe tossed the chain to one of his men, who put it around his legs. He then put on gloves and picked up the silver-coated cuffs. They didn't bother with his broken arm, the ice covering his hand and the knife had already fused with the bricks and it wasn't going anywhere. His remaining wrist was secured to the chain now locked around his waist. I stood Linnea up, holding her shivering body to my side. \"Proceed,\" I said, and the blocks started flying in again. \n\n\"We know Shura is building an army.\" The man shook his head no, the bricks continued to stack. \n\n\"Tell us where Shura is, and where the rest of the men are. You've already lost, have you not heard the news from back home?\" Peter grinned as he saw the man had no idea. \n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"Here, I'll show you.\" Peter pulled out his phone and brought up the story on the Russian media. Walking up to the now-helpless man, he let him read for himself about Yuri's empire being raided, his Alpha now a wanted fugitive. \"If Yuri pokes his head out, he goes to jail, and the Sicilians or his many enemies kill him. If the European Council gets him, he gets executed. It's over. You're going to die a horrible death for a man who is already a dead man walking. Many more of your friends are going to die if I can't stop this now.\" ",
        "\"You'll all die as well.\" \n\n\"I don't think so. Do you think Shura was the only person to bring in reinforcements? I have almost two hundred trained warriors back home, waiting for an attack. I have electronic surveillance, booby traps, explosives, snipers, wolfsbane gas bombs, reinforced fighting positions and air support. When your boss attacks, he is going to lose, and lose badly. All of your friends will die, and for what? Money? Ego? Pride?\" \n\nThe wall was up to his shoulders now. \"You know better than this. Kidnapping a pregnant Luna and threatening to kill her? What would your mother think if she knew what you had done?\" \n\n\"Leave my mother out of this!\" \n\nI looked at the mark on his shoulder. \"Your own mate, what do you think she will be thinking of when she sees the video of your death at the trials? Will she think you are a good wolf, a good mate? Or will she wonder why Luna hated her so much as to give her a mate like you?\" The bricks were stacking to his eyes now, they were wide with fear. \"You don't have much time left. The bricks are almost done.\" \n\nHe looked out to the water, where the last bricks were forming. They stacked above his head, and soon would close his frozen sarcophagus airtight. \"Last chance.\" He looked up in horror at the only spot left. \n\nThe last brick moved down towards the opening. \n\n\"WAIT!\" The brick froze inches above the others. \"He's in Grand Rapids, at a hotel,\" he said. \"Country Inn and Suites, room 287. He's got the whole place rented out for his men and the rogues he's hired.\" \n\n\"What is his plan?\" \n\n\"I don't know much. He said I was to bring her to the south border of your land at six tonight, that he would meet us there for the transfer. He was going to use the transfer as a distraction, the men would attack as soon as he had the money and the body.\" \n\n\"Anything else?\" He shook his head no. Peter looked at me, I nodded and tapped the shoulder of the white and silver wolf by my side. The ice wall shattered around him, falling to the ground. \"Tie him up good and stuff him in the back of my car,\" he said. \n\nThe wolves left my side, and she walked around the group of warriors, healing the wounds that they had. None were serious, the men were good fighters and had the element of surprise. In a few minutes, they were back at my side. \n\nBeta Peter came up and stood before me. \"Orders, sir?\" \n\n\"Put him in the cells back home, and clean up the mess here,\" I said. I handed him a stack of cash. \"Take the men out for a good meal, you've earned it. When you are done, stage yourself ten miles south of my border and out of sight. I'm taking the Luna home.\" The men cheered as we walked off, and you couldn't fit a piece of paper between us until we got to the helicopter and buckled in. \n\nThere were only three seats, so Beta John shifted and pulled on clothes before buckling in, and the silver-grey wolf sat on the floor in back between our feet. We all put on headsets t block the sound, with a microphone that was voice-activated so we could talk to each other. The pilot was on a different channel, so we could speak freely. I looked down at the young shewolf and smiled. \"Thank you Jessie, I'm glad you talked me in to letting you come, even if it was only for healing the wounded after the fight.\" \n\nShe chuffed and licked my hand. Linnea started scratching her ears as we took off and headed back north. \"I was strong, and you DID come for me,\" she said over the noise of the engines. \"How?\" \n\n\"Jessie unlocked more of her power, she was able to locate you and send an astral projection,\" John replied. \"You heard what she said?\" \n\n\"Yes, and I needed to hear that, I was giving up hope,\" she said as her free hand covered her belly. \"What now?\" \n\n\"We'll have to talk about that. We know where Shura is, but they will have already left Grand Rapids by the time I can get any men there, and I don't want this fight to happen around humans.\" \n\n\"He's going to figure out we got Linnea back at some point before six, and then he's lost his leverage. His only option will be to attack us and try to at least get the money.\" \n\n\"We'll be ready for him then.\" I looked out over the frozen ground as we flew north. This ends today. \n\nCh. 56 \n\nJessie's POV \n\nI was so relieved when he cracked, as I was about to kill a man who was helpless. Watching a man slowly suffocate in a coffin of my construction was not my idea of a good afternoon. \n\nStill, I did what I had to, and John was right- he wasn't willing to die for Yuri. Now we knew the direction he was coming from and when. The question on the table right now was what to do about it. \n\nI was sitting on John's lap in the Alpha's office, with his Beta, Alpha Stan, Beta Peter and the Betas of the Packs who had come to help. All of us were looking at the map of the territory. \"His weakness is the use of mercenaries,\" John said. \"Shura doesn't have many men left, not now. He's leading rogues and opportunistic Packs that are hungry for money and territory. If we can sow doubt in their minds, they'll go home.\" He used a laser pointer to highlight the western border. \"Put signs up saying things like, 'We know you are coming' or 'Dying ain't much of a living.'\" \n\n\"Really? Outlaw Josey Wales quotes?\" Sven laughed at it. \n\n\"It's a classic line, and it's effective. Break their morale and limit casualties.\" \n\nSven stood up, going over to the map. \"I don't want to limit casualties.\" I looked up at him, a little shocked. \"Shura is doing us a favor. He's attracted every lowlife, every dangerous rogue and desperate Alpha in one place. We fight them now and the problem is gone; we let them scatter, and they remain a threat for when we AREN'T ready for them.\" He tapped the map. \"How long will it be before rumors start about the wealth of our Pack, or of your mate, John? How many times will she be almost killed before they finally finish the job?\" \n\nI put my hand over my mouth, my gut was twisting and churning. \"I'll protect her,\" John said. \n\n\"Really? How did that work the last time.\" John growled, pulling me closer. \"You have to be right every time, they only have to do the job right once. Sniper, poison, auto accident, explosion- so many ways you could lose her, just like I almost lost my Linnea. I'm not taking a chance on losing her again. This ends today.\" \n\nI ran for the bathroom attached to his office, not even closing the door before I was throwing up in the toilet. John was behind me, holding my hair out of my face as I heaved my guts into the bowl. When it was finally over, he handed me a glass of water. I rinsed my mouth a few times, spitting into the bowl as I flushed. \"There's new toothbrushes in the medicine cabinet,\" Sven said as I stood up. I grabbed one out of the package and quickly brushed my teeth. \n\n\"You all right, honey?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I think so. It's just nerves.\" He led me back to the chair and we sat down again. \n\n\"I have to agree with Alpha Sven,\" Stan said. \"Yuri's a monster, like an octopus with tentacles. The cops have lopped off a few, the European Council will take some more, but there's a dangerous tentacle right here and we need to chop it off before it goes elsewhere.\" \n\n\"We need to capture Shura for the American Council, along with as many of his men as possible,\" Peter said. \"We need to keep the pressure on Yuri and deliver him to trial. Killing them is easy, capturing their leader is not. He won't be at the front, he'll be leading from the rear I bet.\" \n\nStan stood up. \"Sven, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to back you up in the South. My men can monitor Shura and his men with drones, then swoop in on them after they leave. I'd like Peter to be in charge of cleanup on the west side. You've got to be here, in the command center with your Pack directing the defense of your territory.\" \n\n\"I have to be down south for the meeting.\" \n\n\"No you don't. Shura is just going to kill you if you are there. He doesn't have Linnea, and you don't have Jessie or his money. How long do you think it is going to be until he figures out that detail and just attacks?\" He was right, I thought. \"You'll have John and Jessie here to link with Peter and I. He won't attack until you refuse to pay.\" \n\nSven looked over at the allied Beta. \"Nobody escapes, Peter.\" \n\nPeter just nodded. \"Of course. No second chances for those who would kill our men and rape our women. These rogues are savages.\" They spent a few more minutes going over the plans, then Stan and Peter left to meet their men. They would each take charge of one of their groups of warriors, and were going to stage on the southwest and northwest corners of the territory. When they got word the attack was in progress, they would sweep down and cut off the retreat. \n\nWhile they were gone, the explosives experts from one of the allied Packs was setting up shop along the paths from the western border. The boys had Claymores, more gas bombs, and mines. One of the men was in the control room to coordinate with Sven's pack, while the others were stationed in defensive positions with the remote detonators. It was going to be loud. \n\nJust after three, Alpha Sven got a call. \"Do you have my money and Jessie?\" \n\n\"I do. Where can we meet.\" \n\n\"At the south end of your territory, where County Road 796 crosses the Embarrass River. Bring no more than one vehicle, just you and one other, and have Jessi's body in a crate or something, ready to travel.\" \n\n\"What about Linnea?\" \n\n\"She will be brought it once you've delivered,\" he said. \n\nI growled lowly. \"How do I know I can trust you,\" I said. \n\n\"You can't, but you don't have a choice here, Sven. Do what I tell you and you can have your mate back. Don't be stupid.\" \n\n\"Six o'clock at 796 and the Embarrass River, one vehicle, one other person, be ready to transfer Jessie and the money. Anything else?\" \n\n\"It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway. Any cops, patrols, or other werewolves around and I'll kill her while you watch.\" He hung up. \n\n\"Did you trace it?\" \n\nMy tech guy nodded. \"Burner phone. Cell tower was thirty miles east of Grand Rapids. They are on the way.\" \n\nI looked at my watch. \"Time to get everyone in position then.\" \n\nBeta Shura's POV \n\nOur convoy was moving rapidly east towards Sven's territory, avoiding the other Packs along the way. I was getting pissed off; my man holding Linnea hadn't responded to my calls or texts, and we were running out of time. I was certain Sven would insist on talking or seeing her before he would pay, and they better be at the rendezvous point we'd set up in Embarrass by five thirty. \n\nMy plan was pretty simple; we would distract them with the transfer on the south side of the territory, with me bringing three dozen warriors in a show of force. We'd be obvious, and Sven would have to bring his warriors forward to back him up. As soon as the transfer was done, we'd let Sven start to head back with his mate and then we would attack from the north and south sides at once. \n\nMost of my men turned north as we approached, while six vehicles led by me continued to Embarrass. We stopped at the McDonalds there, waiting in the parking lot for my men. He still wasn't answering the phone, and by 5:45 I didn't have time to wait. \"Do you think Sven found her?\" \n\n\"I don't know. This is going to go bad very quickly.\" I got on the phone and talked to my Theta, who was leading the invasion force from the north. \"We don't have the Luna, and Sven may know that,\" \n\n\"What do you want us to do?\" \n\n\"Set up on the border at six, and go on my signal.\" \n\n\"It shall be done, Beta Shura.\" I changed my plan, and soon we were arrayed in a line facing the Embarrass River from the south. I made sure my men's vehicles were pointed towards the Vermillion Pack territory, and everyone had weapons at the ready. \n\n\"A vehicle is coming,\" my scout linked. I got out of the SUV, standing in front of my warriors as they took stations next to their vehicles. A Jeep was driving down the road, it was an open-top model and I could see a big cooler in the back. It stopped just short of the bridge, and I watched as Sven got out with a younger man, obviously a bodyguard. They walked around to the back of the Jeep as I walked up, lifting the cooler and carrying it forward. They set it in the center of the bridge and walked off. \"Is that Miss Donato?\" \n\n\"It is,\" Sven said. \"Now show me Linnea.\" Good, he didn't have him. \n\n\"Not until I verify.\" I walked up to the cooler, guards on each side. I had my cellphone open in my hand, ready to send the text message to my Theta to start the attack. Sven had backed up to the front of his Jeep and was typing something on an iPad. \"Open it,\" I told my man when we were near it. \n\n\"Yes sir,\" he said, and he unlatched it at both ends and opened the lid. As soon as it opened, there was a flash, and white gas came shooting out under pressure. I turned to run, but this stuff was a white cloud that surrounded and choked me. \"Wolfsbane gas,\" I warned as I tried to escape. I pressed SEND on my phone, dropping it as my strength left me. The world started to spin, and the last thing I remembered was looking at the blue sky as the white gas blew over. \n\nAlpha Sven's POV \n\nWe watched the transfer in the bunker under the Pack House, where the security command was set up. The two men who were in the Jeep were volunteers, both unmated, and close friends of the men Shura had killed. They wanted to avenge their brothers, and I let them, with a little help from Jessie. \n\nBill was spelled to look like me, and they were off. \"How long can you hold the illusion,\" I asked Jessie. \n\n\"A few hours, as long as I don't get too distracted,\" she said. We went back to watching the screen, as the Jeep stopped. Shura's men, it looked like at least twenty in six vehicles, were spread out along the south end. \"John, does Stan have the drone up?\" \n\nJohn linked for a minute, then nodded. \"Drone is live, and they are ready a few miles south.\" \n\nMy men were a mile back from the line so they wouldn't be scented. \"I hope they go for this,\" I said nervously. \n\n\"We'll find out in a minute,\" Jessie replied. My men placed the cooler on the bridge, then backed up to the Jeep. They had portable air packs and weapons right next to the doors, in bags that would hide them from view. We'd gone with the Jeep so there wouldn't be doors in the way. I watched as Shura walked up with his men. \n\n\"Jessie, if they set it off, drop the illusion,\" I said. \"He needs to be in his own form to fight.\" \n\n\"I'm ready,\" she replied. We watched the lid open, the gas went off, and my men grabbed their masks and rifles as Shura and his men scrambled to escape the cloud. We had included a smoke bomb with the Wolfsbane gas, so the cloud prevented his men from seeing our men coming fast. My two guys were sitting in the Jeep, masks on, and firing through rifles with infrared-sensing scopes that could see through the fog. It was a turkey shoot, men were dropping left and right and Stan's men were still a few minutes out. \n\n\"BREACH ON THE NORTH BORDER, DOZENS OF THEM,\" one of my men shouted. I looked at the screen and my gut fell. \n\nThey were supposed to attack from the west. \n\nCh. 57 \n\nAlpha Sven's POV \n\n\"Attack coming from the north, shift to planned defensive positions, and get those suicide jockeys to grab as much as they can and set up in the choke points! Fourteen minutes to the Pack House,\" I sent to all my Pack members. The allied Pack members all had one of my warriors with them, so they would relay the word. John was linking with Alpha Stan, who was sweeping in to clean up what was left of Shura's team in the south. \n\nJessie was looking between me and the screens, watching the wolves pour across the border like water. The ones in front were fast, while the ones farther back carried packs loaded with weapons. \"I thought the northern border was safe because it was on Alpha Pine's land.\" \n\n\"I did too. Call him and make sure he know, he's holed up with all our women and children.\" She picked up a phone and made the call while I went back to ordering defenses. \"John, get ahold of Beta Peter and tell him the bad guys snuck around him. Have him move to the northern border and start pursuit, don't give them a chance to regroup.\" \n\n\"I'm on it, Alpha.\" \n\nI looked at the screens, they were at the twelve-minute line. A large map linked with the cameras and motion sensors, showing their progress real time as they charged south. \"Alpha, I estimate over two hundred hostiles inbound,\" my controller said. \n\nThe run was long, but the terrain forced the wolves into chokepoints we had identified. My Beta was directing the defense groups, moving them into place in the positions we'd built just for this purpose. Using boulders and steel, the fighting positions had good fields of fire and allowed a small number of wolves to put a hurt on the intruders. \"How is the redeployment,\" I asked as I looked at the cameras at the forward defense points. \n\n\"We can't make the first line, not enough time with having to re-deploy from the east,\" he said. \"We're sending men to the second line, and we've already re-deployed snipers around the Pack House to face the new threat. I've sent hand and gas grenades out from our reserve stocks.\" \n\n\"Tell the explosives guys to deploy on the third line. They'll need the extra three minutes to set up.\" We used a layered strategy, with defensive positions roughly every three minutes hard run. The first set was only two minutes from being overrun, there was no time to set up. \n\n\"Already done, sir. We'll get them.\" \n\nJohn patted my hand. \"Alpha, Alpha Stan reports the southern group has been routed. He's got eight prisoners, the rest dead. Beta Shura is among the captured, he's unconscious.\" \n\nGood. \"Ask him to send any men he can spare with my men,\" I said. \"Wolf form only, loop around to the east side of the compound. We can't let them surround us.\" \n\n\"Got it, sir.\" \n\n\"Alpha, helicopter approaching fast from the north, just over the trees,\" my warrior in the second line linked. \"Is that ours?\" \n\n\"No, take it out.\" I looked at the room. \"Dammit, they brought a helicopter!\" \n\n\"Our defensive position is deep in the trees, they won't see it until it is on top of them, Alpha.\" He spoke just before the camera overlooking Line 2 Position 2, with a dozen men with rifles, showed it exploding in a huge fireball that none could survive. \"They're dropping bombs, sir!\" \n\nJessie watched the screen in horror, then ran out of the room. John raced after her. \n\nJessie's POV \n\nI couldn't sit there and watch good men die. They were helpless against the bombs being dropped from the helicopter above, and the wolves would pour through the opening without being slowed down. I ran for the stairs, ignoring John's yells for me to stop. \"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?\" \n\n\"I am leveling the playing field, my love. I'll be back.\" \n\n\"JESSIE!\" I closed the mind link as I burst through the door of the Pack House. I could hear the gunfire and explosions from the north as the defenders tried to hold back the horde. Using my levitation, I rose off the ground in human form before shooting north just above the treetops. I flew faster until the trees were a blur below me. I saw the helicopter a minute later, men hanging out of the door and readying another improvised bomb. The plastic barrel had a couple of highway flares attached to the side, and they were lighting it as the pilot banked to attack the next defensive position. \n\nI formed a fireball ahead of me, shooting it out with my thoughts. It flew towards the helicopter, growing in size as it went until it was the size of a basketball. The pilot saw it coming, banking hard right to evade it. The barrel fell out, dropping to the ground and exploding in a huge fireball as the helicopter dove for the trees. ",
        "I guided the fireball, ignoring all else until it collided with the tail of the aircraft. The fireball broke the aluminum frame, and the helicopter started to spin. The pilot had no time to react. He was already just over the treetops and slammed into a tall pine a few seconds later. It dropped straight down to the rocky ground, the remaining barrels exploding and sending a huge fireball up. \n\nI rose higher in the air, until I could see through the trees at the battle taking place below me. There were four defensive positions, three of which were still fighting. The fastest wolves were only a few hundred yards from breaking through. Some of the wolves in back, the ones with the weapons, had shifted and were pinning the defenders down while the others rushed the gap. \n\nI started to form fireballs and shoot them down, targeting the men hiding behind rocks and trees as they fired rifles at the remaining positions. The sudden attack from above caused a panic, but it didn't take long until they reacted. \n\nI could hear the rifle shots and see the flashes as more and more wolves started to target me. Putting up an invisible shield, I let myself fall until I was just above the trees, then I moved to the defensive position on the far left. The position just to its right had been taken out, and the attackers were focusing their fire here, so they could bypass the other two spots. I moved quickly through the treetops, dropping into the middle of the rock semicircle as the men fought for their lives. \"What do you need help with?\" \n\nOne of the Vermillion warriors, I think his name was Nathan, looked at me. His eyes got wide before he went back to firing his rifle. \"Slow them down, they can't get past us,\" he said. I looked at the gap, the arrowhead of running wolves was less than fifty yards away. \n\nFocusing, I called forth my ice-making powers and laid down a thin layer on the bare ground. The wind swirled as it formed, and the result would have been comical if it wasn't so serious. Thirty wolves at a full sprint suddenly looked like Bambi on a frozen pond. \n\nThe defenders focused their fire on the wolves as they slid and piled up along the trail. Dozens were cut down in the crossfire as they struggled to get back to their feet. A cheer went up as the column stopped, and the wounded attempted to retreat. \n\nI was too busy shooting fireballs through the trees at the men I could see. My efforts were not unnoticed by the attackers, who started firing heavily on our position. My shield was taking round after round off of it, the men were starting to run out of ammunition, and I could feel myself weakening. \n\nI was beginning to think that flying off like that wasn't my smartest move. I let my mental block down. \"I'm sorry, baby. I shouldn't have done that.\" \n\n\"Hold on, love. We're coming for you.\" \n\nI stopped the fireballs to conserve my remaining energy. As more and more fighters ran out of ammunition, I pulled them inside the shield I was maintaining with my dwindling energy. We could see the enemy moving forward, tree to tree, their entire force moving towards ours. They were getting farther and farther from the defensive positions to our right, and they were probably running out of ammunition as well. These groups had to reposition here quickly and didn't bring a lot of gear. \n\n\"I'm out,\" the last defender said as he tossed his AR-15 aside. \n\n\"Get in here,\" I said. Three men out of the twelve were dead, four were wounded, and all of us were helpless now. I kept the shield going over us as I heard the sounds of gunfire coming closer, the sounds of paws on the ground heralding their arrival. \n\nA powerful howl shook the trees, and a new rumble was heard from behind us. \"JOHN!\" Tears ran down my face as I watched my mate, wearing a pack laden with rifles and full magazines, leading a group of dozens of warriors towards us. He leaped over the rocks at the back of our fighting position, shifting as he landed and coming to a stop. \"You came...\" \n\n\"Load up,\" he told the men as he tossed them full thirty-round magazines. They each grabbed a couple and loaded their rifles, taking positions back at the front of the fighting post. The men with him filled in the line, and the tide of battle shifted with them. \n\nI looked across, more men had poured into the vacant position to close the breach, and a few brought ammunition and men to the other two positions. The attackers had been repelled and were now trying to fight their way out of the kill zone that had reformed in front of them. The men who had come in were skilled and fresh, and they exacted a heavy toll on the remaining wolves. The attackers didn't have the rifles or the volume of ammunition to get into a static fight with us. The return fire was withering by the minute. \n\nIt sounded like World War Three as we pushed them back. I kept my head down, trying to focus on rebuilding my magic, when the firing suddenly slowed. \"CEASE FIRE,\" the Vermillion Pack warrior shouted. \n\n\"Did they surrender?\" \n\n\"No, but we don't want to shoot our friends.\" I looked out, and from behind and the right I saw wolves tear through the remaining wolves before they could react. Howls and screams filled the air, and a minute later it was quiet. \n\nThe men shifted and I recognized Alpha Stan and Beta Peter among the men looking over the bloody battlefield. \n\nWe had won. \n\nAlpha Sven's POV \n\nI sat down in the chair, the adrenaline coursing through me as I watched the battle on the cameras. We had all been shocked when Jessie entered the fray, especially as she did. John was going nuts, and ran after her. I quickly sent men to follow him, telling them to grab rifles and ammunition and take them forward. \n\nNow that it was over, I could see how decisive that impulsive action had been. The helicopter had created the opening, and the third line of defense wasn't ready yet. The attackers were so many, they would have broken through our lines and had a clear run to the Pack House. \n\n\"Send medical support to the second line immediately,\" I sent to my Pack. \"Squads, take non-critical injuries to the lawn in front of the clinic.\" Stretcher-bearers and medics moved out, they would stabilize the seriously wounded in the field. Our clinic staff had been augmented by three Pack Doctors and six Nurses, all provided by allied Packs for the battle. \"Deactivate all explosives and safe all weapons. Squad leaders, report to your Betas with casualty reports.\" \n\nI needed my mate. Linnea was still recovering from her captivity, and I had left her in the safe room with several guards during the battle. I linked them to bring her to me. While I was watching, I focused a camera on the fighting position Jessie had joined. I could see John was nuclear-grade pissed at her, his body language spoke of his anger and his worry. She was on her knees, her hands over one of my men. \"Nathan, what's going on with Jessie?\" \n\n\"She's fine, but she won't be sitting down for a week after John gets her alone tonight,\" he said with a hint of humor. \"She's almost worn out but is insisting on healing Carl. She's telling John that it doesn't matter if she passes out now since the battle is past.\" \n\n\"Don't get between mates, Nathan, but tell her she saved the day.\" It was true; the casualty reports were coming in. We had lost a total of twenty-one wolves, with another thirty-one suffering significant injuries. Over half of that total had come from the helicopter fire-bombing the defensive position early on, and without her intervention, the helicopter would have taken out more. \n\nI watched as she lifted her hands from the man, then tried to stand. Her legs collapsed under her, and John caught her in his arms and guided her to the ground. She had exhausted herself for us."
