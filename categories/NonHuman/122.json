        "Demetri couldn't get his wife home fast enough. Once the killing had ended and he was sure she was safely healed, all he wanted was to retreat to their home, to finally claim her completely. He had no idea if she had agreed to let him Sire her because she wanted to head off any of the fallout from letting herself get hurt, or whether she genuinely wanted it. \n\nHe didn't care what her reasoning was. He couldn't go through another night like the one they'd just been through. He couldn't ever feel the fear he had when he saw Mara lying there on the floor, when he had thought for a moment that she was dead. If she had been dead....he couldn't even contemplate what he would have done if she had died. \n\nHe had lost it as it was, barely able to differentiate between who was friend and foe at the compound. If he had lost Mara then his words to Caleb would have taken on a very different meaning. Everyone would have died, Vampire and Were alike, because he would have died inside too. Demetri Bozic would have ceased to exist, leaving behind a rabid vampire that Caleb would have had no choice but to put down to save everyone else.\n\nHe shivered slightly, turning his head to watch his woman sleeping in the passenger seat of the Jeep briefly before he turned into the driveway of their home. His own arrogance had almost killed her. He had been treading a tightrope of conflicted, confused emotions since she had entered his life. He had made poor judgement calls and almost lost her because of them. Now he had to start making the right decisions. Decisions which were best for him and Mara and no one else.\n\nShe woke up as he picked her up gently, her sleepy brown eyes smiling up at him as she wrapped her arms around his neck. His breath stilled in his chest for a second as he gazed into her face. He couldn't possibly love her anymore and yet he felt as if he did, as if her near death had somehow managed to make him fall deeper in love with her.\n\nMara snuggled into his chest as he carried her into the house and up to their bedroom, laying her gently on the bed and standing up to look down at her. He saw a speck of blood on her top and frowned, looking down at his hands. He had thought he had cleaned himself up back at the compound but he obviously still had some of Graves' blood on him. Growling softly, he turned and headed into the bathroom, starting the shower and stripping of his clothes. He wasn't touching his woman with that prick's blood on his hands. He wouldn't defile his Mara that way.\n\nMara heard the shower start up and sighed softly, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. Demetri was so quiet, his expression carefully neutral which signified he was thinking deeply about something he didn't want to share with her. She had expected a lecture of some kind, some long, drawn out rant about just how stupid she had been. His quietness worried her. Lord only knew what was going through her vampire's head. She was sure he was blaming himself for what had happened. He didn't always think very rationally at times. Sighing again, she pulled off her clothes, noting she had some blood on them. Another set of clothes for the trash and probably the reason why her husband suddenly felt the need for a shower. Stretching her weary body, Mara headed into the bathroom.\n\nDemetri was leaning with one hand braced against the shower wall, his head bowed as the hot water cascaded down his sculpted back and ass. Mara swallowed hard as her gaze travelled his naked body. He had the most amazing body, so taut and hard and full of barely restrained passion. His submissive posture frightened her though. She couldn't bear to seem him so vulnerable, of knowing that she was the cause of the vulnerability within him.\n\nShe slipped into the shower, knowing he could sense her there but was not reacting to her presence. Her fear increased slightly as she wrapped her arms around his chest resting her cheek against his back, feeling him stiffen at her touch. She expected him to turn around, to hold her and tell her everything was okay but he remained as he was, neither accepting nor rejecting her caress. \"Demetri?\" she whispered uncertainly, some of her fear leaking into her voice.\n\nMara's whispered words seeped into Demetri's mind, her fear wrenching at his heart. He turned, groaning loudly and sweeping her into his arms as he picked her up and pressed her hard against the shower wall. He buried his head in the crook of her neck, his body shaking as his tears continued to flow silently down his face. \"I almost lost you,\" he choked out, clutching her so tightly he knew he must be hurting her but unable to ease his grasp on her fragile body.\n\nMara felt her heart break as his fear and pain washed over her. She clutched him tightly, ignoring the slight discomfort of his hold. She'd felt worse pain already this night. She could withstand a little more. \"I'm so sorry, love,\" she whispered tearfully. \"Please forgive me.\" She pulled his head up, her mouth urgently seeking his as she sought to give him comfort, to ease his suffering. \n\nHe kissed her desperately, his mouth hard and insistent, demanding everything from her which she gave willingly. Finally he raised his head, his expression tortured as he stared into her face. \"Never again, Mara,\" he breathed hoarsely. \"Never again.\"\n\nShe reached up to cradle his face tenderly, tracing each perfect feature until she smoothed out the look of anguish completely. \"Never again,\" she agreed softly, turning her head and pulling his mouth to her neck. \"Take me, love. I'm yours forever.\"\n\nDemetri groaned loudly as she offered him everything he'd ever hoped for, everything he'd ever desired. His mouth brushed her soft skin, the scent of her blood teasing him mercilessly, the heady pulse beating against his mouth. He shifted her slightly so he could bring his cock in line with her wet heat. \"Forever,\" he groaned thrusting deep into her body the instant his fangs slid into her fragile throat and her sweet essence began to fill his mouth.\n\nMara cried out in ecstasy as her husband took her with one quick, hard stroke deep within her body. His fangs slid into her neck, his soothing venom easing the slight pain as he began to suck against her with long, hard pulls of his mouth. He thrust deep inside her, spearing her on his cock as he sucked and rode her body in perfect unison, sending shivers of pure bliss throughout her body.\n\nHis initial rough touch gentled and he began to rock into her body with long, loving strokes, stretching her open for his invasion, grinding against her clit to draw deep moans of pleasure from her. His mouth was insistent again her neck, drinking down her blood greedily. It was the most erotic thing she had ever experienced. It quite literally was making her feel light headed it was so pleasurable.\n\nDemetri drank deeply, sliding his cock into his wife's hot body, loving her as gently and tenderly as he could as he slowly felt her body start to grow weaker as the blood loss took hold. Her moans became softer, her grip on him loosening as she began to slide away into unconsciousness. Her heartbeat faltered, became so weak he could barely hear it. Slowly he retracted his fangs, licking her wound closed, ripping at his neck and pulling her head forward. \n\n\"Drink, Mara,\" he whispered softly, sliding into her body over and over again as she began to suck at his neck. He growled loudly when her sharp teeth pierced his neck and she pulled hard against him. Her hands gripped his hair hard, tilting his head so she could have easier access to his neck. He increased the pace of his thrusts as her feeding sent waves of pleasure crashing through him and she matched his lust with her own as her new vampiric abilities began to strengthen her body.\n\nMara threw her head back, laughing at the sheer joy of feeling Demetri plunging deep into her pussy, his heartbeat sounding so loud, his scent the most intoxicating thing she had ever smelled. She could hear her own heart beating, each drop of water hitting her skin felt like a downpour of rain from the heavens. Everything smelled so much fresher, everything sounded so much clearer, each thrust of her husband's rigid cock inside her felt so much more intense. \n\n\"Demetri,\" she growled softly, kissing him with wild abandon as they moved together in the most delicious dance of pure love and lust all rolled into one. She could feel her pleasure ready to peak, could feel his own release mere moments away. \"Yes,\" she hissed through clenched teeth. \"Harder. Faster.\"\n\nHer words pushed him over the edge and he took her hard and fast, her pussy pulsing around him as he felt his cock start to expand, knew he was ready to soar with his beautiful wife into the sweet abyss that only she was capable of taking him to. He roared loudly as her pussy clamped hard on his cock as she shattered in his arms, his name a mindless chant of her lips as she reached her climax a second before he did. He joined her, his thick cum pulsing up his shaft to bathe her hot pussy with what felt like gallons of his seed. They ground together wildly, their cries of pleasure echoing in the room as they both achieved that one perfect moment when neither of them knew where one began and the other ended.\n\nDemetri finally stilled, cradling his wife against his hard body as he struggled to get his breathing under control. Finally she was his forever. Finally his stunning woman would be at his side for eternity and he would never have to fear that he would one day have to walk the planet without her in his life. He wanted to weep for joy. Instead he held his Mara tenderly and lovingly kissed her before he slid from her body and lowered her feet to the floor. His eyes raked over her body taking in the subtle differences her change had brought over her. She would always be the most perfect woman in his eyes. Now she was stunningly glorious as her beauty was enhanced with her new abilities.\n\nMara opened her eyes slowly and sucked in a deep breath at the open adoration on Demetri's face. She felt so amazing and it was hard not to laugh like a child as her eyes could finally see just how beautiful the world around her was. She smiled at her husband rubbing her body sensuously against his as her hunger sparked again and she had the intense need to feel him fill her again. \"That was delicious,\" she sighed softly. \"Can I have some more?\"\n\nHe laughed softly bending to kiss her slowly, cupping her firm breasts in his hands and flicking her nipples lightly. \"I should have told you how much better sex was as a vampire,\" he chuckled. \"You would probably have agreed to let me Sire you earlier.\"  \n\nHer hand slid down his body to his already hardening cock. She gripped it lightly, giving it a gentle squeeze as she rubbed her swollen nipples against his chest with a throaty moan. \"You could be right,\" she laughed softly. \"Though I think you might need to show me again how good it was before I can truthfully say you are right.\"\n\nDemetri caught her hand, bringing it to his mouth and kissing her wrist lightly, scraping his fangs teasingly against her pulse. \"I'm always right, Mara,\" he said with a little smile teasing his lips. \"But I have no objections to proving it to you.\"\n\nShe laughed loudly as her husband picked her up again and proceeded to prove without a shadow of a doubt, just how erotic and sensual lovemaking as a vampire truly was.\n\n_____\n\nCaleb was quiet on the drive home from the compound. All night long he had been trying to keep two steps ahead of everyone so he could keep his promise to his woman and save her family. Now, finally, there was nothing else to keep his mind occupied and his perfect recall was replaying his first memory of entering the house and seeing his precious woman lying on the floor, blood on her neck and clothes, her face pinched with pain as she sheltered Mara protectively even in the face of her own agony. There was no hiding from it any longer. He had failed his Annie. He had been so intent on protecting everyone else he had failed to protect the most precious thing in his life.\n\nThat she had healed wasn't the point. He had allowed her to feed from Nors because he had needed to keep his own strength for the fight. That fact alone tore at his heart almost as badly as allowing her to be hurt did. She should have come first and she hadn't. He had put others before her so he could keep his promise to her. He didn't know how to reconcile the decisions he had made. He didn't know how to forgive himself for failing her so badly.\n\nRhianna was quiet too as she followed him into the house and waited as he closed and bolted the door. It was only the second time since she had come to live with Caleb that he had ever bolted the door. It was a sign of how upset he was, that he wanted no interruptions from anyone, not even Demetri and Mara.\n\n\"They won't come over,\" she said quietly. \"Mara doesn't have a hope in hell of meeting the dawn as a human, Caleb. Thought you would have noticed that yourself. Demetri will Sire her before the night is over and we both know what they'll be up to once that happens.\" She smiled at the memory of her own change to the life of a vampire. It was a very sexual, intimate experience. One she remembered with many fond memories.\n\nCaleb stared at her with a thoughtful expression on his face before he smiled gently at her. \"I suppose you're right,\" he finally agreed. After nearly losing Mara he doubted Demetri would allow her to remain human a moment longer He wouldn't want to go through that kind of pain again. \n\nHis amber eyes travelled over Rhianna's face, looking for any sign of disappointment towards him. He saw sadness for those who had died, a trace of amusement most probably at her thinking about what Mara and Demetri were up to. No condemnation of him though. He should have felt relieved but instead he felt worse. His amazing woman truly would forgive him anything. He didn't deserve to have her love him so unconditionally.\n\nRhianna met his gaze levelly, watching every flicker of emotion cross his beautiful face and she held in a weary sigh. She could only imagine what stupid thoughts were going through his head. She was just as guilty of having the same stupid thoughts. Rafe was so right though. They couldn't blame themselves for the actions of others. Everyone had done the best they could under very trying circumstances. Things could have turned out so much worse. They had to be grateful for still having each other alive and well.\n\n\"Caleb, it's not your fault,\" she said quietly. \"You did the best you could. We all did. Some of us didn't make it and that's incredibly sad but it's also the way life goes. No one lives forever, not even our kind. We can die just the same as everyone else does. We're just lucky that we're a bit more hardy than others.\"\n\nHis expression turned guarded as he closed off from her, ignoring her words. \"You're wrong, Annie. It is my fault. I was supposed to protect you and I failed. Did you think I wouldn't hear about what happened in that house? Lacey told Rafe. I heard everything. How easily Sandro almost took your head, how he broke your bones and left you in agony as he stalked Mara and Lacey. If you hadn't unconsciously sent out your mental scream I would have come back and found you dead.\" His voice broke and he suddenly turned and pulled open the door again, disappearing out into the night as if he could run away from the thought he had just uttered.\n\nRhianna bit her lip and followed him, knowing he was close by because she could scent him. She stood on the porch, looking up at the dark sky, seeing the first rays of dawn trying to poke through the blackness. \"Caleb,\" she called softly. \"Come inside, love. You can't run away from your fear. It just follows you until you have to stand still and deal with it. Please, Caleb.\" She waited patiently closing her eyes and sighing with relief when he appeared at her side, his arms wrapping around her to hold her close.\n\n\"I should have protected you, Annie,\" he groaned softly, picking her up and cradling her gently in his arms as he brought them both back inside again, moving to sink down onto one of the large leather sofas in the sitting room.\n\nShe straddled his lap, framing his face in her small hands as she brushed his cheeks gently with her thumbs. \"You did protect me, in so many different ways,\" she whispered softly. \"You came when I needed you and you stopped Sandro. You found the strength to tame your possessiveness to allow Nors to help heal me so I could heal Mara. I know how hard that was for you, love.\" She brushed his golden brown hair back from his face, smiling softly as she did so.\n\n\"You moved heaven and earth to make sure my family was safe,\" she continued quietly. \"Because of you Rafe and Lacey are free to live their lives with no more fear hanging over their heads. Millie and Jared can have their babies together bringing new life to the pack when they desperately need the joy of that to help them heal. You did all that, Caleb because you made me a promise. Don't you know how gladly I would suffer every single moment of the pain I felt all over again just to achieve those same results? I got hurt but I lived. We're the lucky ones. We're still alive. We should be celebrating that life in memory of those who are no longer with us, not dwelling on what may have happened.\" \n\nHe groaned and brought his mouth to hers, rubbing his lips gently across hers as he slid his hands into her hair to tilt her head back. \"I've never known a soul as pure as yours, Annie,\" he breathed softly. \"You constantly take my breath away. How I could ever have imagined that you could be seduced into the cold, hard life of a vampire I have no idea. I must have been mad to ever fight against changing you to this life.\" His lips moved to her neck, whispering softly along her silky skin his body hardening with the need to join with her and do some of that celebrating life stuff she had just been talking about. But he didn't want to spoil this precious moment with her, as he allowed her wise words to soothe away the last of his guilt.\n\nShe moaned softly, pressing her aching heat against his rapidly hardening cock, feeling a rush of pleasure course through her as his lips teased her neck with gentle caresses. \"Caleb,\" she whispered on a soft moan, threading her hands in his hair and pulling his head up so their lips could touch again. \"Are you going to do something with that?\" she groaned wriggling against him and dragging a moan from his lips.\n\nHe moved swiftly, flipping her onto her back, pressing between her thighs as his lips hardened against her mouth and his tongue pressed for entry into her moist depths. His breathing was ragged when he finally lifted his head, stroking her red curls from her face, his eyes dark with need as they roamed over her face. \"Don't you think you should be resting?\" he asked gruffly. \"You've had a hard night, Annie, both physically and mentally. I want you, sweet one, so very much but I'd rather just hold you if that's what you need.\"\n\nA wicked smile danced across her face and she shifted her hips, rubbing against his raging hardness with a long, slow deliberate movement, causing the breath to rasp loudly out of his mouth. \"I'd much rather do some celebrating of life,\" she laughed huskily. \"If it's not too much of an imposition on you?\" \n\nHer teasing tone had him laughing softly as he stripped her top off and cupped her breasts gently in his large hands. \"Making love to you could never be an imposition, my Annie,\" he groaned huskily, bending his head to take a taut, swollen peak into his mouth, He suckled gently, laving the hard nub with his tongue as his woman moaned softly and held his head to her body. He could never get tired of the taste of her, the feel of her soft skin beneath his eager hands and mouth.\n\nHe teased her breasts with soft gentle caresses, laving her nipples with his tongue before closing his hot mouth over her straining peaks and sucking gently until she writhed with pleasure beneath him. He wanted to take away the horror of the night, to show her the beauty and passion and the deep abiding tenderness he felt for her.",
        "Slowly and methodically he kissed her soft skin as he bared her body to his hungry eyes and mouth. Being with his Annie like this was all he ever wanted in life, the two of them together, surrounded by their love, giving and receiving sweet bliss from each other. His breath caught when her small hands moved between their bodies, stroking his raging hardness through his jeans before she eagerly freed him from the confines of the rough material.\n\nWith a muttered groan he rose from the sofa to remove his clothes completely and finish removing hers. The feel of her hot mouth sliding over his engorged cock surprised him and he growled loudly as he looked down to see her take him in her mouth with a soft loving touch. Threading his hands in her curls he closed his eyes and gave into the sweet torture her mouth inspired in him. He struggled to hold himself in check as his woman used her tongue so wickedly on his throbbing shaft. She was such a damned tease at times, driving him insane with her little licks and gentle sucking.\n\nCaleb growled again and pulled her off his cock, pressing her back against the sofa as he knelt down before her and paid her back for her teasing with a little of his own. He held her still as his tongue slowly licked up her wet slit, her arousal filling the room with its heady scent and making his cock twitch with the need to be buried inside her beautiful body. He licked and suckled so softly against her pussy until she was crying out her pleasure, trying desperately to move against him but being unable to do so because of his hold on her body.\n\n\"Caleb,\" she moaned in frustration. \"I need you. Stop teasing me, you monster!\"\n\nHe laughed against her throbbing body. \"Monster?\" he whispered softly. \"Do you want to see a monster, sweet Annie?\" he teased lightly, letting his fangs grow as he trailed them slowly against her inner thigh. His movements tickled and she giggled and tried to get away from him but he was holding her too tightly. He sank his fangs into her inner thigh, groaning when her sweet taste filled his mouth. He sipped just a little, conscious of how much blood she had given to Mara to heal her.\n\nA sudden wave of pure possessiveness came over him as he remembered her feeding from Nors. He growled again, moving swiftly up her body to capture her lips in a hard, passionate kiss, twisting around until he was resting back on the sofa and pulling her astride his lap. \"Bite me,\" he commanded softly, his amber eyes flashing with need as he pulled her face to his neck.\n\nHer fangs sank into his neck as he lifted her tiny body up and positioned her over his cock. He slowly lowered her onto his straining shaft, groaning his pleasure as she pulled deeply at his neck as her scalding heat encased his body tightly. \"Fuck, Annie,\" he growled. \"You feel so good, sweet one.\"\n\nHe held her still, savouring the feeling of being buried so deep inside her. It felt as if he had been apart from her for months what with everything that had happened in the last few days. His arms banded tightly around his woman as she fed greedily, the erotic pull of her mouth almost sending him over the edge before he'd even begun to love her the way he wanted to.\n\nWith a muffled sigh, Rhianna closed the wound of Caleb's neck and flexed her hips dragging a harsh groan from him. She knew what the feeding was about. He would never change, her beautiful vampire. He would never lose his possessive streak or his need to protect her from everything. He would try his hardest to be more relaxed, less worried that she would be hurt but he would fail miserably at it.\n\nShe moaned when he raised her body and then pulled her back down onto his throbbing shaft. His thickness stretched her, the rigid bumps on his cock scraping her inner walls so deliciously. Making love with Caleb would always be the most special thing in her world. Loving her vampire was what she was made for. With another soft moan, she gripped the back of the sofa, her hands on either side of his head, and began to dance the erotic rhythm of love with him, riding his cock hard with her head thrown back in ecstasy. \n\nBreathing harshly, Caleb helped her take her pleasure, watching her move sinuously against him, her face flushed with colour, her breath coming out in short, hard pants. She was total perfection, his Annie. Warm, loving and so incredibly sensual. He growled his pleasure as her hot body engulfed him over and over again. He was so close to cumming. Just watching his woman lose herself to the needs of her body was enough to send him over the edge. \n\nHe thrust up to meet her downward movements, his touch becoming rougher as his climax neared. He felt her pussy walls start to flutter around his aching cock, felt his balls tighten as she cried out her release, her head thrown back as she shattered so beautifully around his cock. He came instantly, jerking hard into her body as he bathed her insides with his thick seed, his cries of pleasure mixing with hers as they shuddered together in perfect harmony.\n\nRhianna dropped forward, collapsing against Caleb's wide chest, burying her head in the side of his neck as she struggled for breath. She felt so exhausted but pleasantly so. Caleb's arms wrapped around her tightly, his hand stroking soothingly down her back. \"I love you, my Annie,\" he whispered softly.\n\n\"I love you, Caleb,\" she whispered back, snuggling tighter against him, yawning loudly before falling almost instantly asleep.\n\nCaleb moved them, sliding from her body and grabbing a throw from the back of the sofa. He covered his precious woman against him as he made them as comfortable as they could be on the sofa. He was too tired to go upstairs. He snuggled beside her and closed his eyes, following her quickly into sleep.\n\n_____\n\nAlexei and Andrei picked Andrei's car up from Demetri's. They didn't head into the house, merely climbed into the car and headed back to the nightclub so Alexei could collect his own car which he'd left there earlier. They were both silent, deep in thoughts which they weren't willing to share with each other.\n\nAlexei kept seeing a pair of cerulean blue eyes and a face shrouded by a mane on long blonde curls. Cedar Alexander. He had surreptitiously found out as much as he could about the she wolf without making it too obvious he was doing so. She was close to the pack hierarchy, well thought of, and came from a large family who were held in some prestige within their pack. She was unmated but sexually active like most Weres, indulging her passions when she felt the urge but not having anyone special in her life at the moment.\n\nHer sweet scent still lingered despite the fact it had been a while since he had been in her company. He could still scent her on his hand where he had touched the fragile skin of her neck. The bolt of pure electricity that had gone through his body at that one small touch had been enough to stun him. His entire reaction to her stunned him, as did what he had done to save her and her pack. \n\nAndrei had been livid that someone had told the wolves how to defeat their kind. When he had arrived at the evacuation site he had pulled his brother aside and told him what happened at the compound. He hadn't told him everything. He was withholding something that had occurred and that made Alexei curious for his brother held no secrets from him. As he held no secrets from him.\n\nWhen Andrei pulled up at the club, Alexei turned to him before he could get out of the car. \"I told them,\" he said quietly.\n\nThe atmosphere in the car dropped at least ten degrees as his twin registered what he had said, understanding perfectly what he was meaning. His head turned slowly to look at him, his eyes blazing with fury.\n\n\"You,\" Andrei ground out. \"My own brother?!\" He couldn't believe what he was hearing. Alexei had betrayed them to the Weres? He had to be joking. This really had to be some dumb jest on his part.\n\n\"I told them,\" Alexei confirmed in a hard voice. \"At the evacuation site. It was either tell them or they would have been slaughtered.\" \n\nAndrei stared at him in disbelief his thoughts in total chaos. Out of everyone he thought may have told the Weres their Achilles heel, his twin was the very last person he would ever have considered. \"The Council will have your head for this, Alexei,\" he hissed furiously.\n\nHis brother shrugged nonchalantly. \"The Council need never know,\" he countered.\n\nAndrei took a deep breath and then another, trying to calm his burning rage. Caleb's words came back to him from earlier in the night, when he'd asked him what he would be prepared to do to protect Alexei. Had Caleb known the truth then? He had known every one of Andrei's secrets right down to the most recent one, that he had healed Loretta with his blood and that she now knew it was possible and still lived.\n\nHe turned his gaze back to his brother. \"You just told the Council, Alexei.\"\n\nIt took a second for his brother to understand what he was saying, then his breath hissed out and his eyes narrowed. \"Tell me you're taking the piss, Andrei,\" he growled. \"Tell me they wouldn't be stupid enough to elevate you to The Council. You're a fucking psychopath! You may be my brother and I may love you but even I can admit what you really are. If I can see it then why can't the other elders see it too?\"\n\nAndrei snorted, rolling his eyes and turning away again to stare out the windscreen. \"People only see what they want to see, brother,\" he said quietly. \"Some believe the soft smile and twinkling eyes, others can see beneath the surface and know the truth. It helps that I can thwart Jorge and Philippe's mental abilities. I've been lying to them for years, small things, and huge great big lies too. They've never once picked up on it. Maybe it's because I'm a psychopath as you so lovingly termed it.\"\n\nAlexei shook his head staring at his brother intently. He thought he was the one with the most shocking secret but it turned out his brother was hiding things just as shocking from him.\n\n\"Seeing as we're doing the whole confessions thing, I suppose I should tell you I healed a she wolf tonight and she knows our blood can do that now,\" Andrei said with a weary sigh, running his hand thought his hair as he felt his brother stiffen beside him.\n\n\"Fuck, Andrei!\" Alexei hissed out. \"Anything else to throw into this fucking mess? Because I'm done with just the one fuck up which admittedly is a pretty major one.\" He growled loudly and climbed out of the car, his big body coiled with tension.\n\nHis brother followed him out, leaning against the still warm hood and folding his arms. \"You're going to have to disappear for a while, Alexei,\" he said calmly. \"I can cover my tracks but you can't. If The Council call you in for questioning and ask you directly about the Weres' new knowledge Jorge and Philippe will pick up your lie. They won't be able to mine.\"\n\nAlexei paced up and down in front of the car, a dark scowl in his face. \"I'm a Council Enforcer, Andrei. If I suddenly vanish don't you think that will be just a tad suspicious?\" His tone dripped with sarcasm as he stopped in front of his brother and pierced him with a hard glare.\n\n\"Just as well there's a job coming up in Ecuador then,\" Andrei said with a little smile. \"I'll make sure you get offered it first thing tomorrow. It's a long job, lasting a minimum of nine months, possibly as long as a year. That will give me time to keep the current Council chasing their tails until the rotation happens. Once I'm on the Council proper, it will be safe for you to come home.\"\n\n\"Ecuador,\" Alexei repeated, his voice cold and hard. \"I don't want to go to fucking Ecuador!\"\n\n\"You don't have a fucking choice!\" Andrei suddenly yelled getting right in his brother's face. \"It's the only way I can keep you alive while I try and clear up this fucking mess you've landed me in. You will go to Ecuador and you will bloody well stay there until I tell you it's safe to come home.\"\n\nAlexei quirked an eyebrow up, a smile tugging at his lips. \"Very butch, \" he said drolly. \"Just because you're joining the Council don't think that means you get to talk to be like I'm a piece of shit, brother. I'll kick your ass from here to next week if you try any of that crap on me. Are we clear on this?\" He kept his brother pinned under his steely gaze until Andrei relaxed and leaned back against the car again.\n\n\"You're still going to Ecuador whether you like it or not,\" Andrei sighed with a hint of amusement in his voice.\n\n\"I'm going to Ecuador,\" Alexei agreed with a resigned groan. He really was in no position to argue with his brother over this. He had made his bed and now he had to lie in it. Date night with Cedar Alexander was going to have to be placed on hold until he could come back.\n\n\"So, what's the bitch like?\" Andrei laughed suddenly. \"I assume you were trying to save a she wolf when you opened your big mouth?\"\n\nAlexei smiled slowly. \"Why? Do you want to know if she's as tantalising as the bitch you healed, brother?\" he countered softly as he walked over to his car and opened the door. \"Mind your own business, Andrei and I'll mind mine. Set up the assignment for the morning.\" He climbed in his car and drove away leaving his brother shaking his head in amusement.\n\nAndrei groaned and climbed back into his own car. What a fucking mess. He'd have to dance lightly to keep the Council off balance and Alexei safe. Plus he would need to keep a closer eye on Caleb Cullen. He didn't think he was a threat but he would be foolish not to err on the side of caution. \n\nWith everything he had to get done he wouldn't have time to revisit the Hanlon Compound and take a closer look at the little Rose that had captured his attention. Which was a pity because he'd really like to see her without all the bruises and broken bones. Maybe once he was on the Council and things had calmed down he would take a moment to swing by again, if his interest was still piqued. Sighing again, Andrei started the car and headed home.\n\n_____\n\n\"Aaron,\" Jen whispered softly, her mate waking instantly, scenting the air for any sign of danger and finding none.\n\n\"Honey, what's wrong?\" he asked, his voice still groggy with sleep as he kissed the back of her neck.\n\n\"I need to go,\" she sighed softly, feeling his strong arms tighten around her and his lips still against her skin.\n\n\"Go where, Jen?\"\n\n\"Outside,\" she whispered. \"I really need to go outside right now.\"\n\nAaron stiffened slightly, a smile crossing his face as his lips brushed over her collarbone. \"She's ready, honey?\"\n\nJen turned in his arms, wrapping hers around his neck and pulling his head down for a long, drugging kiss. She giggled as she pulled away, feeling his body hardening instantly. \"That later,\" she laughed. \"My wolf wants to run.\"\n\nAaron laughed softly, jumping from the bed, scooping his precious mate into his arms and striding from the bedroom. \"I can't wait to meet her, honey,\" he sighed, hurrying downstairs and pulling open the front door. He set his mate's feet to the ground and held her against his chest as they stopped to watch wolves begin to trickle out of various buildings, heading into the trees.\n\n\"What's happening, Aaron?\" Jen asked, confused that so many people were up and about after all that had happened.\n\n\"Life, Jen,\" he sighed, stroking her stomach gently. \"The pack is running to celebrate our fallen.\"\n\nJen felt tears in her eyes as she silently watched the wolves slip into the dense forest. Her own wolf wanted to join them but she wasn't sure what to do.\n\n\"Feel her, Jen. Let her come forward, take control. It only hurts a little the first time. After that, you won't even notice it.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, let her wolf come forward, yelped at the quick burst of pain and the strangeness of her body as it suddenly changed and she fell forward onto paws instead of hands and knees. Big, black paws, covered in silky fur. She shook her head in surprise, turning to look back at Aaron and finding the most stunning brown wolf with golden streaks through his fur.\n\n\"You're glorious, Jen,\" Aaron's voice sounded inside her head. It was full of love and awe and it tickled slightly, making her want to giggle. She growled softly instead and then did it again as she tried to giggle because she had growled the first time.\n\n\"This is so weird, Aaron,\" she answered, thinking the words because that's what she imagined he had done to talk inside her head. \"I feel so alive! Like I can take on the whole world.\"\n\n\"Together we can, honey,\" Aaron breathed softly. \"Come run with the pack, Jen. Come celebrate our new life together.\" He took off across the compound and she ran to catch up with him, stumbling slightly as she became accustomed to being on four legs but quickly finding her feet. The wind rushed in her face as she ran swiftly after her mate and she howled softly with joy into the night.\n\n_____\n\nRafe slid quietly from his bed. He had been lying awake for the last hour just watching Lacey sleep. He was struggling to believe the threat to his mate was over, even though he had taken Graves' life himself. From the first moment he had met her she had been in danger and it was hard to relax, hard to believe that he could now live his life in peace with his amazing mate at his side.\n\nHis wolf prowled and his incessant movement dragged Rafe from his woman's side and towards the window. He saw Jen and Aaron, smiling as he understood the significance. Jen was ready for her first change. He felt slightly envious of his friend because he had missed Lacey's first change. He would have liked to have been with her the first time but he would much rather her wolf had saved her life as it had. Some things were more important.\n\nHis eyes took in the other wolves leaving the compound and his wolf rumbled deep inside him. The pack was running. His wolf wanted to join them. He returned to his bed, brushing his lips against Lacey's, smiling as she murmured her appreciation and tried to pull him down on top of her.\n\n\"Wake up, sweetheart,\" he whispered softly. \"Come run with me.\"\n\nLacey sighed, stretching and opening her eyes slowly. \"Is that what's wrong with my wolf?\" she asked quietly as she sat up, swinging her legs to the floor. \n\n\"The pack is running,\" Rafe smiled. \"It calls to our wolves when so many of us feel the urge to run at the same time. It doesn't happen often, usually when the pack is celebrating something. Tonight we run to celebrate the lives of our friends.\" He pulled Lacey into his arms, dropping a soft kiss on her mouth, running his hands through her silvery blonde hair. \"I'm sorry I missed your first shift, Lacey. I can't wait to meet your wolf, sweetheart.\"\n\nShe sighed, kissing him gently before she ducked around him, letting her wolf come forward as she dropped to the floor. She heard Rafe's startled gasp, turned her head to the side to see her mate staring at her with such wonder in his eyes. He sank to his knees beside her, touching her white fur with shaky hands.\n\n\"Breathtaking,\" he whispered softly. \"So, totally, utterly breathtaking!\"\n\nLacey growled her appreciation, nudging her head against him, wanting him to shift too so they could run together. Excitement was tingling through every nerve ending in her body. She may have shifted before but it had been a survival instinct, a frightening experience. Now she was ready to know the joy of being a wolf. To run and play with her mate.\n\nRafe laughed at her impatience, kissing the top of her head. \"Just as well one of us has some brains in this family,\" he teased lightly, standing up and walking over to the bedroom door. He made a pantomime show of opening it.\n\n\"Oops, forgot about that,\" Lacey laughed in his head slinking out in front of him and running lightly down the stairs.\n\n\"Obviously,\" her mate said dryly as she waited patiently for him to open the front door.",
        "Rafe shifted the instant they were outside, rubbing his body against his mate, placing his scent on her and receiving her scent in return. She nipped at him playfully, taking off into the trees with a little howl. Rafe let her run ahead, mesmerised by the sheer beauty of his mate in wolf form, then the call to run overcame him and he bounded after her, uttering his own small howl into the night.\n\n*****\n\nMillie rolled over, seeking Jared's mouth, pressing her lips gently against his as he gathered her close. She knew he was awake, his muffled groan and instant response testament to that. His body hardened and he nudged a leg between hers as he took over the kiss, his hands sliding across her back in a slow, sensual caress.\n\n\"The pack is running,\" She sighed against his lips, her own wolf perfectly content because she knew it was too dangerous to shift. But Millie knew Jared's wolf would be calling to him, demanding the Alpha run with his pack.\n\n\"Let them run,\" Jared answered huskily, his mouth travelling over her throat. \"They don't need me tonight.\"\n\nMillie groaned softly hearing the call of the wolves, the mating call for those with mates, the call of friendship for those without. If she could shift, they would out there with the pack, playing, joining together in wolf form to celebrate life. \n\nJared rolled over, pulling his beautiful woman on top of him, nudging his straining cock between her legs as his wolf growled his approval. He had no need to run with the pack, all he needed was right here with him. He slid inside her wet body, growling his pleasure as her scalding heat enveloped him. Kissing her softly, he rolled over until he was above his woman, tenderly stroking her curls back from her face, brushing her lips softly as he began to move inside her.\n\nHe loved her gently, tenderly as the wolves serenaded them with their own passionate calls into the night. The message was clear. Life moved on despite the tragedy which had befallen the pack. Some friends no longer walked among them but they would be remembered and their names would be passed on to the children who would be conceived on this night as the pack joined together as one.\n\n_____\n\nAshleigh ran with the pack though her heart was heavy with sorrow. She heard them call to their mates, to their friends. She listened for the calls that she knew she would never hear again and she whined softly darting off to the left and flying as far from the pack as she could get. She couldn't bear to be there with them. She had promised Nors that she would try but it was too hard. She ran blindly into the night a mournful howl escaping her despite her best efforts to keep it in.\n\nNors tracked her through the trees. Something had told him to stay when everyone else had left. He had thought he was being foolish but he had stayed anyway. Now he flew through the trees, watching the little she wolf run herself into exhaustion, her pained whimpers wrenching at the heart he was so sure he had closed off millennia ago. He followed until she finally collapsed to the ground, curling into a small round ball and whimpering softly.\n\nHe dropped to her side, his movements light and graceful for one so big. \"You promised you would try, Ashleigh,\" he said softly, reaching a hand out to gently touch her shaking body. \"You haven't given the pack a chance.\"\n\nShe whimpered, moving into the heat of his body, remaining in wolf form. He knew why she did so. She wanted to keep the lines of communication broken between them. Sighing he rested against a tree and positioned himself so she could curl up in his lap, his arms creating a barrier to hold her in place. Her body continued to shake as she whimpered softly and he started to hum under his breath, closing his eyes as the distant howls of the wolves reached his sharp ears.\n\nAshleigh relaxed as Nors hummed softly. He really had a lovely voice, his tone deep and rich. She didn't recognise what it was he was humming but it soothed her pain a little. She felt safe when he was near, safe enough that she closed her eyes and fell into a light sleep as his voice lulled her.\n\nNors stroked her fur gently, keeping up his soothing hum as she relaxed into sleep. He felt a strange peace within himself as he sat in the middle of the forest in the dead of night with the fragile little she wolf on his lap. If anyone who knew him were to witness this, they would be wondering if he had suddenly gone mad. He was not known for his tender emotions. Usually he was bashing someone's head in to keep them in line or ordering someone to be put down for whatever wrong doing they had performed. Caring about orphaned wolves was not something he was used to dealing with.\n\nHe stayed with her for an hour until she woke slowly, snuggling into his body heat with a contented sigh. For a brief second he considered taking her with him, simply getting up and carrying her from the forest, but he knew it was the wrong thing to do. She was grieving, young and completely confused. She wasn't capable of making decisions about her life right now.\n\n\"A deal is only a deal if both people hold to their end of it, little wolf,\" he said regretfully. \"If you don't try then you're not honouring your end of our bargain and I will have to withdraw my offer.\" He felt her stiffen, heard her little whimper and he almost relented. But he was older and so much wiser. He knew he had to do the right thing. \"It's time for you to go home, Ashleigh.\"\n\nAshleigh whimpered softly again. She didn't want to leave Nors. She wanted to go home with him but his tone told her he wouldn't allow it. He was serious. If she didn't try then he would rescind his offer to adopt her into his family. If she didn't try then she had nothing to aim for in the future. Slowly she uncurled from his lap, her big brown eyes meeting his for a brief moment before she turned and ran back into the forest.\n\nNors tracked her to make sure she did return to the pack, sighing regretfully when she entered a clearing full of wolves playfully sparring with each other. She was barely there before her people surrounded her, nudging and cajoling her into the group, rubbing against her soothingly until she relaxed a bit and allowed them to comfort her. \n\nSatisfied she was once more safe, Nors turned and headed away from the forest. He would come back in a year's time to see how she had faired. Maybe by then she would have begun to heal, maybe even chosen a mate within her pack. The thought of her mating disturbed him slightly but it was the natural order of things within a pack. If she had mated when he returned then he could continue on with his life happy that she was content with her mate.\n\n_____\n\nOne month later\n\nThe large fire blazed in the middle of the Hanlon Compound. It was not a cold night but it was traditional to light a fire when the pack came together to commemorate those they had lost or had been when it had happened in the past under other Hanlon Alphas. Jared had ordered the fire to be lit. Some traditions the pack needed to maintain.\n\nIt had been a hard month. Grieving families had to be taken care of, orphans had required foster families to take them in. Jared had to replace his fallen betas. So far he had elevated Brody and Connor Alexander. They had saved the children and his mate, proven themselves to be as loyal as Aaron and Cedar. Their sister was currently working a dual role. She was Millie's second but she also acted as beta too when Jared needed more hands.\n\nSome of the pack had returned to their lives in the city, the ones who were not grieving and had businesses to run. At the end of the first week after the attack, Rafe and Aaron has begun opening up Wicked again though they returned to the compound nightly. Jen had needed to get back to her job though Lacey was at a loose end. She spent a few hours each day helping out with the children so their parents could get on with other pack matters. When she was at the compound Ashleigh invariably was on her heels, shadowing her until the older woman left with Rafe to go to the club. \n\nJared worried about Ashleigh a lot. A few times he had even ordered her to be placed in the safe room overnight. She appeared so fragile, a shadow of her former self. She had been such a happy little thing before the vampires came. Now she lived in her own world of memories that she wouldn't allow anyone into. Luke had told him about the girl's attachment to one of Caleb's friends, about his offer to adopt her. His initial reaction to it had been outrage but as the weeks moved on he wondered if maybe it wasn't something to be considered. He had to do what was best for his pack and right now, he couldn't work out what was best for the little orphan who grieved so badly. \n\nThe pack began to gather in the centre of the compound. Millie slipped from the house and wrapped her arms around Jared's waist as they watched everyone come together. There was a feeling of deep sadness in the air but also a feeling of hope too. Luke had reported ten new pregnancies within the pack, most probably from the night when the pack had run in memory of their friends. The circle of life went on despite everything. All they could do was live their lives to the best of their abilities and remember those they left behind.\n\n\"This isn't supposed to be a sad time, Jared,\" Millie said softly, tightening her arms around him.\n\nHe sighed softly brushing his lips gently across her forehead. \"I know,\" he answered quietly. \"It's hard not to feel some sadness though.\"\n\n\"The pack will follow their Alpha's lead, love,\" she whispered reaching up to pull his mouth to hers for a gentle kiss. He accepted her kiss, drinking in her sweet taste and then he smiled and raised his head. She was right. If he allowed his grief to show then the night would be a sombre affair and it was supposed to be a joyous one.\n\nHis head turned to the left as he scented the night air. Caleb and Annie slipped through the trees followed closely by Mara and Demetri. The vampires had obviously chosen to run to the compound rather than bring their cars. He smiled as they approached. Mara looked stunning as a vampire, her man noticeably more relaxed now that his woman wasn't as fragile as she had been.\n\nThey had been frequent visitors to the compound since the attack, studiously ignoring some of the younger members who saw them as solely vampires and reacted slightly negatively towards them because of it. Instances of dark scowls being thrown in their direction had gone down significantly as they almost daily arrived to help out in any way they could. \n\nJared couldn't remember the last time he had noted a youngster glaring at them for which he was relieved. He didn't want to come down heavy on any of them. They were grieving because vampires had devastated their lives. It was to be expected that some would blame all vampires. His friends' understanding and unwavering commitment to the pack had been enough to ease over that slight hurdle.\n\n\"Glad you could make it,\" he smiled when they reached them.\n\n\"You think we had a choice?\" Demetri grumbled good naturedly shooting a teasing glance at Rhianna. \"She nags like a harpy when she wants something,\" he laughed nodding his head in her direction.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Rhianna snorted with a laugh. \"Who was the one who yelled up the stairs that we were going to be late if I didn't get my ass hustling?\" Her lavender eyes sparkled with laughter as she slid from Caleb's embrace to hug Millie warmly and then Jared.\n\nDemetri feigned a mock innocent expression and pulled Mara over to Rafe and Lacey, sinking down to the ground beside them.\n\nCaleb smiled and greeted the Alphas with a warm hug of his own before they all moved over to sit down beside their friends, leaving Jared the only one standing. A hush fell over the compound as all eyes turned to him.\n\n\"A month ago we faced our gravest threat, total annihilation of the pack,\" he said loudly, his deep voice ringing clear into the night. \"With the help of our friends we overcame that threat but in the process we lost many good, valued members of this pack. We've had our time to grieve as a people. I know many will grieve for longer as individuals but the pack goes on with the new life which is growing within us. The official month of mourning is at an end. Tonight we celebrate our friends and we celebrate the continuation of the pack.\"\n\nHe nodded his head slightly and Brody Alexander approached which a heavy bronze sculpture in his hands. He had spent the last month carefully creating the figure of a wolf with its head raised as if baying at the moon. It wasn't a large, showy piece, standing maybe 15 inches in height, but it conveyed what his Alpha had asked for. He had crafted it lovingly, working into the night to ensure that he produced his best work.\n\nSilently Brody placed the sculpture in the base of a hewn out boulder on the edge of the dirt road directly across from the Alpha's house. It was as close to the centre of the compound as they could place it without impeding on the normal day to day travels of the pack. Most of their dead had lost their lives in the general area. It seemed fitting to place the memorial statue there. There was no list of names on the memorial. They weren't needed. Everyone knew who lost their lives.\n\n\"Thank you, Brody. It's beautiful,\" Jared said softly, his eyes filling with unshed tears as he swallowed the lump in his throat. It truly was a beautiful sculpture, a fitting reminder of his people who had died so bravely in defence of the pack. \"Their sacrifice will never be forgotten,\" he said to the pack once he got his emotions under control. \n\nHe sat down beside Millie, wrapping his arms around her and taking comfort as she held him tightly. Slowly, the pack approached the statue, laying gentle hands briefly on the wolf as they said their silent goodbyes. Rhianna joined them, a lone tear rolling down her face as she touched the beautiful bronze almost reverently before she turned away and moved to hug Mille and Jared again. She settled back in Caleb's warm embrace, remembering Ben, Klaus and Hub. Mike and Pete and all the other faces she would never see again. She was a vampire but the pack was her home as much as being with Caleb was.\n\nJared watched Ashleigh carefully, waiting for her to approach the statue and say goodbye to her family, but she didn't. She held herself aloof and his heart broke as he watched her. He was going to lose the little blonde. She was drifting towards turning rogue and nothing he or anyone else could do was going to halt the process. The enormity of the decision which lay on his shoulders was enough to drive him to his knees. He couldn't allow her to hurt an innocent human when she went rogue. He had two options open to him, one he just couldn't bear thinking about, which only left one really.\n\n\"Caleb, your friend Nors. Is he a good man?\" he asked quietly, his gaze never shifting from the shattered girl.\n\nCaleb followed his gaze, frowning as he watched the little she wolf wrapped in her personal misery. Annie had told him what had transpired between Nors and Ashleigh. \"I would trust him with my life,\" he answered carefully. \"I trusted the pack to him and he didn't let me down. But he is a hard man, Jared. Known for his determination and sometimes cruelty. He makes hard decisions and isn't afraid to stick to them.\" He felt he had to be honest with his friend. Nors was no pushover and probably not the ideal guardian for Ashleigh.\n\nHe felt Rhianna stiffen in his arms and looked down to see her glaring up at him. \"You were just like him, Caleb,\" she said with a weary sigh. \"Demetri was a hundred times worse than him too. Don't sell your friend short. Nors has more inside of him than even he realises.\"\n\nJared turned his gaze to the little redhead and gave her a thoughtful look. Caleb's words had worried him but Annie's championship of the big vampire gave him some hope. No one could read a character better than the petite little vampire. She had this uncanny knack of just knowing when someone was good to their very core even if they didn't know it themselves. He made his decision.\n\n\"Will you call him, Caleb?\" he sighed softly. \"Tell him I have something that belongs to him.\"\n\n\"I don't think that will be necessary,\" Rhianna suddenly smiled, turning to see the huge red haired vampire stride out of the trees towards the compound. \"I think he's already realised you have something that belongs to him.\"\n\nThe Weres parted as the vampire strode through them, ignoring them completely, intent only on his target. That their Alpha was allowing the vampire into the compound with no challenge told them that he was classed as a friend, even if most of them had never seen him before.\n\nNors told himself he was only stopping by to watch from a distance, to check that the little wolf was healing okay so he wouldn't have to come back at the end of the year. One look at Ashleigh sitting in her little world of misery tore at his heart. \n\nShe had been constantly in his thoughts the last month. At first it had irritated him immensely and then he started to look forward to his moments alone when her face would come to mind. The deep sadness in her eyes always stirred him, brought out his protective instincts, incited a slow burning rage to start simmering inside him.\n\nHe wished Graves still lived. He would rip him to shreds slowly for hurting his Ashleigh so much. He didn't quite know when she became his but at some point over the last month he knew she belonged to him. That it was an impossible scenario didn't matter. That he would have to wait for her, until she healed was something he had been willing to do until he saw the sick, anguished expression on her Alpha's face. He knew what that expression meant, what Jared was considering having to do and it sent a deep rage spiralling almost uncontrollably inside him.\n\nNo one would ever hurt his Ashleigh again! Not as long as he lived.\n\nNors stopped in front of Ashleigh, reaching out a hand and pulling her to her feet. Wordlessly he walked her across to the bronze of the wolf, placing her in front of it and pressing her hand against the cold metal. \"Say your goodbyes,\" he rumbled softly, holding her still as she tried to pull her hand away. \"You cannot heal if you do not let them go, little wolf.\"\n\nAshleigh bowed her head, tears rolling down her face as he forced her to face her grief. She didn't want to say goodbye, she didn't want to admit that she would never see them again but Nors wouldn't allow her to hide within herself. She wept as she whispered her goodbyes to Mama and Papa, to Karen and Christina, David and Tanja, to Alicia, her little body shaking with emotion.\n\nNors growled softly, picking her up and striding over to the Alpha, nodding his head to Caleb and Demetri, scowling at the smiling youngling with the knowing look in her eyes. She really was irritating as hell the way she kept smiling her approval at him. He turned his gaze to the Alpha who had stood up and was regarding him intently.\n\n\"I said I would wait a year. She will not be here if I wait that long. I've come for what is mine. Will you refuse me?\" He waited to see what the wolf would do. There had been a war over a vampire trying to claim one of his pack. Would there be a second one?\n\n\"Her home will always be here,\" Jared said quietly. \"You will not refuse her that?\"\n\nNors snorted, cradling his precious bundle as she shivered in his arms. \"I will ensure she returns often,\" he answered carefully. \"Whether she wants to or not. She will not deny her heritage though she may need some time to heal before she is ready to visit again.\"\n\nJared nodded slowly, reaching out a hand to gently caress Ashleigh's hair. \"Do you wish to leave with Nors, little one?\" he asked softly.\n\nShe raised her head and looked at her Alpha, a look of longing in her big brown eyes. \"Please, Alpha,\" she whispered softly. \"It is too hard to stay here.\"",
        "He nodded again, smiling gently at her, relieved that he wouldn't be forced to make the decision to end her life. He wouldn't have been able to live with himself if it had come to that. He would be eternally grateful to the hulking vampire who he barely knew but was entrusting one of his pack to. \"Then go with my blessing, Ashleigh, but always remember your pack loves you and will always be here for you. Come home when you are ready to. You will always be welcome here. Both of you.\" He fixed his gaze with the big vampire, acknowledging him as a friend of the pack.\n\nThe big man nodded once, looking down at the she wolf in his arms. She was now his, under his protection with all the worry and responsibility that brought. His life had changed in ways he hadn't even begun to imagine. He lowered her to the ground. \"Go, retrieve what you need,\" he said gruffly pushing her gently towards the heart of the compound. He could buy her anything she needed but he was certain she had personal keepsakes she would want to bring with her.\n\n\"Will you join with us a while, Nors?\" Jared asked, sitting back down and offering him a place beside them.\n\n\"For a moment, until she returns,\" he answered taking a seat on the ground and turning to engage Caleb in quiet conversation. It was obvious that despite his warm welcome he was not comfortable within the pack.\n\nJared sighed softly, smiling down at Millie as she beamed her approval up at him. \"You are so amazing,\" she said softly, stroking his cheek lovingly. \"If I didn't already love you to distraction I think I would have fallen in love with you instantly just now.\"\n\nJared laughed, shaking his head and kissing her lovingly before he raised his head and turned to the pack. \"Where's the music?\" he called loudly.\n\nAshleigh returned with a small bag draped over her shoulder, sitting down beside Nors and resting against his side. He continued to talk with Caleb, allowing her to seek comfort from him but not making a big deal out of it. He listened carefully as Caleb's youngling said something to her and smiled slowly when his little wolf haltingly answered her. Maybe staying for a little while wasn't such a bad idea after all.\n\nMusic rang into the night as the pack relaxed and bottles of wine and beer appeared in the centre of the compound, along with a table full of food. The sombre feel slowly eased as the time for mourning passed and the pack came together as one to celebrate the lives of their loved ones.\n\nAcross the compound, Aaron and Connor tussled together, laughing as they lost their footing and ended up in a pile on the dusty ground.\n\n\"Boys,\" Jen laughed, rolling her eyes at Cedar before she suddenly launched herself on top of them, piling in to tickle them both mercilessly.\n\n\"No fair!\" Connor growled. \"You've got your mate helping you!\"\n\nAaron laughed trying to wriggle away from Jen. \"She's attacking me too,\" he grumbled good naturedly, wrapping his arms around his mate to try and halt her assault on him. She really was the most amazing woman ever. She still had her odd moments when she became stuffy and pompous but overall, she was as carefree and loving as the rest of them, thriving in the warm embrace of the Alexander family.\n\nAaron rolled until he had her trapped beneath him, lowering his head to capture her lips in a long, slow drugging kiss until she was breathless. He smiled down at his mate, kissing her again before he jumped up and pulled her to his feet. Any more kissing and he was going to be testing her tolerance for exhibitionism and he somehow doubted she would be happy with that. \"Love you, honey,\" he breathed softly, running his hands through her tangled hair which was now covered in dust which she didn't seem to mind.\n\n\"Love you too,\" she sighed giving him a tight squeeze as they once more settled down among his family. \n\nLacey snuggled into Rafe's warm embrace, smiling as she watched Jen diving onto the Alexander brothers, her laughter echoing across the compound. Her friend's happiness was effervescent, shining like a bright beacon in the night sky. She knew how Jen felt because she felt the same. She couldn't believe how much her life had changed, how making that one fateful decision to try and get into an exclusive nightclub had turned her life so upside down.\n\nIt had brought her Rafe, her amazing, strong, handsome wolf who loved her more than his own life. The past month had been the best of her life as she had slowly learned pack ways, indulged her passion of being around children and spent her nights sharing the most amazing, heart stopping, sensual lovemaking with her mate. \n\n\"I know what I want to do, Rafe,\" she sighed contentedly. \"I want to train to be a teacher. I want to help shape young, enquiring minds, give them the tools so they can take on the world and win when they grow up.\"\n\nRafe smiled, looking down at his mate, feeling the same contentment he heard in her voice. \"That's a wonderful idea, sweetheart,\" he rumbled softly. \"You'll make an excellent teacher. You're so good with the children here. They totally adore you, almost as much as I do.\" He kissed her gently, still amazed that he had such a wonderful woman in his life, that he was so blessed.\n\n\"It means we won't get to spend as much time together,\" she frowned. \"I won't be able to spend as much time at the club with you.\"\n\n\"Which will make our alone time so much more fun,\" he laughed softly, rubbing his hands down her sides, feeling his body start to react predictably and stifling down a deep groan. \"Damn, I need to think about something else,\" he said ruefully when she laughed quietly and rubbed against his growing hardness.\n\n\"Save it for later, love,\" she laughed huskily. \"I'll take care of you then.\"\n\nRafe groaned aloud, kissing the side of her neck and wrapping his arms tightly around her as he mentally started to run the club's drinks order through his mind. That would surely take his mind off of other things for the moment.\n\nThe celebration lasted well into the night until slowly it began to break up. Friends, old and new alike rose and said their goodbyes. Ashleigh spared a moment with her Alphas and then gave Lacey a quick hug before she vanished into the trees with Nors, walking away from the pack to a new life which hopefully would be less painful than her last one. \n\nDemetri and Mara left next, informing the group that they would be out of touch for a while. Demetri planned on taking his wife away for a bit, somewhere private where they could just be alone. He was still trying to comes to turns with almost losing his woman. It would be a while before he completely got over the events of the month just past.\n\nCaleb waited patiently as his woman decided she had to say goodnight to just about the entire pack. He rolled his eyes, a loving smile on his lips as he watched her stop to chat with Loretta and Cedar. They began making their way over to them as Jared turned his gaze to his friend.\n\n\"What happened to those brothers?\" he suddenly asked. \"I half expected them to show up tonight.\"\n\nCaleb started in surprise, frowning slightly. \"Last I heard Alexei was out of the country and would be for possibly a year. Council business. Andrei...Lord knows what he's up to but it can only be something devious and underhand. Whatever it is, it's keeping him occupied and that's all that matters. The Romanovs are not vampires I'm comfortable having around any pack members.\" His tone hardened slightly as his amber gaze flickered to first Cedar and then Loretta who both met his gaze levelly, their faces calmly serene.\n\nHe could see they wouldn't heed his subtle warning but he had to give it to them anyway. He considered telling Jared of the possible, impending issue which could arise for the pack in the future and then sighed softly. A year was long time. The Romanovs would most probably have forgotten that they were ever tempted to play with a couple of tempting little she wolves. They were fickle that way as was most of his kind. He decided to hold off, wait and see if anything happened. He would deal with any possible fallout later if it was needed.\n\n\"Time to go, love,\" he sighed softly turning to his woman with a gentle smile on his lips. He said goodbye to Jared and Millie as Rhianna hugged Lacey and Rafe tightly, sharing a few words with them before she hugged the Alphas and slipped into his arms. It had been a good night, a healing night and now he wanted to get his woman home so he could end it the way he ended all of his nights, lost within the beauty of her body and her warm, loving touch.\n\n\"Do you want us to clear up, boss?\" Loretta asked as the vampires departed.\n\n\"No, get some rest,\" Jared smiled. \"We can clear up in the morning.\" He turned and pulled Millie up, caressing her stomach lightly. \"Let get our babies into bed, woman,\" he murmured softly, as they disappeared into the house.\n\nRafe followed with Lacey, pulling her towards his little cabin. He really would need to think about building something a little bigger if they were going to spend so much time at the compound, though maybe it wouldn't be needed if his mate was going to go back to school. Maybe staying in the city would be better. They could discuss it later.\n\nThey called goodnight to Aaron and Jen as they headed into their house, laughing when their friends' goodnights were said very hastily indeed as Aaron all but pushed his mate inside. They didn't need to ask why they were in such a hurry.\n\n\"I didn't think perfection existed, Rafe, \" Lacey sighed softly, her voice full of wonder as she wrapped her arms around her mate, luxuriating in the feeling of joy inside her at her new life and all it entailed.\n\nRafe Hanlon stared raptly into his mate's beautiful face, his hands threading in her silvery blonde hair as he tilted her head back gently. \"Oh, it does,\" he breathed softly, his head bending down to capture her lips in a gentle loving kiss, letting her know that she would always be perfection to him, in every possible way imaginable.\n\nThe End\n\n I hope you all enjoyed this last chapter of Worlds. You guys have been totally amazing throughout all three stories, your feedback has been invaluable and really spurred me on to try and make each new chapter better, more exciting and more emotional.  \n\nThanks to everyone, from all the Anonymous to named people, to my challengers who asked me hard questions about certain plot points (you know who you are, boys!) Yes, the boys tend to ask more leading questions and don't get so caught up in the romance of things LOL! To the Guild, your support and encouragement have been amazing.\n\nAs always, WorldHistoryBuff I can't thank you enough for giving up your time to edit for me. "
