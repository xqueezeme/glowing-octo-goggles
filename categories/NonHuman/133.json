        "A little later than planned...but here is chapter 11. My heartfelt thanks to Mistress of Shadows and Angel in Disguise for editing for me. You ladies polish my work so well #hugs\n\nA quick reminder, the reading order of the FTI series is listed on my Lit Bio, as is the various links to Facebook and my Blog where you can join in with competitions and find new stories that are not listed here on Lit.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n*\n\n\"Annie! You're back. For a moment there I thought someone had broken into the bookstore.\" \n\nAshleigh's voice shattered Rhianna's concentration, and she glanced up from her book, startled by the other woman's arrival. It was still early, just past six thirty. She hadn't expected Ashleigh to arrive for at least another hour and a half.\n\n\"And you're here very early. Did Nors kick you out of bed?\" There was a teasing note to her voice as she set the book beside her on sofa and stretched to get some of the kinks out of her neck. She'd arrived at the bookstore a couple of hours ago, unable to sleep and not wanting to disturb Caleb. He appeared to be getting the first decent night's sleep since they'd been apart; it had seemed a shame to disturb him with her restlessness. The bookstore had offered the perfect place for some uninterrupted solitude as she began reading the two books Anakatrine had selected. She just hadn't figured on Ashleigh coming in so early. \n\nTruth be told, she had missed the comfort she'd always found in the bookstore. As a vampire, her appearance no longer aged so being there daily had no longer been an option. It had been almost 15 years since her last visit. The running of the shop had been handed over to the pack, with different members rotating every few years to keep suspicion to a minimum. Ashleigh had taken the first five, and had just recently resumed that role again. Her youthful appearance meant she could pass as a younger relative if need be, but so far none of the patrons had appeared to notice anything unusual. \n\nRhianna knew that they would have to sell the place soon. The mere thought of it broke her heart, but keeping their secret was more important. She knew it would break Ashleigh's too, and that was the reason the younger woman had asked to be the final manager. The blonde wolf had come to find the same inner peace in the bookstore as she did. It had helped her cope with the loss of her family, and it appeared to be a safe haven for her as she struggled with her current dilemma.\n\nRhianna hadn't realised just how much she'd missed her sanctuary until she'd seen Anakatrine's library. It was only then she'd realised that she shared the same love of books as the vampire Queen. Anakatrine had owned an extensive library. Rhianna had chosen to open a bookstore when she'd first lost Rafe. The synchronicity wasn't lost on her, nor was the feeling that a sense of closure hung in the air. She didn't want to think of that at the moment though, and was glad when her friend spoke.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep,\" Ashleigh sighed, running a hand through her wispy, blond hair. Dark, black circles shadowed her eyes and her face was etched with a deep frown. It was clear that she was struggling with the torrent of recent events. \n\n\"Same here.\" Rhianna picked up an empty coffee cup from the table in front of her as she rose from her seat. \"Coffee?\"\n\nAshleigh nodded, her expression softening as she sat down on the sofa. Her eyes unconsciously scanned over the snug area of the bookstore where patrons could sip coffee while sitting on comfortable seats to read. It was her favourite part of the shop. Floor to ceiling bookcases separated it from the main part of the store, offering a semblance of privacy. She sat here often when she had things on her mind. \"Have you seen Rafe yet?\"\n\n\"I called him last night and let him know I was home. I had some things to do before I headed over, some research that may help us.\" Rhianna returned with the coffees and set them down on the table. She took a seat next to her friend, her expression sympathetic. \"Rafe told me you're having a hard time with what's been happening. Do you want to talk about it? I imagine you may have some things you would like to say to me personally, as I played such a large part in what occurred up at the Praetorian Compound.\" Her tone was soft and encouraging; she realized that the emotions her friend was experiencing were in stark contrast to her normally sunny disposition, and therefore, part of her struggle.\n\nThere was a long silence as Ashleigh appeared to try to verbalise what was running through her mind before she sighed and ran a hand through her hair again. \"I've often wondered how you do what you do and make it seem so easy, Annie. I don't think any of us have ever realised how hard it is for you...not until now. I think I can understand a little, because I am so torn with everything that's happened.\"\n\nShe turned haunted brown eyes to the vampire. \"Part of me was so angry that you didn't allow Caleb to kill Thereasa, though I knew you must have had a reason for it and it would have hurt Liam to his very core. I know  that's wrong, but I still had those feelings. I've been working on understanding\u2014or trying to\u2014but it's been hard having that woman in my home with Liam claiming her as his mate. I want Liam to be happy, but not with her .\"\n\nAshleigh swallowed hard and reached for her coffee, needing something to occupy her hands. \"Annie, to have such hatred for that woman in my heart, knowing that I'm hurting my son, is ripping me apart. I don't know how to reconcile all these conflicting emotions. I want to be there for Liam, yet I find myself pushing him further away. I can't bear the thought of losing him, but I can't find it in my heart to forgive Reasa either.\"\n\nThe self-loathing evident in Ashleigh's voice weighed heavily on Rhianna. She stood up and took a few steps away, before pacing back towards the sofa, her heart filled with empathy for her friend. \"I don't always understand why Anakatrine chooses to do what she does. I just know she has a reason for it and I have to have faith in her. There is no denying that Thereasa has made mistakes, some truly appalling ones, but there is  good within her.\"\n\nKneeling before Ashleigh, Rhianna gently removed the cup from her hands so she could hold them tightly. \"You know it's natural to have these feelings, Ash. You almost lost your son and there is nothing stronger than a mother's love for her child. You should spend less time beating yourself up for feeling this way and accept that it's okay to be human.\"\n\n\"I've tried, Annie. I've tried so hard, but I can't see anything beyond the fact that she came here to murder my son.\" \n\nAshleigh's confession was full of misery. It was heart-rending to hear the conflict, the raw pain in her voice. \"Stop and think of who you are...what you are, honey. You are pack and you are wolf. The mating instinct is a part of you; it shapes you personally and it shapes every Were in existence. The V\u00e2rcolac follow that same mating instinct. For Liam's wolf to choose Thereasa means there is something worth choosing. She completes him, Ash. He needs her to help him with his empathic abilities and she needs him, too.\"\n\nRhianna reached up to cup her cheek soothingly. \"You found it in your heart to accept Freya\u2014and Thereasa isn't all that different from her. You welcomed Freya into your life for Nors' sake and you saw how his love, and Dayton's, was able to free her goodness. Your capacity to love and feel compassion is what makes you so unique, Ashleigh Bryant. You passed down that same love and compassion to your son. Trust in Liam. He knows what is right for him, just as much as Day did when he finally stopped resisting Freya. Thereasa will save three souls; Liam will save so many more with her at his side.\"\n\nHer cryptic words were intended to create curiosity and they succeeded. Ashleigh's troubled expression turned quizzical, her head tilting to the side. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nRhianna smiled, quickly mulling over the pros and cons before she spoke again. \"Honestly, I shouldn't really say anything, because this hasn't been discussed with anyone yet. Caleb and Gard know bits and pieces, but maybe this is something you need to know more than everyone else does right now. Perhaps this information will help you as much as it will Liam and Reasa.\"\n\nSitting beside her, she leaned over to retrieve the book she'd set aside earlier. It was old and leather bound, and she stroked it gently as she considered her next words. \"Liam's abilities, his empathy, are like nothing we've encountered before. Oh, I know Anakatrine's magical power seems limitless, but it appears her role is one of guidance for now. She is content to step in, but only when she feels there is no other option. While I was away I dreamed, Ash, and in those dreams I discovered that the vampire Queen had hidden away some of her library, hoping to transport those irreplaceable books to the future, to our time.\"\n\nThe other woman regarded her with a confused expression. \"Why would she do that?\"\n\n\"Ana was always looking toward the future; she realised, so long ago, that there would come a time when we would need to unlock the knowledge bound between their pages.\" Rhianna sighed softly, still stroking the book on her knee. \"Gard has been the custodian of the books since the deaths of the King and Queen. He has recreated a portion of the library to store them, and he took me there recently. This book, Ash...I've been reading it for a couple of hours now. I can just feel that it will help Liam and so many others.\"\n\nAshleigh was peering down at the book, her full attention riveted to what her friend was saying. If something could help her son, she wanted to know about it. \"I can't read the title. What language is that?\"\n\nRhianna smiled, staring off into the distance for a moment, as if reliving a memory. \"It didn't occur to me that no one would be able to read them. Caleb and I can read them easily, but I assume that was most likely due to Anakatrine and Callain's memories. The books were translated into the modern tongue of each era, as the ages passed. I believe this text is a version of Hattic and the title translates to Soul Searching.\"\n\n\"Soul Searching?\"\n\n\"I couldn't understand why Ana picked this book out when I left the selection to her, but I'm beginning to now.\" Rhianna's expression held more than a hint of excitement; she was unable to keep it from her voice. \"Ashleigh, the vampire race has changed so much over the millennia. From what I can understand\u2014long before Anakatrine was born\u2014they were more of a cerebral race. They had a range of mental powers that have long since been forgotten.\"\n\n\"But they still have some of those powers,\" her friend countered. \"I know nobody really uses them for anything specific, but can't Alexei mask his scent? Andrei...he can conceal when he is lying. There are other vampires who can spot deception, aren't there? There must be other skills available too?\"\n\nRhianna nodded, conceding the point. \"There are still those who have managed to retain some of their enhanced mental abilities, but they pale in comparison to what the books tell us we once were capable of mastering. It's as if we've regressed to the point that those powers seem...useless.\"\n\nShe turned to face her friend, her lavender eyes aglow with excitement. \"Don't you see, Ash? Liam's gift isn't a new one; it's an old one that has been given back to us.\" She let that thought sink in as she watched the small blonde's eyes widen in shock.\n\n\"His particular skill was a rarity, even back then, but it was one of the most powerful ones in existence. Empathy was predominately used as a counselling tool to help others, but there were those who viewed it as a very dangerous weapon. An elite group of Elders and Ancients existed who had the talent to Dream Walk...well according to the book there were.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Ashleigh queried in a hushed tone. The tiniest spark of hope ignited inside her as she continued. \"If this book could somehow help Liam...maybe he won't have to suffer anymore.\"\n\n\"From what I've read so far, a dream walker can enter a mind and travel within another person's sub consciousness, their dreams, on the psychic plane. I hadn't read much beyond that point before you arrived, but the applications could be limitless. We know Reasa has strong empathic powers. There has to be others out there who share this ability. Maybe this method could be used to help the injured vampires at the Praetorian compound?\"\n\nAshleigh's mind whirled as a burst of chaotic thoughts rushed through her head. Her heart picked up a beat and there was hope in her eyes as she looked at Rhianna. \"Reasa's the only one who can calm Liam and help him shield when he has an episode. If she can teach him her skills, it will help to calm his mind. Together, you're thinking they will able to do this dream walking thing?\"\n\nRhianna smiled widely, nodding as her friend grasped the importance of the situation. \"Maybe they could, Ashleigh. They may have the potential to wake up the Praetorians\u2014or at least allow us to know if there is any hope for them.\"\n\nAshleigh rose and paced over to the window to look out into the street. She was both excited and confused by what she'd learned. If what Rhianna said was true, it would be difficult to deny that Liam may actually need Reasa's help. Also, she couldn't ignore that Freya had done some reprehensible things in her past; in spite of that fact, she had come to love her sister-in-law with all her heart. Forgiveness wasn't an easy concept for her to consider, but she'd already lost so many that were dear to her heart.\n\nLiam needed Ashleigh as well as Reasa, more now than he'd ever needed her before. Was it such a leap of faith to step back and consider that maybe Reasa had to use her empathy adversely just to survive over in Europe? What did she really know about Thereasa's life and what she had endured till now? She'd made no attempt to find out what motivated the former vampire. Annie was right, it was time to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\n\nTurning slowly, she stared at the petite redhead sitting on the sofa watching her in silence. Annie had risked everything for what was right. She was the bravest person Ashleigh had ever met, and that had nothing to do with the soul of the vampire Queen that lived within her. It was time for Ashleigh to be just as brave, and just as determined to do the right thing.\n\nA soft smile crossed her face and she nodded her head. \"What can I do to help, Annie?\"\n\n*****\n\nRhianna and Ashleigh headed over to the pack compound once Rowan showed up at the bookstore. Aaron and Jen's daughter liked helping out on a part-time basis while she was finishing off another degree at the university. The latest venture was in teaching; the first one had been in computer science. Though she enjoyed all things computer related, she'd realised that wasn't the type of career she wanted. She appeared much happier since she switched paths, and enjoyed helping out with the children's story time session at the bookstore.\n\nAs Rhianna pulled up outside her brother's house, she wasn't surprised to see him waiting in the doorway. It was as if he had known she was on her way over, and it made her lips quirk in a small smile to see him standing there. \n\nHe strode to the car and had the door open even before she'd managed to take off her seatbelt. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Rafe, I told you last night I was fine.\" She laughed as she was scooped up in a big bear hug, and returned his embrace with as much fervour. It never seemed to matter to him that she was a vampire and technically stronger than he was. She would always be his baby sister to protect. \"You worry too much.\"\n\n\"That's my job,\" he answered with a lop-sided grin, turning to greet Ashleigh as she joined them. \"I thought you were working at the bookstore today.\"\n\n\"I was, but Annie had some important things to discuss that affect Liam. Rowan is taking care of the shop for the time being.\"\n\nRafe turned a quizzical gaze on his sister who gave him one of her enigmatic smiles. \"All in good time,\" she grinned. \"Caleb's on his way over, so I want to wait for him. However, you can tell me how you managed to get your mate pregnant again without me knowing about it.\" There was laughter in her voice which prompted a wide grin to spread over her brother's face.\n\n\"I really need to tell you the facts of life? Thought you and Caleb had that one nailed down already, but if you need some pointers...\"\n\n\"He's been insufferable since we found out the babies are okay,\" Lacey laughed, as she proceeded out of the house to give her sister-in-law a big hug. There was more than a hint of amusement in her voice as she looked at her smug mate. \"He's been strutting around like a proud peacock.\"\n\nHer teasing had the Alpha grinning as he gathered her to his side and dropped a kiss on the top of her head. \"Don't let her fool you, Annie. She's been lapping up all the attention the pack's been giving her, too.\"\n\nThe happiness exuding from the couple was warm and soothing. Rhianna's answering smile was full of love as she gave each of them another quick hug. This was her family; when they were happy, she was happy. Things could have gone so much differently, and she was relieved that everything was okay.\n\n\"I need to head over to lessons, so I'll catch up with you later.\" Lacey disentangled herself from them and disappeared into the community hall, leaving the others to head into the Alpha's study.\n\n\"Nors is over at the new warehouse preparing it for Monday's opening,\" Rafe said as he ordered coffee and breakfast to be brought to his study and sat down in the armchair beside the fireplace. \"Do we need him here?\"\n\nA lot of the older businesses were being shut down or changing hands. The pack and the vampires were consolidating their finances and redistributing them into new ventures. Immortality and longevity were all well and good, but living longer required them to reinvest and reinvent themselves every so often.\n\n\"Ashleigh can fill him in later or if we need him, we can give him a call to come home.\" \n\nRhianna was interrupted briefly when Lily knocked on the door and entered the study. She was carrying a laden tray and the Alpha immediately rose to take it from her. \"You shouldn't be carrying this in your condition.\" There was disapproval in his tone, but also a trace of pride. He knew his errant pack member wasn't required to do breakfast duties, but she was there every morning, usually before the other pack members' were awake.\n\n\"I'm pregnant, Rafe, not sick.\" The V\u00e2rcolac laughed, though her pleased smile let everyone know that his concern for her well-being was appreciated. \n\n\"You're wasting your breath there,\" Annie chuckled as she rose to give the younger woman a hug. Her eyes travelled over her face with intent before she smiled again, clearly pleased with what she saw. \"Impending motherhood suits you.\"\n\n\"We'll revisit that in another month or so when I suddenly balloon out to the size of a house,\" Lily quipped as she turned and left the room, passing Caleb on his way in.\n\n\"Are you trying to irritate me?\" the vampire grumbled as he headed straight for his mate and wrapped her up in his arms. \"You're not even home for twenty-four hours and I wake up to find myself alone in our bed.\"\n\nRhianna laughed at his peeved tone and cuddled closer to ease his separation anxiety. It was going to take her a while to alleviate her mate's distress when she wasn't at his side. She would have to put up with it until he was once again convinced he wasn't about to lose her. \"You needed the rest and I couldn't sleep because of what we've discovered. I was only at the bookstore, Caleb. Not that far away.\"\n",
        "\"Does someone want to tell me what you've discovered, and why we're gathered here?\" Rafe's droll tone had everyone turning to look at him and it was Caleb who replied.\n\n\"I think your guess is as good as mine. When I went to bed, very little had really been discovered; however from Annie's expression, it appears she knows something more?\" Caleb phrased it as a question, moving to sit down and help himself to some coffee. He poured a cup for his mate.\n\nAs Rafe and Ashleigh grabbed some food, Rhianna quickly apprised her brother of Anakatrine's rediscovered library and the books they hoped would help them deal with the European threat. The alpha's expression turned incredulous the more information she imparted.\n\n\"Dream Walking?\" Caleb echoed, when his mate got to that part of her discovery. He felt a bubble of hope well up inside at the mere possibility of help for the injured vampires.\n\n\"I think Liam and Reasa should have this.\" Rhianna patted the leather-bound book on the coffee table where she'd placed it when she'd arrived. \"I'll have to use a spell to translate the text into English so they can read it, but that shouldn't be hard. They are the ones who know most about their abilities. It makes sense that they would be the logical choices to read it through and determine what they can or cannot do.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting one little thing, Annie. Reasa is our prisoner, whether she is Liam's mate or not. No one knows what kind of harm she could cause with this new knowledge. From what I understand, you didn't strip her empathic abilities when you took her immortality.\" There was a healthy dose of caution in Rafe's tone as he frowned at the thought. He didn't even blink at the fact she was going to employ magic to perform the translation.\n\nHis sister frowned too, pursing her lips as she regarded him. \"Yes, she needs to be watched. I'm not disputing that fact; but how is she ever supposed to integrate with the pack if she continues to feel like an outsider, Rafe? Reasa has a strong affinity for vampires even though she's no longer one. Providing her with the opportunity to help the casualties at the Praetorian Compound will give her a purpose. That's something she is clearly lacking right now. It will also give her the chance to work with Liam and get to know him as a person. It's a calculated risk in my opinion.\"\n\n\"She's already contacted someone outside the pack,\" Ashleigh countered. \"We don't know the consequences of that yet. If Reasa can move around more freely, won't that grant her the potential to place Liam in harm's way? What if someone comes to rescue her?\"\n\n\"I think we can all agree that Liam doesn't need any protecting,\" Caleb sighed, giving the younger woman a rueful smile. \"On the contrary it's the rest of us who need protection from him. I'm in agreement with Annie. We always use the tools that fit the job, and this empathy thing is what Liam and Reasa do best.\"\n\nRafe nodded. Since the issue at Freya's, he had been reassessing what was best for the pack; it was clear to him that separating Liam and Reasa would only lead to another episode. He in no way trusted the former vampire, but it was hard to dispute Annie's reasoning. They would have to ensure that Reasa was closely monitored. That would mean putting their stronger-willed personnel on the task, and relying on Liam to retain enough pack loyalty to back them up if she proved stronger than anticipated. He'd already considered allowing them to go up to the Praetorian Compound.\n\n\"Fine, it's agreed then. Liam and Reasa will research the book. They'll also be permitted to go up to the Praetorian compound to see if they can be of any assistance. I want a V\u00e2rcolac presence around them though, just to ensure Reasa can't manipulate any vulnerable minds to attempt escape.\"\n\n\"Lily could be excused from kitchen duties,\" Rhianna suggested. \"She will want to be there for Brandon in case he wakes. Kallum will also want to be present, as he's partial to the Praetorians. We could send Elina and Kothari too?\"\n\n\"I'm agreeable to that,\" Rafe confirmed with another nod of his head. \"I doubt any of the V\u00e2rcolac will have an issue with helping out.\"\n\nThey talked a little longer, finishing breakfast as they discussed the best timing for the trip to the Praetorian compound. Despite some concerns, there was an air of excitement in the room. Things appeared to be moving, swinging in favour of the pack-vampire alliance. Whoever it was in Europe that had orchestrated the current conflict had no idea the consequences those actions were about to unleash.\n\n*****\n\nThe sound of shattered glass startled Cassia. Her head shot up, an annoyed scowl on her face as the sound dragged her away from the lab results she was perusing. One of the teenagers helping out in the lab was staring at the door, and whatever she'd been carrying was lying broken at her feet. The V\u00e2rcolac hoped it wasn't anything important that would set them back in their testing. She was about to speak when her wolf growled. Turning her head, it was all she could do to keep her face expressionless as she caught sight and scent of what had startled the youngster.\n\n\"Pietro, can I help you?\" Mallen was already crossing the room towards the doorway where the vampire stood, looking around the laboratory with open curiosity on his face.\n\nThere was barely an inch of exposed skin in view, which was probably what had startled the girl when she'd turned around. Dressed entirely in black\u2014a long coat, fedora hat, and matching sunglasses\u2014Pietro looked like something out of a bad vampire movie. For a moment, all Cassia could do was stare as the urge to laugh bubbled up inside her. She dampened it down though, and chose instead to analyse what it meant for the reclusive vampire to have left his sanctuary. \n\n\"I would like a word with Cassia,\" Pietro answered, the dark glasses turning in her direction. \n\nShe could feel the heat in his gaze, and a slow shiver ran down her spine at the sound of his voice. How could something so simple sound so decadent? Was this how all mates felt towards each other? Her reaction to Pietro since that moment at the lake had intensified, to say the least. It mildly disconcerted her, even as she found herself incredibly excited by it.\n\nCassia smoothed a wayward curl as she rose from her seat and nodded to the pack doctor. \"I'll be back soon.\" While she didn't really have the time to spare from her work, she couldn't refuse Pietro if he'd come looking for her.\n\nFollowing him from the lab, she could hear Mallen talking to the girl about the failed experiment she'd dropped, his tone kind though instructive. She easily tuned him out, her attention fully on the vampire in front of her.\n\nStepping into the morning sunshine, Cassia freed her hair from the clasp at the nape of her neck and gave her head a shake. She was aware of Pietro watching her, a half smile curving his bottom lip.\n\n\"You look like a puppy when you do that.\"\n\n\"And you look like something out of a bad horror movie.\" The words came out with a hint of amusement, laced with a little annoyance. His alluding to her youth rankled a bit, but not enough to dent the excitement that he'd come looking for her. Cassia waited patiently for his reaction, wondering if she'd said the wrong thing and if he'd retreat again. When his lips curled more, she knew she would have seen humour in his eyes if he wasn't wearing glasses. \n\nPietro's gaze drifted down to look at himself. His smile turned into a lopsided grin so unexpected and endearing, that for a moment she forgot how to breathe. \"I guess I do at that,\" he agreed, taking off the glasses and hat, and letting his hands drop to his sides. \"I've never seen you in wolf form.\"\n\nHis response was not what she'd expected and she blinked at him in puzzlement. Where the hell had that come from, and what had he meant by it? She couldn't read anything from his expression and was starting to feel so off balance that she needed to get some kind of control over the situation. \n\nCassia opted to be practical and ignore his last comment. \"Pietro, why did you want to talk to me?\" Her tone held more confusion than anything, until a thought suddenly struck her and her voice turned to a whisper. \"Are you hungry?\" \n\nHe stiffened slightly; it was his turn to be surprised. For the space of a few heartbeats, they stared at each other and it was clear they were both reliving the moment by the lake. \"No, I fed earlier before I came out,\" Pietro finally replied, a flicker of something mysterious that she couldn't quite decipher in his eyes. \n\nHis lips quirked again and he shrugged. \"I have cabin fever. I wanted to go for a run and thought you might like to accompany me in case I get into any trouble. I haven't exerted myself since Europe. I have no idea what I am or am not capable of right now.\"\n\nShe could appreciate how difficult it must be for a vampire of his age to acknowledge being doubtful of his own strength. His admission surprised her; his decision to come to her for support made her wolf sit up and pay close attention.\n\nPerhaps some time with Pietro is exactly what her wolf needed. It might help settle the animal down, one way or another. Cassia couldn't really afford the time away from her experiments, but she couldn't refuse him either; especially not after he sought her out on his own volition. She wanted to run with him...she couldn't deny that.\n\nMaking up her mind, she gave him a quick smile. \"Catch me if you can.\" She shifted to wolf form a split second after she had spoken, her glossy golden fur rippling with brown accents as it shimmered under the morning sunshine. She chuffed at the vampire before sprinting off into the forest. \n\nCassia ran. The feel of the early morning breeze ruffling her fur, the morning dew dampening her paws was...heavenly. It had been a while since she'd taken some time out to be in wolf form and she had forgotten how much she missed it. The wolf could hear Pietro's pursuit and she howled in delight, completely determined to outwit the male chasing her.\n\nShe gracefully sailed over a fallen log as she wove deeper into the forest, searching for dense thickets to slow his advance. The vampire was very agile, almost soundless in his movements. To his credit, he was nearly undetectable as he stalked through the trees. Unfortunately for him, she was not a normal vampire or Were; her ultra-enhanced hearing easily tracked his movements.\n\nThe wolf halted, puzzled. Its hybrid mind clearly registered the vampire heading in the opposite direction. Where the hell was he going? Cassia was sure he knew exactly which way she'd gone, and yet he'd veered away from her. It didn't make sense. She turned to follow him when suddenly all sound and scent of him vanished.\n\nPanic welled up inside the V\u00e2rcolac as Pietro disappeared off of her radar. She burst out of the copse running full speed towards his last known position. Had he fallen and hurt himself? Had his weakened body betrayed him and caused him to pass out somewhere? She had to find him, had to make sure he was okay...\n\nThe wolf howled in outrage as the vampire dropped from above them and landed square on its back. Pietro took her down to the ground in one swift move, his unyielding arms of steel covering her completely. One large hand had an iron grip on the scruff of her neck, pinning her head to the forest floor. In wolf terms, he held her steadfast in the submissive position. She had no option but to yield defeat.\n\n\"Sneaky bastard.\"\n\nIt was considered rude to speak telepathically with someone who couldn't respond back in kind, but the mental words exploded from her wolf form unbidden. She'd meant to think it not project it, but the slow rumble of laughter which erupted from the vampire told her she'd done just that.\n\n\"Yes, I am, Cassia, though a more polite term would have been adaptable.\" He didn't release his hold or shift his position, even though the wolf's body language made it clear that his dominance had been established. \"It's always good to know both your opponent's strengths and your own weaknesses. That way, you can make plans to beat them accordingly. We both knew there was no hope in hell of me ever catching your wolf in a straight contest. I adapted the circumstances to fit my needs.\" \n\nHis hand softened on the nape of her neck and long fingers burrowed into her fur, slowly stroking through the golden mane. \"Your wolf is beautiful; its fur is so sleek and soft, its muscles strong and powerful. Stay where you are, Cassia: let me know your wolf.\"\n\nShe couldn't have shifted if she wanted to. Her wolf liked the feel of his hands on its body, so much so, it was trying to purr! She lay there, allowing his hands to flow down her back, a slow heat building in both woman and wolf. \n\n\"Pietro...\"\n\nShe'd projected again, her hind legs tensing as he trailed lower. It was too much for Cassia and she shifted form, gasping aloud as his hands flowed over her jean-clad bottom and down the back of her thighs.\n\nPietro moved back over her, covering her body once more, pressing his rock hard erection against her bottom as he raised her hands out straight above her head. His breath whispered against her ear as his tongue snaked out and took a leisurely swipe against her lobe. \"Stay where you are, Cassia.\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the blatant demand in his tone, but she was feeling so weak limbed from his gentle stroking that it never crossed her mind to object to it. She was eager to see what he would do next.\n\nPietro stroked his fingers lightly down her side, before bunching up the material of her shirt in order to touch her skin. Cassia shuddered at the first touch of his fingers, as an electrifying tremor coursed through her body. How could something so delicate cause such an instant reaction? Her arousal was almost at fever pitch already, and he'd barely touched her.\n\n\"I lied when I said I wasn't hungry, Cassia. I'm ravenous\u2014not only to taste your blood once more\u2014but to taste all of you. I yearn for the touch of your skin, for the taste of you in my mouth and the feel of you wrapped around my cock. If you don't want this, then say so now; it will be too late if you allow me to proceed further.\"\n\nWas he really asking her if she wanted this? Every nerve ending in her body was on fire from a simple touch. He had to be able to scent her instant arousal and know what he was doing to her. She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out; her answer, instead, was to wriggle her bottom against his erection. The movement dragged a harsh hiss from his lips and a nip of his teeth against her earlobe.\n\n\"So be it, Ni\u00f1a,\" he growled, as his tongue snaked down her neck. His teeth snapped the fragile strap which held her top to her shoulder. Hot lips travelled to the end of her shoulder and then back again, until he was at the sweet juncture of her neck. Pietro licked the spot roughly, eliciting a deep moan. His hand slid under her body to yank at the button on her jeans.\n\nThe zip rasped down and his large hand burrowed under her panties to cup her mound at the same moment his fangs sliced the delicate skin of her neck. Cassia cried out, her body arching helplessly into his hand. He was pulling deeply at her life's essence, the incessant tugging sensation causing an answering spasm between her thighs. Three thick fingers found her opening and plunged deep into her body, the heel of his hand massaging the tiny bundle of nerves, intensifying her pleasure.\n\nPietro stoked into her in time to his suckling at her neck, rubbing against her relentlessly as he savoured the sweetness of her blood as well as her sexual hunger. Sensations overwhelmed Cassia, her need so hot and heavy she was crying out incoherently, her hips grinding as she tried to force the pace of his movements.\n\nHer abandonment made his cock pulse with a heady desire, as his fingers demanded access, demanded the wanton response she seemed unable to control. Pietro took his time, refusing to give in to her muttered pleas for more, teasing her with slow, hard thrusts, taking a moment to graze her sweet spot and make her cry out. \n\nIt was the sexiest sound he'd ever heard and the sexist sight he had ever seen. A sense of male pride flushed through him as his beautiful blonde wolf gave her body to him to do with as he pleased. Cassia shuddered wildly as she pulsed with pure pleasure, liquid fire running through her veins. It was enough to fracture Pietro's tenuous control. He pressed into her hard, sending her tumbling over into her climax, continuing to suckle at her neck as she shuddered in his arms.\n\nReluctantly, Pietro eased his fangs from Cassia's flesh and lapped at the stray rivulets of blood that covered her sweet skin. His fingers remained buried inside her body, her scalding heat embracing his hand. He didn't ever want to move his hand from her. She felt so perfect gripping him. \n\nAs had happened when he'd lain with women in the past, a sense of possessiveness welled up within him. Only this time, it was stronger than anything he had ever experienced before. This time he wanted to beat his chest and scream MINE so everyone knew that this exquisite creature belonged to him. She was his\u2014to touch, tease and make love to\u2014whenever he so desired.\n\nHis body ached to be inside her, to be buried in the wet heat that bathed his fingers. He had sated a hunger he hadn't even known he was feeling. Now he wanted to satisfy the hunger that had compelled him to leave Andrei's home and seek out the stunning blonde wolf lying beneath him.\n\nHe knew he shouldn't touch her. He'd tried to resist her charms, but that fateful moment by the lake had rendered his defeat inevitable. Since the moment he'd first tasted her sweet essence, when she'd shattered so beautifully for him, his cock had been rock hard. He wanted\u2014no, needed\u2014to be sheathed as deeply as possible within her. His lust dominated everything. He would take her here and now, riding her beautiful body hard as he tasted her sweetness. He would worry about the consequences of their actions later. For the moment, all that mattered was claiming Cassia, and loving her so thoroughly that any other man would pale in comparison to what he could give her.\n\n\"Stay there,\" he growled, taking his time to slide his fingers from her body, giving in to the need to suck on them and flood his mouth with the flavour of her passion. She tasted so good, sweet and musky at the same time. Licking his fingers clean, Pietro stood up, a half smile on his lips as Cassia obeyed his command. He had no doubt this was a strange experience for her, but one she seemed willing to try.\n\nThere was too much spark to the wolf to be a true submissive. While compassion and maternal emotions ran deep in Cassia, there was a soldier within too; a warrior who would go toe to toe with any threat to her pack. No, she wasn't submissive, but she acquiesced because she knew it would bring him pleasure. \n\nThat realization made his heart thump hard in his chest and his body pulse with a deep need, something he couldn't ever remember experiencing before. He had to have her and it had to be now. Stripping off his clothes quickly, he knelt back down and lengthened his talons so he could cut the denim from her body. Salvaging her clothing was irrelevant; his impatience wouldn't allow for it, and he knew she could summon new clothes if needed.\n\nPietro ached to touch every inch of her perfect skin and he did just that, slowly tracing the back of her calves all the way up to her inner thighs. His mouth followed his fingers, licking and tasting each savoury inch. A low rumble resonated from his chest as his ministrations encouraged the sexist of sounds from Cassia's lips. He glanced up to see her fingers buried in the grass beneath them, as if she was holding on for dear life. Despite having come once already, there was no mistaking her body's responses; she was ready for more. ",
        "He was ready, as well: ready to sheathe himself deep within her, to stroke her to another mind-numbing orgasm, and to join her in her ecstasy. Yet, he wanted so much more than just a quick fuck; she was worth so much more. Sitting back on his heels, Pietro pulled at Cassia's hips until she was on her hands and knees. A long, black tendril of his hair tickled her skin as he leaned forward and ran his tongue slowly up her spine.\n\nShe shivered and moaned, making his cock flex at the sound. He licked up her spine again and again, taking a moment to nip with his teeth, which sent her into a frenzy of movement. Her skin looked so delicate, but he knew her heritage made her a thousand times stronger than he was, even when he was in full health. Cassia was V\u00e2rcolac: both vampire and wolf. She had a feisty lust that made her the most alluring woman he had ever lain with.\n\n\"Stand up, Ni\u00f1a, I want to see you.\"\n\nCassia rose to his bidding, turning around slowly to give him a complete view of her naked form. Pietro gulped through the pain in his chest, a pain that was there because he quite literally couldn't breathe for a moment. She was truly exquisite, standing before him in all of her nakedness. Her swollen breasts and dusky pink nipples, now hardened with desire, begged for his touch. She had beautiful curves in all the right places, her hips rounding into sleek, muscled thighs that rippled with strength\u2014the power of her wolf clearly evident.\n\nHis gaze travelled to the juncture of her thighs, to that hot, tight place where his fingers had been buried only a short while ago. She trimmed her sex until there was but a whisper of downy blonde curls covering her secrets, curls that were damp and glistening from her earlier climax.\n\nGlancing up, he met her gaze and saw the smokiness of desire in her light blue eyes. Her unruly locks were a tumbling mass of disarray framing her face, and her lips were so pouty, as if he'd kissed her senseless. He didn't know which turned him on the most; the sight of her naked form or the passion still lingering on her beautiful face. All he knew was he had to taste her, had to feel her gripping his cock as he rode them both to completion. \n\nPietro push her back a few steps until she was pinned against a large Ash tree. Moving on his knees, he slid his hands slowly up her legs until his thumbs rested a bare inch from her sex. He inhaled deeply, breathing in her heady scent; it was a perfect blend of raw desire and that unique scent that was Cassia Romanov. Silently, he eased apart her legs, baring her most vulnerable area to his gaze.\n\nShe was simply stunning; her body hot and wet, so eager for his touch. He couldn't deny himself any longer. He buried his head between her thighs and laved his tongue roughly against her sex to drink in the sweet nectar she offered. Her juices were even sweeter when he drank directly from her body than when he'd licked them from his fingers. As he lapped against her, her shrill cries stoked his own need, and his touch grew increasingly wild.\n\nPietro feasted on her body like a starving man, as he fought to keep his fangs from elongating. He wanted to taste her blood again, to nip at her delicate skin, to feed from the very heart of what made her a woman. He struggled for control, and concentrated all of his energy on giving her the pleasure she deserved. Her hands fisted tightly in his hair and she held him to her aching core, grinding herself against his mouth and tongue.\n\n\"Please, Pietro...\"\n\nHe had no idea what she was asking for but the sound of her voice and the feel of her hands shattered the last ounce of his self-control. His fangs dropped and he pierced her most vulnerable place, pulling and licking ravenously as her blood and juices flowed into his eager mouth. Cassia screamed as tremors of another climax coursed through her, flooding his mouth with her pleasure. He suckled even harder as she shuddered wildly, his mind consumed by a burning haze. It took all of his control to remove his fangs from her body, his tongue refusing to stop its broad sweeps against her succulent flesh as he drank in everything she had to give him.\n\nHis vampiric nature wrested control from him as he rose up sharply; his human half was forgotten as he hooked his arms beneath Cassia's thighs and lifted her from the forest floor. With a loud roar, Pietro buried his cock deep into her waiting body. Pressing her against the tree trunk, he allowed his own beast to answer the blonde wolf's challenge and stamp his dominance upon her.\n\nHer hot, tight sheathe gripped him like a glove, squeezing him painfully hard despite the juices he had tempted from her body on two occasions already. He was impressively endowed; his cock long and thick, and sometimes, a bit much for human women to withstand. Cassia accepted all of him, crying out as he rolled his hips to thrust back inside her again.\n\nShe was perfection, her body made for his, her lust matching his as no other woman ever had. Pietro took her hard and fast, watching the pleasure ripple across her exquisite features, his gaze drawn to her beautiful breasts bouncing as he rocked into her. He had to claim that flesh too, had to know every delicious inch of his woman and her wolf. He thrust in deeply and held himself rigid inside her as he sucked a hardened peak into his eager mouth.\n\nHe suckled, his touch rough and demanding. There was no gentleness in this coming together; there was only wild passion and deep need. He was ruthless as his teeth scraped her nipple, and she cried out loudly. \"More!\"\n\nHe bit gently and then a little harder, laving her nipple with his tongue to soothe the ache he'd caused. She whimpered and begged him for more, her cries breathy as she bathed his cock with her juices. Pietro kissed across her chest, rolling his hips into her as he did, catching the other nipple and biting and suckling it as he had the first. Each time he thrust deep and used his teeth on her, his wolf raked her nails down his back, inciting him for more.\n\nNo woman had ever called out his beast the way Cassia did. Usually he had to rein in that part of himself with most of his female partners; with Cassia he knew he could let go\u2014give in to the searing passion within\u2014and he did. Pietro was relentless as he slammed into her repeatedly, his hands hard against her back, his mouth rough against her skin. He was out of control, and he knew it. He also knew he couldn't hurt her, that her passion, her desires mirrored his one hundred percent.\n\n\"Oh God, Pietro. I'm going to come again.\" Cassia cried out the words in a hoarse voice and it was enough to snap the last of his self-control. Thrusting hard and fast, he ground his lips against hers, their tongues duelling as he pushed her that last distance. She was crying out into his mouth, her body rippling around his rock hard cock, pushing him over the edge too.\n\nPietro threw his head back and bellowed into the morning air as every nerve ending in his body danced with fire and he emptied his seed into Cassia's hot body. She was still crying out, still shuddering and bathing his cock with her come as another rope of his seed pulsed within her, and another and another. He thought it would never end, the wonderful euphoria of being in her arms, his body shaking with each powerful eruption. His knees trembled and gave way, and he sank to the forest floor with Cassia still firmly embedded on his cock, her arms thrown around his neck.\n\n\"Fuck!\" The word panted out on a shaky breath, his chest heaving as he held his wolf close. He could feel her heart hammering against his body as he held her tight, her head buried against the crook of his neck. \"Ni\u00f1a, are you okay?\"\n\nCassia giggled and drew in a deep breath before she giggled again, almost choking on her laughter. \"I don't think I'll ever be okay again. That was...that was...there are just no words for it.\"\n\nHer words brought a deep rumble from his chest, his ego basking in the sound of her breathy voice as much as her words. Weres were very sexual by nature, and to leave her this shaken was a testament to his prowess. The ecstasy he'd just experienced surpassed anything he'd ever known, and he was glad to know it was mutual. She deserved nothing but the best...and if that meant he had to make love to her himself, then so be it.\n\n\"It certainly was earth-shattering, Ni\u00f1a,\" he chuckled, his hands lightly tracing her back for any damage from the bark of the tree. It was smooth and silky soft, and he knew he was foolish to check for injury; she would have healed instantly from any scrapes she may have taken. Still, it was in his nature to be a protector, and he couldn't stop himself from checking.\n\n\"Are you okay, Pietro? We exerted ourselves a lot, the run before uhm...before...\"\n\n\"...our lovemaking?\" His mismatched eyes shone with humour as he tilted her chin up to read her expression. \"Are you shy, Cassia?\" His tone echoed the surprise on his face.\n\nShe blushed and tried to lower her eyes but he wouldn't let her. \"There is nothing to be shy about, Ni\u00f1a. The passion we've shared is perfectly natural and I love that you were so uninhibited and took your pleasure as you gave it so generously. Never be embarrassed about enjoying your sexual needs, pretty wolf. You have a body made for sin...and I took great pleasure in bathing in your wickedness.\"\n\n\"Pietro!\" Cassia's laugh was a choked sound as she flushed scarlet and shook her head. \"I'm not embarrassed...oh okay, maybe a little bit,\" she conceded when he raised an eyebrow at her fib. \"I'm not normally that...uhm...wild, so it threw me a little.\"\n\n\"I like wild,\" he growled softly, a wicked smile crossing his face. \"I don't just like it, I love it. I can't wait to be wild with you again.\"\n\n\"Pietro!\" Cassia laughed harder, burying her head against his shoulder as she tried to catch her breath. The man had the cheek to call her wicked; as if what he'd just done to her wasn't downright outrageous! And she had loved every second of it. She had never felt as alive as when he had ravaged her so sensually. Ravaged was the right word for it, was the only word that truly described the encounter. If her wolf had had any lingering doubt that the vampire was their mate, it was silenced now. Her animal was luxuriating in the strong arms holding them, in the still hard cock pinning them to his body. It had made up its mind and now there were no questions left to be answered. Pietro de la Rios was their mate and they were never letting him go.\n\n\"God, I'm still hard, woman. I'm ready to sample wild once more.\"\n\nShe leaned around to kiss him; a long, sensual meeting of their lips as she raised herself up and slid slowly back down his rock hard body. \"Your wish is my command...\"\n\nTo be continued..."
