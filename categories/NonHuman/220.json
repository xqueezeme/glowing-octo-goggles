        "Karen noticed the smiles on every face she passed as she finished up the last minute preparations for tonight. Cole had tried to explain the importance of the full moon to the Werewolves, but it was only coming clear now. It wasn't just the mating rituals. It had to do with family and being together and rejoicing in what they were. They were special. She had to agree. The smiles were infectious and pretty soon she was smiling too. The nervousness was still there, but with it was excitement of what would happen tonight. Her bond with Cole would be solidified, and she would officially become a member of the pack.\n\nKaty looked out the window and saw the pack moving towards the woods, to the clearing. Some were already in their wolf forms, some still human. She jumped when Rhys' hand rested on her shoulder.\n\n\"Little one, remember, once the mating has begun, you won't be nervous anymore.\" He leaned down close to her ear. \"Do you trust me?\"\n\nShe spun around to face him and hugged him tight around the waist. \"Yes, I trust you more than I've ever trusted anyone in my life Rhys. I can't wait to be your mate. I can't wait to be whatever it is I'm meant to be. As long as I spend the rest of my life with you, that's all I care about.\" Her body molded itself to his, so naturally, like they'd known each other for years, not days.\n\nHe smoothed her hair as he held her close. He could feel her heart pounding in her chest. He kissed the top of her head. Soon they would be bonded and neither would ever be alone again. His wolf was close as he felt the full moon near. The time would come for him to take their mate. He was more than ready.\n\nJenna finished brushing Sheila's hair just as Alistair arrived to escort her to the gathering. She smoothed down the last few stray strands and kissed her friend on the forehead. She was looking forward to the day Sheila was out of this drug induced coma and she could help her to understand all the changes that had happened in the last few days.\n\nJeff was staying behind to look after Sheila and the other patients. Normally his wolf would be complaining, but not this time, he would much rather stay with his mate. \"Thank you for thinking of those kinds of things Jenna. I'm not very good at thinking of brushing her hair. Guess I'd better learn huh?\" He stood next to the bed and held Sheila's hand gently.\n\n\"I'm sure you'll do fine Doctor.\" Jenna knew already how deeply the Werewolf bonds affected both parties. Once Sheila was awake Jeff would know exactly what she needed from him. She had no worries her friend would always be well cared for. She and Alistair hadn't mated yet but she could already feel how much they were in tune.\n\n\"It's time for us to be on our way Jenna.\" Alistair slid an arm through hers and smiled as she waved at the Doctor. He couldn't believe how nervous he was right now. You'd think at his age he wouldn't be so worried about what could happen. But this was his first mating. Alistair and Jenna walked out the hospital doors into the compound.\n\nThe sun was just above the western mountains. It was almost time. Several wolves trotted by them on their way to the clearing. The cubs could feel the excitement and their laughter could be heard echoing between the buildings as they raced between the adults on their way into the woods.\n\nJenna pointed to Katy and Rhys but Alistair shook his head and took them to the other side of the clearing. He held her hand as they found an open spot on the grass. His wolf was far too protective at the moment for them to be around anyone else.\n\nKonstantin walked with Tracy, his good arm around her waist protectively. His broken arm had been taken out of the splint and was now in a sling. The pain was almost gone, but his wolf didn't care if it hurt. Any pain would be worth it to have his mate with him the rest of his life.\n\nThe moon was in sight and was affecting Tracy already. She couldn't explain why she felt the way she did. She'd always been shy, and after several months with Gary's pack, she was downright petrified of males. While earlier she had been frightened of her own shadow, her only thoughts now were on the male next to her.\n\nIt looked like the entire pack had arrived and were waiting for the official word for the hunt to begin. Karen was standing with Lila and the female Betas while Cole stood with the males. The two groups were side by side, wolves milling around, impatient, wanting to run. The Omegas were busy feeding the fire in the center of the clearing.\n\nThe visitors wishing to attend had found those they knew and stood in small groups around the clearing.\n\nCarr and Lee walked into the clearing hand in hand. The pack silenced immediately and all eyes were on the Alphas as they made their way to the large rock formation at the east side of the clearing. Carr climbed the rocks and stood at the very top. As the pack watched him, they saw the rising moon just above his head.\n\n\"Baxter Pack. We are here to celebrate. We celebrate the battle won against the rogues.\" He stopped while the wolves howled in triumph in front of him. He smiled broadly. He was so proud of his pack and how they dealt with Gary and his followers, and how they worked with the other packs as a team.\n\n\"We celebrate the new members of our pack and our newly found friends.\" Those in human form clapped and smiled at the human women as the wolves howled in welcome.\n\n\"We are here to celebrate new lives to come.\" With that he looked at Lee who had her hands held protectively over her stomach as she looked lovingly at her mate. This time when the wolves howled it was louder and lasted longer. This was the future of their pack.\n\nCarr grinned. His pack was strong before and stronger now. He looked at the newly mated pairs, so many more than the pack had seen at one time in many years. And now they would have alliances with the Councils here and in Europe.\n\n\"We celebrate the future of our kind. We celebrate under the Wolf Moon that gives us strength.\" And at that each wolf looked up and howled one last time.\n\n\"Prove to the moon that we are worthy of her guidance and protection.\" With a nod, he sent the hunters on their way. The males went to the north with Cole in the lead, Brett at his side. The females went to the south with Karen leading, Lila close to her.\n\nCarr climbed down off the rocks. This was the first full moon hunt he had missed since he was a cub. He looked around the clearing at those still here and saw the three humans that would mate tonight. They were each glued to the side of their mate. He had warned the entire pack to keep a wide berth from them. He wasn't too sure how protective the wolves would be, or the panthers for that matter.\n\nHe took Lee's hand when he hit the ground, and they walked arm in arm to speak with those who were sitting out the hunt.\n\n------------------------\n\nKaren had thought she'd have no idea what to do on this hunt. But Cole and Lila had been right, her wolf knew what to do. As soon as they were away from the larger group, she picked up the scent of an animal. A deer she thought. Lila noticed it too. They took off like a shot through the forest. From the staleness of the scent it must have been about twenty minutes ahead of them. The group ran as a pack until Karen stopped.\n\nThe deer was up ahead. It was a six point buck. He was huge. The pack fanned out upwind of the deer. Karen and Lila would attack from the one opening left. If the deer smelled them he had no where to run where he wouldn't be met by one of the wolves. Once the buck was circled the females slowly started to close in. They crawled on their bellies through the grass. Karen and Lila were far enough out of the circle for the buck to think he had an avenue of escape.\n\nThe buck heard something. His head came up and he scented the air. Wolves! The odor was thick around him, except to the north. He ran for his life towards safety. The wolves took off after him but his escape was cut off by two snarling wolves, one auburn, one blond. His only choice was to try to leap over them. Karen saw him gather himself to jump and she lunged at the same time, gripping his neck with her powerful jaws. The blood filled her mouth, and she reveled in it.\n\nLila held back, letting Karen do this on her own. She was doing well considering this was her first hunt. The others crowded in closer to watch.\n\n-------------------------\n\n\"Rhys, why are we waiting, hmm?\" Katy had been sitting on the ground next to him, but she wanted to do more than sit. She stood up and walked behind him, her hand never leaving his body. It trailed along his chest and then across his shoulder until she was behind him and her hand stroked his neck. She leaned down behind him to whisper in his ear, \"Don't you want me?\"\n\nRhys remembered Guillame's descriptions of the Vlkolak women at the Wolf Moon, twenty times a cat in heat. He smiled as he felt her finger nails against his skin. His body was reacting to her attentions. He reached behind him and pulled her down, turning his head to meet her lips with his own. It was a heated kiss, not his usual Katy, but this wasn't a usual night. He had to remember that.\n\nShe felt hot all over and started peeling off her clothes. She tugged at his shirt to get it off him. She needed to feel his skin. She didn't know why but it was an almost aching need. Once his shirt was off, she pressed herself to his back. She sighed with the coolness of his skin in contrast to the heat she felt.\n\nHe stood to shed his pants and turned around to face her. \"Little one, you were worried about being seen, do you want to move deeper into the forest?\"\n\n\"Why? I want you Rhys, now. I don't care about being watched.\" She rubbed her body on his. She needed the contact with him.\n\nThis was an interesting development, one that was not expected but not without it's merits. He smiled down at her, his pure Katy, acting like a bitch in heat. Or worse, a cat in heat. His hand found her hair which he grasped tightly as he bent down to kiss her again, this time expecting the heat that passed between them. \"I do want you Katy, my wolf wants you.\"\n\nHe stepped back for a moment. She watched him closely as he shifted and she was soon faced by the large black wolf. She got on her knees and put her arms around his neck, holding onto him and hugging him hard, whispering in his ear, \"I want you Rhys.\"\n\nThe wolf slid his tongue across her neck and collarbone, then down between her breasts. He lapped quickly at each nipple which made her gasp in surprise. But she didn't move. His tongue delved lower, across her belly to between her legs where he took a long intake of breath. Her scent was thick with her arousal. His wolf wouldn't be able to hold back for long, and certainly would not be able to be as gentle as the human Rhys would like.\n\nHis flicked his tongue through her slit. She tasted amazing. He wanted to taste more. His tongue slid in farther. She shook with desire. She wanted him, needed him. She couldn't wait. She dropped to her hands and knees. She knew what was expected of her. She looked at her wolf as he moved behind her. She looked over her shoulder at him. \"Please, Rhys, don't keep me waiting. Please.\"\n\nShe felt his tongue tasting her again. She was so swollen, so ready. She was dripping, and he savored every bit of her delicious nectar. He couldn't wait to taste her again and again over the rest of their lives. But for now, he would make her his. His tongue slid from her pussy to her ass. She shivered underneath him. His cock was hard as a rock. His human half wanted his wolf to be gentle. But his wolf was on fire with lust for his mate. There would be no holding back.\n\nHe lifted up and took hold of her hips with his paws and moved his cock in line with her wet pussy. He slid the tip in and gave her just a moment to get used to it before sliding in farther. His wolf was confused when he hit a barrier. And then he remembered, she was a virgin. He pulled out until just the head of his cock was inside her and then plunged forward, holding her hips tight. He felt himself break through her hymen as she screamed his name.\n\n\"Rhys, Keep going, don't stop, please, don't stop.\" She spoke in a breathy whisper. There was a little pain but Katy had never felt anything like this in her life and wanted to feel more. He filled her in a way she had never imagined was possible.\n\nThe wolf could feel his knot forming and pushed deeper into his mate, stretching her around him. He heard her loud moan as he seated himself inside her. He held her tighter and pistoned in and out. He could feel her body tensing. The wolf knew she was close. He started licking her back as he continued to thrust inside her. When he reached her neck he lapped at the pulse, calming her underneath him before sinking his teeth into her tender flesh.\n\nShe felt his tongue and she moaned as he licked the sweat off her back. When she felt his teeth close around her neck she almost leaned into him. She screamed with pleasure as he bit down and convulsed with her first orgasm. Her whole body shook as he continued to fuck her. When he finally let go of her neck, she felt his tongue lapping up the blood until it slowed it's flow. And then she felt his thrusting become more frantic and his paws holding tighter, the nails digging into her skin.\n\nRhys howled to the full moon as his semen flooded his mate's tight virgin tunnel for the first time. He pulled her to the ground and held her tight against him as they waited for his knot to recede. His tongue lazily licked the sweat off her smooth skin.\n\nShe loved the feel of his fur against her bare back. She opened her eyes and saw the pack members wandering around the clearing. She'd forgotten they weren't alone. But it didn't matter. All that mattered was him.\n\nShe suddenly realized she could hear things much more clearly. She heard the flames licking the wood, the occasional pop. She heard conversations going on around her. The colors were sharper, even though it was now dark, she could see so much better than ever before. She felt the fur behind her disappear and her mate's bare skin touching hers, his arms circling her body. A female walked by them about twenty yards away. She felt a low growl coming from her chest.\n\nRhys laughed softly as he stroked her shoulder. \"Don't worry little one, she doesn't want me. You are the only one for me, and I for you. Forever.\" One finger played with a strand of her beautiful red hair. He felt his knot shrinking and sighed as he felt his cock leaving her tight sheath. He turned his attention to the bite wound on her neck. It was beautiful. He couldn't help but smile at his mark on her.\n\n\"Rhys,\" Katy turned to face him. \"I feel her.\" She was smiling. It was amazing to feel the presence of another in her mind, but more than that. Everything was new, seen through the panther's eyes instead of her own. It might take some time to get used to but she was looking forward to it since she'd be with Rhys. A second after that thought she had an overwhelming need to bite him. If she didn't one of those other females might try to claim him for herself. He was beautiful, they would all want him. She pushed him to lay on his back.\n\nRhys saw the change in her face, in her eyes. Her eyes had always appeared fairly cat like to him, but now, the pupils had changed. Instead of round, they were slits. He laid on his back as she straddled him, sitting on his chest. He could smell their mixed fluids leaking onto his chest from her swollen pussy. He smiled up at her feral face. Katy was inside but he was looking at the panther now. She was in control. Her long red hair surrounded her face and spilled over her breasts as she looked down at him. He brought his hands up and pushed her hair behind her ears. He wanted to be able to watch her face, watch the panther.\n\nHer mate looked at her lovingly. She wanted him, she needed him. She leaned down and kissed him hard, her tongue pushing into his mouth and meeting his, fighting for supremacy. She let go of his mouth and slid down to his neck, feeling his pulse. But it wasn't time, not yet. She kissed his neck and down his chest, licking his nipples. She could feel his cock, hard again already. She smiled to herself. This is what she did to him. She lifted up until his cock head was at the mouth of her gaping hole. Virgin or not, she knew what to do. She reached down for his cock and aimed it at the opening and slowly slid down onto him.\n\nHe groaned as she took him into herself. She was so tight. He had to grit his teeth not to cum immediately. He looked into her face and could see the pleasure she was taking from him. Her eyes were closed but he knew it was still the panther that controlled her. She rode him, moving up and down on his cock, as his hands moved across her body. He cupped her breasts, pinching her nipples until she gasped and opened her eyes in surprise. He smiled into his mate's face, meeting his panther really for the first time. He started to thrust up into her, pushing them both closer. His knot grew and he pushed it inside her, smiling at the growl she gave as it seated.\n\nShe saw his eyes dilating, he was close, she could feel his hard cock throbbing inside her and the knot that stretched her. She leaned over him, her breasts brushing against his chest. Her lips found his neck and the pulse beating in time with his heart. She flicked her tongue to taste him. He was hers, he would always be hers, and every female would know it as soon as they looked at him. She felt her canine teeth and they seemed sharper than before. She smiled as she took hold of his neck and bit hard, blood pouring into her mouth. She felt her mate's cock spurting his seed deep inside her as he bellowed. She held the bite until his cock stopped spasming inside her. She let up and licked the blood until his wound healed under her tongue. She looked at it for a moment, the scar was visible to all the bitches that might want to take him from her. They would never be able to now.\n\nHis arms held her tight as he turned them to their sides. His hands never stopped moving as he stroked her soft skin. He smiled when he heard his mate purr. \"So you like being petted little one?\" But he didn't speak it, he spoke to her through their new bond. She continued to purr as she sent him her answer \"yessss.\" He laughed quietly to himself. They laid there together, ignoring the movement all around the clearing. Too soon his cock slid out of her and she slid out of his arms.\n\nKaty moved away from him and got on her hands and knees, putting her arms out in front of her and stretching her back as she purred again. The panther wanted to take over. Katy agreed to lay down as the panther leapt up and came forward. As quickly as the wolves shifted, the panther changed. She again stretched and purred louder than Katy had. Her tail twitched and curled around her. Her long whiskers felt the breeze and wriggled in response as she tried to sense the direction.\n\nRhys watched in awe as his little one morphed into her panther form. She was long and sleek and beautiful. Her coat was the exact same color red as her hair, her eyes the same green. And her scent was the same, mint and cinnamon. She walked to her mate and pawed him with her huge feet but kept her claws sheathed. He could see them and could imagine the damage they could do if she wished. He stroked her coat, and she leaned into him, purring again. \"You're so beautiful little one.\" He looked up for a moment and saw Guillame watching them. At first his wolf was angered, but Rhys was sad for him. He had lost his mate. He reminded his wolf that Guillame was their mate's ancestor and no threat.\n\nKaty watched as Rhys shifted and the black wolf and red panther walked side by side into the woods. They wanted some time together, alone.\n\nGuillame watched Katy and Rhys and for a second was consumed with jealousy. But this was not Orsolya. There was no reason for jealousy. But she was just as beautiful and it made him miss his mate even more. He was so intent on watching them he didn't notice the female who approached him from behind.",
        "Julia leaned in close and whispered in Guillame's ear. \"I decided to stay behind in case you wanted to...\" She never ended the sentence but reached out her tongue and flicked it along the shell of his ear.\n\nHe turned and his eyes roamed up and down her beautiful body. She had already discarded her clothing. \"A run would be invigorating.\" He quickly disrobed and shifted, waiting for the female, and then took off at a dead run through the woods. He led and he had no idea where he was going, but he was glad to be away from Katy and Rhys. It was difficult to watch them together now. His head knew it wasn't her, but his heart was aching. Maybe Julia could help him to take his mind off her.\n\nAlistair and Jenna had watched Katy's transformation with awe. Alistair had never seen a Werepanther before. He looked at his mate lovingly, his hands never leaving hers. \"That is what you will become my dear. Are you ready?\" He stroked her cheek as she looked into his eyes and smiled.\n\n\"Yes Alistair, I'm ready. And please, don't worry, I'm not as fragile as you think I am. You don't have to hold back.\" She held the hand that still touched her cheek and smiled up at him. She couldn't wait to be his forever. Her whole life had come down to this. Everything that had happened in Gary's caves had been meant to be to bring her to this point. If Gary hadn't found her, she never would have met Alistair.\n\nThey had eyes only for each other as they touched and kissed tenderly. She knew exactly what to expect and although for a fleeting moment she had a flashback to the cave, she quickly pushed it out of her mind. She was here with her white wolf, her champion, her mate. He would never hurt her like Gary had. She wanted him as much as he wanted her.\n\nThey didn't notice the horrified looks of those around them when they saw the large bruises and cuts all over Jenna's body. Most had no idea what had been done to her in the caves and hadn't seen her many injuries. Several gave thanks to the moon for protecting her and leading Alistair to her in time.\n\nShe got on hands and knees and smiled when she saw the white wolf behind her. She would be living her dreams. She would live what had kept her sane during the time in the cage. She gasped when she felt his tongue tasting her. Her voice was raspy as she spoke to the wolf. \"Alistair, please, hurry, I need to feel you inside me.\" She had to feel him now!\n\nHe lifted himself to cover her and slid his hard cock into her incredibly wet passage. In one motion he was filling her completely and he began to pump in and out of her. His paws held her tight. He could hear her moans of pleasure and it caused him to move harder against her. She was right, she could take more than he had imagined. His knot was ready and he pushed it into place. He could feel her body quivering around his shaft and knew she was close already. He pulled himself higher and lapped at her neck. Finding the spot he wanted he clamped down with his teeth, her warm blood released into his mouth. Her body bucked underneath him as she cried out. His body responded by emptying himself inside her. He released her neck when her spasming had ended.\n\nHe pulled her to the ground and held her against his body. He could feel her chest rising and falling with each deep breath as she concentrated on relaxing. She giggled as he licked her skin. She moved away from him when his cock had receded and turned to face him. She had a devilish smile on her face as she looked at his cock, still wet with a combination of his semen and her fluids. She dropped her head and licked at his cock, tasting the testament to their mating. She lapped at it and closed her mouth over his cock to suck him back to life. She heard his groan and looked up to see his head thrown back, eyes closed, as he relinquished all control to her. Very quickly his cock was filling her mouth and hard as a rock. She began to purr as she moved up and down on him. He let out a strangled moan.\n\nHe struggled to speak through the immense pleasure he was receiving from her. And if she purred one more time with his cock in her mouth they wouldn't be able to finish mating until later in the night. \"Jenna, don't tease me my dear, I'm not a young wolf anymore.\" He tried to smile but it was impossible.\n\nShe gave one more long slow pull on him and then moved up his body to throw a leg over his hips. Her dark brown eyes looked up at him and he immediately saw the change in them. He also noticed that some of the bruises on her body had begun to fade. His hands slid over the healing lacerations. There might not even be any scars soon. He smiled up at her.\n\nShe slowly lowered herself onto him and began to move. She liked it best when he was deep inside her. She moved as gracefully as a cat, or a panther. She could feel his cock pulsing inside her. The panther in her mind told her that it would be time soon. She nodded to herself. She slid slowly off his cock, and then dropped back down, then rocked back and forth, enjoying the sensations. When she felt his knot she ground herself down on him until he was fully inside of her and locked. It was time.\n\nShe smiled down at her mate and he saw her incisors were longer than he remembered. His hands never stopped their movement over her skin. She lowered herself and he bared his neck to her, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt her teeth tear into his flesh, and roared, thrusting hard, feeling his cum jettisoning into her body. His thrusts slowed and she released the bite. He shuddered when he felt her tongue licking the blood. He wondered quickly what the panther's tongue would feel like on his body. He pulled her down to his chest and wrapped his arms around her. She purred loudly into his ear. He stroked her raven black hair and spoke to her for the first time through their bond. \"We will be together forever now Jenna.\"\n\nThe purring was louder as she answered him. \"Forever my white wolf.\" She held tight to him, not ever wanting to let him go. Gary would never enter her mind again. What he'd done to her was evil. This was wonderful and special. She was disappointed when she felt him leave her pussy. But within a few seconds she felt something else. She wanted to run. She wanted to climb a tree. She wanted to see what else she could do. She looked at herself but she was still human. The Panther wanted her time. It was her turn. She rolled onto the ground and onto her hands and knees.\n\nAlistair watched as the last bruises faded to nothing and the lacerations completely healed. And within seconds, he was facing an impressive black panther. She flicked her tail from side to side as she looked at her mate. She approached him and slid her rough tongue along the side of his face. He laughed and stroked her soft coat, even softer than her long hair. She butted her head into his body, nearly knocking him down.\n\nAlistair shifted quickly. The white wolf slid his body alongside his panther mate. She turned and ran off, her graceful strides carried her swiftly across the clearing, the white wolf easily keeping up with her. She found what she wanted, a tall tree and leaped into the air, catching the bark with her sharp claws about eight feet up. She scrambled up to a branch high above the clearing. This was what she wanted, she needed to be high. She looked down at her wolf, staring up at her.\n\n\"How long will you stay there? I really can't join you there you know.\" He couldn't believe how easily she had made her way so high.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I just had to see the world from up here. I'll be right down.\" Her tail waved in the air behind her as she laid on the branch. She hoped there were trees where Alistair lived. She suddenly realized she knew nothing about where they would be living. But it didn't matter, home would be where Alistair was. She saw the pack watching her in amazement. Wolves couldn't climb. She smiled to herself. \"I'm on my way down love.\" Alistair waited patiently as she made her way back down the tree, leaping the last ten feet to the ground.\n\nShe slid her long body along his, purring the entire time. She never dreamed of being a panther. This was so much better than she'd ever imagined.\n\n\"Do you want to run?\" Alistair would do whatever she wished, except of course climb a tree.\n\n\"No, not right now, maybe later. I want to be here when the hunters return. I want to see how Karen did.\" She found a nice patch of grass and laid down, her tail wrapped around her body. She lazily groomed herself as her mate laid next to her, leaning into her body.\n\n\"She's so beautiful.\" Lee was awestruck by the black panther. She felt Carr's arms around her. He rested his chin on her shoulder as they watched Jenna and Alistair.\n\nKonstantin held Tracy as he tried to calm her fears. \"See? They are fine. There was no pain, only pleasure.\" He whispered in her ear as she trembled in his arms.\n\n\"I-I can't in front of everyone.\" She shook like a leaf. As much as she wanted him, she remembered the time at the caves and what the wolves had done to her in front of the pack. She couldn't take that again.\n\nThe silver haired Were stood up and put out a hand for Tracy who grabbed hold. He smiled at her as he pulled her to her feet. \"Then we find somewhere private. We'll return to the group after you've shifted. I'll not have you thinking about anything but me, m\u016fj and\u011bl.\" They walked towards the woods.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" She was going to have to learn his language or it would drive her crazy. But she'd have a lifetime.\n\n\"M\u016fj and\u011bl, it means my angel. You are my angel you know. You've saved my life Tracy. I never thought I would find a mate. I'd given up trying years ago. Werewolves are extremely sexual by nature, but the wolf wants to find it's mate, and after a time, really doesn't care about the act anymore if there is no mate, and no cubs. That is what they live for. That is the true meaning of our existence.\" He pulled her close when they reached a stand of trees away from the group. They could just barely hear them anymore.\n\nKonstantin knew he'd have to be slow and gentle with his little blond panther. She had been subjected to Gary's perverse idea of pack life and knew nothing else. He would show her how pack life could be, how it would be for her. Luckily for both of them, the Wolf Moon acted as an aphrodisiac for her and took a little of the edge off her fear. If not for that, he doubted they would mate for months at the very least. He looked down at her and stroked her face slowly, bending down to touch her lips lightly. He would take his time.\n\nTracy was torn by her fear and her sudden lust for the large male in front of her. But she didn't need to be afraid of him, he wasn't Gary or Paul. She couldn't help but be drawn to him, to want him. She didn't want to fight that feeling but in the back of her mind, she couldn't let go of the memories. But his hand felt so good on her skin, cooling where she was so hot all of a sudden. And his lips were so warm and inviting. He wasn't cruel like the rogues who had hurt her. He wasn't going to take what he wanted. He was waiting for her. She sighed and melted into his arms.\n\nWhen he heard the sigh he smiled to himself. His wolf wanted to take over but he held him back. It was too soon, she needed time. They had all the time of the full moon.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThe male hunters had returned to the clearing with their kills. They had several deer, a few boar, and an enormous elk. They dragged them over to the Omegas waiting near the fire who would take over the preparation for the meals.\n\nCarr congratulated the Betas on a fine take. They howled in unison at the compliment. Those who were un-mated ran off to find a companion for the evening. Those who's mates were still hunting watched to the south for the pack to return.\n\nCarr felt Cole's agitation. He could see him pacing, he just couldn't seem to hold still. \"She's fine, Cole. If something had happened, I would know.\" The wolf looked up at him, nodded his head, and walked to the edge of the clearing, and waited.\n\nCarr shook his head as he found Lee. \"Over-protective.\"\n\n\"Oh and when I led my first hunt you weren't worried at all? I heard from Cole later that he had to stop you from coming to look for us.\" She stood, arms crossed, with a stern look at her mate.\n\n\"OK, OK, I stand corrected, I was just as over-protective. It's a good trait in a mate.\" He grinned and pulled her close for a long, deep kiss. He wanted to shift so badly right now, and take her here in front of his pack, but he had promised the Doctor.\n\nThey heard a triumphant howl come from the southeast and all eyes were in that direction as the females arrived. The auburn wolf was dragging the largest carcass, the six point buck. Each of her hunting pack had their own kill with them which they delivered to the waiting Omegas.\n\nCole was waiting for Karen. He was so proud, he could barely contain himself. His tail was up and wagging. When she reached him, he licked her face, tasting the blood from her first kill. She was a magnificent wolf. She was everything he'd ever hoped for. \n\nKaren was full of energy after her first hunt. \"Cole, it was amazing. I can't wait to hunt again.\" She ran circles around him, her tail waving in the air. She was practically prancing. But there was something else she needed to do. Her wolf knew what it was. She wanted her mate. Her playful mood morphed into one of seduction. She turned to Cole and dropped to her elbows, then leapt away when he moved towards her.\n\n\"Pet, the pack is watching. You know that, right?\" Not that Cole cared. The pack was waiting for the leaders of the hunt to celebrate their kills. They would mate in front of the pack. He circled her carefully, waiting for her to make a wrong move.\n\n\"I don't care, I deserve the attention, don't you think? My kill was bigger than most that the males brought back.\" There was a giddiness in the tone of her answer. Like she was on a high. Every time she thought he was going to make his move, she shifted direction. He thought he could catch her, but she'd show him.\n\nThe pack watched the two wolves like it was a dance. Everyone knew where it would lead, but it was mesmerizing to watch.\n\nCole smiled to himself. Karen's wolf thought she had the upper hand, or paw. But she was wrong. He would be the victor of this battle. And he couldn't wait. He studied her every movement. She moved well for a new wolf, no clumsiness, light on her feet. But her scent permeated the air around them, lavender and licorice filled his brain. He had to shake his head to clear his mind. She'd gone into heat! He'd forgotten Guillame had said the women would go into heat during the Wolf Moon. He had to stay in control of himself or she would be the one in control.\n\nHe seemed to be able to immediately counter any move she made. But maybe if she made a break for it. He looked like the hunt had tired him out. She might be able to out run him on open ground. She lifted her head to look for an open lane to run.\n\nAh, she was thinking of running. Now he had her. When she made her move he was ready for her and blocked her escape. Now he had her. His paw came down over her back and she was trapped. He moved to her side and shouldered her into an open space in the clearing. She was his. He waited for her to realize it.\n\nSome of those watching weren't sure if Karen was going to give in. A few of the females were laughing, those that knew Cole best. Maybe it was time he got his comeuppance. It was time for a female to take the lead.\n\nShe was fighting internally. She wanted to try to run again, but her wolf said she must submit to her mate. It was wolf instinct and she had to give in to it. She was no longer human. She had to let human instinct go and embrace that of a wolf. She was a wolf now. Karen loved Cole more than anything, she was his, she would submit.\n\nThe auburn wolf laid on the ground, baring her neck and her belly to her mate. Her dark brown eyes followed him as he approached her and sniffed her from tail to nose. She felt his jaws close around her neck and knew she was his forever.\n\nHis green eyes sparkled as he held her to the ground. When he let go, he stepped back, waiting for her reaction. Would it be her wolf in control or the human?\n\nKaren got to her feet and dropped her head to the ground, her haunches up, pointing towards her mate.\n\nHe moved in close, his nose touching her. He laughed to himself when he heard her whine. Now she would have to wait while he played. Her tail moved aside for him and he licked her swollen, wet pussy. She pushed backwards into him, but he moved away. He flicked his tongue out again and she whined louder.\n\n\"Stop teasing me Cole, you've won.\" She whimpered, begging him to take her now. She needed to feel him.\n\n\"I won the day I walked past you on the street Pet.\" He lifted himself up onto her back and hooked his front legs in front of her knees to hold her in place and his cock thrust into her wet,tight channel in one motion. She was so ready for him there was no resistance. He drove himself into her again and again, low growls coming from deep inside him. He wanted to force himself as deeply as he could inside her. His knot was ready almost immediately and he forced it into her, seating it well. This was the first time they would mate when there was a chance of her becoming pregnant. His wolf was well aware and wanted to be sure they had cubs soon.\n\nShe growled with pleasure when she felt his knot. She couldn't believe how ready she was for him. Was it the moon? She felt him thrusting and could feel her body so close to cumming. He moved up over her back until his mouth was poised over her neck. She felt his teeth in her flesh and howled her pleasure which intensified when she felt his seed flooding her womb. His thrusts were frantic as he emptied load after load.\n\nHe held her tightly, and when he heard her howl he was overcome with an even higher level of his lust, something he'd never felt before. His wolf was intent on fathering cubs and continued to cum into his mate. As he felt the last of his seed flowing into her, he howled his satisfaction to the Wolf Moon. He pulled Karen to the ground to wait while they were tied. He thanked the moon for bringing him such an amazing mate. Without her, Gary may have succeeded. He licked her mouth as they laid together.\n\nThe pack was satisfied. The leaders of the hunt had mated and everyone was just sure she would have cubs in the fall. The mated hoped they would have the same luck tonight. Those that were unattached were envious and wished they could find a mate. But in the meantime, a playmate would do.\n\nThe three panthers and their mates made their way to a quiet area away from the fire. The males sat, heads cocked, what were their mates up to?\n\nThe panthers stood in a close group, their mates next to them. They realized, they were bonded to each other, as well as to their mates. They were an eye opening sight. Black, red, and blond panthers, sitting close like they were in a conversation. No one knew at the time, they were.\n\n\"How can we speak with each other?\" Katy hadn't expected this. She looked at Rhys who looked as confused as she.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting it, but it could come in handy. I have to say, this is more than I ever dreamed. Things seem so much different now. And I'm getting visions, of the future I assume.\" Jenna had so many dreams when she was human, but she was always asleep. She was awake and seeing the future now. Was it the absolute future? Or just a possibility? Were there things that could be changed? And she wasn't just having these visions about herself. She looked towards the compound. She was so glad that one vision was of Sheila, happy with the Doctor.\n\n\"There is so much new life here tonight.\" Tracy was glancing at the females in the clearing. She smiled to herself. She used to have a subtle feeling that let her know that a woman was carrying before, but it had been heightened now. She felt each individual cub. Even those who had been conceived this very night. She liked being a panther. She sighed as she thought about how gentle Konstantin had been with her, how patient. After tonight, he could let his wolf take more control. He couldn't hurt her now. She knew how much he loved her, how much they needed each other. She couldn't wait to tell him he would be a father. But would he believe her so soon?",
        "Carr approached the Panthers slowly, soon joined by Xylon and Sandalio. They stood a short distance away, watching the amazingly beautiful animals as they seemed to be deep in conversation.\n\nCarr hoped the panthers would help to save their race. And the women. If Cole hadn't found Karen when he did, what would have happened? He looked around at his pack, at his mate, laughing with the Omegas. He smiled in her direction but the smile quickly turned to a frown. What could have happened to his pack?\n\nXylon turned to Sandalio. \"I think our Councils need to take control of finding the remainder of these panther descendents. They will be the future of our packs. So many more could be mated.\" He looked at Carr's pack and had a thought. \"Are there any male descendents?\"\n\nCarr answered absent-mindedly, \"I'll have Ben work on it.\"\n\nCole didn't want to let go of Karen, even though his knot had receded.\n\nThey both shifted, Karen turning to face her mate. She stroked his face, she couldn't believe how happy she was. She couldn't believe how much her life had changed. If she hadn't met Cole, she would have belonged to Gary.\n\nCole felt her trembling and held her tight. \"You never would have belonged to Gary! You were meant to be mine, pet. The moon sent you to me.\"\n\n------------------\n\nThank you all for reading Wolf's Pet. I hope most of you enjoyed it. I don't hold out any hope that everyone did.
