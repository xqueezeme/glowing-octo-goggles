        "Bob is standing beside me as I look at myself in the mirror. I could not feel more \"trapped\" than I am feeling right now, wearing a brand-new suit and tie. I give my hair a few more quick passes with the comb. \"How's that?\"\n\n\"Like trying to put lipstick on a pig\" Bob teases \"Ain't no fancy suit in the world going to change the fact that you are just a horny old Goat underneath!\"\n\nShe playfully slaps my ass \"You best be getting those fancy threads packed up, or you are going to miss your plane!\"\n\n\"Damn\" I say, \"I hate having to back there, but I don't see any other way around it.\"\n\nI take off my suit coat, shirt and tie and slacks. Bob puts everything in a travel bag, along with other \"essentials\" that I might need for the flight to Kansas City.\n\n\"You got all your shit together for the lawyers to look over, before you all go in to see the Judge?\"\n\n\"All right here in this folder\" I tell her as I slip it into the travel case as well.\n\nI reach for a comfortable pair of shorts to wear on the plane. But before I can put them on, Bob stops me by grabbing both of my wrists. \"This one is for luck\" she says as she drops to her knees and pulls my boxer briefs down to my ankles.\n\nShe holds my cock firmly in her hand, as she licks around the head, as if it were an ice cream cone. The sensations she is creating immediately cause a large drop of precum to form in the opening of my cock.\n\nSeeing the clear liquid glistening there in the light. Bob cannot resist touching it and pulling it away in a long slimy string.\n\nHer warm rough tongue quickly licks away what remains of the small clear bubble... then down her throat my cock goes, with her not so much as batting an eyelash. She closes her lips around my cock and creates a suction as she tries to swallow even more of my cock shaft down her throat.\n\nOh my god; that feels SO fucking good! I must grasp her shoulders to keep myself standing straight. The pleasurable sensations are so intense that if I were to let go, even for a millisecond, I fear I might collapse into a boneless, gelatinous heap on the floor. My legs are trembling!\n\nI tighten my grip on her shoulders and buck my hips forward as cum rockets from deep within my cock...and dives down her throat like a platoon of white liquid paratroopers leaving a plane.\n\nI feel so completely drained that I must sit down on the edge of the bed, to regain my composure.\n\nBob stands up, leans in, and kisses me right on the lips, something that she has never done until just now. Just as I am starting to really enjoy this newfound passion...she sticks her tongue in my mouth, and then I taste it... CUM! She has just given me back my own cum!\n\n\"Gotcha!\" she giggles gleefully as she claps her hands together and dances with delight.\n\n\"See\" she says \"Tom ain't the only one that can dump a load of cum in your mouth. Running around here, wearing a fancy shmancy suit and all! How Ya likin' the taste of your own medicine? Huh?\" She teases.\n\nShe tugs on my arm \"You've got to get a move on... you got to get to the airport, PRONTO!\"\n\nAs much as I am dreading this trip, I am hoping that it will be one of the last trips back, that I will have to make for a while...or at least until I am damn good and ready to go back.\n\nI would not be going back now, if it were not for my family trying to scheme and plot against me, for their own selfish gain.\n\nAfter I put them all on a restricted budget...two months ago and cinched the purse strings shut...\n\nThey hired themselves a crooked lawyer and filed papers to try to have me deemed \"incompetent\" to manage my own financial affairs...and are trying to gain guardianship so that they can have access to all my financial records and take over managing all my bank accounts. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\n\nThey do not realize it yet, but they have just messed with an INCREDIBLY angry bull, and now they are all going to find out that I also have a very sharp set of horns!\n\nIn the short time that we have been here in New Orleans, Tom and Ingrid have both found jobs and a nice little house to rent in a neighborhood near the French quarter; and within walking distance to where they work.\n\nWhile not totally convinced that New Orleans is where they want to stay. They thought that it might be wise for them to at least give it try... before making a final decision. Bob and I assured them that we have no intention of leaving until we have experienced Mardi-Gra for the first time. So that should give them plenty of time to decide if they want to stay or continue around the loop with us.\n\nSo that means that Bob and I have the whole ship to ourselves again. Which is nice, having more room to move around in, but it is also sadly quiet, without the other two.\n\nAn elderly couple, quite possibly in their late 80's or early 90's, has leased the slip right next to us and are convinced that we are \"father and daughter\", and we have not bothered to tell them any different. We just refrain from doing anything above deck, which might lead them to think that we are engaging in incest. Making up for this inconvenience, once we are below deck; with the hatch door closed and latched.\n\nThe couple seem like genuinely nice friendly people. The wife, Margarete has taken Bob under her wing and has been helping her to learn how to cook. So, we have been having a few rather \"interesting\" meals lately, as Bob spreads her culinary wings. Shall we say.\n\n\"I really wish you would come with me\" I say as I am about to head to the airport.\n\n\"I will be perfectly fine, right here on this boat, while you are gone. I have Tom and Ingrid's phone numbers and Mr. and Mrs. Yates are right next door. I am sure that they will keep an AWFULLY close eye on me, while you are gone. Might just have to think of a few pranks to pull on them, just to keep them entertained.\"\n\n\"Play nice, I don't want to come back and find out that you caused both of them to have a stroke!\"\n\nShe slumps her shoulders as if dejected and says \"Alright... if I have to...\" then her face lights up in a wide grin.\n\n*************\n\nMy plane lands at Kansas City International Airport, 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Since I only had carry-on baggage, I go straight to the taxi stand across the circle drive from the terminal.\n\nI give the taxi operator the address of my attorney's offices and hang on for dear life as he dodges in and out of heavy traffic toward my destination.\n\nHow I arrive, still in one piece, I do not know, but I pay the fare and give the operator a tip. And make my way inside the tall modern building.\n\n\"No wonder I have to pay these guys so much\" I think to myself \"Their offices encompass the entire top floor of this building!\"\n\nI report to the receptionist's desk, give her my name, and tell her that I have a 10:45am appointment with the group and settle into an overstuffed chair in the corner to wait.\n\nAs I sit there, I cannot help but \"check out\" the receptionist, when she is not looking.\n\nExtremely attractive woman, about Bob's age, height, and weight. Her hair cut is very stylish and is a bit longer than Bob's ...with similar color, but it is hard to tell for sure because she has obvious \"high lights.\"\n\n\"Hmmmm,\" I think \"Wonder if Bob would like to go to a day spa, when I get back...take her shopping for a fancy dress, get her hair and nails done...generally give her an entire day of pampering!\"\n\nI am jarred mid-daydream by the receptionist's voice, as she is telling me \"You may go in now.\"\n\nI feel like I am being treated like Royalty, as four attorneys meet me at the door and usher me into a large conference room.\n\nWe go through the usual greeting formalities before settling at the conference table to conduct business.\n\n\"Do you want the good news first, or the bad news?\" the lead attorney asks.\n\n\"Give me the bad, both barrels at the same time, if need be...let's just get it over with and move on to damage control measures.\" I say reluctantly.\n\n\"Well, pardon my bluntness, but the bad news is that your Wife, your son and your daughter are genuine Assholes\"\n\n\"Tell me something that I don't already know\" I interrupt\n\n\"Well, they are trying anything and everything they can think of, to take control of all your assets. Just as you suspected they might.\"\n\n\"We put two investigators to work, figuring out what they are scheming to do. Both investigators are retired FBI agents; and you can believe me when I say that very little escapes their scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Good news is, the attorney that your family is using, is a nitwit! One of those guys that makes you wonder how in the hell he managed obtain his law degree.\"\n\n\"By you alerting us early, to potential problems, we have been able to block your family members and their attorney, at every turn and have hidden all important data from their prying eyes.\"\n\n\"Plus, we were able to \"Leak\" a bit of false data to them...which, if they attempt to use in court, will leave them all, looking like buffoons. Then we can immediately put a stop to all of this...possibly even threatening their lawyer with disbarment... for unethical practices!\"\n\n\"So,\" I ask, \"Sounds like you have this situation well under control. What do you need for me to do?\"\n\n\"If you will agree to see a very reputable psychiatric doctor... well known and well-liked by the court... and allow him to do an evaluation on you. Then this should be an open and shut case, when we go before the Judge\"\n\n\"Your family is trying to make you out to be a stark raving lunatic, and that you are depriving the rest of the family of money they need to live on, while you are galivanting around on some foolhardy adventure. They claim you have lost control of your faculties and that they need to be appointed your guardians before the \"family inheritance money has been squandered away\" ... as I believe was stated in their competency petition to the court.\"\n\n\"We have all the documentation we need to prove that you have been and still are, making sound financial decisions. Plus, we have more than enough proof, that your family members are their own worst enemies, when it comes to financial decisions, they make for themselves\"\n\n\"A glowing report from the psychiatrist will easily prove to the judge, that if there are any improprieties, it is on the behest of your family members, and their shyster of a lawyer!\"\n\n\"Okay\" I say, \"When and where do you want me to see this shrink?\"\n\n\"We've already spoken to him this morning: and He can see you in about an hour. One of our interns can give you a ride over there, whenever you are ready to go.\"\n\nThe shrink turned out to be a quirky little man in a white lab coat. He asked me a whole fuck-ton of bizarre questions.\n\nThen he got around to asking me about my sex life. Did not want to lie to the man, so I told him that at home with my family; I did not have one. My wife has no desire to ever do anything, so I eventually just gave up trying.\n\nBut when I told him about some of my escapades along the way, during my trip to New Orleans... the old goat perked up and had a thousand and one questions about that!\n\nAt first, he was convinced that I was lying. But when I whipped out my phone and showed him a few photos of all of us onboard the ship, as well as a few photos of Bob and Ingrid in their bikinis. Plus a few very risqu\u00e9, yet tasteful photos of Bob in various stages of undress... the old man sat up and took notice, realizing that I was NOT exaggerating in the least!\n\nAfter leaving the shrink's office, I had the intern drop me off at a car rental place. I needed to have transportation available to me for the next few days and Unlike New Orleans, Kansas City's public transportation is concentrated in the downtown area only, with Cab's, Uber and Lyft being the only options for travel outside of the downtown area.\n\nI am able to snag a Mitsubishi Mirage that has less than one thousand miles on it. As I pull out of the lot and into Kansas City traffic...I think about how strange it feels to be behind the wheel of a car again. No channel markers to guide my way and certainly no hazard buoys informing me of dangerous areas. Unless you count the thousands of orange traffic barrels that constantly adorn the streets and highways of Missouri. Why fix a pothole, when you can just cover it up with an orange barrel, seems to be the new state motto.\n\nI make it to the hotel near KCI without playing bumper tag with any of the wild Kansas City traffic. Cannot say I didn't have a few choice words for the way some of those idiots were driving, but I made it all in one piece. Which was what was important.\n\nI check into the hotel and quickly realize that the hotel owner's idea of a four-star hotel and mine are vastly different. Got to admit that the place did appear to be clean, but the d\u00e9cor was certainly screaming 1980, the year the hotel was most likely built!\n\nI enter my room, put my bags in the closet, kick off my shoes and lie down on the bed.\n\nAbout the time I doze off to sleep, I am startled back awake by the ringing of my cell phone...\n\n\"By golly you did stop jerking off long enough to answer your phone\" I hear Bob's familiar voice say, \"Other than beating your old cock into submission, whatcha been up to and how are things going?\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, I just got back from visiting a shrink, at the insistence of my lawyers\" I say\n\n\"So, I take it then, that you are just waiting for them to find you a room at the looney bin?\"\n\n\"No, unbelievably, I passed the evaluation with flying colors! Shrink told me that whatever I have been doing, to keep it up! Said I have an exceptionally good, open minded outlook on life and my mentally appears to be that of a man half my age!\"\n\n\"Now what have I been telling you? Ya Gotta keep plugging that ole dick of yours into young pussy, that's what keeps your batteries charged up!\"\n\n\"Wish I was plugging in right now! Don't know how I am going to manage over the next few days...without a daily dose of Poontang!\"\n\n\"I'm sure that hotel you are staying in; probably has a porn channel, if you get really desperate!\"\n\n\"Just keep your dick out of those Kansas City Hookers, they probably passing out the kind of VD that will make your dick rot plum off! Give me a fucking phone call, before you go off and try to tap into something like that...I will talk you through enough of a nut, to get you by, until you get back down here!\"\n\n\"I bet you would\" I say with a chuckle \"So, what kinds of mischief have you been up to today or should I just wait until I get back to read the police report?\"\n\n\"I've behaved myself...or at least I tried, honest I did!\"\n\n\"Okay, what did you do; young lady?\" I ask cautiously\n\n\"I made Mr. Yates VERY happy today!\" she says with a giggle\n\n\"OH MY GOD! Don't tell me you gave him a blowjob! THAT is not a good idea, that could kill a man his age; his old heart won't be able to take it!\" I tease\n\n\"No, I didn't suck his dick!\" she replies \"but I did put on a little show for him, that made him very happy to have us for his neighbors\"\n\n\"What.... Did.... You...DO?\n\n\"I washed the ship today\"\n\n\"And...?\"\n\n\"I was wearing a bikini\"\n\n\"And...?\"\n\n\"I didn't have the top part on...\"\n\n\"And...?\"\n\n\"I had one of your big white tee shirts on...and it might have got just a little bit wet...and seeing as how it was so big on me, my titties might have fallen out a time or two... don't know if he ever got hard or not, but he sure was doing a lot of adjusting himself...while trying to act like he wasn't looking. Old fucker followed me around all afternoon like a damn puppy dog...while Mrs. Yates and I were busy trying to cook\"\n\n\"Just carry a rolled-up newspaper around with you, and smack him on the nose if he starts trying to hump your leg\" I tease...\n\n\"Oh My GOD! Mrs. Yates showed me how to make \"Cincinnati Spaghetti\" ... it is SO fucking good! I cannot wait to make some for you, we can invite Tom and Ingrid to supper some evening and it will just blow their minds, when they find out that I actually made it all by myself!\n\n********************\n\nCannot decide if I am feeling nervous for myself, or for what I believe is going to happen in the courtroom. My team of attorneys assure me that they are prepared for any contingency and that from their perspective, this is a done deal, and my wife, son, and daughter are going to be leaving the courtroom today, living in an entirely new world to them.\n\nOn the one hand, I do blame myself for allowing things to get this far out of hand. I should have put my foot down years ago...and things might have turned out differently.\n\nBut I took the easy route and rather than create a fuss and cause discord, I just allowed them to get away with far more than I should have. Water under the bridge, no way to change it now. It is what it is, and it is about to come to a head...like popping a pimple on my butt!\n\nSitting here at my table, listening to all the testimony being presented, I am both amazed and appalled!\n\nI am amazed by my attorneys and how they are managing the case, they have well documented evidence, to disprove each and every piece of \"Evidence\" that the opposing lawyer presents, and my family has petitioned the court about.\n\nI am appalled that my family would stoop so low as to even try to get something as fraudulent as this, past a judge.\n\nAfter both sides have rested their case, the judge sits there for a moment, looking over his notes. Then asks my wife what her annual income is, and how is that income derived?\n\n\"I do not honestly know, your honor I don't have time for dealing with things like that; I am much too busy with maintaining our family's good standing within our social circles\"\n\nJudge nods his head, then asks my son...\n\n\"What is your annual income and how is that income derived?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly how much I make per year\" my son replies\n\n\"What line of work are you in?\" the judge asks\n\n\"I'm in the entertainment business\" my son says\n\n\"Oh? Tell me about this business\" the Judge queries\n\n\"My sister and I have a Party Planning business together\"\n\n\"How many clients does your business currently serve\" the judge probes...\n\n\"We don't have any clients just yet, your honor...we are still in the startup phase\" My son answers\n\n\"I see\" says the judge\n\n\"How long have you been in this line of business?\" He asks my daughter. \"What would you estimate your annual income will be once this business is in full operation?\"\n\nMy daughter looks panic stricken as she stammers \"we started that business when we were in high school, I forgot all about it until just now\"\n\n\"So, what you are telling me, is that this business that you and your brother are supposed to be in...is a fabrication, just like all of the rest of what you and your attorney have presented to the court today?\"\n\n\"I guess so\" She replies sheepishly...\n\nThe judge leaned back in his chair and said \"Normally, at this time, I would retire to my chamber to weigh the evidence before reaching my decision.\n\nWith this case, I find no reason for me to do that! This is clearly three people allowing their greed to overshadow any common sense that they may have.\n\nBased upon what their attorney has tried to pass off as evidence, I doubt that common sense has been present at any time, during preparation for court this morning.\n\nWith that said, I hereby find for the defendant, petition for guardianship is denied with prejudice!\n\n\"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?\" my son yells at their lawyer.\n\n\"DO NOT USE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IN MY COURTROOM!\" the judges voice booms!\n\n\"Fuck off\" my son yells at the judge\n\n\"BAILIFF! TAKE THAT MAN INTO CUSTODY, 30 DAYS FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT!\n\nMy son then grabs up a handful of papers off the table and threw them on the floor in front of the judge.\n\n\"6 MONTHS in COUNTRY JAIL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY FOR A YEAR?\" the judge demands\n\nThe bailiffs place my son in handcuffs and lead him from the courtroom.",
        "My wife begins to throw one of her usual tantrums...and the judge quickly silences her by mentioning that She, and my daughter could be charged with lying under oath...for false statements made to the court. Their lawyer quickly ushers them from the courtroom.\n\n\"Man! If that ain't a kick in the dick, I don't know what is!\" I say to myself as we wrap up the court proceedings.\n\n**********\n\nAs I step outside of the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the heat and humidity hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\n\"Yep\" I tell myself \"You know that you are in New Orleans in August when the air makes you feel like you need to chew it, instead of try to breathe it\"\n\nBefore I had left, 5 days ago, I had become acclimated to the heat and humidity of summer in the Big Easy. But with the sweat running into... and stinging my eyes, I am beginning to wonder if I may melt into a puddle before I can get back to the ship.\n\nAs I walk along the dock leading to our slip at the Marina. My eye catches movement on deck of our ship. Bob is busy taunting our neighbor, Mr. Yates by lying out on deck in her yellow bikini. I swear her skin has attained a nice bronze color; in just the few days I have been gone. So, I am assuming that this has become a daily ritual.\n\n\"I almost laugh aloud, when I glance over at the neighbor's boat and see the old man sitting in a deck chair with his sunglasses on....and trying to appear as though he is reading a magazine. But failing miserably, at his subterfuge since he has it upside down.\n\nI wave to the old man and press my index finger to my lips as a sign for him to remain silent, while I sneak up on Bob. I quietly set my suitcases down on the dock and climb the ladder as stealthily as I can manage.\n\nBob is lying face down on her tanning blanket, with her top untied so as not to leave strap marks. Her breasts pressed against the deck beneath her, offering a tantalizing view of \"Side boob.\" She has her eyes closed and I honestly cannot tell if she is asleep, or just resting her eyes from the glare of the sun. I move silently toward her, my body casting a shadow across hers. She opens her eyes as if suddenly noticing a change in temperature caused by my shade...and the moment she sees me, she jumps up and throws her arms around my neck and gives me a hug. Completely forgetting that she is topless. Not that public nudity has ever posed a problem for her.\n\nSuddenly remembering that we have neighbors, Bob nonchalantly bends down and picks up her bikini top...and stand there putting it on, as if she had just finished her act at a strip club.\n\nOnce she has \"The Girls\" restrained and under cover once again. She throws her arms around my neck again and gives me a nice father/daughter type of kiss on the cheek. Then whispers in my ear, WHICH is for the neighbor's benefit...I cannot wait to get you below deck and give you a proper Welcome Home! Sure, hope you ate your Wheaties this morning, because we have got a lot of catching up to do!\"\n\nShe helps me retrieve my bags from the dock, then waves to Mr. Yates as we are going below deck.\n\nI just barely make it to the bottom of the stairs and before I can even set my suitcases down. Bob pulls the strings on her bikini and lets those small pieces of fabric hit the floor; then pounces on me like a cat after a mouse! I am almost knocked off balance by her attack and must drop the suitcases and grab onto her naked body to regain my balance.\n\n\"Give me some of that goddamn dick\" she says as she thrusts her hand down inside my pants \"I NEED that fucking cock of yours SO goddamn bad! Don't you ever leave me like that again!\" She says as she is practically ripping off my clothes!\n\nNever, in all my years, has a woman made me feel this wanted and this sexually attractive. After all those years of \"Just go ahead and do it ...if you think you have to!\" coming from my wife. It is absolutely refreshing and oh so stimulating to be treated as a sexually desirable human being!\n\nMy cock is so FUCKING hard that I can feel it throbbing with every beat of my heart. Bob has her hand wrapped tightly around it... working the skin back and forth, spreading the precum that is dripping from the tip, up and down the shaft.\n\nWithout wasting another second, we both drop to the floor, right where we are and I enter her, sliding my cock deep inside in a single stroke. Like a man possessed I fuck her hard and fast...she has her arms wrapped tightly around my neck and has both of her legs wrapped around my waist as we both moan and writhe and hold onto each other, absolutely nothing else matters in this world, but achieving orgasm. When the first waves of pleasure begin, it is as if there is an electrical current passing back and forth between our bodies at the same time! She is moaning \"Fuck me, Fuck me hard, Oh goddam I'm cumming!\" As my pent up cum is released from deep within my balls, I cannot say a single coherent word. All that I can do; is pump my cum deep inside her cunt and giggle like a schoolboy as all that sexual energy is suddenly released.\n\nWe both lie there on the floor, gasping for air...totally drained of the energy needed to move. I roll off her and lay beside her on the cool galley floor. Feeling happy and alive. \"THIS is what has been missing in my life for so many years. PASSION!\n\n\"So, I take it that you might have missed me, just a little bit?\" Bob says to break the silence.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I did, more than you can imagine!\"\n\n\"I take it that you got everything settled in court?\"\n\n\"Wasn't pretty, but yes we got everything took care of. My son is now serving 6 months in jail for contempt of court, my wife and daughter are no longer on speaking terms, because as my wife reportedly put it \"She fucked the whole thing up for everybody by telling the judge the truth\" So... I figure that the next step she will try to take, is to file for a divorce. Which I am ready for, and my attorneys have a contingency plan for when that happens. She will get to keep the house and its contents and will be offered a lump sum cash settlement. Leaving me with only this ship, but all the income that I have been getting from the businesses that I sold. My attorneys and I think that she will end up having to sell everything before too long and they plan to have an undercover buyer buy it from her for about half its worth...so, I will eventually end up owning it all again in a year or two. If she remarries and they can afford to keep everything...GREAT, Wish them the best of luck!\"\n\n\"So, in other words, right now you are technically homeless like me?\" Bob asks\n\n\"Girl, whether you knew it or not. You have not been homeless since we left St Joseph, this is your home now, for as long as you want to live here. If you do not mind an old man like me, hanging around with you ...at least until you are ready to dump me in a nursing home\"\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Bob says \"Don't you worry, I will keep you feeling young, and will suck your dick and wipe your ass when you need it, you ain't going to be ready for no nursing home, any time soon!\"\n\n\"I appreciate that\" I say as I lean over and take one of her perky little nipples into my mouth, Nursing on it at if I were a tiny baby. I kiss her flesh on my way to the other tit, to give it equal attention. He skin is so smooth that it feels like silk beneath my lips. As she lies there enjoying the sensations that my tongue and lips are giving to her breasts, I dip a finger inside of her still cum filled pussy and use some of my own sperm as a lubricant to play with her clit. Apparently, it is still extremely sensitive from our previous coupling as her hips buck and jerk as I use the tip of my finger to draw circles around the sensitive button of flesh.\n\nAs her breathing becomes quicker, and her body tenses in anticipation of the orgasmic bliss that is building. I am suddenly overcome with the desire to replace my finger, with my tongue...\n\nBefore she even has time to protest, I move down and give her clit a lick with my tongue... She grabs my head as if to push me away... but as my tongue flicks back and forth across her clit...she is powerless to do anything but hold onto my head and allow her orgasm to happen.\n\nJust as her ass cheeks tighten and her belly becomes rigid... the first small wave of pleasure hits her.... I jam my tongue in between the fleshy folds of her pussy and tongue fuck her over the edge. FUCK...OHFUCKOHFUCKOHFUCK! She cries out as her body convulses with hard hitting waves of pleasure!\n\nI can taste my own cum, mixed with her vaginal secretions and rather than be repulsed, I feel a strong animalistic desire to \"finish her off\" ...keep doing what I am doing until she is begging me for mercy!\n\nI must admit, the girl is a trooper! She hung in there for as long as she could, enjoying her orgasms until she could stand the pleasure no more, and pushes my head away from her crotch.\n\nShe lies there on the floor gasping for a good while, both of her hands covering her vagina, as if to protect it from further assault.\n\n\"Just where in the FUCK did that come from? Day-um!!\" she says with a grin! \"I never dreamed that you would be willing to eat fresh fucked pussy! FUUUCK, it is STILL tingling!\"\n\nBob and I spent the rest of the afternoon lying in bed, naked and snuggled up together. We had two porthole windows open and there was a nice breeze coming in and so we completely forgot that it was hot outside.\n\nAlong about 5pm Bob hopped out of bed and disappeared into the galley. Minutes later I can smell the aroma of something she is cooking. OH MY GOD, it smells awesome!\n\nNot wanting to make her nervous, I decide to just lie there and leave her to her own devices...when she is ready for me to come in there, I am sure that she will call for me.\n\nI am lying there on the bed, scrolling through emails and text messages on my phone. Looks like I have several rambling rants as usual from my wife, telling me how she is going to lay the law down and things are going to change in our relationship, or she is going to file for divorce. I type \"whatever\" as my reply and hit send.\n\nBob comes in and sets on the side of the bed beside me. Runs her fingers through the hair on my chest and rubs my belly.\n\n\"Are you tired, or still pissed at your family?\n\n\"Little of both, I guess\"\n\nShe moves her hand down and grasps my cock... squeezing it gently as she strokes up and down. \"Maybe if I can empty this for you, then put some decent food in your belly, I can make it all better for you\"\n\n\"It's worth a try\" I say with a big smile...\n\nShe is stroking my cock with one hand, while playing with my balls with the other. Occasionally, she will take her hand off my balls and use the palm of that hand to rub the tip of my cock in a circular motion. causing extreme pain/pleasure to rampage though my entire groin.... I can feel the old familiar tingling sensation building deep inside and know that I will not be able to hold back the flow of cum for much longer.\n\nBob can tell that I am getting close and intensifies her efforts to bring me over the edge. \"Oh FUCK, ... Holy SHIT!\" I cry out as cum erupts from my cock and leaves strings of it across my belly and chest. A few stray drops hitting me on my forehead and cheek.\n\nBob laughs \"for an old guy, you still produce a ton of sperm and even managed to give yourself a facial! I must say that I AM impressed! Now go wash that stuff off and come to the galley, I have a surprise for you\"\n\nI go to the head and clean myself up, then step out to see that Bob has the table all set, complete with a checkered tablecloth, Plates, silverware, glasses, and a vase with some wildflowers in it.\n\n\"Wow\" I say \"I am impressed\"\n\n\"Wait until you see what I managed to cook! You will not believe that I did it all by myself! Mrs. Yates showed me how to do it... but I went and bought the stuff at Rouse's Grocery with the money you had left for me and cooked it all by myself!\"\n\n\"So, what are we having this evening? I ask\n\n\"Swiss steak, mashed potatoes and green beans\" she says with a smile \"we got hot rolls too, but I just heated them up...I'm nowhere ready to tackle baking anything like that. We'll leave that as Ingrid's specialty\"\n\nShe had me go ahead and sit at the table, took our plates, and filled them up. It looked and smelled every bit as good as any I have ever had served to me in a restaurant!\n\n\"Bob\" I say after taking my first bite \"You NAILED it girlfriend! THAT is good eating!\"\n\n\"Glad you like it! I really had fun making it for you! \"\n\n\"Well between your Swiss Steak recipe and my Chili recipe...I don't think we have to worry about starving to death any longer!\"\n\nWe finish our meal and I help her clear the table, wash the dishes, pots, and pans, and clean up the galley area.\n\n\"How would you feel about letting me take you someplace where we can spend the entire day together, doing stuff that girls like to do?\"\n\n\"What kind of stuff?\" She asks, \"You know full well that I am more of a Tom Boy than any high society floozy!\"\n\n\"Yes, and that is what I like about you so much, you are basically a female version of myself\"\n\n\"That and the fact that I can suck a golf ball through a garden hose.\" She teases\n\n\"That too!\" I agree \"That Too!\"\n\nI am talking about you and me going somewhere for an entire day of \"pampering\" .... We can get a couples massage; you can get your hair and nails done. Hell, I might even let em work on mine if they think they are brave enough! Maybe go on a shopping spree... see if we can find you one of those sexy little black dresses that every woman needs in her closet for special occasions\"\n\n\"You know I don't feel comfortable around all those hoity toity high society types...that just ain't my style\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm not doing this just for you! Maybe, I want to see you all dressed up, looking sexy as hell...just so that I can walk down the street, with a beautiful babe on my arm...and make all those younger guys jealous as hell... and leave them thinking to themselves \"Damn those old guys get all the really hot chicks!\"\n\n\"So, Eye candy... you want me to parade around as your eye candy?\"\n\n\"Yea, something like that\"\n\n\"Fuck, count me in, should have told me that to begin with! I LOVE being a cock tease!\"\n\nWe head out early the next morning as we have a 9am appointment at a day spa. I have booked \"the works\" for us both...tranquil hot stone therapy, full body massage (without any happy endings darn it) essential oil skin treatment, facials (no, not THAT kind) nails and pedicure. They promised me that we will feel like a new person when we leave. They did NOT lie!\n\nBob and I were both a bit skeptical of all the attention we were getting. They gave us the couples massage treatment first...which we both highly recommend. We were so relaxed when they were done, it was incredible.\n\nThen we had the hot stones therapy...and we both LOVED it... we are laying on tables together in a small warm and darkened room, there is a sort of a combination artwork and waterfall built into a wall that produced very soothing sounds. The rocks that they put on our bodies were smooth and very warm and oh so relaxing. Bob and I both nearly fell asleep.\n\nWe had some kind of herbal tea and little, tiny cucumber sandwiches for a snack\n\nWe are led to another room, where we are seated in chairs side by side. They apply different scented oils and work them into our skin, then apply cream made from Avocados to our faces and put huge slices of cucumber over our eyes. I whisper to Bob \"Now we know what happened to the rest of the cucumber that wasn't used to make sandwiches...which sets her off with a giggling fit.\n\nThey placed our feet and hands in basins of hot water to soak while we relax with all these \"salad fixings\" smeared on our faces. Soon four girls began to work on my fingernails and toenails. All I could do was wish the girls luck because they were going to need it....to make my fingernails and toenails look like something other than claws!\n\nOnce our nails are done, it is off to the hair salon where I receive a genuinely nice haircut from a pretty little gal in a very low-cut dress...that was barely containing her huge tits. While she was cutting my hair...I was getting a bird's eye view of her bouncing cleavage. At that point, I figured that if she did not want me to look at her tits...then she should not have put them on display like that!\n\nPoor Bob, people were swarming all over her... she had a hair stylist working on her hair, she had one makeup artist applying base for her makeup... another person was working on her eyes and yet another was doing lip color.\n\nWhen all these people were done \"working their magic\" I could NOT believe the transformation. Bob looks BEAUTIFUL! As sexy and attractive as any movie star I have ever seen!\n\nNext stop was a high-end clothing store for women. Thought sure that Bob was going to refuse to even go in. But luckily there was a little black dress on a mannequin in the window that caught her eye. So, we went in... tried one on in her size and bought it. Did not even have to look at any other dress, this was the one! Picked out a pair of stiletto heels and a little matching purse and wore the whole outfit out of the store.\n\nWe pick out an \"off the rack\" suit for me at a men's store...complete with Patent leather shoes and a fedora to finish off the look.\n\nWe stop by a little costume jewelry shop and pick out some flashy pieces to add the finishing touches.\n\nThen off to the French Quarter we go...for an evening \"on the town\"\n\nWe visited a couple of bars and had a drink before moving on down the streets. Finally found ourselves being drawn in by the blues music coming from \"B-B Kings\" ... so we went in and sat down at the bar to enjoy the entertainment. Bob was certainly attracting the attention of most of the guys in the bar, and several of the women. One little gal of apparent Creole descent seemed to be taking a special interest in Bob. She just could not take her eyes off her, or so it seemed. Every time we looked her way...she would be sitting there... watching every move Bob made.\n\nThe little gal eventually worked up enough courage to come sit with us at the bar. Was not long until her and Bob were chatting like a couple of long-lost friends. I could not hear half of what they were saying, the music was so loud. But they really seemed to be hitting it off and having an enjoyable time.\n\nI must have been having a fun time myself because I only vaguely remember leaving that bar. I remember the little Creole gal walking with us to the bus stop... but do not remember anything after that.\n\nI woke up the next morning lying in bed naked with Bob naked as well, snuggled up against me. As I am laying there...taking inventory, to see just how much of a hangover I was going to be experiencing. I suddenly feel movement behind me ... and when I look over, I see the little Creole gal just as naked as Bob and I.\n\n\"Okay\" I ask myself \"Just what exactly did we DO last night?\"\n\nTry as I might, I cannot remember a thing!\n\nBoth beautiful women are snuggled in close to me, so I REALLY hate to move and disturb them. But if I do not make a quick trip to the head...and SOON...we all may drown in this bed!\n\nI inch my way down to the foot of the bed, as quietly as I can...manage to stand up without waking either one of them...and make a mad dash to the head to unload a night full of drinking who knows what.\n\nAs I open the door to step out of the head...the creole girl is standing right there waiting. \"Next\" she exclaims as she starts to move past me. \"Oh, by the way, I'm Gabrielle\" I shake her hand and say \"I'm Rick\" as she disappears behind the door.\n\nBob wanders sleepily out of the cabin \"Morning' Sunshine\" she says cheerfully \"How are you feeling after our excursion yesterday?\"\n\n\"Physically, I feel great; mentally things are a bit foggy!\"",
        "\"I wonder why... Hmmm don't suppose drinking 4 daiquiris would have anything to do with that. Noooo, surely not!\" she teased\n\nBob gets a pot of coffee started while she waits her turn in the head.\n\n\"You were pretty out of it, by the time we got back here\" she continues \"Not that Gabby and I were in much better shape\"\n\n\"You can say that again!\" Gabrielle laughs as she exits the head\n\n\"Well, this is a first for me\" I say \"being black out drunk...and just a bit awkward, I might add ... since all three of us are buck naked this morning. Did we do anything? Be kinda nice to know if we had a fun time, or even just know what the hell took place, because my mind is totally blank!\"\n\n\"Despite our best efforts, no; nothing happened other than we all got naked and passed out on the bed!\" Gabrielle giggles\n\n\"Yea\" Bob adds \"You were just a little bit wasted, by the time we got back here. Took both of us to get your old, wrinkled ass in the boat and down the stairs. Good news is...you are a very pleasant drunk to deal with. You kept thanking us for bringing you home and kept apologizing for being intoxicated\"\n\n\"One of the friendliest drunks I have been around in a long time\" Gabrielle interjects.\n\n\"So, can anyone explain the nudity this morning? Because when I woke up, we were all three snuggled together in the bed!\"\n\n\"Gabby and I had intended to take advantage of you in your delicate state, and have our way with you\" Bob teased\n\n\"But while we were undressing you, you passed out on us completely... and we couldn't get any kind of response out of you... even though we both tried\" Gabrielle adds\n\n\"So, we admit it...we both tried to suck your dick while you were passed out, but must have passed out ourselves\" Bob explains\n\n\"So, technically kind sir, your chastity has not been sullied by the lust of us wayward women\" Gabrielle teases\n\n\"Damn, wish I had been aware that all that was going on, sounds like it might have been a fun way to end the evening!\" I reply\n\n\"After I get some coffee in me, I'm not opposed to picking up where the action left off last night\" Gabrielle adds\n\nBob and I look at each other and smile...\n\nWe sit there drinking our coffee and chatting for a bit. Turns out that Gabrielle, or Gabby as she prefers to be called. Is a second-year med. student at Tulane University and her goal is to become a pediatrician. Tells us that she rarely leaves Campus but felt like she really needed a break and ended up at \"B-B King's\" last night...hoping to find something fun to do, to take her mind off her studies. She saw us there, and was immediately attracted to Bob, because she reminded her so much, of her best friend from high school, that she just had to approach her and strike up a conversation, just to be certain.\n\nLong story short, Gabby and Bob talk for a while before Bob, in a moment of alcohol induced bravado, asks her if she would be interested in a little three-way action. Bob told her \"I promised Rick that I would find us a girl to have a three-way with sometime and if you are interested, you are my choice.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we didn't consider the amount of alcohol that they were putting in our drinks\" Bob explains \"you know the rest of the story of what happened after that\"\n\n\"At least we all seemed to have had a good time\" I comment\n\n\"This is SO out of character for me, to even think about doing anything like this.\" Gabby says \"Especially now that I am sober! I have never done anything like this before.\n\nMy best friend and I experimented a bit back in high school and I have had a boyfriend or two that talked about wanting to have a threesome sometime...but it never happened.\n\nSo, I am here now, and obviously already naked, if you two are still interested in doing something...count me in! Let's get this party started before I come to my sense and run out of her screaming!\"\n\nBob slides over next to Gabby and puts one arm around her naked body...then uses her other hand to caress the side of her face and run her fingers though her hair. \"I can make you scream baby, but it won't be out of fear!\"\n\nI am sitting there taking all of this in, amazed at how easily these two women go from making small talk to making out!\n\nBob and Gabby begin kissing each other deeply. Groping and exploring each other's bodies. While I am sitting here on the sideline with a growing hard on...wondering how... or if I even should, try to enter this picture of sapphic splendor.\n\nThe girls took that decision away from me. They both get up from their chairs and both reach out a hand to me as if to say, \"come with us\" and lead me back to the cabin.\n\nAs soon as we are inside the door, Bob throws her arms around my neck and gives me a kiss as deep and as enthusiastic as any she had just given Gabby.\n\nAs soon as she and I broke free from our kiss, Gabby took her place. By the time both girls were done...I was so sexually excited that I could not believe that the heat of such passion, was even possible... let alone survivable!\n\nBob pulls a long scarf out of a drawer and says, \"Want to play a game?\" She then wraps the scarf around my head and ties it...so that I cannot see a thing.\n\nBoth girls then help me to lie back on the bed as Bob explains\n\n\"this game is called CAN YOU TELL A DIFFERNCE...Gabby and I are going to do some things to you, and you have to guess which one of us is doing it! Absolutely NOTHING painful or anything like that; this is just for fun.\"\n\nThe girls then lie down next to me...and begin to have their fun... First one of the girls gives me a passionate kiss. Based upon the kisses that they had given me moments ago; I correctly guess that Bob has kissed me.\n\nThen I feel someone licking the nipples on my chest, and I must admit I was finding that to be very arousing. Since I had never experienced that before...I assumed that it was Gabby that was doing that to me....and stated as much and I am now 2 for 2\n\nOne of them grabs ahold of my cock and runs their fingers up and down the shaft...then cups my balls. I can feel hot breath on the head of my cock, just as a warm pair of lips touch the head of it; to give it a kiss. I feel a wet rough tongue swirl around the head of it...before the lips close and my cock is swallowed whole. The muscles of a throat are massaging my cock. I can feel lips sliding up and off from my cock for only a second, before sliding right back down again...as if trying to milk my cock.\n\n\"That has GOT to be Bob\" I call out\n\nThe sensations stop and both girls say \"Wrong\" in unison\n\nThe scarf is untied, and my eyes are uncovered...\n\n\"We cheated\" Bob giggles \"That was both of us! Me first and Gabby second\"\n\n\"Oh my god, then I am definitely in danger! I am in the presence to two cock swallowing masters\"\n\nBoth girl's giggle. Bob gives me a very passionate kiss while Gabby goes back to work on my cock. THIS I could really learn to love. I enjoy exchanging passionate kisses and I enjoy having my cock sucked. This is the first time that I have had the privilege of experiencing both at the same time.\n\nBob changes places with Gabby but instead of sucking my cock, she straddles my thighs and lowers her pussy onto the spit slick shaft...sliding down clear to my balls in one smooth movement.\n\nAs she begins to bounce up and down on my cock. Gabby stands up in the bed. Steps in between Bob and I and holds open her labia lips as an open invitation for my tongue!\n\nHer vagina is sparsely covered with dark curly hair which tickles my nose as I apply my tongue to her clit. She gasps as soon as my tongue makes contact, then presses her pussy tighter against my face. I reach up and cup her small round ass cheeks in my hands...partly to help her keep her balance while standing on the bed...but also because I just wanted to touch and squeeze that cute little ass of hers...\n\nMoments later, the girls decide to swap places again... Bob slides off my cock with a wet sucking sound...Gabby gets herself into position and impales herself on my cock. Causing all of us to laugh when her pussy queefs a few times as she slides up and down. Her pussy squeezes my cock as tight as any fist. If she keeps this up; I am not going to be able to hold on much longer...and I tell her as much.\n\n\"Go for it\" she says \"I've got an IUD in place, no worries\"\n\nAs if on cue, my cock erupts and fills her vagina with my hot sperm. As she slides off my cum slick cock, Bob is right there to clean up the mess for us...she gives my cock a few quick licks to clean the cum off it...then dives right in to suck the creamy filling, fresh from inside of Gabby's pussy.\n\nGabby lays back and grabs handfuls of bed sheets as she rides out a wave of orgasm caused by Bob's efforts. She lies there moaning \"Oh.... Yes.... Yes... Oh fuck.... Oh fuck...Oh fuckfuckfuck fuck fuck as wave after wave of pleasure courses through her body.\n\nSince Bob is in an \"head down, ass up\" position, I decide to flip myself around and give her a taste of her own medicine. I slip my head up under her body, grab a nice handful of ass cheeks, and lick her wet pussy bottom to top, then top to bottom...I feel her tense as my tongue contacts her swollen clit. It only takes a moment of licking until she begins to buck and moan as her orgasm explodes in her groin.\n\nSo there the three of us are.... Bob with her face buried in Gabby's crotch, while I have my face buried in Bob's crotch, both of the girls are in the throes of full-blown orgasms and my cock is standing at full attention yet again!\n\nThat was when I felt someone touching my cock and hear a voice say \"Glad to see that nothing has changed around here\"\n\nI stop what I am doing long enough to investigate where the voice is coming from, and who is speaking...\n\nTom and Ingrid are standing beside the bed, both with a huge grin \"Mind if we join in?\" Tom asks\n\n\"The more the merrier\" I say before turning my attention back to Bob's pussy.\n\nTom and Ingrid quickly strip off their clothes... Ingrid hops on the bed beside me and begins to suck my cock. While Tom goes to the other end of the bed to offer his cock to Gabby just in case, she needs something to play with while Bob is eating her pussy.\n\nIngrid decides to go for a ride on my cock and just as she impales herself to the hilt on it...I suddenly realize that she did not put a condom on my cock...and stop what I am doing to remind her before we go any further!\n\n\"It's all right! Don't worry, I went to the doctor after I got my first paycheck and she talked me into getting an IUD. Now we can do it and not worry about getting pregnant until we are ready to have kids!\"\n\nGabby pulls Tom's cock out of her mouth and says to Ingrid \"Kyleena?\"\n\n\"YES!\" Ingrid replies\n\n\"Hi, I'm Gabrielle, just call me Gabby...that is the same kind of IUD that I have\"\n\n\"Do you like it, have you had any troubles with it?\" Ingrid asks\n\n\"GIRLS!\" Tom says loudly \"We gonna sit here exchanging recipes and gossip ...or... are we gonna fuck?\"\n\n\"Sorry\" said Ingrid as she began to bounce up and down on my cock again.\n\nGabby manages to bring Tom to orgasm quickly... he groans, quivers, and shakes as his cock empties its load into her mouth.\n\nAs Tom steps back to allow his spent cock time to recuperate... Gabby pulls Bob up to face-to-face level....and the girls kiss \"snowballing\" Tom's cum in the process.\n\nWatching all of this happen from my vantage point.... with Ingrid's tight pussy still working its magic on me... I hang onto her thighs as my cock spews forth yet another load. Deep into her tight pussy!\n\nWe all lie there on the bed for a bit, catching our breath.\n\nFinally, Bob hops up on all fours and says, \"Boy's I appear to be the only one that is behind in the orgasm count, how about you give me a spit roast and help me catch up?\"\n\nSince I am in front of her, I get up on my knees...give my old cock a few strokes to let it know it is time to get back on duty. Bob slides my cock into her mouth and her tongue and throat muscles do the rest, to bring my cock back to life!\n\nTom gets up on the bed behind Bob... Gives his cock a few strokes as well, which instantly brings it back to full mast...\n\nHe aims the head of his cock at Bob's pink wet hole...and slides it in; all in one smooth move.\n\nUnlike the DP that we had done before, this was much easier for us to get into a workable rhythm... All Bob had to do was allow our cocks to use the orifices on each end of her body...for our own lustful needs.\n\nHaving cum earlier, it took us both a while to build up another one. But build it we did! There couldn't have been more than a millisecond between Tom, and I starting to groan and shoot our hot loads of cum into her at the same time!\n\nHer greedy mouth and equally as greedy pussy took our loads like champions. Her pussy milked every drop of cum from Tom's cock and her throat muscles milked the last dregs of cum from my cock as well.\n\nI collapse on the bed, and Ingrid and Gabby both snuggle in beside me. Tom and Bob snuggle up together at the foot of the bed.\n\nIngrid and Gabby are both caressing my chest and belly and dipping their hands down toward my cock.\n\nI make the sign of a cross with my two index fingers and say \"Girls, I am an old man...I have GOT to rest for a bit. If I try to cum again, the only thing I have left to shoot out....is DUST!\n\nWe all eventually decide to get dressed and go topside where we can at least enjoy a breeze. It is hot and humid in the cabin and smells of raw sex!\n\nTurns out, the reason that Tom and Ingrid have dropped by, is to tell Bob and I some news... Number one...they have plans to be married in two months, in a little courtyard wedding venue near where they both work... and they want Bob to serve as Bridesmaid and for me to serve as Best Man.\n\nThey even ask Gabby if she would consider being a bridesmaid as well. \"I realize we just met you today, but I think we have gotten acquainted well enough to ask you\" Ingrid teased\n\nGabby agrees...\n\nSecond thing we want to tell you, is that we have decided that we really do like it here in New Orleans, and we have decided to stay. The little house that we are renting, is going to be offered for sale soon, and we are hoping that we can come up with enough money for a down payment on it...and make that our permanent home. It was not touched by any flood waters during Katrina, it is a nice solid house, might need a little fixing up here and there, but I think it will make a wonderful place for us to live and to raise a family when the time comes.\n\nAs if a lightbulb suddenly turned on in my head...an idea struck me that this might be a way for me to give these wonderful young people a boost up in life!\n\nDon't want to make the same mistake with them, that I made with my own children...by just giving them what they want.\n\nSo, I ask Tom \"What are they asking for the property if you don't mind me asking?\"\n\n\"The landlord hasn't set a price yet, as far as we know...but I am guessing he will ask anywhere from 80,000 on the low end...to 130,000 on the high end.\"\n\n\"A TON of money for a house, but if we buy it... it will eventually be ours. If we continue to rent...we pay out the same amount of money and have absolutely nothing to show for it, in the end.\n\nPlus, we are at the mercy of the property owners they can boot us out any time they want...especially If they think they can get someone else to pay more rent.\"\n\n\"What are your thoughts about \"rent to own?\" I ask\n\n\"That would be awesome, if we could find a deal like that\" Tom says \"But most of the places we have looked into that offer something like that...are basically just dumps! Too far gone for a property owner to rent out, so they try to sucker someone in with a rent to own scam\"\n\n\"What if you knew and trusted the person offering the rent to own deal, and the house being offered was one that you both really wanted...like the one you are living in now? Rent the home for a set amount per month, so that you can budget.\n\nWouldn't be paying in interest so the money you spend on rent actually goes directly toward paying for the house...and if things change and you both decide that you no longer want to Live in New Orleans, you can just notify the landlord of such...and walk away from the deal...without having to deal with trying to sell the house and get your investment back?\"\n\n\"That would be a miracle deal! That could set us up for life! Problem is, I don't even have any idea where to go or where to look for a deal like that...and even if we could find one... I have no idea how long it might take us to save up enough money to pay for insurance and repairs\"\n\n\"Can you give me a phone number for your landlord?\"\n\n\"Sure, I got it right here on my phone. Why?\"\n\n\"Well, since I have really taken a liking to you and Ingrid and have recently had to rethink my financial situation, because of family issues. I would like to do something to help You and Ingrid get a start in life.\n\nI want to buy that house and offer it to you, just like we just talked about...on a rent to own basis, I will take care of taxes and insurance on the property, and I will pay for any repairs that you say need to be done. But if you decide to move on...you are free to do so, without any encumbrances. If you stay, when you have paid what I originally paid for the house. I sign the property over to you free and clear!\"\n\n\"Oh my god, I hadn't even thought about taxes!\" Tom replied\n\n\"Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this, because we will never be able to thank you enough for helping us out like this... but at the same time, we would never be able to forgive ourselves if we felt like we had taken advantage of your generosity in some way! We would rather do without as do anything like that!\"\n\n\"It is because I know in my heart that you would never do anything like that...which is exactly why I am making you this offer! Consider it a wedding present from me! \"\n\nWith tears in his eyes Tom swooped in for one of his quick \"man hugs\" but quickly switched to a full-on bear hug filled with genuine emotion...as he whispers, \"Thank you so much Bro.\"\n\nHe was going to go tell Ingrid the good news until I stopped him. \"Give me the guy's phone number first...and let me make a few calls. That way we will not get her hopes up, in case this whole idea goes down in flames\"\n\nI slip back below deck... talk to the property owner on the phone, talk to my lawyers in KC, talk to my banker in St Joseph...call the property owner back and strike a deal. Call the lawyers and the banker back to get things in motion...then call the property owner back one more time to confirm that we have a deal, money is on its way to his bank, where they will hold it in escrow, until we can both get there to sign all the necessary paperwork to close the deal.\n\nWhen I walk back up the steps, I can see the look of anticipation of Tom's face. I smile, wink, and give him a \"thumbs up\" and he springs out of his seat like a Tiger after its prey...\n\n\"No fucking way! Seriously? Oh My God, I cannot believe it! I swear, if you ever need anything, all you got to do is ask man. We can never thank you enough for this\"\n\n\"Thank him for what?\" Ingrid inquires \"What are you two up to?\"\n\n\"I'll explain on the way home\" Tom says gleefully as he tugs on her arm to go \"OUR home, Honey OUR home!!\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" Tom repeats as they wave and briskly walk up the dock ramp toward the guardhouse gate.\n\n\"I best be on my way too\" says Gabby \"Thank you... for inviting me to your boat, I had an absolutely wonderful time, and would not hesitate for a second, if invited, to come back again some time, HINT, HINT\" she said with a wink...\n\nShe gathers her things gives Bob and I both a big hug and a kiss. \"Are you sure, you don't want us to call an Uber or a Lyft for you?\" I ask\n\n\"Nope\" She says as she whips out a card \"got my Jazzy pass ...just take the bus down to Canal Street, then Hop on the St Charles streetcar line...and I'll be back on campus in no time\"",
        "\"Hey\" I say \"Give us a call, anytime you need a break! Don't necessarily have to get naked every time you visit... but we certainly won't complain if that is what happens!\"\n\n\"I just might become a pest if you give me an open invitation like that\" she replied\n\n\"And that would be a problem, how?\" Bob retorts\n\n\"Au revoir! Merci Beaucoup Mon Cher, Mon Cherie!\" Gabby calls out as she makes her way up the ramp as well.\n\nAs soon as she is out of sight. Bob grabs me by the front of my shirt and says, \"Alright, tell me... what did you do?\"\n\n\"Whatever do you mean, my dear?\" I ask as if puzzled\n\n\"You know damn good and well what I mean! You have been up to something! Why else would Tom be practically floating on a cloud with happiness. You have had to have done something that has made him so obviously happy!\"\n\n\"Let's just say that I have given Tom and Ingrid a Wedding present, something that they both really want and need! \"\n\n\"Oh my god!\" she exclaims \"You gave them the money for a down payment on that house they are wanting to buy! You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Not exactly\" I reply \"Let's just say that I now own property in New Orleans, and they are going to be my tenants. I'll take care of the insurance, taxes and upkeep on the property, and they are going to rent it until they have paid me what I gave for the property...then it will be theirs free and clear\"\n\nBob gives me a hug and a kiss and says \"dammit Rick, just when I think that you are the nicest and sweetest guy I have ever met, you go off and do something like this and prove that you are even nicer and sweeter, even than that!\n\nI tell her \"It's just me trying to help someone get a start in life.\n\nThe Judge ordered that all payments stop to my son and daughter. Said it was high time that they learn to take care of themselves. So, the money that I was putting into their accounts each month...is now freed up for me to do with as I choose, and so I chose to invest in some Real estate in New Orleans and invest in a young couple that is just trying to make their way in life.\"\n\n\"Rather than ruin their chances of success, like I did with my own kids by just giving them whatever they wanted...I simply offered Tom and Ingrid an opportunity to get ahead in life....and earn what they really want.\"\n\n\"I will do the same for you, if you find some place where you want to settle down and put down roots.\"\n\n\"Well, you and I both know that THAT won't be happening any time soon. You done stirred up the gypsy in my blood... given me the wanderlust and stirred up a couple of other kinds of lust in the process. So, you are stuck with me...You hear me mister! I've done clamped onto your ass like a snapping turtle and I ain't about to let go of you any time soon!\"\n\nBob slides her hand down and grabs ahold of my cock through the material of my shorts \"Come on you ole soft hearted fart, about time to take you below deck for your afternoon blowjob!\"\n\n*************\n\nTom and Ingrid's wedding was a nice, simple courtyard ceremony in the French Quarter. We all dressed casually and after the service I surprised the Bride and Groom with a little wedding reception dinner at the Court of Two Sisters.\n\nI had closed the deal on their house, and immediately hired contractors to come in an give the place a face-lift. New roof, Paint, new shutters landscaping etc. had plumbers and electricians go over everything to make sure the house is safe and up to code. I might be a bit prejudiced, but to me...it is now easily one of the nicest looking little houses on the block.\n\n******************\n\nMardi Gra, for those that have never attended... there is absolutely no way to describe the event. For those that have attended... if you know, you know. There is nothing else like it anywhere in the USA!\n\nBeing \"Yankees\" from Missouri, we had no clue about what to expect during Mardi Gra. We just assumed that it would be like the Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York...with everyone standing on the sides of the streets, watching until the parade goes by.\n\nAu Contraire Mon Ami! (On the contrary my friends)\n\nThis whole city turns into \"party central\"! There are parades on practically every street and in every neighborhood from early morning till late at night. Trying to walk down Bourbon Street is like trying to move through an obstacle course! People on the floats are throwing beads and trinkets...drunk people everywhere trying to catch some of the tossed bounty... trash is sometimes knee deep in places... it is a fucking mad house! But everyone loves it!\n\nIf you enjoy hanging out with a huge crowd of rowdy drunks...and do not mind seeing public nudity. Then Mardi Gra in New Orleans really needs to be on your bucket list of things to do before you die.\n\nIf you don't like crowds and don't like drunks and don't approve of PDA's or bare breasted women... stay as far away as possible because you are going to HATE, it here!\n\nBob and I absolutely loved it! Loved the people, even the drunk and obnoxious ones...loved the parades and the partying. But after a day or so, we were ready to be moving on.\n\n******************\n\nOne lesson I learned from our journey down the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, is that simply relying on charts for navigation is not enough preparation!\n\nI chatted with many ship owners during our stay in New Orleans. Each one of them told me that I had better do my research for our journey across the Gulf Intercostal Water Way or GICWW as it they refer it.\n\nLike the Missouri River, we will be sharing narrow channels with a lot of commercial shipping traffic. Huge cargo ships and barges can make traveling this route treacherous at times.\n\nTides affect these waters and other waterways intersect, so you must really pay attention; so that you don't get broadsided, or you broadside someone else!\n\nOne similarity to the Mississippi river, is that the GICWW can also have a lot of floating debris \"Propellor testers\" as one guy described them.\n\nWe reluctantly leave our little slip at the Marina on Lake Ponchatrain. The ship is fully restocked, refueled and ready to make our way east...\n\nBad news is, we left rather late in the year for running \"the loop.\" Good news is... we are not traveling alone for this leg of the trip.\n\nOur travels from New Orleans to Apalachicola Florida, were fairly uneventful. Lots of beautiful scenery, lots of nice stately homes to see along the way. LOTS of narrow channel to navigate. We are lucky in the fact that this old ship sits fairly high in the water. So, tide shoaling effects does not bother us as much as it does on some watercraft.\n\nWe are traveling with a group of five other vessels. That we met along the way. Like the wagon trains of the old west, there is safety in numbers.\n\nIf we all stick together as a group, especially when taking the \"big Bend\" route toward the Florida Keys. We can all look out for each other and help each other make the crossing safely.\n\nThe Big Bend is a more direct route that will take us across the Gulf of Mexico by following the western curve of Florida...It will take us out into open waters a good 20 nautical miles from the Florida shores. If the weather permits, and we choose to take the long way around... we can go all the way to the Florida Keys...then travel back up the eastern coast of Florida. We can also take the Okeechobee water way (OWW) and cut across the state through a series of locks and dams....and pop out on the Atlantic side.\n\nRegardless of which way we go. We will have to pay exceptionally close attention to weather patterns, wind speed and direction...plus we will have to be on alert for Crab Buoys marking where crab fishermen have their crab pots set.\n\nWhile not being the shortest route, or the possibly the safest....\n\nIt is the best route for us to avoid heavy ship traffic...which can sometimes make the intercoastal water way look like the Los Angeles Freeway during rush hour. If we stick to the GICWW...we are looking at top speeds, at times... similar to that of someone at a brisk walk on dry land.\n\nBy taking the Bend...if the weather and the sea is good to us...we may easily be able to average 30 knots or roughly 35mph. Not exactly a blinding speed compared to a car on highway! But a very respectable speed on water... especially when you consider that we can maintain that speed constantly, while cars on the highway have to deal with stop and go traffic, road construction, detours, etc.\n\nNot to mention the fact that it can take three to four days to travel from Carrabelle Florida... taking the GICWW down to the keys...while it should only take about one day to get to Cape Coral at the mouth of the OWW...taking one of the more direct routes of the Florida bend!\n\nI am feeling confident that this is the right route we should be taking, and most of the people we are traveling with have travelled this route of the loop several times before.\n\nWhat concerns me, is the fact that our old ship, is the smallest one in the pack, and we do not have all of the modern navigational equipment that the other ships have, such as radar and sonar, etc.\n\nAt 40 feet, the old girl looks like a dinghy compared to a couple of the ships in this group. One of them is an 80ft Sunreef catamaran...probably a 7- or 8-million-dollar Yacht!\n\nOur little ship may not be as big or as fancy as that floating palace. But it will still get our butts from point A to point B, the same as theirs will....and what I have invested in this ship...is mere pocket change compared to what they have invested in theirs! It will probably cost them more just for their fuel, to make this leg of the trip. Than I have invested so far... in this entire Journey from St Joseph Mo; restoration of the ship included!\n\nBob and I spent the evening on Shore, dining at one of the many seafood restaurants that line the beaches. Bob had never seen such large shrimp; some as big as a chicken leg, that these restaurants were serving.\n\nWhen we mentioned to one of the locals, that we are from Missouri. He teased Bob, by saying \"The shrimp they feed you back in Missouri, that is what we use for bait round here! These shrimps were caught this morning, by that ship tied up right over there at the dock. That stuff you get has probably been frozen for at least a month or two!\"\n\nWe ordered the Shrimp Sampler, a huge tray with shrimp fixed several different ways. Fried, boiled, shrimp scampi, shrimp and grits, Barbecue\n\nWhile we did manage to eat everything served to us, we are both miserable, we are so full.\n\nWe decided to go for a walk through the quaint little shops in the business district. We could have spent a week there, and not see everything that they had to offer. Bob found a little statue of a sea gull that she immediately fell in love with. I offered to buy it for her, but she thought the price was too expensive. While she continued to browse, I excused myself to go find a restroom and when she wasn't looking. I latched onto the little statue and bought it for her... slipping the purchase into one of my pockets to hide it from her.\n\nWe eventually work our way back to the dock where our ship is moored. Giving the ship one more inspection, before we strike out, just as the sun is coming up tomorrow morning.\n\nThe ship is fully stocked with supplies. We have our water tanks and our fuel tanks all topped off and I purchased a few more Gerry cans of fuel, just to be on the safe side. We now have enough fuel on board to make it 500-600 nautical miles. Learned my lesson on the Mississippi River. Rather have too much on board and not need it, as to have to hope and pray that we can make it to the next available fuel dock.\n\n\"What say, we get to bed early tonight? The rest of the group said they wanted to leave here at the butt crack of dawn, so that we can make it to Cape Coral while there is still daylight left.\"\n\n\"Sounds good to me\" Bob says as she pops into the head, while I am closing and securing the hatch door.\n\nShe emerges, naked as a jaybird, as per her usual choice of sleepwear. I take my turn in the head and join her in bed wearing my wrinkled old birthday suit as well.\n\nFor a man in my mid to upper sixties, I really don't look as old as some guys my age appear. Until you put my body up next to her young, smooth skin, and the difference in our ages could easily be seen my a blind man! Guess it is all just a case of \"mind over matter\" ... if she doesn't mind, then it really does not matter.\n\n\"Feeling nervous about heading out into the gulf tomorrow\" Bob asks as she cuddles close to me.\n\n\"Yeah, maybe a little bit,\" I say \"Have no doubt that this ole girl can make it that far without trouble. I'm just worried about trying to keep up with the rest of the flotilla. If the rest of the ships cruise along at a sensible pace, then we should have no problem at all keeping up.\n\nBut if someone decides to be an asshole and try to prove how fast their boat is...then we could end up being left behind. I do have a compass and I do have all the coordinates we need to get there. But this won't be like travelling the rivers or ICW's... there won't be any channel markers to guide the way.\n\n\"You are worrying about things that probably won't happen. Most of the people in the other boats have traveled this route before, and they know that we are novices. I really do not think that any of them would intentionally leave us behind.\"\n\n\"Even if we do wander off course, I think I can remember enough of my high school Spanish, to get by when we drop anchor in Cuba!\"\n\nBob slides her hand into my groin and wraps it around my cock. \"Right now, you need to just relax, forget about all of the what if's... and just concentrate on giving me a good fucking\"\n\nMy cock seemed to like the sound of that idea, as it quickly swelled and stood up, ready for action.\n\nBob, slid down and slipped it into her mouth and let it slide down her throat, massaging it with her throat muscles in the process.\n\nWhen she had it slick enough for her liking, she raised her body up until we are face to face. She moves in and gives me a nice long passionate kiss. Then looks me right in the eyes, as she impales herself on my throbbing cock.\n\nAny cares or worries that I may have had, suddenly vanished as my cock was swallowed up by her tight wet pussy. I am always amazed at how easily we can both read each other's bodies... we seem to instinctively know when to speed up...to bring our bodies to the brink of orgasm. As well as when to slow down, so that we can savor that sweet pleasure/pain moment right before orgasm, just a little bit longer.\n\nSometimes we can take each other right up to the razors edge of pleasure, then back off just enough that we can make those wonderful sensations linger.\n\nOther times, pure lust overtakes us, and we charge right toward our orgasms, with no intention of stopping or slowing down until we have gone flying over that edge, like a daredevil jumping a motorcycle off of a ramp!\n\nTonight, Bob was in one of her teasing moods. Riding my cock until she can tell that I am getting close, then stopping to let my cock soak and throb. If my cock could talk, it would be begging her to let it shoot out a load of hot cum.\n\nEventually, all of this teasing catches up to her, and she is the one that is desperate for an orgasm. She rides my cock like she is heading for the finish line on a horse in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nWe both reach our goal at almost the exact same time. Her orgasm is so strong that it makes her stomach muscles contract and contort in sweet erratic spasms. My cock dumps load after load of my semen deep inside of her.\n\nShe collapses on the bed beside of me, and we lay there cuddled together. Both of our crotches soaked with a mixture of our own body fluids. Bob grabs one of my tee shirts from out of a drawer and uses it to clean up the mess we have created.\n\nNext thing either of us remember is the alarm on my cell phone going off at 4am!"
