        "We drive by the Marina on our way to Colonial Williamsburg, just to make sure that the ship is still secure, and that nothing has been tampered with.\n\nOnce we are satisfied, we make our way to the Visitors Center; purchase our day passes and start our walk back through time to the Revolutionary war period. Have to admit, they know how to do things right! Aside from us \"tourists\" walking around in our modern clothes... a person could easily be convinced that they have traveled back to the 1700's!\n\nWe spend our day there visiting the historic shops and buildings, attending as many of the demonstrations as possible...even took a carriage ride around the town and up to the Governor's Mansion. Ate lunch at a pub that was frequented by the likes of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Watched the soldiers march on the green and even went on a \"ghost tour\" just after the sun went down.\n\nNext morning, we visited the Jamestown Settlement and museum. All three of us feeling amazed and humbled by all of the history that had taken place here, and all of the hardships that people had to endure in order to survive in the early days of this country.\n\nWe managed to make it to the Revolutionary War Museum before noon, so we spent the rest of our day here...going through all of the exhibits and living history areas. We finished off our day by having a wonderful dinner at a local seaside pub just down the road from the Museum.\n\nWe all took off our shoes and wandered out onto the beach and watched a three Masted Schooner \"The Alliance\" head out with passengers for an evening tour on the York River, out to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and back.\n\nAll in all, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable day! None of us were ready to end our stay in the area, so we decided to travel to Charlottesville Va the next day; to visit Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nWe figured that once we have made that trip, seen all that we can see there. Our heads should be full to running over with historic facts and trivia from the colonial time period.\n\nWhen we arrive back at our hotel, we park the car and go to our room. The moment we step inside the elevator...Bob takes off her shoes and breathes a sigh of relief. We push the button to go up to our floor as she reaches up under the back of her blouse for a few seconds... then does a Criss cross thing with her arms and slips her hands inside the opposite sleeves of her blouse and then in one fell swoop...pulls her bra out of one sleeve!\n\nMax just stood there amazed and said, \"This is a perfect example of why women should be in charge of things!\"\n\n\"You are just jealous that you can't take any of your clothes off in an elevator\" Bob teases\n\n\"Who says I can't?\"\n\n\"The laws on public decency, for one thing!\" I remind them\n\n\"Have you SEEN any cops patrolling the halls of this Hotel?\" Bob challenges me...\n\n\"No, but that don't mean you won't get caught! There are other people on the same floor as us...somebody's poor old grandmother steps out of her room to get a bucket of ice....and gets confronted by a naked guy wandering the halls with is dick just a swinging. Don't think that wouldn't get the cops up here in a hurry!\" I say\n\n\"You'd let her play with it a bit, wouldn't you?\" Bob questioned Max as if she were serious about doing this.\n\n\"Sure, you know I would\" Max replies\n\n\"Bullshit!\" Bob retorts \"You would chicken out before you even take your shoes off!\"\n\nMax kicked off both of his shoes and removed his socks...\n\n\"Rick, you get that room card ready...when these elevator doors open...you beat feet to our room and get the door open...THIS is going down!\" Bob commands\n\nI already had the room card in my hand so the moment the elevator stopped... I was ready to run. When the doors opened, I took off and the last thing I saw was Max and Bob standing just outside the elevator topless and in the process of taking off the rest of their clothes.\n\nOur room was at the far end of the hall, and I have not run-in ages. So, by the time I made it to the room and got the door opened; I was completely out of breath and laughing so hard I thought I may pass out... but here comes Bob and Max...both stark naked...with their clothes tucked under their arms... running like sprinters in the Olympics with our door being the finish line!\n\nThis is the kind of fun and spontaneity that we have been missing on this leg of the trip. Glad to see it has returned and just hope I can come up with enough cash for bail money if the need arises!\n\nBob and Max fall onto the bed, both laughing so hard they can barely breathe.\n\n\"Oh my God, that was fun!\" Max finally managed to say, \"After Rick implanted the idea in my head... the whole time I was running, I kept expecting some old lady to step out into the hall and I just mow her down before I can get stopped!\"\n\n\"Now I know why boys can run faster than girls...guys got stick shift and ball bearings!\" Bob joked\n\n\"I needed every advantage I could get, just to keep up with you!\" Max said \"I swear, she took off like a rabbit, didn't think I was ever going to catch up to her! All I could think about was \"Damn she has a nice ass as I watched her speed off down the hall!\"\n\n\"So, you like my ass, do you?\" Bob teases\n\n\"Hell, I had to look away from it...just so that I could concentrate on my running! Kept thinking, if I get a hard on now and fall on the carpet, that rug burn is going to hurt like hell!\"\n\n\"Well, since I beat you to the door, I think I will accept my prize now\" Bob teases as she plays with Max's hardening cock.\n\n\"Just what kind of prize are you expecting?\" Max inquires\n\n\"Just hide and watch, I think you will enjoy it too!\" she says, \"Rick, get your clothes off, you ran the gauntlet too...you get to share the prize as well.\"\n\nAs I removed my clothes, Bob went to work sucking on Max's cock, getting him quickly to full erection. When I am completely naked, she has Max and I stand next to each other...while she alternates sucking our cocks... she sucks Max for a while, then she sucks me for a while. Then she has us both stand closer...so that she can squeeze our cocks together and suck them both at the same time.\n\nMax was a bit skittish about being this close to another male... but the sensations that Bob was giving our cocks was too overpowering for him to muster up a protest. So, he just hung right in there and let her do whatever she wanted to do.\n\nBob let our wet glistening cocks slip from her mouth and stands up in front of Max.\n\n\"Think you can hold my body weight, if we try to fuck standing up?\" Bob Inquires\n\n\"Yeah, I think I can manage that!\" Max replies\n\nBob wraps her arms around his neck and hops up...wrapping her legs around his waist and locking her ankles all in one quick movement. Max uses one hand to get a grip on her ass...while he slips his other hand down and guides his cock into her vagina.\n\nOnce it has slipped all the way inside... Bob starts to bounce up and down on his cock! After a bit of good hard fucking. Bob stops and tells me. \"Rick, you've got asshole duty...You know what needs to be done and raises herself up just enough for me to gain easy access to her little brown hole...while still keeping Max's cock securely embedded in her pussy.\n\nAlthough the principle of this position is the same, as when we did this with Tom. Standing up changes the whole dynamics of it. Where Tom and I had to use a see-saw motion to enjoy both holes at the same time. Standing did not allow for that as much... and so, as my cock slowly eased its way inside of her tight little ass...my cock had to slide in far enough for me to be cock head to cock head level with Max's cock, with only a thin wall of flesh to separate the two. Once I was in place and Bob had become relaxed and acclimated to having both cocks deep inside her...she began her rhythmic bouncing once again.\n\nI grabbed onto her ass cheeks too and helped Max hang onto her as she rode both of our cocks...bringing all three of us closer and closer to an orgasm that promised to be of epic proportions!\n\nWe were NOT disappointed! Bob was the first to go \"over the edge\" She began to moan and tighten her grip around Max's neck and waist. Her ass cheeks clenched to the point that I thought for sure that her asshole was going to pinch my cock off at the base!\n\nI came next, the tightness of her hole and the rhythmic movements that I had no control over...were just too much to ignore. My cock erupted in a volley of cum that filled her hole and quickly began to leak back out around my pistoning cock... running in a trickle down the inside of my thigh.\n\nMax was doing his best to hold back, but when it was obvious that I was dumping my load, Max gave up his struggle and rode out his own orgasm...pumping a load of cum deep inside Bob's pussy.\n\nI slid my cum slick cock out of Bob's ass and stepped back to allow her room to release her legs from around Max's waist and lower her feet to the floor. She stepped back allowing Max's still hard cock to spring free and slap him wetly on his stomach. He still had a few drops of semen sliding down the shaft of his cock, which Bob immediately seized upon....and dropped to her knees to lick his cock clean.\n\nWe all decide that we are starving, but really do not want to go through all of the trouble of getting dressed to go out for dinner. So, I offer to go over to the shopping mall and bring back some Chinese Take-out.\n\nBob and Max snuggle up next to each other to watch some TV until I come back with the food.\n\nAs I am returning to the room with the food. The desk clerk, a woman I suspect to be in her late-forties or early-fifties, with an \"Ample\" figure...flags me down.\n\nI immediately assume that there must be a \"no food in the room\" policy ...that I am in flagrant violation of....and she is going to call me out on it.\n\n\"Sir, would you mind stepping around to this side door, for a few moments...I need to speak to you privately\"\n\nI do as she requests and just as I approach the door, she opens it and beckons me to come inside.\n\nOnce the door is closed. She says, \"Sir, my name is Ann, I am the night manager here and I wanted to speak to you privately because we had an issue earlier this evening. That cannot be repeated. This is a family hotel, and we have guests of all ages staying here.\"\n\nTrying to play innocent, I say \"What kind of issue are you talking about?\n\n\"The \"Streaking in the hallway\" issue...\" She says, \"We DO have security cameras on every floor and while I know that kids will be kids, especially when they get to be college age. But we cannot allow your son and daughter to behave in this manner in our hotel. So, if you could please speak to them about this incident, and make sure that it does not happen again. It would be greatly appreciated!\"\n\n\"You have my word, they will keep their clothes on in public areas, from now on!\" I say, while thinking to myself \"I HOPE!\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, and have a nice evening!\"\n\nI return to the room to find Max and Bob fucking like there is no tomorrow. Max has Bob's hands pinned to the bed, by her head and is fucking her pussy in long deep strokes. Although Bob is pretending to put up a fight...it is quite obvious that she is enjoying every moment of this!\n\nI set the bags of food down on the table and take a seat. Watching the wonders of young lust unfold before me.\n\n\"Who would ever believe\" I think to myself \"that watching others enjoying themselves sexually...would become the new \"Normal\" for me! After all those years of self-denial, living by OTHER people's rules...and letting others dictate how I should be living my life. Why did it take me so long to finally \"wake up\" and learn to live in the moment...and enjoy all the wonderful things that life has to offer!\n\nMax's body begins to jerk erratically as he dumps his load of cum deep inside of Bob's pussy. This triggers a wave of orgasm coursing through her; that has her quivering as if she is having a seizure.\n\nOnce they have both rode out their orgasms...Max rolls off of Bob's body...his cock still coated with a frothy white mixture of their combined juices. Bob is lying there with her legs still splayed open...a trickle of cum slowly draining from her pussy and leaving a glistening trail down toward her asshole.\n\n\"Nice to see that you two managed to whip up a batch of dipping sauce for the egg rolls while I was gone\" I tease\n\n\"This was the second batch!\" Max teased back\n\n\"Well, I would have been back sooner, except for the fact that I got called into the hotel front office... for an ass reaming about letting you two run up and down the halls up here...naked! I was told to keep my kids under better control\"\n\n\"NO SHIT?\" Max inquires seriously...\n\n\"YEP! You two got caught on surveillance video...running down the hall!\" I reply\n\n\"Probably going to be a real hit when they show it at their office Christmas Party! They will be talking about us for years!\" Bob adds\n\nWe check out of the hotel early the next morning, pack all of our stuff into the trunk of the car. Swing by the marina to check on the ship and once we are satisfied that everything is okay... we head off to Charlottesville to visit Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nI have always enjoyed reading about history...and have often thought about great men like Thomas Jefferson and how they worked to form this great country of ours. I knew that Jefferson was a very intelligent man... but had no clue exactly HOW intelligent... until visiting his home! There are so many things that the man invented and incorporated into his life, that I was awestruck by the sheer genius of it all.\n\nFor example...if he wanted to know which way the wind was blowing... all he had to do was step out on his front porch and look up... he had a weathervane mounted on the roof of his house.... that had a rod running down through the ceiling of the porch; that had a metal arrow attached to the bottom of it. Which pointed to the direction the wind was blowing from.\n\nJefferson even had a Clock in his house that was capable of telling not only the time, but the day of the week as well! The Clock is huge and hangs above the front door... it is a seven-day wind clock, meaning that it has to be wound every Sunday...and is powered by the weights of cannon balls weighing 18lbs each. As the weights pull on the cable that powers the clock...they slowly go down...slow enough that Jefferson has plaques on the wall indicating which day of the week it is, by where the cannon balls are on the wall.\n\nRemember, this was built in the 1700's and is still working and keeping time to this very day! Not unlike everyone else...Jefferson did have a setback or two on some of his inventions... but what separated him, from the rest of us...is that he was not one to simply give up...because an idea did not work out as he had hoped. Take that clock for instance...when he had it built originally, Monticello was still under construction... and so he had the clock set up to work in a house he was living in at the time. Monticello has much lower ceilings than the house the clock was originally installed in...so when it was installed at Monticello...the cannon balls would hit the floor before the week was out...stopping the clock. Jefferson fixed this problem by cutting holes in the floor, to allow the cannon balls to pass through....and put the \"Saturday\" plaque on the wall in the basement...Problem solved\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent at Monticello, but by the time we had walked around the plantation, visited the gardens, and walked down to the family cemetery to see the graves...and followed the path through the woods to the Visitors center...we were all exhausted!\n\nWe drove back to Newport News, stopped by the Marina, and unloaded all of our things. Then took the car back to the rental place. On the way back to the Marina, we stopped at a nice seafood restaurant for a meal before returning to the ship.\n\nWe each ordered a sampler platter and are chit chatting, while we wait for the food to arrive. I happen to notice a woman at a table near us... looking at us and smiling every once in a while.\n\n\"WHY does this woman look so familiar?\" I keep asking myself\n\nThen it dawns on me... this is the night manager from the hotel we just stayed at!\n\nThe next time she looks our way, I smile back and wave.\n\n\"It's been a struggle, but I have managed to keep these two fully dressed today!\" I tell her...\n\nBob and Max both turn around at the same time, to see who I am talking to... then turn back to me and mouth the words \"is that the night manager?\"\n\nI nod my head yes, then invite the woman to come sit with us...as she appears to be alone. At first, she politely refuses...but when I insist. She gathers her things and comes over to sit by me at our table.\n\nI introduce her to Bob and Max...and Bob has to go through her usual Roberta to Bobbie to Bob nickname progression story.\n\n\"Well, my birth name is Edith Ann... but I go by just Ann...since the comedienne Lilly Tomlin, made my childhood a living hell with her act.\"\n\nOur food soon arrives, and it turns out that Ann had ordered the same thing that we did...so we all had a laugh about that.\n\nDuring the meal, I tell Ann that Bob and Max are NOT my children. We are all just traveling together aboard my ship...and that we are traveling the loop. Left St Joseph Mo last year and this is as far as we have made it.\n\n\"Oh, I know all about the \"great loop\" that was something that my late husband always wanted to do and talked about it constantly. Unfortunately, he passed away from Cancer before he ever got the chance.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that\" I tell her\n\n\"He traded for a boat... just for that purpose, but it has been just tied up to the dock, ever since he got it. I probably need to see if I can find someone to check it out and see if it is still worth selling...rather than just let it sit there until it rots and sinks right where it is.\"\n\n\"Where is this boat at?\" Max asks\n\n\"It's over here at the Leeward Marina...just a couple of blocks from here\"\n\n\"That is where we are berthed...\" Max says \"I am a certified boat technician...I would be willing to take a look at it for you, if you want...maybe help to make up for you having to see my bare ass running down the hall of your hotel\"\n\n\"You don't have to make anything up to me...and besides, you DO have a cute ass...so it was not a compete hardship my part!\" Ann teased\n\nMax blushed\n\n\"And you have a very nice tush as well\" she said to Bob with a wink.\n\n\"Seriously, if you want me to look the boat over...and you have the time to show it to me... I am more than happy to do it\"\n\n\"If you are sure you don't mind\" She said \"I really need to do something with it... before it is no longer of any use to anyone. But as it is... I don't know what it is worth...someone could tell me it is worth scrap price...and I would have to believe them\"\n\n\"We are heading to the Marina right after we eat anyway...so if you want to meet us over there... I'll grab some tools and look it over...and give you my best estimate of what it is worth\"\n\n\"Better yet...why don't you all hop in with me, and I can drive us all over there. I've got a big enough car to haul all of us, no problem.\"\n\nWe finish our meal and I spring for the check...telling Ann that it is my way of saying thank you for not calling the cops on Bob and Max for public indecency.\n\nOut in the parking lot we find out that Ann is driving a huge Cadillac Escalade. \"This was my husband's pride and joy...like trying to drive a house down the road... but it will pass anything on the road...except a gas station.\"\n\nTurns out, Ann's Boat is berthed only two slips over from where we are. I open up our boat and Max grabs a flashlight and some tools, and we all go over to check out her boat.\n\nHer boat is a 1998 Sea Ray 400 39ft ...appears to be in excellent condition other than being covered in grime and bird droppings. She takes us below deck and gives us the grand tour. Said her husband took it in as part of a business deal right when he first found out that he had cancer. His business partner wanted to buy our half of the business but did not have the cash to do so....so my husband took the boat and made a deal for him to pay off the rest...over time.\"",
        "Max checks the boat over thoroughly and says that to get a true picture of what it is worth, he needs to power it up and see how the engines sound...and whether everything still works as it should.\n\n\"Where can we get a battery and how much will it cost?\" Ann asks\n\n\"I noticed that there is still a bit of a charge left in the batteries that are here... not enough to start the engines, but if we can get a car battery, we can jump start the generator motor... then it can charge up the rest of the batteries if they will still take a charge.\" Max Replies\n\n\"Would the battery on my car work?\"\n\n\"Should\"\n\n\"Here are my car keys...let's see if we can get this thing fired up\"\n\nMax returns shortly with her car battery and uses it to jump start the Generator engine. Once it fires up... the gauges all show that the batteries are charging. So, he lets the generator run for a bit and gives it time to do its work.\n\nWhen he feels like there is enough charge in the batteries to start the engines...He gives them a try... They spin over, but do not make any attempt to start, at first. Then with a cough and a sputter the engines spring to life and quickly smooth out to steady idle.\n\n\"Looks like there is at least 3/4 of a tank of fuel... can we take it for a spin to see if everything is working properly?\" Max asks\n\n\"If you think it is safe to take out... sure! Let's all go for a boat ride!\" Ann says happily\n\nWe untie the shorelines and Max carefully backs the boat out of the slip...cranks the wheel to turn the boat toward the James River....and then heads upstream...just idling at first then bumps the throttle to half speed and then when everything seems to be working properly, he opens it up to full throttle and we are flying up the James River! Max soon shuts the throttle back down and makes a wide sweeping turn near the Jamestown Settlement...and begins our journey back to the Marina\n\nHe pulls the ship back into the slip and Bob and I quickly tie off the shorelines to secure the boat.\n\n\"Based upon what I am seeing, this ship would probably sell for 70-80 thousand in the condition that it is currently in. Spend some time and money on it...getting it cleaned up and serviced...and you could probably ask 90-100 thousand and easily expect to get it!\" Max tells her\n\n\"WOW! I had no idea! It was just an old boat, costing me marina rental fees...was all I knew about it!\" Ann smiles\n\n\"So, you think you want to sell it then? I ask\n\n\"Yes, definitely!\" Ann replies\n\n\"You think it is worth buying and putting some money into...to fix it up?\" I ask Max\n\n\"Absolutely\" he replies \"The bones of the ship are in great shape... its more about the cosmetics...the \"dock appeal\" as they used to say at the dealership. Nice and shiny...worth more bucks...covered in bird poop...not so much.\"\n\nMechanically, the boat appears to be in great shape. It would have to be serviced before I would feel safe going very far in it...probably needs to have the fuel tanks drained so that they have fresh fuel in them. But other than that, put it in dry dock for a bit...to clean and polish the hull, inspect and/or replace the prop shaft bearings and boots...and it should be as seaworthy as it ever was.\n\n\"Would you be willing to sell it for $75 grand?\" I ask \"That is my... as is, where is... price... that I am willing to pay. You walk away with the money and don't have to do another thing to the ship\"\n\nAnn stood there for a moment, giving my offer some thought. \"Could you offer a bit more?\" she asks\n\n\"Sure, I could offer more, but I am going to expect for you to do more to get the boat ready to travel. Have it serviced and inspected like Max suggested. In the long run, you will probably come out with about the same amount of cash...\"\n\n\"How long would I have to wait for the money?\" she asks\n\n\"Let me give my accountant a call and I can give you a solid answer after I talk to him.\"\n\nI step away from the ship and call my accountant... \"Just what have you decided to purchase NOW?\" he asked with a mock sternness in his voice.\n\n\"Got a chance to buy another boat, REALLY good shape, just needs cleaned and serviced top to bottom...and I think I can flip it for a decent profit if I choose to do so\"\n\n\"How much? My accountant asks\n\n75 grand...\n\n\"Ouch!\" he replies...\n\n\"It will take me a little while to move some things around and come up with that kind of cash... but if you can get me the banking information...I can probably have the funds to you by noon tomorrow... if that is agreeable with everyone.\"\n\n\"I will call you back in a few minutes, and let you know...\"\n\nI return to Ann's ship... \"My accountant assures me that he can have the money transferred to your bank by noon tomorrow. Will that work for you?\"\n\n\"75 thousand and I don't have to do anything to the boat at all?\"\n\n\"Not a thing...we will take care of getting it serviced and ready to sail...Do we have a deal?\"\n\n\"Deal!\" Ann says with a huge smile...as she shakes my hand. Then writes down the address to her bank, to share with my accountant.\n\n\"I will put your battery back into your car for you.\" Max informs her as he picks up the battery and some tools...\n\n\"There is another set of keys, some manuals and other paperwork at home. I'll bring them to the bank with me tomorrow.\" Ann says\n\n\"You are back in business\" Max tells Ann when he returns\n\n\"Thank you all so very much\" Ann says as she is leaving\n\n\"Well, it appears we now have TWO boats to deal with... what do you suggest we do? I ask Max\n\n\"First thing that I would do, if it were mine...is take it over to the boatyard and see if we can find someone that will put it in dry dock and go over everything with a fine-tooth comb. Yes, the boat is in great shape mechanically for its age... but it has been sitting for quite some time. Try to take off for Missouri in it...as it is...you are bound to have trouble of some sort. Don't know if you will be able to find a place that will let me work on it, or not... some places require a state licensed watercraft technician to service a boat...and my license is only good in the state of Florida.\n\n\"Well, once I get the ship officially bought... we will go see what we have to do ...to get it ready to travel.\"\n\nWe returned to our ship and got busy washing clothes and putting things away, that we had used on our little vacation from the loop.\n\nBob allowed that since the ship had been closed up for a few days...the air inside had grown stale, and the ship needed to be aired out. \"Just smells like Booze, Butts and Bad Decisions in here\" she declared...\n\nAfter we got everything put away and were just waiting for the clothes to get dry. I grabbed a beer and went topside to sit in a deck chair and enjoy the peacefulness of the marina as the sun was starting to set.\n\nI must have dozed off for a bit...as I was awaked by a feminine voice saying \"Yoo-hoo\"... and opened my eyes to see Ann standing in front of me, with a cardboard box in her hand.\n\n\"Got home and was so happy, that I just decided to call in sick this evening...and didn't want to spend the first free evening off, that I have had in ages... all alone. So, I dug out all the stuff that I have for the boat. Stopped at a liquor store and bought a couple bottles of Champagne and came back over here...hoping you wouldn't mind helping me celebrate!\"\n\n\"Getting to spend an evening with a beautiful woman, while imbibing in a little \"bubbly\" ... How could I refuse an offer like that!\" I say\n\n\"Pretty sure that I forgot to pack any stemware...so I hope you don't mind sipping Champagne from a Solo cup\" I tease\n\n\"We can just pop the cork and drink from the jug, for that matter... I am not fussy!\" Ann replied\n\nI gesture for Ann to go ahead of me, down the stairs to the galley... The moment she gets to the bottom...she freezes in her tracks and just stands there. I take the last few steps down and immediately see why she has stopped!\n\nThere in front of us, is Bob and Max. Both naked... Bob is bent over at the waist, with her little butt pushed out behind her, holding onto the handrail to maintain her balance. Max is behind her...bent forward as well, with a hand on each of her breasts as his cock is pounding her pussy from behind.\n\nI immediately grab Ann by both arms to turn her away from the spectacle...as I say \"I am SO sorry\"\n\n\"Don't be\" she replies as she resists my attempt to shepherd her away. \"It doesn't bother me in the least to watch them have their fun... if they don't mind being watched\"\n\n\"Those two would do it in the middle of the street and sell tickets, if they thought they could get away with it\" I say\n\n\"Well, then; let's get those solo cups and grab us a front row seat.\"\n\nI grab some solo cups from the cupboard and sit down on the hide a bed beside Ann. I pop the cork on the bottle which causes Bob and Max to look our way, just as a stream of Champagne spews out.\n\n\"That reminds me of Rick's cock\" Bob jokes, then goes right on fucking.\n\n\"So, I take it that all three of you have an ongoing relationship then?\" Ann inquires\n\n\"Not exactly your normal captain and crew relationship, but we do enjoy the time we spend together.\" I reply\n\nAnn sits there for a bit, sipping her Champagne and watching Bob and Max fuck.\n\nAfter a moment or two, she looks at me and say's \"Is this something that is exclusively between the three of you...or can others join in?\" she asks \"It has been ages since I have felt the comfort of another person's touch! My husband and I toyed with having an open marriage, but never went much beyond \"same room\" stuff with another couple. Would you care to indulge me...and let me join in the fun this evening?\"\n\n\"I have absolutely no problem with that...and I am sure that they won't mind either.\" I tell her\n\n\"Great!\" she says \"So, what do I do?\"\n\n\"Just get naked and have fun...that's what we do.\" I tell her \"If something is suggested that you aren't comfortable with doing...just say so, and we will move on to something that you ARE comfortable with. Easy and simple as that!\"\n\nAnn sat there for a moment, contemplating what I had just said...then set her drink on the table and started unbuttoning her blouse. Being a \"full figured\" woman and wearing a very low-cut bra, her breasts looked as if they could explode from her bra cups at any moment. She quickly reached behind her and unclasped her bra, letting \"the girls\" run wild and free.\n\nShe stood up and unfastened her skirt, letting it drop to the floor before picking it up and placing it on the pile with the rest of her clothes. She was wearing pantyhose over top of a pair of high-cut silk panties. She kicked off her shoes and worked the pantyhose down her legs and off the toes. Returning to an upright position to grasp the waistband of her panties and slide them off as well. Then stood there in all her naked glory. She has a patch of very neatly trimmed pubic hair that framed her vagina...I can just barely see the hood of her clitoris poking out at the top.\n\n\"Aren't you going to get undressed?\" she inquired\n\n\"Oh, hell yes\" I replied, \"I was enjoying watching you strip so much...I forgot to get undressed!\"\n\n\"Don't mind him\" Bob Pipes in \"He's got \"old Timers\" disease, he gets sidetracked easily... but he is still a damn good fuck!\"\n\n\"Something that I hope to find out for myself in just a few minutes\" Ann replies\n\nI strip off my clothes and wrap my arms around Ann's naked body. She feels so much different in my arms than Bob... but there is definitely a fire of passion burning within her body that only a good hard fucking is going to tame...and it appears that I am the one that has been selected to accomplish this task.\n\nShe kisses me, tentatively at first...as if she is testing the waters before letting her passion run wild. Apparently, I have passed any test she may have been giving me... because once she threw a lip lock on me... our tongues began to battle, and the flames of passion immediately grew into an inferno!\n\nShe reached down and began to stroke my cock while we kissed. I returned the favor by slipping a hand down to finger her pussy, which was sopping wet! I am sure that if I had looked down...there would have been a puddle on the floor from vaginal secretions that had dripped onto the floor.\n\nSince she had seemed to enjoy watching Bob and Max fucking doggy style... I decided to let her experience it for herself. I broke free from our kiss... moved back behind her and had her bend over... resting her hands on the galley table. My cock slid into her wet pussy as easily as a hot knife through butter. Her vaginal sphincter muscles gripped by cock as if reluctant to let it go. I leaned forward and grabbed ahold of her large breasts... one in each hand...squeezing and kneading them as my cock pistoned in and out of her.\n\nMoments later, Max stepped around to the other side of the table...his young virile cock hard and ready for action. He stood there right in front of Ann's face... giving her a really good look at his cock. Unable to avoid the temptation any longer... she reached out and grabbed his cock and drew it to her mouth. After giving it a few good licks... she took it into her mouth and began to bob her head up and down on it.\n\nJust as I was starting to wonder where Bob was... I suddenly felt her touching my legs from underneath the table. Ann tensed up and stopped moving for a few seconds...as Bob got into position and began to alternately lick Ann's clit and my cock and balls.\n\nBy this point I was getting close, I knew that I was going to cum at any moment and was contemplating pulling out and dumping my load on Ann's ass. But Bob changed those plans for me! Just as I was starting to feel that old familiar tingle signaling an imminent ejaculation... Bob takes it upon herself to wet one of her fingers and stick it up my ass in one swift movement causing my cock to erupt...no more warning! The cum is flying out and that is how it is going to be!\n\nOnce I have regained my senses, I slip my cock out of her sodden pussy as Bob move into position to lick and clean up my mess for me.\n\nAnn is in seventh heaven; she is moaning as she rides out the huge waves of her orgasm. Max has ahold of her head and is essentially fucking her face as he gets closer and closer to unloading his cum as well. When he finally lets loose, it is all that Ann can do, to swallow and keep up with the sensory explosions going on at that moment.\n\nShe finally lets Max's cock slip from her lips and pushes Bob's head away from her pussy...then staggers over to plop down on the hide a bed beside me.\n\nAnn sits there for a bit, trying to catch her breath...\n\n\"So, you mean to tell me, that you three have been doing this together, ever since you left Missouri? I must say, I AM impressed!... WOWZER!\" she joked\n\n\"Just Bob and I have been at this since Missouri...we had another couple that we picked up in St louis, that traveled with us to New Orleans... they stayed there...then we picked up Max in Florida and the three of us have been having fun like this ever since.\n\n\"Well, I am both jealous AND impressed! Thank you, thank you all for allowing me to join in on your evening's entertainment...you have NO idea how much I needed something like this! I swear, I haven't felt this alive and vibrant in a VERY long time!\"\n\n\"Hang around with the likes of these two... for very long...\" I say, pointing to Bob and Max \"And YOU will be Streaking up and down the halls, right along with them!\"\n\n\"And I would be loving every moment of it!\" Ann replied\n\n\"They have both helped me to open up and enjoy life as it comes along. Instead of letting things pass me by and wish later that I had been bold enough to have at least tried it!\" I confess\n\n\"Well, as much as I have truly enjoyed this evening...and this whole mind-boggling experience. I had best be getting dressed and be on my way. A woman of my age is far too old to be doing the \"Walk of Shame\" come sunup.\"\n\n\"No need to rush off\" Bob says, \"We're just getting started, the Orgy Main event doesn't even start until midnight!\"\n\n\"That DOES sound tempting... but I really must go.\" Ann says as she gathers her clothes and begins to put them on. But when she got to the panties and panty hose, she just crumpled them up and stuck them in a pocket on her dress...\n\n\"Nice night to go commando!\" she says with a grin. Might just leave a \"snail trail\" on the leather seats of my car...as a reminder of the fun we had tonight!\"\n\n\"My guess is, that we will probably be here for a few days...getting your boat ready to go. So, feel free to drop by any time you want.\" I tell her...\n\nI slip my pants on and escort her to her car. When we reach the car, she leans back against it, then grabs ahold of the waistband of my pants and pulls me close to her. Then kisses me deeply and passionately as she strokes my cock through the material of my pants.\n\nThe more we kiss, the harder my cock gets. The harder it gets, the more frantically she rubs on it. Until she suddenly stops, opens the car door, and leans back on the seat...sliding her skirt up to her waist.\n\n\"Fuck me again Rick...Please fuck me right here where anyone can see!\" she begs.\n\nNot being one to leave a damsel in distress...I unfasten my pants and let them fall to the ground, I aim my cock at her glistening wet folds and push forward...sinking the shaft all the way to my balls. Her pussy seemed to have an even tighter grip on my cock than before!\n\nOnly took a few minutes of hard lustful pumping until I flew right past the point of no return...my cock sending volley after volley of it's hot load deep inside of her! She was thrashing and clawing at me as if possessed...as her orgasm hit her and hit her hard. When she finally stopped convulsing... she moved back to let my limp wet cock fall out of the pussy's tight grip...then dropped to a squatting position to let the cum drain from inside her...as she sucked my cock clean!\n\nWhen she stood up, she pulled her crumpled panties out of her pocket and used them to wipe the residual cum off of her vaginal lips, then pushed the wadded material inside of her, to stop the flow of semen.\n\n\"See you tomorrow at the Bank!\" She says as she twists around in the seat and starts the engine. \"We will DEFINITELY be doing this again...before you all have to go!\"\n\nWith that...she closed the door, put the car in gear and drove off.\n\nWasn't until that exact moment... that I realized that I am standing in the middle of a fairly well-lit parking lot, with my pants down to my ankles and my cock still half erect!\n\nTrue to his word, my accountant has the funds transferred to Ann's bank...along with a personal note from him to me, which read:\n\n\"NO MORE BOATS!!! Don't care how nice it is, or how GREAT a deal you can get on it....NO MORE BOATS!!! (at least until your accounts have had a chance to heal themselves!)\n\nWe close the deal and I become the owner of a \"New to me\" Boat.\n\nAnn stays behind to talk business with her banker. While Bob and Max and I head out to look for somewhere to get the boat serviced. Unfortunately, we have picked a bad time of year, since most of the boat dealerships are already swamped with boats that people are wanting repaired or serviced so they can use them on the weekends during summer.\n\nWe finally find a place close to the Navy shipyards...that has a boat lift and storage racks where we can work on the boat ourselves. A bit pricey for what we are getting...but they have it, and we need it...so I'll just have to grit my teeth and pay the man what he asks.\n\nWe bring to boat to the boat lifts and the guy hoists it up out of the water...then transports it over to the storage racks and gently sets it down.\n\nMax immediately goes to work, inspecting the prop boots and bearings. Just as he surmised...they will have to be replaced, otherwise we will be facing mechanical failures in the near future. If the bearings seize then the props won't turn...and the boat is dead in the water...if the boots begin to leak...the ship could start taking on water...and if the bilge pumps can't keep up...down to the bottom the ship goes! Which reminds me...I need to call my accountant back... to give him the information on the boat, so that he can make sure that it is covered by insurance... just in case something does happen!",
        "Once Max has a shopping list of all the things, we need to work on the boat... we head over to the Marine Supply Store to pick everything we need up.\n\nGood news is, they have ALMOST everything that we need...in stock. Bad news is...the boots will have to be shipped from their warehouse in Chicago...which will take about a week to get here and a day or so to install.\n\nIt would be foolhardy to think that we could put the ship back into the water and expect to make it very far...without those parts.\n\nSo, we decide to let Max do as much as he can...until those parts arrive. Bob and I will begin cleaning top to bottom, inside and out.\n\nI rent a power washer to take off the accumulation of bird poo and river grime. Most of it comes off fairly easy. But there is a rusty looking water stain that refuses to budge...so that will require a lot more manual labor to get it off. We scrub and buff and polish until the old ship looks like new again! The interior just needs a thorough cleaning to get rid of all the cobwebs and dust that has built up from non-use.\n\nAnn stops by to invite us all to her house for dinner this evening. So, we are doing our best to get things finished early, so that we can all have time to get cleaned up... before she comes by to pick us up.\n\nShe arrives just as we are walking up the dock toward the parking lot.\n\n\"Hope you have all worked up a good appetite,\" Ann says as we get in the car \"I've whipped up a few local favorite dishes that I think you might enjoy\"\n\nAnn's house is in a very nice, quiet, well-kept neighborhood, near the end of a little cul-de-sac.\n\nWe follow her inside and the moment we step inside the front door...we can smell the wonderful aroma of all the food she has prepared for us.\n\n\"Hope you don't mind eating Buffet style. Just thought that might be the best way to serve everyone...just let them pick and choose what they want to try\"\n\nShe definitely had a wide variety of foods prepared... Soft shell crabs, crab cakes, Oysters done a couple of ways, casseroles, breads, and salad. If we go away hungry from this meal...it will be our own damn fault!\n\nWe all filled our plates and sat down at the dining table and truly enjoyed our meal. Could not have asked for better!\n\n\"So, how is the boat project coming along?\" Ann asked\n\n\"We've got it looking like new, inside and out...just waiting on a few parts, and once they are installed it will be ready to go back in the water\" I reply\n\n\"So, you will probably be leaving in a few days then?\"\n\n\"As much as we have enjoyed our stay here, we really need to be heading out soon, so that we can be across the Great lakes before the weather starts changing for the worst in the fall\"\n\nAnn sat there silently for a few moments, as if trying to build up the courage to say something...\n\n\"I've been doing some thinking and please forgive me for being so bold. But would you consider allowing me to tag along on this adventure you are all on?\n\n\"Now, before you give me your answer...please let me explain why I would love to travel with all of you.\n\nWhen my husband passed away... I was devastated and have often felt like a large part of my heart was buried with him. I just did not want to do anything but sit around and feel sorry for myself.\n\nHe left me in good enough shape financially that I really do not HAVE to work... But I NEED to work, just to keep myself occupied and keep from becoming one of those lonely old ladies that has 50 cats and talks to herself all the time!\n\nThe other night, when we all had our little \"get together\" ... THAT was the very first time... that I have felt like a living breathing sexually desirable woman since my husband's passing!\n\nWhen I am with the three of you...I feel like life really is worth living again...and I am truly dreading having to go back to my dreary existence after you have gone.\n\nSo, I thought that if you are willing to allow me to tag along...I will turn in my notice at work... and let my niece stay here in my house, rent free, just to have someone here to look after the place.\n\nShe works as a teacher at Langley AFB and is trying to save up to buy a house of her own...but the cost of her apartment is so high, that she really cannot save very much. I have tried to talk her into just moving in with me...but she does not want to impose...and I am sure she values her own privacy...able to come and go as she pleases without having to consult with anyone else... I get that!\n\nBut if I can come up with a good excuse... like being away for an extended amount of time. then she could move in here...and I will have a full-time house sitter...and she can sock away what she currently pays out in rent...and hopefully be able to afford a place of her own.\"\n\nI answer Ann by saying... \"Honestly, I have no problem with inviting you along. Been wondering how we were going to handle two boats with just three people. This just might be the answer! What do you think?\" I ask, directing my question at Bob and Max\n\n\"I think it's a great idea\" said Max \"Bob and I can navigate the Sea Ray and You and Ann can navigate the Chris Craft. Sure, either craft COULD be operated by one person, but it would be so much easier and safer to have at minimum a crew of two on each one. I am more familiar with operating a ship like the Sea Ray....and I am sure you can quickly teach Ann whatever she needs to know to help operate the Chris Craft.\n\n\"That works for me!\" Bob interjected \"We're going to be traveling together anyway, just makes sense to have two on each boat. That way, if either boat has trouble, you've got one person to pilot the ship and the other to throw safety lines or whatever\"\n\n\"Well, it looks like we have us another new deck hand! Welcome aboard Ann!\"\n\n\"Thank you all so much! That was surprisingly easy...\" Ann replied\n\n\"Betcha thought you would at least have to suck some dick, to get 'em to say yes. Huh?\" Bob Joked\n\n\"I was prepared to do whatever it takes!\" Ann joked back\n\n\"Guess we should have tried to negotiate a bit more!\" I say to Max\n\n\"Last time I checked, we haven't shaken hands to close the deal...Negotiations are still ongoing, the way I see it!\" Max replied\n\n\"Is sex ALL that these guys think about?\" Ann asks Bob\n\n\"Oh yes, crack either one of their heads open and the only thing that would fall out is teeny tiny boobs and pussies....and Boats! Got no room in there for much of anything else!\"\n\n\"Well, maybe I had better rethink this a bit... hmmmm\" Ann Jokes \"Okay, I can offer you each one blowjob and I can also offer cash money!\" then reaches into her pocket and pulls out two quarters and lays them on the table.\n\n\"DEAL!\" Max and I call out in unison, and both offer our hands to shake.\n\n\"Not so fast!\" Bob exclaims... \"Throw in a little girl on girl time and we got a deal!\"\n\n\"You got it!\" Ann declares as she shakes each of our hands. \"Okay, so now that I know that this really is going to happen...I've got a few things that I need to be able to stash on one of the ships. Won't take up much room, but I cannot leave it here. I would be absolutely mortified if my niece were to find this stuff...\"\n\n\"What kind of stuff are we talking about...and why do you need to stash it onboard one of the ships? Couldn't you just put it in a storage locker?\" Bob asks\n\n\"Follow me, said the spider to the fly...\" Ann beckons for us\n\nWe go down the hall to a closed and locked door.\n\nAnn says: this was our \"playroom.\" My husband and I used to have a LOT of fun in here. It is stuff that I simply cannot just throw away or put into storage, for a number of reasons. So, I need to clear it out before I let my niece move in. Once you see this stuff, I think you will understand why...\"\n\nWith that... she reaches for a key hidden above the door frame...uses it to open the door, then turn on the light...and we suddenly found ourselves inside what at first appeared to be just a standard guest bedroom. There is a large king-sized four poster bed. With matching bedside tables.\n\nTHEN, we begin to notice things that change the whole atmosphere of the room. On one wall is a glass doored bookshelf...which is not out of place in the least...until you notice that it is filled with all manner of \"adult toys,\" such as vibrators, very realistic looking rubber cocks... fur covered handcuffs, blindfolds, etc.\n\nOver in the corner is a sex swing...and in the other corner is a small, elevated platform with a stripper's pole!\n\nOkay...so this has just gone from your typical \"grandma's spare bedroom to a full-on SEX DEN!\n\n\"Goddam Ann! I think Rick has just been dethroned as the head pervert on this crew! All Hail the new queen!\" Bob exclaims in amazement\n\n\"I am certainly impressed!\" I say\n\n\"I'm scared!\" said Max in mock fright...\n\nAnn sidles up to Max and says \"Don't worry hun, I don't bite...too hard\" then pinches his butt\n\nBob ran over and jumped up on the small stage and grabs the stripper's pole. \"Damn this brings back some memories!\"\n\nAnn walks over and opens a cabinet to reveal a stereo music system and a panel of switches. \"This might trigger a few more memories for you\" she says as she turns on the stereo and Gun's and Roses Welcome to the Jungle\" begins to play. She flips a couple of other switches and suddenly there are flashing lights all around the stage and a spotlight beaming down from the top of the pole.\n\nBob immediately goes into her old act...dancing and stripping in time to the music. Got to admit...the girl has some moves!\n\nWhen she was completely naked, she did some maneuvers on the pole that defied gravity...and we were all amazed...to say the least!\n\nShe stepped down when the music stopped and sat down on the bed to rest for a moment. Ann went back to the stereo and did something...a few moments later \"Riders on the storm\" by the Doors was playing and Ann is doing an act of her own. For a woman of her age...she still has a LOT of energy and flexibility! Did not take long for her to get naked and start dancing around the pole provocatively. Her \"act\" might not have been quite as \"refined\" as Bob's, but I would have happily stuffed dollar bills in her g string if I had seen her performing this dance in a strip club!\n\nWhen the music ended...she joined Bob on the bed to catch her breath. \"That used to be a whole lot easier when I was 30lbs lighter! My husband used to just love the fact that I would strip for him... even when cancer was slowly taking him away from me... he always enjoyed our \"naughty time\" together\"\n\n\"NEXT!\" Bob called out... and Ann repeated...\n\nMax and I just stood there making excuses for why we couldn't try to do a strip show for the girls...\n\nOh, come on! PUSSIES!\" Bob heckles\n\n\"All you have to do is move that ass and swing that dick, while losing your clothes. It's not rocket science guys!\" Ann teases\n\nNot wanting to be the last one standing here fully clothed, I say, \"Oh what the fuck\" and go over to the sound system and see that there is a whole playlist of songs to choose from.\n\nSo, I pick \"Born to be Wild\" by Steppenwolf...and once the music starts to play...I start doing without a doubt the cheesiest \"Dad\" dance that anyone has ever seen. We are all laughing so hard that I can barely keep time with the music and get my clothes off. But get them off I do...and grab ahold of the pole...not realizing that the damn thing has bearings in it to make it spin...so I lose my grip and end up flying off the stage landing on to my hands and knees on the floor before I can catch myself.\n\nThis is when I realize something about growing older! If you are young...and you do something very stupid and end up falling down. Everyone just laughs and points and makes fun of you.\n\nBut when you get older and do the same thing...then everyone gasps \"oh my god\" and rushes to see if you have hurt yourself!\n\nTo my embarrassment...I got the gasps and the rushing to my aid thing!\n\nLuckily nothing was hurt but my dignity...so, I got up off the floor and joined the girls on the end of the bed.\n\n\"Well Max, it's up to you to try to pull a win out of this for the guys! I sure as hell couldn't do it!\" I say\n\nMax gives me a \"do I really have to?\" look; then goes over to pick out his music. In a few moments \"Flirtin' with Disaster\" by Molly Hatchet begins to play and we are ALL shocked at how quickly Max came out of his shell and out of his clothes at the same time!\n\nFor a guy, he definitely has a few very sexy moves...that were not escaping the eye of both women! Okay, I admit...I looked too! He was down to just his underwear when he climbed up the pole and placing one hand high on the pole and one hand down low on the pole...he extended his body out until he resembled a flag...his body extended straight out sideways from the pole. He lowered himself back down...climbed up the pole a bit further and wrapped his legs around the pole as he turned upside down. Somehow, he managed to wrap the waistband of his underwear around the pole so that as he slid down ...off they came so that he was completely naked when he stood up again. Then he moved to the edge of the stage and did the \"helicopter\" thing with his dick...\n\n\"Now you are just showing off!\" I call out\n\nBoth girls looked at me and Bob said \"Hey, you had your chance! We are watching a true artist perform here...so keep your comments to yourself!\"\n\nWhen the music stopped Max came over and joined the rest of us on the bed.\n\n\"What say you and I have a little bit of fun, while we let these poor guys rest up a bit.\" Ann says to Bob\n\n\"Splendid Idea\" Bob replies\n\n\"Have you ever tried one of these swings?\" Ann inquires\n\n\"I've heard about them but never actually saw one in person or seen one in use\"\n\n\"Then you are in for a treat\" Ann says as she guides Bob over to the other corner of the room. Have yourself a seat right here... then put your feet into these stirrups...then just lean back and relax and I will take care of the rest.\n\nAnn pulls a small round padded stool over and positions it in front of Bob in the swing...then she goes over to the bookshelf with the toys and selects a few items...as well as a couple of bottles of lube...and sets them on the floor by the padded stool.\n\nAnn sits down on the stool and reaches between her legs to operate a lever that raises or lowers the seat to whatever height is needed. Which in this case...brings Bob's pussy directly in front of Ann's face.\n\nShe uses her fingers to open Bob's vagina then leans forward and flicks her tongue across her clit.\n\nThe pleasurable sensations are so intense that Bob bucks and thrashes in the swing, but she cannot move away from Ann's busy tongue.\n\n\"DAY-UM!\" Bob cries out \"Girlfriend, this ain't your first coochie rodeo. Is it?\"\n\nAnn stops what she is doing long enough to say \"I went to an all-girls boarding school when I was younger. I would have gone totally insane if my roommates hadn't shown me a thing or two...\"\n\nShe reaches down and picks up a bottle of the lube and a wand shaped vibrator. \"This might be a little cold at first...but you are going to love it!\"\n\nShe applies some of the lube to the baseball sized globe on the end...then lets some of the lube trickle down on Bob's clit... and into her labial folds\n\n\"You guys' best be getting prepared because she is going to be BEGGING for some real cock, here in just a few minutes.\n\nAnn touches the end of the vibrator to the top of Bob's pubic mound and works It up and down near her clit. As Bob begins to moan and struggle as she feels a major orgasm brewing deep inside. Ann reaches down and inserts first one, then two then three of her fingers and begins pumping them in and out of her wet, slippery hole. Bob is crying out so loudly and forcefully that I was concerned that what Ann was doing...was causing her intense pain.\n\nBut it soon became quite evident that was NOT the case. Bob stiffened her body for a few seconds, then let out a moan, followed by a deep intake of air! Her eyes which had been clenched tightly shut...immediately opened with a wild-eyed look as he body began to spasm.\n\nBob's body jerked and shook as the pleasurable sensations took over all control of her body movements...\n\n\"Quick, she needs a hard cock in her now! Take her to a whole other level... DO IT..DO IT NOW!\" Ann yelled out...\n\nMax was the closest...so he immediately jumped up and got into position to ram his cock deep inside of Bob's throbbing cunt.\n\nHe slid his cock into her in one swift move...causing Bob to scream out \"YES! OH, MY FUCKING GOD YES!!!\"\n\nMax was able to grab ahold of the ropes of the swing and use them as leverage as he pounded his cock into Bob's soaking wet pussy. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, FUUUUCK... don't you DARE stop, Don't you Dare! Give that goddam cock to me...pound my pussy, pound my mother fucking pussy!\" Bob screams out as she frantically grabs for anything to hold onto...so that she can maintain her grip on her sanity.\n\n\"Slap, slap, slap\" is the only sound we can hear for a few moments as Max continues to fuck Bob with every bit of passion that he can muster. His thrusting hips...which only moments ago, had been so rhythmic in their motion...suddenly become very erratic as he unloads his cum deep inside of her. He is so giddy at this point that all he can do is laugh as the semen flows from his cock.\n\nWhen he slides his slick wet cock from her gaping hole...a rush of their combined juices flows out and forms a puddle on the floor.\n\nAnn turns to me and says \"Well that was very entertaining...care to join me on the bed for a bit of fun of our own?\"\n\n\"Thought you would never ask!\" I reply\n\nAnn moves around to the side of the bed and lifts up one corner at a time...flipping a leather restraint out, each time she does.\n\n\"Should be two more on your side\" she instructs\n\nI retrieve the two straps on my side of the bed.\n\n\"I just love a little light bondage now and then, don't you?\" she asks\n\n\"Can't honestly say that I have ever tried it\" I reply honestly\n\n\"Oh, then you are going to love this! I want you to fasten each of the cuffs around my wrists and my ankles... so that I am tied spread eagle on the bed. Then you are free to do anything that you want to me... just as long as it does not involve pain, pee, or poo. I just love the feeling of being totally at someone else's mercy. I would NEVER even dream of doing this with someone that I didn't trust implicitly. So, you can consider this to be the highest compliment I can pay to you. By allowing myself to be so vulnerable.\n\nAnn lays down on the bed and extends her arms and legs. I wrap the leather bands around each limb and secure them with the Velcro strips that have been sewn to them.\n\n\"Well, now that you have me...what do you want to do with me?\" she asks\n\n\"Hmmm, very good question\" I say\n\n\"Guess I could check to see just how ticklish you are!\" I say as I begin looking for \"tickle spots.\" Turns out that she is VERY ticklish, and I am VERY good at finding those special triggers that send her into fits of laughter.\n\nShe is laughing so hard that tears are flowing down her cheeks...\"Stop, please stop...you'll make me wet the bed!\"\n\n\"If I must!\" I say \"Guess you did tell me that I couldn't do anything that involved pee...\"\n\nSo, I bend over and take one of her nipples into my mouth and gently bite it as my tongue flicks the end that is trapped inside my mouth. Apparently, this is having the desired effect as the whole areola becomes rough as it is stimulated.\n\nAs I move over to the other breast, I use my fingers to gently roll the hardened and extended nipple, to keep the arousal effect going.\n\nI work my way back and forth between the two breasts...orally stimulating one nipple, then the other. Ann is obviously enjoying this as she is moaning, cooing, and bucking her hips.\n\nI decide to move a bit further south and lick a trail down the center of her stomach...down past her belly button... down to that glorious patch of hair that surrounds her pussy.",
        "I purposely avoid her clit as I kiss and lick my way around the edges of her vagina...kissing the crease where the belly ends, and her thigh begins. I go back and forth a couple of times...just to build the anticipation. Finally stopping in the middle to use my tongue on her clit. She is REALLY bucking and humping now...I continue my assault until she stiffens and groans as her orgasm takes over...\n\nWhen she calms down again... she looks me right in the eyes and says, \"Please fuck me, I NEED to feel your cock inside me!\"\n\nI move up into position and insert my cock into her wet slippery pussy and it sinks in...all the way to my balls in one smooth movement. I lay on top of her, sawing my hard cock in and out of her with increasing speed.\n\nJust as I am about to reach the point of no return...she whispers in my ear...\" Please don't cum inside me...I want you to stand up on the bed and shoot your cum in my face and on my chest and in my hair... I want to be covered in your hot cum.\n\n\"If that is what the lady wants, then that is what the lady gets\" I think to myself as I grip the base of my cock tightly to hold back the load of cum that is building up pressure deep inside. I pull my cock out of her and stand up on the bed...my feet straddling her midsection....as I jack my cock to start the release of my hot sperm.\n\nShe wanted to be covered in cum... well, she got her wish! She had drops of cum in her hair, across her nose, cheeks, and forehead...I saw a little bit fall into her open mouth... and she definitely had a \"pearl necklace\" of cum droplets stretching around her neck and across the top of her breasts.\n\nI quickly regain my senses and realize that Ann is trapped in this predicament. So, I quickly loosen the Velcro fastener from each restraint and grab some tissues from the box on the bedside table. Together we clean up the evidence of our fun time together.\n\n\"I'm sorry for making such a mess!\" I tell her as a feeling of guilt washes over me.\n\n\"Why be sorry for something that I ASKED you to do?\" Ann Replied\n\n\"Just a ghost from my past, making a visit, I guess. My wife always made me feel that ejaculating on her, was degrading to her. I was supposed to either \"finish\" as she called it...inside her...or pull out and pump it into my hand...even then she always treated my ejaculate as something evil and vile and to be disposed of as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly do not view it that way...and actually enjoy the feeling of hot cum being ejaculated on different areas of my body. Love it on my face, on my tits, even on my feet! Nothing better for smooth silky skin that using cum for a skin treatment!\"\n\n\"Damn, Learn something new every day! If I had only known, when I was younger... I could have made a fortune selling my cum as a skin care cream\"\n\n\"So, how much of this stuff do you think I can take with me?\" Ann asks as she looks around at all of her \"treasures\"\n\n\"Every freaking bit of it...you ain't leaving NONE of this behind!\" Bob declares. \"I'll water ski behind the fucking boat...all the way back to Missouri, before we leave any of this stuff behind!\"\n\n\"Don't think it will be any problem at all...\" I say \"We won't need to stock the \"Queen Ann\" as heavily as we do the \"Tia Maria\" ...so there should be plenty of room for things you want to take along\"\n\n\"The Queen Ann?\" Ann asks\n\n\"Yep, Bob named the boat just a bit ago and didn't even know it. Once we get the boat back in the water...we will have to do a \"Naming ceremony\" to properly name her..."
