        "September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2019\n\nDear Diary,\n\nWhere to start? How about I can't stop smiling? How about I've never been so thoroughly fucked in all my life? How about for the first time in years I feel wanted, desirable, and do I dare say it... sexy?\n\nMy pussy was so sore this morning I could barely walk, but damned if I can't wait for Ryan to get here so we can do it all over again. What started with me moping into a glass of wine turned into, well, the best night of my life. He took me back to his place and fucked me, and fucked me, and then fucked me some more. Sex has never(!!!) been like last night, even when I was younger. He absolutely ravaged me, and I loved every minute of it. It's a good thing today is Saturday. If I'd had to go into the office today, not only would everyone wonder why I was walking bowlegged, but I wouldn't get shit done for thinking about why I was sore, and how much I wanted to feel him inside me again.\n\nHe's going to pick me up about six and we're going to dinner. People will probably think I'm having dinner with my son, but I don't care. Despite what he said, maybe he's living out some kind of mommy fantasy, or maybe he's bragging to his friends right now about how he banged an MILF. I don't care about that either. I deserve to have some fun and last night... well... last night and this morning was the most fun I've had in years!\n\nI'm getting sleepy after my soak in the bath. I think I'll take a nap. If he can stay up all night, like he did last night, I want to be well rested, so I can stay up all night myself. God! I'm getting wet just thinking about it! 52 years old and I'm panting over some guy just because he fucked me stupid and blind last night.\n\nIf I knew being divorced was this much fun, I'd have kicked Bob out years ago!\n\nI jammed my laptop into its case. It was Friday but that made little difference to me. It was just another shitty day in another shitty week in my shitty life. I shrugged into my coat and slung the laptop bag over my shoulder.\n\n\"Have a good weekend,\" I mumbled to Rachael on my way past. Just because I was in a bad mood didn't mean I had to take it out on the help.\n\n\"Thank you, Ms. Burkes! You too!\"\n\nThere were still a few clerks and paralegals in the office, doing the grunt work that kept the office running, but I was the only partner. We didn't like close on Friday afternoons because if something went wrong we had no time to recover before the weekend, so the other partner, Paul Chelsey, always took advantage of the dead office and left between eleven and noon. Because I had nowhere to go and nothing to do, I stayed, but doing so invariably put me in a bad mood.\n\nWell, a worse mood than normal, I thought to myself.\n\nWork had been my life for the past five years, but never more so than the last three, and most especially the last year. For the past year I came into the office, worked, and went home to an empty apartment. It sucked, and I hated it, but I felt like the classic third wheel. Since my separation and divorce I'd all but stopped seeing friends. Bob and I hadn't been social butterflies even before things turned completely sour between us, but we did occasionally go to dinner with friends. Now, however, being the single woman out with a married couple just felt wrong. Maybe it was my imagination, but it seemed that wives who were once my friend were now looking at me differently than they had when I was still married. Maybe they thought I was going to try to steal their husband as mine had been stolen from me.\n\nI chucked the laptop into the backseat of my C 63 before I dropped into the driver's seat, started the car, and sat as the air conditioning blasted to cool the interior from the late summer heat. I stared at the featureless brick wall of my office. My divorce had finalized almost two months ago, but I was still smarting, even though I'd tried to put Bob's treachery behind me from the moment he told me he was leaving me. I could have fucked him good in court. I could have tried to extract my pound of flesh, could have demanded half of his constructions company, which was worth two or three times what my half of the practice was, when splitting our assets, but I just wanted it over. After we'd signed the agreement where we'd agreed to keep our respective businesses, split the house and the rest of the property fifty-fifty, and ask for no spousal support, I'd turned my back on him. I'd moved out of our house into a nice apartment, bought myself some new clothes, and decided to extract my revenge by living well.\n\nI shook myself out of my reverie and placed the car into reverse. Except it hadn't worked out that way. When I'd decided to move out, wanting to get away from the memories contained within the wall of the big empty house, I had visions of dating rich and handsome men and traveling to exotic locations. A divorce in North Carolina required a minimum of a year's separation, and rather than dating and traveling, I'd spent the year working longer hours and hiding in my apartment. I kept telling myself that as soon as the divorce was finalized I'd start going out more. My routine hadn't changed since I signed the papers that made me a free woman.\n\nWhat's your excuse now?\n\nAs I rolled to a stop at a light, I could feel the tears trying to start. I willed them away with a soft, sighing gasp. I'd cried exactly once after our split, and that was all the tears that asshole was getting from me. I'd heard through mutual friends that Bob already had a live-in girlfriend who, according to the gossip, was at least twenty years younger than him, and they'd been waiting for the divorce to finalize before they married.\n\nMore power to them. I hope they live happily ever after.\n\nExcept I didn't. It wasn't fair that he was the one who destroyed our marriage because he couldn't keep his manhood in his pants, and yet he was the one who had moved on and was enjoying life. Bob had always been a selfish prick. I still couldn't believe that it took him cheating on me for me to realize that.\n\nThe light winked to green and I pulled away. I didn't want to go back to my lonely apartment, but I had nowhere else to go. I had nobody to share a meal or a drink with. I didn't even have a cat at home. I drove past De Jure\u2014Latin for In Law\u2014which was the local watering hole for the legal crowd. I rolled to a stop at the next light and glanced into the rearview mirror, watching a well-dressed couple open the door to De Jure half a block behind me before my view was blocked by an approaching pickup.\n\nA polite toot of the horn from the F150 behind me brought my attention back to the moment and the green light that glowed. I waved my hand in apology as I pulled away. I drove another couple of blocks, leaving the downtown area where the law and investment firms had congregated.\n\nI couldn't get the image of the couple out of my head. Were they dating, or were they coworkers enjoying an after-work drink before leaving for separate lives? Why was I so alone, unable to connect with friends? Nobody blamed me for what happened. Most said I was better off without him, but I wasn't sure. I surely didn't love the prick anymore. Any love I'd had for him had died along with the marriage, but living alone was no panacea.\n\nPinching my lips tight, I signaled and pulled into the center turn lane, waited for traffic to pass, and then made a left. A quick loop around the block and I was headed back to De Jure. As the three blocks passed, I considered turning around again, but instead of continuing past, I slowed and turned into the establishment's parking lot. I'd been to De Jure before, but after I claimed a parking space I sat in my car, the engine idling, wondering why I was there. Percy Sledge crooned away about how a man loved a woman on the radio and I snapped off the stereo in annoyance.\n\nI placed my hand on the gear selector, almost selecting reverse and backing out of my space, but instead I switched the car off and opened the door, forcing myself to step out of the car. I tugged my jacket smooth as I made my way to the door, holding my head high.\n\nDe Jure was a low-key place, a cross between an Irish pub, mid-scale restaurant, and a pickup joint. I hadn't darkened De Jure's door in over a year, but nothing had changed. It still had the oak and brass that reminded me of a pub, the long bar occupied by young men and woman chatting each other up, and the double row of tables with the red and white tablecloths to the right side. The walls were covered with fake law degrees from various universities, pictures of the local courthouse through the years, and photos of stern looking judges glaring at the patrons.\n\nIt was a nice, upscale place, but as soon as I'd stepped inside, I immediately remembered why I didn't frequent the place often. The men and women at the bar were already engaged in the slow dance of seduction, with their too loud laughs and over bright smiles. I changed my mind about staying and turned to leave, but a pair of men entered before I could turn. I was causing confusion and bottling up traffic as three well-dressed women opened the door immediately behind the men and waited for the traffic jam I was causing in the door to clear. Flushing, I muttered an apology as I stepped away from the door and continued deeper into the room, claiming the table farthest from the door and deepest in the corner.\n\n\"Hi! I'm Jenny, and I'll be taking care of you this evening. What can I get'cha?\" the waitress asked as she glided to a stop at my table.\n\nI glanced up and forced a smile. When did they start letting sixteen-year-olds work in bars? \"Chardonnay?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Coming up. You want a menu?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nShe dropped the laminated sheet of paper on the table before turning and hurrying away. To pass the time while I waited on my glass, I glanced at the wine selection. I'd never heard of Cloud Break, the Chardonnay listed. My gaze traveled the bar, recognizing several members of the legal community, before my gaze returned to the menu. There were a few older patrons, most of them occupying a table as I was, but the bulk of the traffic at the bar proper were in their twenties and thirties.\n\nI recalled the food was good, so I glanced over the offered selections. Baby steps... baby steps. Eating out. Whoo-hoo! Next thing I know I'm might say 'hi' to someone in my apartment building.\n\nI was debating between the grilled chicken salad and the chef's salad when Jenny returned and placed my glass in front of me. \"Ready to order?\"\n\nI wasn't sure I wanted to stay long enough to eat. \"Can you give me a few minutes?\"\n\n\"No problem!\"\n\nMy gaze swept the bar again. There was a young guy chatting up a woman with big breasts, and she was defiantly telegraphing her interest with the way she leaned in close and placed her hand on his arm as she laughed. The thing was, he was looking at me instead of her. He looked familiar, but I couldn't place where I'd seen him. Maybe I'd done the closing on his house or something. I took a sip of my wine and then stared into the glass as if I expected to find answers in the liquid.\n\n\"Ready to order?\" Jenny asked.\n\nI wondered how long I'd been staring into my glass. It seemed like she'd just delivered my beverage. I handed her the menu. \"Not tonight, I think. Just the wine.\"\n\nShe smiled as if that was the best news she'd had all night. \"Okay. I'll check on you again in a few minutes.\"\n\nI stared at the glass again, slowly spinning the container by the stem. I took another sip, but nothing changed. Like at home, time seemed to grind to a stop as I stared at nothing, my mind empty of thoughts. It was this feeling, the feeling of being disconnected that I hated the most. More often than I liked I would sit and watch some inane program on the television, and when it was over, I couldn't remember a thing I'd seen.\n\n\"Doing okay?\" Jenny asked, pulling me back to the present.\n\nI glanced at my glass. It was half empty, and I couldn't remember drinking any of it. \"Fine. I think this is all I need, except for the check.\"\n\n\"Already taken care of.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, not certain I understood what she was saying.\n\nJenny jerked her head toward the bar. \"Someone picked the tab up for you.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nJenny turned. \"The guy there in the middle, wearing the dark suit with the loosened red tie.\"\n\nIt was the man I'd noticed before. When our gazes met, he smiled and raised his glass to me. There were considerably more people clustered around the bar now than before, but Ms. Big Boobs had moved on. I nodded at him and smiled in acknowledgement.\n\n\"Thank you, Jenny.\"\n\n\"My pleasure!\"\n\nAs Jenny left, the man heaved himself off the bar and started toward me. It took real effort for me to not to roll my eyes. I didn't want to have to deal with some pickup artist. Still... I know I've seen him before... somewhere.\n\nHe eased to a stop beside my table. \"Ms. Slatterly?\"\n\nNot anymore. \"I'm sorry, but do I know you?\"\n\nHe didn't try to sit. \"Ryan Kirkwood. I assisted your husband's divorce attorney.\"\n\nThe moment he said 'husband' his face clicked. I tried to be pleasant. It wasn't his fault Bob was a dick. \"What can I do for you, Mr. Kirkwood?\" I asked, and despite my efforts, I heard the coldness in my voice.\n\nHe held my gaze for a moment. \"Nothing. I only wanted to say... thank you.\"\n\n'Thank you' wasn't even on list of things I was expecting him to say. \"Thank you?\"\n\nHe nodded slowly. \"Yeah. Your divorce was my first-time flying solo.\" A faint smile touched his lips. \"It was so straight forward that the partners trusted me to handle the separation agreement by myself. Thank you for not taking advantage of me and making me look like a total idiot.\"\n\n\"Why would I make you look like an idiot?\"\n\nHis tiny smile grew a little more. \"I'd just been hired by Valverde & Kobelt, and after observing and assisting on a few cases, they let me take a more active role with your divorce to see what I could do with it. I know you're a lawyer, a partner at Chelsey & Burkes, and I appreciate you not... making me go beg for help... or slipping something past me and embarrassing me.\"\n\n\"Well... you're welcome... I guess.\" I paused a moment and he began to turn away. \"And thank you for the wine.\"\n\nHe turned back, his lips graced with a true smile this time. \"The least I could do to show my appreciation.\" He turned away again, but after taking only one step, he paused and turned back. \"I'm sorry, and I hope you don't mind me saying so, but your husband\u2014</span>\"\n\n\"Ex-husband,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Your divorce is final?\"\n\nI nodded. \"About two months now.\"\n\nHe nodded as if he found that bit of news pleasing. \"Your ex-husband is an idiot.\"\n\nI held my glass up in salute. \"On that, we agree.\"\n\nHe nodded once and pivoted again.\n\nAsk him to sit down! the devil on my shoulder shouted.\n\nDon't encourage him! He's too young for us! the angel on my other shoulder countered.\n\nMy angel didn't put up much of a fight when the devil bitch-slapped her into silence. \"Ryan!\" He stopped and turned back to me. \"Would you like to sit down?\"\n\nHe beamed at me as he slid into the booth across the table from me. \"May I get you another?\" he asked as he nodded at my glass.\"\n\n\"No, but thank you.\" I jerked my chin at his glass. \"What are you drinking?\"\n\n\"Coke.\"\n\n\"Coke and what?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just Coke.\"\n\n\"You came into a bar and ordered a Coke?\" He bobbed his head. \"Why?\"\n\nHis eyes danced. He was no male model. He didn't have the brooding eyes and dangerous air that models always seemed to have, but he wasn't unattractive. He had a friendly, open, boy next door kind of charm. His dirty-blond hair was carefully trimmed and styled, and while he wasn't bulging with muscles, he was well built and glowed with the vitality of youth. He also had the most amazing hazel eyes that seemed to peer directly into my soul.\n\n\"So I'd remember in case I met someone interesting.\"\n\n\"Think you will?\"\n\n\"I already have,\" he said, his tone as frank and straight forward as if I'd asked if he planned to put on pants.\n\nI flushed and looked into my glass, but I forced my eyes up. \"Why did you say Bob was an idiot? That's not a very professional thing to say about your client.\"\n\n\"He's not my client, never was technically, and I think the reason is self-evident.\"\n\nI watched him, my curiosity urging me to demand more explanation. I had my reasons for thinking Bob was an idiot, but I wondered about Ryan's. After an awkwardly long silence I couldn't stand the tension anymore. \"Do tell,\" I murmured.\n\n\"He had you, and he threw you away for Ms. Rankin.\"\n\nI held his gaze. His tone was as honest and open as before, and I had no sense he was trying to flatter me. \"Happens all the time,\" I grumbled.\n\n\"Maybe, but it doesn't change my opinion.\"\n\nI grunted. \"You'd prefer me over Bethany. Right...\" I drawled.\n\nHe didn't smile. \"In a heartbeat.\" I snorted as I picked up my glass. \"She's not my type, but maybe she really does love your ex. I saw her eyes light up once, in my office, when she looked at Mr. Slatterly.\" He paused for effect as I took a sip. \"Then I realized it was just sun shining through the window and into her ear.\"\n\nI bubbled and spluttered into the glass and then coughed once as he smiled, probably pleased with my reaction. I dabbed at my lips as I snickered again. \"Isn't that what men want, the pretty but vacuous bimbo?\"\n\n\"See, that's what I mean. 'Vacuous.' If you asked Ms. Rankin that, she'd ask if that was a type of vacuum cleaner.\" I snickered again as he continued. \"If I wanted to have a conversation with a houseplant...\"\n\n\"You have to admit, though, she's beautiful.\"\n\nHe nodded slowly in agreement. \"Yes, but so are you, and you have an IQ that's higher than room temperature.\"\n\n\"Really? You think I'm beautiful?\" I asked, but my tone said that I didn't believe him.\n\nHe again nodded slowly. \"You're one of the most beautiful women I've ever met.\" This time I did I roll my eyes before I looked away. \"You don't think you're beautiful?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" I demanded. \"Why are you feeding me that line of bullshit?\"\n\n\"It's not a line of bullshit.\"\n\n\"I'm old enough to be your mother.\"\n\nHe held my gaze for a moment. \"Maybe, if you were just a kid yourself. That doesn't make you any less beautiful.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Twenty-seven.\"\n\nI sniffed as I looked away. \"Hardly a kid, then.\"\n\n\"Bull. You can't be much over forty, forty-five at the outside.\"\n\nI held his gaze for a moment. \"I'm almost ten years older than that,\" I murmured, preferring to round down from forty-five to rounding up from forty.\n\n\"Bullshit!\" I smiled at my glass but said nothing, secretly pleased by his reaction. After a long pause, maybe waiting to see if I'd say I was kidding, he spoke again. \"Even if that's true, it still doesn't change my opinion. In fact, it only reinforces it.\"\n\n\"That Bob is an idiot?\" He nodded once. That seemed to be his style, a single, simple, nod to show he'd heard. Sometime Bob wouldn't shut up, uncomfortable with silence, but I liked Ryan's simple indication that he was listening. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Same as before.\"\n\nI held his gaze. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Trying to flatter me.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to flatter you. I came over to tell you thank you. Maybe I shouldn't have said what I did about Mr. Slatterly, but it's what I think.\" He didn't say anything else, and as the silence lengthened, I looked up from my drink. \"And you looked like you could use a friend,\" he added softly.\n\n\"That's why you bought my drink? Because I looked like I needed a friend?\"\n\n\"No, that's not it at all.\"\n\n\"Then why?\"",
        "\"I told you, and I... well... nothing.\"\n\n\"And you... what?\"\n\nFor the first time he looked unsure of himself. \"It's not important.\"\n\nI looked at him, my expression clearly telling him I didn't appreciate his games. \"You what?\" I repeated.\n\n\"It's not important. I don't want you to think I'm hitting on you or something.\"\n\n\"Are you?\"\n\n\"Hitting on you?\" This time it was my turn to nod. \"No.\"\n\n\"Then what were you going to say?\"\n\nHe held my gaze and I could see the debate going on in his eyes. \"I wanted to tell you that I admired your class, but since you already think I'm feeding you a line of B.S...\"\n\n\"My class?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Mr. Slatterly is...\"\n\n\"Is?\" I prompted when he didn't continue.\n\nHis lips thinned. \"Pardon me for saying so, but I think you deserved better, and could have done better.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Really?\" he asked, his right eyebrow trying to crawl into his hair. His tone made it clear that not only did he know the reason, it also made clear that he knew I knew he knew the reason.\n\nI returned my gaze to my glass. \"What do you know about our marriage?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Most of it. I think he was afraid you were going to try to take him to the cleaners, or go after Ms. Rankin for alienation of affection, so he was pretty open. He had three affairs while you were married, offered as proof the marriage was over before he met Ms. Rankin. He said you'd drifted apart, you rarely had sex, and he wanted out. He tried to make it sound like it was your fault that he had his affairs. Even though Mr. Slatterly was a total douche, you seemed to shrug it off, like he was beneath your notice. I thought you were a class act.\"\n\n\"And Bob was an idiot?\"\n\nHe raised his glass in silent agreement and took a sip.\n\nFor half our marriage, more than ten years, our marriage had been running on autopilot. Five years ago, Bob started having trouble in the bedroom. He couldn't always get it up, and even when he could, he often wasn't able to keep it up, and our sex life had withered and died. We'd gone from having sex three or four times a week when we were first married, to once a week as our marriage began to coast, then to once every couple of weeks, to finally, in the last few years, to less than once a month. Then it had stopped entirely.\n\nThe irony was, I hadn't really cared the sex was dying. Not at first, but when he asked for a divorce, that was when it became clear why he couldn't keep it up. That's what'd hurt. Bob was still a good-looking guy, and I'd worked hard not to let myself go. There was nothing I could do about time and gravity, but I was still trim and active for a woman in her early fifties, but it hadn't been enough. He'd said it wasn't me. After a year of contemplation, I'd decided he was telling the truth. It wasn't me. It was him, and his fucking inability to keep his pants zipped.\n\n\"Did he tell you the reason we never had sex was because he couldn't get it up?\" I asked as I stared into my glass.\n\n\"No,\" he said softly.\n\nI nodded. \"For the last couple of years. Turns out, it wasn't that he couldn't get it up, it was that he couldn't get up with me because was getting it up for someone else.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said just as softly.\n\nI looked up and met his gaze. \"Like I said, it happens all the time.\" I drained the last swallow of my wine. \"Thank you for the wine,\" I said as I began to slide out of the booth.\n\n\"You're welcome,\" he replied, sliding out with me. He tossed a five on the table, perhaps as a tip, and I wondered if he thought he was leaving with me. \"Enjoy your evening.\"\n\nI forced a smile, my mood soured by memories. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Ms. Slatterly, one more thing,\" he said as I started to step around him. He was taller than I realized, standing at least ten or eleven inches taller than my five foot two, and a couple of inches taller than Bob.\n\n\"It's Burkes, and what is it?\"\n\nHe held my gaze for a moment. \"Some guys would have appreciated what he had.\"\n\n\"Like you?\"\n\n\"I don't know you, but maybe. I can say I wouldn't have cheated on you. At the very least I would have manned up and given you that much respect.\"\n\n\"That's what Bob said, too.\"\n\nHe stepped aside. \"So your ex-husband's a douche, an idiot, and now I know he's a liar too.\"\n\nI forced another smile, but there was no humor in it. \"Another thing we agree on,\" I murmured as I stepped past him.\n\nI made it three steps before I slowed to a stop. I turned back to him, and I was secretly pleased he was watching me. \"Walk me to my car?\"\n\nWhat are we doing? my angel cried.\n\nShut the hell up! my devil snarled in return.\n\nI had no idea what possessed me to ask him to escort me, the words out of my mouth before I could stop them, but it felt good to have a man, a handsome man, paying attention to me, and yes, flattering me.\n\nHe broke into his largest smile yet as he placed his glass on the table. He said nothing, and didn't touch me as he passed, walking a half-step in front of me before pausing to open the door for me.\n\n\"Where's your car?\"\n\n\"On the side.\" He followed me around the corner. \"The silver Mercedes.\" He escorted me to my car.\n\n\"Nice car,\" he murmured as we approached.\n\nI paused at the door but didn't open it. I turned to face him. He still hadn't touched me, but he was standing close, as lovers would, though I didn't feel threatened. He was giving me some space yet seemingly wanting to be close to me. I looked up and held his gaze.\n\n\"What's your game?\"\n\n\"No game.\"\n\n\"You expect me to believe that a twenty-seven-year-old is interested in me?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I'm more than twenty years older than you?\"\n\n\"You seem to be the only one concerned with the age difference.\" I continued to watch his eyes, looking for a lie. \"Why is this so hard for you?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"Because,\" I murmured, dropping my gaze.\n\n\"Because you don't think your beautiful? Because you can't imagine a man might find you attractive and interesting? You don't have to be twenty to be beautiful, and I already know you're much more interesting than a lot of women.\"\n\n\"Maybe...\" I mumbled.\n\n\"Do you think Salma Hydek and Cathern Zeta Jones are beautiful?\"\n\nI didn't recognize the first name, but I did the second. I'd seen Cathern in the movie Zorro years ago, and while I didn't know her age, I knew she wasn't a twenty-something. I also knew Cathern was stunning, so I assumed Salma was as well. \"Yes, but I'm not them, am I?\"\n\nHe held my gaze. \"No,\" he replied softly. \"You don't have the benefit of professional makeup and airbrushed photographs. They're not real. You are.\"\n\nI was starting to sweat, and I wasn't sure it was all from the weather. \"What? Are you living out some kind of mommy fantasy?\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed and hardened slightly. \"If that's what you think,\" he said, reaching for and pulling on the door handle of my car. As I was standing close, the car had sensed my key and it opened.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, looking down in shame. He said nothing, still holding the door open, and I felt even worse. \"I should go,\" I whispered as I turned away from him.\n\n\"You've been hurt,\" he said before I could settle into my car. \"I get that. I'm not promising you anything except to be honest with you.\" He paused as my heart hammered in my chest. \"Let me take you home. Let me show you I'm not playing mind games.\"\n\nDo it! my devil cried.\n\nNo! We don't know anything about him! my angel countered.\n\nWe haven't had a man between our legs in more than three years!\n\nIt could be dangerous!\n\nLive a little!\n\nHe could hurt us!\n\nWe're already hurting! At least maybe he'll give us a good fucking!\n\nWhat will people think?\n\nYeah, we wouldn't want anyone thinking we're a sexy MILF for pulling a young stud like him!\n\n\"Where do you live?\" I whispered.\n\nHe broke into a broad smile. \"Not far from here.\"\n\nI licked my lips. \"I...\"\n\n\"I won't hurt you...?\" he said, his voice trailing away when I paused.\n\n\"Michelle,\" I murmured.\n\n\"I won't hurt you, Michelle.\"\n\nI swallowed hard. \"I've never done anything like this before.\"\n\nA slight gust of wind swirled, blowing my shoulder length brown hair into my eyes. I started to push it back, but he was already reaching for me, softly brushing the strands out of my face with the lightest of touches.\n\n\"Let me show you how it feels to be wanted.\"\n\nI almost shivered, despite the warmth of the late summer day, and my mouth was suddenly dry. I swallowed hard. \"Yes. Please.\"\n\n\"I'm going to kiss you.\"\n\nIt wasn't a question, but he gave me plenty of time to object. When I didn't, he leaned in slowly, bringing his lips close to mine, stopping with our lips millimeters apart. When I didn't pull back, he closed the remaining distance. The kiss was amazing, soft and warm, with just a hint of desire and heat. He slowly pulled back, his gaze soft, but I could see the desire burning in his beautiful eyes.\n\n\"My car is\u2014\"\n\n\"I'd like to drive myself, if that's okay?\" I interrupted, but then I was suddenly unsure, afraid of ruining the moment.\n\n\"If it makes you feel safer. If you're not ready for this, you\u2014\"\n\n\"No. No... I am.\"\n\nHe leaned in again. \"I want you,\" he whispered as his lips closed over mine.\n\nHis second kiss was even better than the first. Like the first kiss, it was slow and soft, but this time it spoke more clearly of his desire as he pulled me against his chest. I thrilled with his touch as I flooded with wetness, flooded in a way I hadn't in many years. I wanted him. I wanted him as I'd never wanted a man before.\n\nI slowly pushed him back, my head tipping forward as our lips parted. I looked at my shoes, my heart pounding so hard I was certain he'd felt it slamming against my ribs before he released me. I felt unsteady and euphoric and terrified in equal measure. I wanted to take him right there in the parking lot and to fall into my car and drive away as fast as I could. I forced my eyes up, forced myself to meet his gaze. He touched my face, his strokes gossamer light as he caressed my cheek, his eyes steady as he held my gaze, not pushing me and allowing me to decide for myself if I could trust him.\n\nI swallowed hard. \"I'll follow you.\"\n\nHe beamed as he cupped my face and slowly pulled my lips to his for another kiss, this one fleeting, yet somehow still warm and inviting. He was still smiling as he slowly stepped back, his fingers caressing my face as he slowly drew his hands away. I was all but shaking as I watched him walk away, heading toward a compact sedan who's taillamps flashed twice as he approached. He didn't look back to see if I was watching until he stopped beside the small car. He smiled at me as he opened the driver's door.\n\nAfter identifying his car I fell into my own and noticed the tremor in my hands. I was shaking, but I didn't know if it was the result of excitement, fear, or both. I started my car and began backing out of my parking space, the strident blare of a horn causing me to brake suddenly. A car passed behind me, a car I hadn't seen. I gripped the steering wheel firmly as I closed my eyes and blew out a cleansing breath.\n\nGet control of yourself! I carefully checked for additional cars and backed out. Ryan's Hyundai was waiting at the entrance, his right turn signal flashing. As I pulled to a stop behind him, he pulled into the road. I followed.\n\nHe led me on a twisting path through town before pulling into the parking lot of a well-maintained apartment complex. I considered driving past and forgetting the whole thing, but I followed him until he pulled into a reserved space. I stopped, glanced around, but saw no spaces except those marked as reserved. I coasted to the end of the row and turned, pulling into the first empty space I found that wasn't marked as reserved. I switched my car off, but I didn't immediately exit.\n\nIt's not too late to change our mind, my angel whispered.\n\nOh, yes it is! my devil cooed.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I opened the door and stepped out of my car. Ryan was approaching and I waited for him to arrive.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked as he gently took my arm.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Nervous?\"\n\nA smile tickled my lips. \"A little.\"\n\nAn echo of my smile danced over his lips. \"Good. So am I.\"\n\nHis words surprised me. I would have described his demeanor as relaxed and in charge. \"You? Why are you nervous?\" I asked as he led me to the building directly in front of his car.\n\nHe smiled down at me. \"I don't want to disappoint.\"\n\nI flashed hot. I blamed it on my simmering excitement, but his response caused me to I giggle like a schoolgirl, and I had to resist the temptation to look behind me to see if I was dripping on the pavement.\n\nThe complex was composed of eight units in a building, four on the first floor forming the square of the building, and four more directly above, each apartment with two exterior walls and plenty of windows. He led me to the second of the two floors and paused in front of the deep red door of apartment 72A.\n\nMy mind was buzzing, and I puzzled over the number as he unlocked the door. There was no way there were seventy apartments in the complex, then I realized it was building seven, second floor, apartment 'A.' The deadbolt snapped and my whirling thoughts refocused. He swung the door open and led me inside.\n\nHis apartment suited him. Clean, simple, and masculine without being a cave. The front of the apartment was one large room that comprised the living room, dining area, and kitchen. Immediately beyond that, in the center of the long wall, was a short hall, with four doors, two facing me, the short one over the air conditioning return vent obviously a linen closet, and one on each side. The two doors facing me and the one on the right were closed, but the door on the left was opened, and I assumed it was his bedroom.\n\nThe apartment was painted, carpeted, and tiled in neutral colors, as most apartments were, but the living room had some tasteful furnishings and art. The most notable piece was a cartoon rendering of a young Sean Connery dressed as 007, holding his fingers like a gun in a typical Bond pose. The large print was a vibrant splash of red and yellow that added color, but more interesting was the cartoony text that read, Your mind is a weapon. Keep it loaded. The other print I found interesting was a picture of a statue, perhaps David, shot from behind while a naked man with the same general shape and hair, in a matching pose, his skin and hair so pale it resembled the marble of the statue, stood to the side. The print stopped just before I could see the man's ass, but it was an interesting piece. I also noticed there was no television, nor a cabinet that could hide one, which I found curious.\n\n\"Not much, I know,\" he said as he closed the door behind me.\n\n\"Better than what I started out in,\" I replied as I took in the room.\n\n\"Can I get you anything? I'm sorry, but I don't have any wine.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, nothing.\"\n\nHe gestured to the living area. \"Make yourself comfortable,\" he said as he began removing his tie.\n\nI shrugged out of my coat and laid it across the heavy chair that was a matched set with the couch as he disappeared into the room I assumed was his bedroom. He appeared a moment later without his jacket or tie. I was still standing in the middle of the room, unsure of what to do or what was expected.\n\n\"Want to sit down?\" he offered, waving to the large, deep brown, leather sofa. I did and he settled close, placing his hand on my leg, but not too high up. \"Are you okay with this?\"\n\nHe didn't have to define what 'this' was. I nodded. \"I think,\" I whispered.\n\nHe smiled as he touched my face. \"I won't hurt you,\" he rumbled softly. \"I'm not going to try to force you, and I'll stop anytime you say.\"\n\nI nodded. \"But this is what you wanted...\"\n\nA tiny smile touched his lips. \"What I wanted. Not what I expected.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"When I met you, I thought you were both beautiful and interesting. But honestly, I never thought I'd see you again after we thrashed out the separation agreement. Then tonight, when you came into De Jure, I was surprised to see you there, and I wanted to take the opportunity to tell you... well... you know.\"\n\n\"You weren't trying to pick me up?\"\n\n\"No. This is a... gift.\"\n\n\"A gift?\"\n\nHe nodded once. \"A gift. Something that surprises and delights but wasn't necessarily expected.\"\n\nI placed my hand on his leg and leaned in slightly. It was all the invitation he needed. He gently placed his hand on the back of my head, slowly pulled my lips to his, and kissed me, really kissed me. I expected him to slide his hand up my thigh, an act I would have welcomed, but instead he removed the hand and cupped my face.\n\nHe slowly pulled back from my lips, though he kept his hand on the back of my head, and drew the fingers of his other hand along my jaw with almost imperceptible lightness. \"Regardless of what you might believe, you are beautiful,\" he whispered. \"You have the most amazing eyes.\"\n\nI couldn't remember the last time a man said I was beautiful, and I was melting as his words touched me. I couldn't prevent the smile from teasing my lips. \"If you're not careful, you're going to give me an inflated opinion of myself.\"\n\nHis lips mirrored my own. \"No. I want you to believe in yourself.\"\n\nI placed my hand behind his head. \"You know what I believe?\" I murmured.\n\n\"What?\" he whispered, his lips so close to mine I could feel his breath.\n\n\"I believe I want you to kiss me again,\" I breathed as I pulled his lips to mine.\n\nKiss me he did, an electrifying, toe curling kiss. He inhaled deep as I opened my mouth to him, an invitation he eagerly accepted as he leaned back, falling into the seat of the couch while pulling me down with him, his hand still in my hair as his free arm wrapped around my back. I could feel his hardness between us and I ached to feel it inside of me. He left my lips and ravaged my neck as I pillaged his in return. His breath on the side of my neck was hot as flame, and the feel of his lips and tongue as he licked and kissed, coupled with the soft sounds of lips on flesh and our heavy breathing, was winding, winding, winding me tighter until I thought I would burst with need.\n\nI fought my way out of his embrace to take his lips again, needing to taste them, and then fighting the urge to moan in pleasure with their flavor. I was out of control in a way I'd never been before, my need a living thing that was consuming me from the inside. Again his lips left mine to erotically attack the other side of my neck, his hands sliding down my back before grabbing my ass and pulling my hips tightly against him.\n\nI kissed and licked his neck, tasting his skin, my hands wadded in his hair, holding myself to him as if afraid he'd suddenly disappear. He groaned softly as he pressed up with his hips to drive his hardness more firmly into me, his sound of desire the sexiest I'd ever heard. I wanted him, and I thrilled with his wanting of me.\n\nHe released my ass, grabbed my hair with one hand, and gently forced my head back before again pulling my lips to his. His kiss was torrid and I drank it in like a parched desert soaked up life giving rain. Before I had my fill, he pulled my hair again and forced my lips from his. His face was twisted with desire as he stared at me with hard eyes. My heart pounding, I held his erotic glare. He released my hair, but before I could return to the well of his lips, he shoved me back as he sat up. I started to swing a leg over his hips, wanting more, wanting so much more, but he rose before I could execute my plan.\n\nA shiver of fear passed through me. Had I come on too strong? Had I done something to cause him to change his mind? Had he decided I was too old? I looked up as he stood, afraid and uncertain as he loomed above me. His face was softening and he slowly extended his hand. Swallowing, unsure of what was happening, I placed my hand in his, and he gently pulled me to my feet.",
        "I'm not going to cry! I promised myself, but almost before I could complete the thought, he slowly drew me into his chest as he brushed hair out of my face. He kissed me, slowly, tenderly, sweetly. He was trying to let me down easy. He was going to tell me\u2014\"\n\n\"I want you,\" he whispered as our lips slowly parted.\n\nFear became relief and trepidation became elation. \"I want you,\" I whispered in return, afraid I would cry, but not for the reason I'd first thought.\n\nHe kissed me gently. \"Ready for habeas corpus?\" he murmured, the hardness of his earlier expression replaced with one of gentle teasing.\n\nI smiled as I looked down. Habeas, translated from Latin, meant 'to have' and corpus translated to 'body.' I looked up, unable to hide my smile. He was in complete control of himself, his sudden shift from a hard charging, demanding lover to something gentler sweeping away the last of my unease. He was using humor to slow us down, to give me a chance to change my mind before I charged headlong into something I'd later regret. I could trust this man, I wanted him, and if I had any regrets later, they'd be solely mine.\n\n\"Yes, counsellor,\" I murmured.\n\nHe held my gaze for a long moment, as if he were memorizing my face. He lowered his lips, and as I opened my mouth to accept his kiss, he bypassed my mouth to bring his lips close to my ear. \"I'm looking forward to touching you more than any woman in a long... long ... time,\" he whispered before slowly drawing back.\n\nI whimpered. \"Please don't make me cry,\" I gasped.\n\nHis lips brushed mine. \"No tears,\" he murmured.\n\nI sniffed and pulled myself together. \"No tears,\" I agreed.\n\nHe slid his hand down my arm and took my hand as his lips caressed mine with butterfly kisses. He took my lips with one final fleeting kiss before he began to slowly back away, drawing me to his bedroom, walking backwards as he towed me along, his gaze never leaving my eyes.\n\nAs we turned into his bedroom, I quickly took it all in. Like his living room, his bedroom was simple yet stylishly masculine. Dominating the room was a king size bed with a blueish grey padded headboard, replete with deeply recessed buttons and small wings on the sides that cosseted a jumble of pillows. I nearly shivered, my imagination running wild as I wondered if the padded fabric was to prevent his female guests from getting a headache as he pounded them into the headboard.\n\nOpposite the window was a dresser, it's large mirror reflecting the sunlight back into the room. On the third wall stood an armoire with a mirrored door in the same light wood and simple design of the dresser. It didn't escape my notice that the mirrors were placed so that we could watch ourselves fuck if we wanted to.\n\nThe bed was covered with a medium grey comforter and stark white sheets, with the throw pillows adding splashes of blues and teals to break up the mass of grey. Above the bed was a stylized print of Marilyn Monroe lying on her back with only her head and chest visible, her right arm curled seductively around her head, her left lying across her chest just under her breasts, wearing a lacy bra as she stared into the room with her bedroom eyes. It was clearly a work by the same artist as the Sean Connery print in the living room, and its lurid reds and oranges drew the eye.\n\nI slowly removed my glasses and laid them on the dresser beside a small framed print that announced, I licked it, so it's mine. I reached for the buttons of my blouse, but he took my hands and wrapped them in his to freeze them in place.\n\n\"Part of a gift is the anticipation and unwrapping,\" he rumbled as he slowly released my hands.\n\nDragging his fingers lightly over my arm and shoulder, he slowly moved behind me. I was expecting his fingers on my blouse, not his lips on my neck, and I gasped softly with their touch. Ryan was twisting me up as no man before him had, his slow seduction so different than the uninspired sex of my married life. I curled an arm around to rest my hand lightly on his head as his fingers began to leisurely unbutton my blouse. As the fabric parted, his lips roamed from my neck down my shoulder, chasing the edge of the fabric as more flesh was revealed. As the last button opened, he breathed deep, as if drinking in my scent, and slowly turned us so we were facing the armoire. With another slow, deep inhalation, he slowly brought his hands up my belly to grip my breasts in his strong hands.\n\nI gasped again, louder this time, as he nuzzled my neck more aggressively, his gentle manhandling turning me on even more. He was watching me, watching us, in the mirrored door, something I found incredibly erotic. I could see us well enough without my glasses, and my imagination filled in the details. I tipped my head back, giving him better access to my throat, my mouth opening slightly as my lips searched for his. He took them, gently kneading my breasts as he kissed me deeply, teasing their hard points through the fabric of my bra as he drew me against him.\n\nHe'd given me a chance to avoid regrets, but I had one now. I desperately regretted I was wearing my plain bra and panties instead of one of the racier ensembles I'd bought when I moved out. I tried to turn, wanting to press myself against him, but he tightened his embrace to hold me in place.\n\nHe began to kiss me more passionately, his hands sliding down my stomach and inside the waist band of my pants to pull my ass tightly against him. I moaned softly as our tongues dueled and his hard manhood pressed into the small of my back. He released my lips and attacked my neck, biting me gently before kissing away the sting. As I groaned with desire, unable to remain still, he quickly released the clasp of my pants and roughly shoved them down.\n\nI stepped out of my low-heeled pumps and kicked free of my pants as I turned in his arms. He squatted and lifted me as if I were a bag of feathers, drawing me tightly against his chest. With one hand wadded in my hair, he pulled my lips to his, kissing me fully, deeply, our tongues dancing as he gripped my ass with his other hand and held me tight. I wrapped him in my arms and legs and began humping him slowly, my passions carrying me away as they had on the couch.\n\nGently tugging on my hair, he pulled my lips from his and forced my head back, opening my throat to his marauding lips. I tightened my grip around his hips with my legs and leaned back, anchoring myself to his neck to give him full access to my throat. He turned to the bed, and with nimble and practiced fingers, he released the clasps of my bra before he dropped me to the bed. He tumbled with me, pinning me to the soft bed as his lips roamed. Then he stopped.\n\nI groaned with my need, pumping my hips against him as he slowly brought his lips to mine. The flames of my desire were roaring, but as I strained to taste his lips, he kept them just out of reach as he caressed my face, his tiny smile telling me he knew exactly what he was doing. He'd set me alight with passion, and now he was allowing me to burn in the flame to leave me gasping. It was exactly what he'd done beside my car, and then again only minutes ago on the couch, and with each cycle, the flames of my desire licked hotter... the asshole.\n\nAs I began to relax, all but growling in frustration, he lowered his lips to mine, his kiss slow, deep, and supremely erotic. I reached for the buttons on of his shirt, desperate to feel his flesh against mine, but he quickly captured my hands and pinned them to the bed. He wasn't hurting me, but he was controlling me, dominating me in the most erotic way possible. His hands released mine to slide leisurely down my arms, his soft touch leaving behind crackling pleasure. I moaned quietly as his touch made me squirm. Never had a man heaped so much attention on me without asking for anything in return.\n\nHe allowed me to place my hands on his head as his lips and tongue caressed my body, slowly moving ever lower, kissing and licking his way down between the valley of my breasts, his fingers never still as he caressed my flesh with slow, feathery, strokes. He teased the fabric of my bra aside with his lips to find the center, his warm wet mouth enveloping the hard point as his fingers gently worked my brassiere off me.\n\nI was alive with pleasure, my skin as hot as if I were lying naked under a desert sun. He teased my nipples to aching hardness, his lips and fingers skillful. I pushed on his head, wanting him to move lower, but he wouldn't be rushed, taking his fill from first one breast then the other. Finally, after a year, a century, an eternity of pleasure, he moved on, kissing his way down my body, his lips and fingers covering every millimeter of flesh with cracking pleasure.\n\nI began to pant softly in anticipation as Ryan slowly worked his way lower, sliding off the side of the bed to rest on the floor, his upper body draped over me as he kissed and licked with madding deliberateness. Bob had never spent this much time stoking my passions, nor had he been particularly interested in pleasing me with is mouth. With agonizing slowness, Ryan began sliding my panties lower, and again I wished desperately that I wasn't wearing full briefs but a pair of my bikini panties so there wouldn't be so much fucking material to pull down!\n\nBy the time my womanhood was exposed I was ready to scream with pent up desire and anticipation. As he gradually drew my panties down, I tried to help by kicking out of my underwear, but he stopped his erotic licking and kissing, silently signaling he wouldn't be rushed. With a groan I forced myself into stillness, and after a moment, he returned to his task.\n\nI moaned, twisting my hands in his hair as he blew softly on my womanhood, his warm breath wafting over my flower incredibly erotic. I groaned again as he bypassed my center, his only touch the soft stream of air, to continue kissing down my leg, his lips slowly chasing my panties.\n\n\"Please, please,\" I begged softly, releasing his hair to wad the bed linens in my fists. \"Please lick me and make me yours.\"\n\nHe huffed once as he kissed all the way to my ankles, chasing the fabric with his lips as he removed my panties, every touch of his lips to the inside of my thighs a flair of pleasure. Panties removed, he slowly drew off my sheer socks, briefly massaging each foot as he sucked on my big toe. No one had ever done that to me before and I found the act incredibly erotic. As I squirmed, his lips returned to my thigh. My breathing sped up as he slowly worked his way back to my center, his lips and fingers touching and caressing in an unhurried march.\n\n\"Please,\" I begged again, afraid he would bypass my womanhood as he had before. \"Please lick it and make it yours.\"\n\nHe didn't lick me, but his gentle touch, the soft swipe of his finger across the petals of my flower made me want to moan in anticipation. I wanted to watch, I had to watch. Drawing my legs up and planting my feet on the bed, I looked down the length of my body and met his gaze. He was watching me as he gently caressed me again. I gasped with his touch, and as he slowly, ever so slowly, extended his tongue and lowered his mouth to me, my body felt like a giant battery ready to explode in a sudden and massive discharge of energy.\n\nHis tongue touched me, the barest tickle, but it was enough. I shuddered as I moaned low and deep and pressed down with my legs to lever my ass off the bed. I didn't orgasm, but the different was inconsequential. He licked me again, harder this time, his tongue worming its way into me. My back arching, I draped my legs over his back and again levered my ass up as I released my grip on the linens and wadded my hands in his air. As I panted and writhed his tongue slithered and probed and his lips gently pinched and pulled. My orgasm was coming, coming hard, and it was going to be devastating.\n\nFuck! Shit! Fuck! the devil on my shoulder screamed. The motherfucker is sucking on our clit! Fuck! Unable to remain still as I was destroyed with pleasure, my hips began rocking of their own accord. Face fuck him! Face fuck that sexy motherfucker until we fucking come! Fuck!\n\n\"Fuck...\" I moaned softly, the word drawn out long and stuttered, my mind screaming in pleasure as I shuddered and jerked through the hardest orgasm of my life.\n\nI curled, my shoulders rising from the bed as every muscle warred with the other, my eyes crushed tightly closed as I battled my pleasure, and still he licked me, sucking gently on my button or flicking it with his tongue. I fell back to the bed, my back now arching in the opposite direction as he slid a finger into me and slowly curled it in a come here motion while the fingers of his other hand caressing a nipple.\n\nFuck! my mind screamed again. I'm still coming! The fucker is still making me come!\n\nThen it was over. I lay panting and out of sorts, jerking and grunting as aftershocks of pleasure pinballed though me. I was devastated, feeling like little more than a formless, boneless, blob of goo. The bed moved, or maybe it was the world moving around me, I didn't know, and I didn't have the strength to open my eyes to see. Something brushed my lips. Through the fog of orgasm spent, I realized it was his lips, and I lunged for them, needing to taste them no less than I needed to breathe.\n\nI pulled him onto me, and he kissed me slowly, deeply, revitalizing me with the touch of his lips. He allowed me to take my fill from his lips before he slowly pulled back and touched my face. I gradually opened my eyes to see him watching me, a small, self-satisfied smile dancing on his lips. He was pleased with himself for what he'd done to me, the arrogant shit, but he had the right to be, and I couldn't stop my return smile.\n\n\"Does this mean you belong to me now?\" he murmured as his lips quirked into a teasing grin.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"'Lick me and make me yours?'\"\n\n\"Did I say that?\"\n\nHe nodded as he brought his lips back to mine for another gentle kiss. He was still fully dressed. He'd absolutely wrecked me and had asked for nothing in return. \"Twice.\"\n\nThe words tickled the edge of my memory. I was recovering rapidly now, and I wanted more, so much more. Unable to stop it, my smile spread. \"For tonight,\" I purred as I began working at the buttons on his shirt.\n\nHe held my gaze as I released each button of his shirt in turn and pushed the cloth off his shoulders. A surge of desire roared through me as his chest was revealed. He was near perfect, lean and muscular, his stomach flat, his arms and chest well developed. The only flaw of his otherwise perfect body was a lengthy, puckered scar, long healed, that slithered along the ribs of his left side.\n\nHis kiss turned my attention from the scar. I reached inside his pants as our tongues danced, and the kiss became electrifying in its intensity. His underwear was sodden from his need, and he issued a soft, sexy grunt as he pressed himself into my hand as I gripped his hardness. He pulled back from the kiss as he slid off the bed, standing at the side as he began unbuckling his belt. His gaze ever left mine as I kicked myself to the center of the bed and turned, leaving behind a large wet spot where I'd been. As he slowly lowered his pants his desire was clear, his cock impressively hard, standing at rigid attention, and weeping for me. He was about average in size, perhaps a bit above as he was a little taller than the average man, and I longed to feel him inside me. I'd only been with six men, now seven, but I could say without doubt or fear of contradiction that he was the sexiest, most desirable man I'd ever been with.\n\nHe glanced away from my gaze only long enough to remove a condom from the side drawer. It pleased me that he was being careful without complaint, but I yearned to feel a man's wetness inside me. As he ripped open the thin plastic pouch I rolled to the edge of the bed and plucked the tiny roll of thin latex from his fingers. His sharp intake of breath as I used my breasts to wipe his glistening lubricant from his cock made me feel wicked in all the best ways. Satisfied that I'd cleaned his cock as much as possible, to prevent the condom from slipping off mid fuck and ruining what I hoped was going to be a long and hard ride, I rolled the film over his manhood.\n\nFinished with my task I pulled him into the bed with me. He settled between my legs and after a moment of searching, sank to my depths, issuing a low and sexy groan with his plunge. He wrapped me up, his muscular arms tight at my sides as he held my head, his lips finding mine for a torrid kiss as his hips began to rise and fall in a slow, steady, drumbeat of pleasure.\n\nWith a squeak of pleasure, I flung my arms around his neck and held on as he stretched me as I wanted to be stretched, touched me as I wanted to be touched. I couldn't breathe, and I warred with myself if I wanted his kiss or my breath. With a gasp I forced my lips from his, his mouth instantly finding my neck.\n\n\"Fuck...\" he snarled softly, the stress in his voice exciting me even more. \"You're so fucking tight!\"\n\nHis words thrilled me as he began driving into me harder, faster, and then harder and faster still, his kissing and licking of my neck increasing in tempo with his hips. My second orgasm was coming, bearing down on me with frightening power and speed. I forced his lips back to mine and gripped him as I'd cling to a life preserver in a stormy sea, clutching him as if my life depended on never letting him go.\n\nHe reared up on strong arms, his face twisting with pleasure, with erotic pain, and still he fucked me. His display was the sexist sight I'd ever seen, and my climax began to close around me.\n\nFuck that fucking pussy! Ram that big hard cock into us and fuck us! Fuck us! Fuck us! Fuck that pussy with your big cock! my devil screamed. And then he stopped.\n\nI began thrusting frantically. He couldn't leave me hanging like this, not with me so close! \"Don't stop!\" I mewled.\n\n\"I'll come!\" he growled, his face twisting in effort and pleasure.\n\n\"I don't care! Don't stop!\" I begged, thrusting frantically, inching my rapture nearer.\n\nHe fell over me, pressing me into the mattress with his weight as he began pounding into me hard and fast as his hands wadded in my hair.\n\nWe're coming! my devil screamed. That motherfucker is making us come all over that big fucking cock! You fuck that pussy! You fuck that pussy and make it come hard!\n\nI moaned softly as my rapture poured through me. With a hard grunt, he rammed himself deep and held himself there. I could feel the tension in his body as he grunted a second time, a third, and finally a fourth. My orgasm was washing out of me as he gasped, the tension leaving his body as he settled more heavily over me. He was still supporting some of his heft on elbows and arms and I pulled him down, desperately wanting to feel more of his weight against me. He settled slightly, as his lips found mine. His kiss was long, slow, and incredibly fulfilling, and was perhaps the best kiss of my life.\n\nAfter we'd taken our fill he slowly pulled back from my lips. He watched my eyes, his own eyes so soft, almost loving in their tenderness as he brushed my hair back from my face. \"That was... incredible,\" he murmured before his lips took mine again.\n\nI had no words, and I could feel tears threatening, though I didn't know why. I held him close and tight, his cock still inside me, luxating in warmth and closeness I felt for him. He drank deep from the well of my kiss before slowly pulling back.\n\n\"You were incredible,\" I sighed, sleep already tugging at me.\n\nAs if laboring under a great burden, he pulled out of me, his sharp hiss and the erotic twist of his face as his cock slid out of me pleasing me enormously. I was going to have to go soon, but I desperately needed a snuggle first, and I twisted, making ready to roll into his arms, but Ryan had other ideas.",
        "He began kissing his way down my body again, a repeat of his performance earlier, the soft sucks and smacks of his lips dancing over my skin adding to the eroticism.\n\n\"Ryan... no,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Do you want me to stop?\" he murmured in return, but his lips never stopped their slow march down my body.\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\n\"I want to. Once isn't enough with you.\" I flushed hot with his words. \"Do you want me to stop?\" he rumbled as his lips neared my womanhood. \"I'll stop if you want me to, but you're going to have to ask me to.\"\n\n\"No,\" I breathed. \"Don't stop.\"\n\nFor the next eternity I writhed and moaned in pleasure as he licked and kissed my flower while his hands slowly roamed my body. Gone was the fury of our first encounter, replaced by something slower, something gentler. He'd begun to soften after his orgasm, but as I lay panting after shuddering my way through my third orgasm, he was once again the man of steel. At some point, unnoticed by me, he'd covered himself with a fresh condom, though I didn't know when he'd changed or what he'd done with the old one.\n\n\"I want you,\" I whispered as I opened myself for him. \"Take me.\"\n\nHis smile was soft as he slowly settled between my legs. As he sank into me I sighed with pleasure, the sensation of his passage exquisite. It had been at least twenty years since I'd made love twice in one night, much less twice in less than two hours. He took me slowly, his lips feathering over mine as I luxuriated in our joining. I wouldn't, couldn't, come again. Three climaxes were my limit, and that extremely rare, but I wanted to feel him inside and see his face twist in erotic agony as he came again.\n\nHe took me for a long moment before pulling out, rolling me to my side, and then snuggling into my back. I gasped with pleasure as he entered me again, his cock slowly pistoning into me as his left hand cupping my breast, his fingers gently teasing the nipple as he delicately caressed my button with his right. I moaned softly, the new position intensely erotic after the vanilla sex I'd become so used to. I twisted, searching for his lips as his cock slowly plunged into me and his fingers danced in my wetness. I keened as his hand left my womanhood to hold my chin, holding me in the kiss as his cock slowly plumbed my depths, enthralling me with the experience. He released my chin, his hand returning to my flower, twisting us into a human pretzel as a new surge of pleasure roared through me with his touch. I pulled his hand from my breast and intertwined my fingers with his as he nuzzled and kissed my neck, but I wanted more, so much more.\n\nI pushed away from him, his hard cock popping out of me igniting a flair of pleasure. He was sweating, the glow of his flesh exciting me. I threw myself over him, held his shaft erect, and settled, curling in on myself with pleasure as he entered me. His face hard, yet gentle, he pulled me down to his chest and kissed me as I began thrusting.\n\nI pushed up on my hands, but at almost twice Ryan's age I didn't have the stamina he did, and I quickly began to sweat as my breath became deep and ragged. With a sneer of lust Ryan grabbed the sides of my head to hold me firmly as he pulled me down to brace against his equally sweaty arms. I rocked up slightly on my knees when, with the sexist growl I'd ever heard, he began pounding into me.\n\nYeah! Fuck that cock! Fuck that big hard cock! Don't even think about stopping! my devil snarled.\n\n\"Fuck... fuck... fuck...\" I mewled as I gripped his arms in a ferocious grip. He'd primed me as he fucked me from behind and teased my clit, and now I was going to come... I needed to come... but I was getting tired and out of breath.\n\nWe have to finish him! my angel urged. He's given us everything and asked for nothing!\n\n\"I'm going to come,\" I gasped, the words followed by a soft wail as he began fucking me harder. \"I'm going to come again! Make me come!\" I barked out another soft cry of erotic pain and soaring pleasure as he held my gaze, his eyes hard and lust filled. I'd never been fucked so hard as I was being fucked then, his pounding strokes inching me toward bliss with every hard and fast reciprocation, but I needed more. I needed to feel him against me. \"Oh, God! Please make me come!\" I begged.\n\nBreathing like a bellows, his pounding strokes began to slow. He was sweating profusely now with his face twisted in pleasure and pain. He threw me off him, rolling me to the bed as he followed. I landed on my back with my head hanging off the bed, but before I could adjust my position, he rammed his cock into me again.\n\nHolding my head up, I reached for him as I turned to look at us in the mirrored door of the armoire. Without my glasses we were fuzzy, but I could see our glowing skin, our sweat damped hair, and in my mind's eyes, our expressions of lust as we fucked. I twisted my head and saw his reflection in the mirrored back of the dresser. I groaned as I pulled him down on me. I couldn't explain why, but seeing nothing but my hand clasping the back of his head before he sank from view was the sexiest thing I'd ever seen. He collapsed over me, pounding into me hard and fast as he supported my head in his big strong hands.\n\n\"I'm going to come,\" I gasped, replaying over and over the vision from the dresser mirror of me pulling him down to fuck me.\n\nRelieved of my weight, he pounded his cock into me in a fury of motion as he panted into my neck.\n\n\"I'm going to come!\" he grunted. \"I can't\u2014\"\n\nI wasn't a screamer, at least not until then. In fairness, most wouldn't call my soft wail of pleasure a scream, but for me, I was screaming, my fingers biting hard into Ryan's back as I was ravaged by pleasures I couldn't contain. I'd rarely climaxed three times, and I'd never orgasmed four, but like my soft cry of pleasure, this was a night of first.\n\n\"I'm going to... I can't...\" he groaned, his words barely registering through my own maelstrom of pleasure.\n\nHe began to shudder before he lunged into me hard and deep, his face twisting in anguish, his mouth opened in a silent scream. He reared onto stiff arms, lifting me with him as I clung to him with my breasts flattened against his chest. I was battered by overwhelming pleasure, unable to breath, unable to think, waiting, waiting, waiting for the most intense orgasm of my life to release me from the teeth of pleasure. My eyes crushed closed, his hips lunged and bucked before slamming deep into me again, his body alive with motion before he reared higher still, his cock still inside me, lifting me from the bed as he rose to his knees like a sexual stallion displaying his prowess. As he tumbled away, his arms closed around me, holding me tight as one of his hands protected my head. We collapsed into a sweaty, gasping heap, our chests rising and falling hard and fast as we struggled to reclaim our breath.\n\nHe blew air from pursed lips and puffed cheeks. \"Fuck...\" he gasped, the word long and drawn out.\n\nTears were coming and I couldn't stop them. I began to weep softly into his chest.\n\n\"Michelle? Are you okay? What's wrong? Did I hurt you?\"\n\nI heard the concern in his voice, and that only confused me more. \"No,\" I sniffed, wiping at my eyes. \"You didn't hurt me.\"\n\n\"Then what's wrong?\"\n\nI rocked my head. \"I don't know. Nothing. I just...\"\n\nHe seemed to understand. He tightened his embrace, holding me tight as he kissed my head, giving me the time I needed to get gather myself. \"It's okay,\" he whispered as his hands slowly caressed my back. \"Are you sure I didn't\u2014\"\n\n\"No,\" I sniffed again, wiping my eyes. \"No. It was nothing you did. It's just... I...\"\n\nI couldn't finish my thoughts as I was again overwhelmed by... what? I didn't know. I couldn't put the feeling into words, even for myself. I only knew that something had shifted inside of me, but I didn't know what. It was like I was finally letting go of the pain I'd been carrying for the last eighteen months and I was feeling alive in a way I hadn't in such a long time.\n\nI sniffed again, my tears drying. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. I swallowed hard and sighed. Whatever the surge of emotion was that had rattled me so was passing. I snuggled in. I was exhausted, wrung out emotionally, not to mention tired and supremely well fucked. My tears were replaced by a small smile, brought forth by his kiss on my head.\n\nWe said nothing, silence filling the room as our sounds of passion had only moments before. I sighed again, more comfortable and relaxed than any time I could remember. My eyes drifted closed, a tiny smile painting my lips as I listened to the heavy rhythmic thumping of his slowing heart. I wanted to snuggle a few more minutes and then I'd make my goodbyes.\n\nThat was the last thought I remembered before the dark veil of sleep claimed me.\n\n<center>***</center>\n\nLips slowly feathering across the back of my neck and down my spine dragged me from sleep. I was sprawled on my stomach in the middle of a destroyed bed. I rolled over with a groan and forced my eyes open. The light beyond the window was ruddy with approaching night. With another groan and a stretch I glanced at the bedside clock. This wasn't my bed, my bedroom, or my clock, and for a moment I couldn't remember where I was. I blinked at the glowing numbers. 7:18. My location came back to me with a flood of memories, and I smiled and stretched again. I didn't know what time Ryan and I had finished, but it was still bright outside. I'd probably slept thirty minutes to an hour.\n\nAs the fog of sleep continued to clear, the delicious smells of food captured my attention. I was ravenous. Ryan was there, looking bed tossed but still fuckable as hell, wearing tan shorts and a butter yellow shirt.\n\nHe sat on the edge of the bed. \"Hungry?\" he asked as he gestured to the collection of white containers with red oriental characters on the sides crowding the bedside table. \"I hope you like Chinese.\"\n\n\"Love it,\" I yawned, \"but we can't eat all that.\"\n\n\"I know. I didn't know what you liked so I got a variety of stuff. Sweet and sour chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Lo Mein, in case you don't eat meat, beef and broccoli, and vegetarian egg rolls,\" he said, tapping each carton as he listed their contents. \"All over fried rice.\"\n\nI was most interested in the two white Styrofoam cups. I picked one up and sucked greedily at the straw, the water wonderfully cold and refreshing. \"Sounds good,\" I gasped as my thirst slaked.\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"All of it. I'm starving!\"\n\nHe smiled as he picked up one of the cartons. \"Ah... allow me,\" he said as he took my arm and prevented me from rolling out of bed.\n\n\"I'm going to get dressed.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you not,\" he murmured as he released my arm.\n\nI debated a moment, wondering what he was planning, but then scooted up in the bed and propped against the padded headboard. I reached for one of the cartons as he stirred the contents of the one in his hands with chopsticks. I was looking for a fork when something approached my face. He opened his mouth slightly, as if he were feeding a baby, the chopsticks pausing close to my lips with a chunk of broccoli in their grasp. I opened my mouth and he inserted the vegetable, closing his lips as I did mine.\n\nHe sat the container aside and opened another, stirred, and then offered me a piece of chicken coated in red sauce. I took that. As I chewed another piece went into his mouth. He opened a third and extracted noodles for me to enjoy. I did like Chinese food, and while this was typical takeout fare, it was surprisingly delicious. I didn't know if it was the food, my hunger, or the fact that he was feeding me, that made the dishes especially sumptuous.\n\nI took another drink as he opened the last container and ate a piece of the General's chicken. \"You know,\" I said as I removed the straw from my mouth, \"if I'm going to have to eat naked, it only seems fair that you do too.\"\n\nHe opened his mouth as more of the General's chicken approached my mouth. \"If I get naked, there might be more than eating going on,\" he teased as he extracted the chopstick from between my lips.\n\nA wave of heat washed over me. Three times in one night? Can guys actually do that? Make him prove it! my devil challenged. \"I... wouldn't mind,\" I murmured.\n\nHe held my eyes a moment as he broke into a smile. He fished an egg roll out of the container with the chopsticks and held it out for me. I snapped at it, gripping it between my bared teeth for a moment with an evil smile as he watched my mouth, before I severed the end of the roll with a quick bite. He continued to watch my lips as I slowly chewed, both of us breaking into a smile as I sensually licked my lips.\n\n\"Yes... well...\" he murmured as he placed the remainder of the roll aside. He took a sip of water from his own drink and then stood, removing first his shirt, then his shorts. He wasn't wearing underwear, something that I didn't know would turn me on, until it did. He wasn't fully hard, but he was well on his way to a strong erection when he returned to sit on the edge of the bed. He continued to feed me, but as one hunger was satiated another grew, the hardness of Ryan's manhood speaking of his own hunger, and a powerful distraction.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked as I nodded at him.\n\n\"This?\" he asked as he waved the chopsticks at his side. I nodded. \"Stupidity.\"\n\n\"Stupidity?\" I asked as he offered me more food.\n\nHe smiled. \"Yeah. A buddy of mine got a PS2 for Christmas of two thousand. He called me and asked me to come over. I was so excited I went tearing down the drive on my bike and...\"\n\nA sick dread settled over me. \"And?\" I asked when he didn't continue, taking a bite of food for himself.\n\n\"And I learned the hard way that two objects can't occupy the same space at the same time. I never looked and rode right out in front of a car.\" He held my gaze. He didn't smile but his eyes were merry. \"Not one of these wimpy cars of today with their plastic bumpers either. No... \" he drawled, drawing the word out. \"I had to ride in front of a 1968 Ford pickup. Those things don't have any give. Broke some ribs, punctured and collapsed a lung, broke my arm and collarbone, and fractured my skull.\" He held my gaze. He still didn't smile, but the teasing remained in his eyes. \"Dad said it was the only time in his life he was glad I had such a thick skull. Anyway, in case you were wondering, it hurt. A lot.\"\n\n\"I bet. You're okay now?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah. I don't remember any of the accident. I remember riding down the drive, all excited to see Trevor's game, and then the next thing I remember is a guy on the ground beside me as somebody else was yelling for someone to call an ambulance. I spent some time in the hospital as they pinned me back together. Kids are tough. The guy that ran over me felt so bad he visited me in the hospital several times and bought me a new bike when I got out. Mom wouldn't let me go out for high school football or anything like that, probably afraid that my bones weren't as strong as before or something. But yeah, no permanent damage. The only lasting effect is the scar and the reminder that if you play stupid games, like playing chicken with a car, you win stupid prizes. I tended to be... less impetuous after that.\"\n\n\"Was the guy speeding or something?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Don't know. He said he wasn't. The speed limit where my parents live is thirty-five. He probably wasn't speeding any more than most people who drove up and down the street.\"\n\n\"Is that why you decided to become a lawyer?\"\n\n\"Nah. It was dad's idea. He said as much as I liked to argue, I should become a lawyer.\"\n\nI snickered. \"Really?\"\n\nHe shrugged while offering me more noodles. \"Not entirely, but kind of. Mostly it was because I...\"\n\n\"You what?\" I asked when he didn't continue.\n\n\"It'll sound corny, but I like helping people.\" A flicker of a smile danced over his lips as he offered me a piece of sweet and sour chicken. \"And he was right, I do like to argue.\" As I opened my mouth, a dollop of the red sauce fell from the chicken on to my right breast. \"Oops,\" he breathed as the chicken disappeared into my mouth. \"Let me get that.\"\n\nI thought he would use one of the napkins, but he wiped the drip away with his finger before popping it into his mouth to clean it.\n\nMy eyes widened slightly. Holy fuck, that's hot! My devil brayed. Do you supposed he'd fuck us while we're covered in that shit?\n\nThat's gross! my angel countered.\n\nA smile tugged at my lips. I found it amusing that in my imagination both my devil and angel appeared as disheveled and well fucked as I did. He started to place the container aside but I took his hand.\n\n\"Want some more?\"\n\nI nodded, unsure of my voice. The thin wooden spears disappeared into the carton and reappeared with a bit of chicken gripped between them. He scraped it on the side of the container to remove excess sauce, much to my disappointment, and then extended it to me. Butterflies swarmed in my stomach as I took his hand and steered the morsel to my breasts. I'd never done anything even remotely like this before and I worried how my action would be perceived. I drew the red, sticky, mess down between my breasts and then across to one nipple before I steered the bit of chicken to my lips. I plucked the piece from between the chopsticks with my lips and chewed slowly, my gaze never leaving his. He held my gaze for a long moment before he placed the container aside.\n\n\"Now look at the mess I've made,\" he rumbled as he leaned over me. \"I'd better clean that up.\"\n\nHe brought his lips slowly to my breast to leisurely lick and suck away the sauce. He took his time, making sure he didn't miss any spots as he worked his way down between my breasts and then over to the nipple. The hard point of my breast must have been especially dirty as he spent a long time cleaning the point. I reached for the carton with a soft moan, straining to grasp it as Ryan cleaned my breast. Hooking the bale with a finger, I pulled the carton to me, reached inside with two fingers, and dipped them into the sauce. I smeared the thick red liquid over my other breast, dipped my fingers again, and then coated the hallow of my throat and my lips.\n\nHe didn't seem displeased as he took the carton from my hand, placed in on the side table, and then set to work cleaning me, holding my hand while sucking my fingers clean, before turning his attention to my lips. I moaned softly as he pressed into me, smearing the coating on my breast between us before moving down and cleaning my throat. As he slowly moved his lips to my throat, I wrapped my hands in his hair as I squirmed lower in the bed.\n\nFinished with my throat, he moved lower still, lapping away the sticky mess covering my breast, the smear of red sauce on his chest exciting me for reasons I couldn't explain. He spent a long moment cleaning my breast, returning to the breast I'd first made dirty to ensure he hadn't missed any spots, and then kissing and licking his way back to my lips. I attacked his lips, forcing my tongue into his mouth to taste the sauce on his tongue, the sauce he'd licked off me.\n\n\"Take me!\" I breathed as I forced his mouth to my neck.\n\nI was sure he was transferring the sticky red liquid from his chest back to mine, but that did nothing except make me want him even more. He pulled back from devouring my neck, opened the side table drawer, and removed a condom. With expert fingers, he opened the package and spread the thin latex covering over his rock-hard member.\n\nI opened myself to him as he settled between my legs. As he cleaned up my breast a second time, I reached between us and caressed his stiff manhood. Satisfied with his work, he probed for my opening, and after finding it, sank to my depths with a soft and sexy groan, my own gasping moan of pleasure mingling with his. He braced up on stiff arms as I cleaned his chest, licking and sucking away the sauce while he pounded into me hard and fast.",
        "He fell over me, driving me deeper into the corner of the headboard as he devoured my lips and ravaged my neck. With a grunt, he pulled out and jerked me lower in the bed while moving away from the edge and turning me so I more crosswise. He placed his legs outside of mine before he steered himself into me again, his eyes hard and lust filled as he held my gaze. He squeezed with his legs, pinching his cock inside my pussy as he began fucking me, his clasping legs making him feel fucking huge! I moaned as I jerked one of the pillows out from behind my back. He was driving me tighter against the padded headboard, wedging me into the corner so that I was unable to escape the fucking I was receiving. I wailed softly as a surge of pleasure washed over me. It was just like in my imagination when I first saw his bed and wondered about the headboard.\n\nHe's so fucking big and strong! Fuck him! Fuck his big fucking cock! Shit! He's fucking the shit out of us! He's going to make us come! Fuck that big cock until we come! I moaned as my devil's words swirled in my head, my angel strangely silent.\n\nMy orgasm was coming, bearing down on me like an approaching storm. Being wadded into the corner was slightly uncomfortable, but somehow that made our fucking even more intense. I pushed at him, trying to free myself from the corner, yet wanting him to overpower me and fuck me still.\n\nHe stopped, moving away with my push. 'I won't hurt you. I'll stop any time you say,' his voice rang in my memory.\n\n\"Don't stop!\" I gasped. \"I'm going to come! Make me come!\"\n\nHe hesitated, confused by my mixed signals, but after the briefest of pauses, he collapsed over me again and began fucking me even harder, his cock slamming into me with deep and powerful strokes as he continued to squeeze me tight around his plunging cock. I pushed at him, thrashing with pleasure, but he seemed to sense what I needed, and he gripped my wrists and pinned them against the headboard over my head.\n\n\"Come!\" he ordered as he fucked me, his voice hard and demanding. \"I want you to fucking come!\"\n\nFuck! my devil screamed as I strained against his grip. The motherfucker is holding us down and fucking us with his big fucking cock! He's not fucking stopping and is taking us! I struggled to pull my hands free, and with the strain, my orgasm swelled within me. He's too big and strong! We can't stop him from fucking us! He's going to fuck us until we come all over his big fucking cock! Fuck! Keep fucking him! We have to keep fucking him until he comes!\n\nI moaned as my orgasm washed over me to drown me in pleasure. I again struggled against his restraining hand, but this time he released me and I surrounded him with my arms, my moan of pleasure becoming louder as I pulled him tightly into me, my fingers biting deeply into his back, and still he fucked me.\n\n\"Stop!\" I begged. \"Stop, stop! Fuck! Please stop!\"\n\nHe did, holding me as I panted and blew, trying to recover from yet another brain melting orgasm. I tried to remember, was that my fifth or sixth climax of the night? I couldn't recall, to strung out to think clearly.\n\nHis lips feathered over my cheek. \"You okay?\" he whispered.\n\nI couldn't speak but nodded slowly as I blew out a cleansing breath through puffed cheeks. \"Did you come?\" I asked as my strength began to return.\n\n\"No.\" I groaned. He was insatiable, and I was running out of gas. \"It's okay,\" he murmured as he brushed my lips with his.\n\nYou have to finish him, my angel whispered. You can't leave him hanging. That's not fair to him.\n\nI shoved at him. He pulled out of me and fell away, rolling to his back and pulling me into a snuggle. I refused to go to his side, choosing instead to swing a leg over his hips. I was starting to get sore, but I thought I had enough left in me to finish him.\n\n\"You will,\" I growled, putting as much sex into my voice as possible as I lowered myself over his shaft. I began rocking my hips, watching his face. \"I want you to come,\" I whispered. \"I want to watch you come.\"\n\nHe reached up, grasped me by my head, and slowly pulled my lips to his. We kissed, our tongues darting and probing as my hips rose and fell in furious motion. I sat up again, wanting to feel him deep. I was done, unable to come again, and that allowed me to concentrate on pleasing him as he'd pleased me time and again.\n\nAfter I'd ridden him for a long moment I began to sweat and my breathing was becoming labored. He could seemingly fuck me forever, but after only a few minutes of me fucking him I began to falter. I need something, something to push him.\n\n\"You like the feel of your cock inside my pussy?\" I murmured as I tried to twist him up with words. It was another first as I listened to and repeated my devil's patter as it echoed inside my head. I'd never talked to Bob like that, had never wanted to, though now I found the words salacious.\n\nHe bared his teeth, his lips twisting in a snarl of lust as he continued to play with my breasts. \"I love the feel of my cock inside your pussy.\"\n\n\"I want you to come,\" I cooed, the pillow talk adding flavor and texture to our fucking, like adding jam to dry toast. \"I want to feel your cock throbbing inside me as you come.\"\n\nHe released my breasts to grip my hips, guiding me, adding his strength to mine, helping me to fuck him. \"You're fucking amazing,\" he growled.\n\n\"Come, Ryan,\" I demanded. \"I want you to fucking come.\"\n\nHe helped me pound his cock into me for another long moment. \"I'm going to come,\" he rumbled.\n\nMake him work for it... my devil whispered. \"Don't you come,\" I ordered. \"Don't you come until I tell you to.\" His face hardened, and I felt wicked, strong, and in charge as he tried to do my bidding.\n\n\"I'm going to come!\" he snarled, his voice strained.\n\nDon't let him come... \"You fucking hold it!\" I demanded, his display of erotic agony as I fucked him exciting me.\n\n\"I can't hold it!\"\n\nTell him he has to fucking hold it! \"Don't you fucking come!\"\n\nHe tried to stop me from fucking him, but I powered through. I might be nearly twice his age, but my legs were still stronger than his arms.\n\n\"Fuck! I'm going to come!\" he snarled, his face twisting with effort, pain, and pleasure.\n\nI brought my lips close to his. \"Come,\" I whispered.\n\nThrough luck I'd timed it perfectly, and as the word left my lips, he pressed down on my hips while pressing up with his to ram his cock as deep as possible. I stopped my thrusts, watching his handsome face as it twisted into the most profoundly erotic display of pleasure imaginable. His head tipped back into the mattress, his mouth open slightly, his eyes crushed closed, as he was devastated by pleasure. I'd done this to him. I'd given him this pleasure. Me. I'd fucked him until he couldn't hold his orgasm another second, so turned on he couldn't prevent himself from coming. As he slowly relaxed underneath me, I kissed him, slowly, softly, enjoying how his hand wrapped in my hair to hold my lips to him. Bob didn't want to fuck me, and Ryan seemingly didn't want to stop. Bob had thought of only himself and what he wanted, and Ryan seemed only to think of me.\n\nI slowly pulled back from the kiss, and again I could feel tears forming. I willed them away, but I couldn't stop the tiny smile that touched my lips as he brushed a bit of hair out of my face. I lowered my lips to his again, wanting to taste him and feel his closeness.\n\nI slowly pulled back from the kiss and laid my head on his chest to listen to the thunder of his heart. I sighed, amazingly content, enjoying the feel of Ryan inside of me. Sleep was pulling hard on me. I roused myself before I went to sleep again, but as I tried to rise, he tightened his embrace, holding me to his chest.\n\n\"I need to go,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Stay the night with me.\"\n\nTears threatened again, and I wasn't sure why, but I was supremely gratified that that he wanted me to stay. I settled back to his chest and nodded my head as I sighed. I lay still, warm and comfortable in his embrace, my eyes closed, listening to the thudding of his heart and the rustle of his breathing, smiling as his cock finally softened enough to fall from inside me. I kissed him on his chest and smiled to myself when he kissed me on the top of my head. It had been so long since I felt so wanted, so desired, and I liked it.\n\nI was still smiling, my mind pleasantly blank, as I slid into darkness of sleep.\n\n<center>***</center>\n\nI woke in the dark room. The last time I woke I was confused and disoriented, unable to remember where I was for a moment. Not this time. This time I knew exactly where I was and why I was there. I smiled with the memory. I remembered Ryan waking me with kisses, feeding me, dripping sweet and sour sauce on me, fucking me, and then dropping off to sleep still lying on his chest.\n\nI glanced at the clock. It was just after two in the morning, and sometime during the night, I'd slipped from his chest into the crook of his arm. I groaned silently. I was so supremely comfortable I didn't want to move, but I was bursting for a pee. With another silent groan, I carefully extracted myself from his arms and tiptoed out of the room, the safety lights in the parking lot pouring pale yellow illumination through the open blinds of the windows.\n\nI left the bedroom and turned into the room I assumed was the bathroom. It was. I left the door open to allow what little brightness that entered to light my way. I hissed softly as I relieved myself, shivering with relief. I'd never been fucked like Ryan had fucked me, and I was paying for it now. My womanhood was suffering the same fate as my body would have if I'd taken five years off from the gym, and then started back with a long and hard workout. I smiled to myself as I silently closed the door and then flushed the toilet. Like starting a workout routine, I should have started slow, but damn if jumping straight into the deep end hadn't been fun.\n\nWhen the toilet had finished filling, I opened the door. I peeked into the bedroom. Ryan was still in the center of the bed where he'd been. Being nosey, I carefully opened the door to what I assumed was a second bedroom. Inside the room was a large, all in one, workout machine, something in the corner that might have been free weights, and a large television positioned to be easily visible from the workout machine. The room explained his kick-ass body, and I carefully shut the door without entering.\n\nIt's time to go home, my angel whispered.\n\nFuck that!\n\nWe've had our fun. We should get our things and go.\n\nNo fucking way! We want to fuck some more!\n\nWe're already sore. We're too old to be acting like a twenty-year-old.\n\nShut the fuck up! We didn't fuck like a fifty-year-old! We fucked the shit out of him!\n\nWe're kidding ourselves if we think anything is going to come from this.\n\nWho the fuck cares? Maybe we just want to have a little fun for once!\n\nI quietly entered Ryan's bedroom and stopped just inside the door. Even in his sleep he was sporting a huge erection and I wondered if he was dreaming of fucking me.\n\nThat's right! He's dreaming of fucking us, baby! We turned his fucking crank!\n\nJust stop it! We need to start acting our\u2014\"\n\nMy angel didn't have a chance to finish her sentence before my devil attacked her with a bitch slap. Angel attacked in return, and as the two sides of me fought in a vicious catfight, I stood in the doorway, unsure of what to do.\n\nAfter a moment, I smiled as I moved deeper into the bedroom and slowly crawled into the bed, moving carefully to not wake him. I didn't hesitate, settling to the bed facing the opposite direction of Ryan, my devil with her hands around Angel's neck as she choked the shit out of her.\n\nBob was a lazy lover, more concerned with his own pleasure than mine. While I had to cajole him into pleasing me with his mouth, I'd always been willing to suck his cock, and had many, many times. Ryan didn't seem to need any encouragement and had eaten me alive twice already while asking for nothing in return. I smiled as I took his cock and swallowed him. He might not have asked for it, but he was going to get it anyway.\n\n\"Fuck...\" he gasped only seconds after I took him into my mouth, his hands landing on my head as he pressed up with his hips.\n\nHe wasn't pressing on my head hard and I knew I could overpower the pressure easily when I needed to catch my breath. I held him deep in my mouth, my tongue dancing around his shaft as I tickled his balls with my nails. The moment I pulled back to catch my breath, he grabbed me by my hips and lifted me over his face, cinching me down tight by wrapping my hips in his powerful arms. Both previous times he'd eaten me, he'd started slow, gradually building me up, but not this time. He went in hard and fast, his tongue flicking and darting, his lips pinching and pulling. I swallowed him again, his deep rumbling groan incredibly sexy.\n\nWe engaged in a war of pleasure, each of trying to break the other before being broken ourselves. I'd come so often and so hard I thought I'd been wrung dry of need, but as he began gently sucking on my button again, I knew there was at least one more orgasm in me.\n\nShit! Fuck! He's doing it again! He's sucking on our clit, the sexy motherfucker! Suck that cock! Suck that big cock and make him fucking come! Goddammit! Fuck! Devil snarled, battered and bruised from her fight with Angel, but she'd emerged from their fight victorious and was urging me on.\n\n\"Fuck, Michelle! You're going to make me come!\"\n\nKnowing that I was overwhelming him, that I was going to make him come before I did, excited me even more. I held the head of his cock between my lips and battered the head with my tongue as I furiously stroked his rod.\n\n\"If you don't stop, I'm going to come!\" he snarled.\n\nIt had been so long since I experienced a man filling me with his essence, I decided I didn't want him coming in my mouth and that I wanted to experience him coming inside me instead. I swallowed him deep one more time, his loud sexy moan as he battled his need my reward.\n\nI pulled him from my mouth and struggled to escape his embrace, straining mightily against his clinch until he let me go. I tumbled away from him and turned in the bed as he rolled for the side table where he kept his condoms. I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him away before he could reach it.\n\n\"Are you clean?\" I demanded.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Are you clean? When were you last with a woman without a condom?\"\n\n\"Never. Why are\u2014?\"\n\nI swung a leg over him and held him erect. He realized what I was about to do and caught me, his hands under my ass, holding me up and preventing me from taking him inside. \"Michelle... stop,\" he said, his voice firm. \"What are you doing? You need to think about this.\"\n\n\"I want to. I want to feel you come inside me.\" I paused and I could see the uncertainty on his face. \"I had myself tested after I found out, and I haven't been with a man since Bob. I can't get pregnant... not anymore. I want this.\" I paused. \"Have you ever been with a woman without using a condom?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\nI smiled, pleased with the thought that I would be the first woman he experienced as nature intended. \"Then please, let me be your first.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\nI nodded. \"I've never been so sure of anything.\"\n\nHe slowly drew his hands away and I settled over him. He hurt as he slid into my tunnel, but fuck he hurt so good!\n\n\"Oh... fuck!\" he snarled as he began lunging into me.\n\nHe hauled me down, crushing me into his chest as he took my lips in a blistering kiss, his hips battering me and his cock plunging deep into me time and again. I wailed softly, the pain fading and mingling with pleasure until they became one.\n\n\"Fuck me! Fuck me and don't stop!\" I cried softy.\n\n\"Fuck! I'm going to come!\"\n\n\"Don't stop!\"\n\nWith a growl he gripped my head and pushed me up, propping me on his arms as he had previously, and I rocked up to give him room to move. He began pounding into me harder, then harder still, his face twisting in rapture as he fucked himself to orgasm.\n\n\"I'm going to come. You're making me come,\" he gasped, his face a mask of erotic pain.\n\n\"Don't stop! Keep fucking me!\" I gasped, wanting to feel the rush of warmth and wetness as he came. He growled as he pushed me down on his cock, driving himself deep and holding himself there. I began thrusting my hips. \"Don't stop!\" I begged.\n\n\"Fuck!\" he barked before he began pounding into me furiously hard. After a long moment of frenzied fucking, he began to wail, a sound I'd never heard a man make, his cry an equal measure of pleasure, pain, and effort. An instant later he splashed into me, and still he fucked me, his face contorting in sweet agony as his wail grew louder with each pounding stroke.\n\nWatching him being savaged by his orgasm pushed me over the edge. My orgasm was tiny, the smallest of the night, but it was utterly and completely satisfying. He pulled me down, holding me to his chest with rib creaking force as he grunted and shook, slamming his cock into me hard and fast before pausing, only to do it again a moment later. Then he was still, rumbling like an idling semi-truck for a moment before grunting and driving his cock into me with three more hard, stabbing, thrusts, and then becoming still again, his slow loping rumble continuing.\n\nWith a long sigh, he finally relaxed his embrace. \"Jesus, Michelle, are you trying to kill me?\" he murmured into my neck before kissing me slowly.\n\nI smiled, totally pleased with myself. Take that, you sexy motherfucker! my devil sneered.\n\n\"Good one?\" I teased as I rose and took his lips.\n\nHe blew out a breath as our lips parted. \"I don't think I've ever come that hard before.\" He held my gaze a moment. \"Did you come? You were too much to handle and I didn't last very long.\"\n\nHis words were immensely gratifying and I brushed his lips with a finger. \"A small one.\" I saw the look of annoyance, probably at himself, and determination settle over his features. I bought my lips to his again. \"It was enough. I didn't think I was going to come at all. You've worn my ass out tonight.\"\n\n\"Are you sure. I can\u2014\"\n\n\"Shhh...\" I breathed, taking his lips again. \"Just hold me.\"\n\nHe rolled over and dumped me to the bed, pinning me to the mattress with his weight. Supporting himself on elbows and knees, he held my gaze. \"You are the most incredible woman I've ever met,\" he said before brushing his finger over my lips, up my cheek, and pushing lock of hair off my face.\n\n\"Please, don't make me cry,\" I sniffled.\n\nHe grazed my eyes with his lips, kissing way my tears before they could fall. \"Never.\"\n\nI pulled him to me, burying his face in my neck. I didn't love him, and I knew he didn't love me, but he still made me feel special, and sexy, and desired, and... and... and all the things I hadn't felt in a long time.\n\nWe kissed and nuzzled for a long time, saying little, our soft touches and gentle caresses saying it all until I snuggled into his side and tumbled headlong into a deep and peaceful sleep.\n\n<center>***</center>\n\nI swam for the surface of consciousness, stroking out of the ocean of sleep that enveloped me. I yawned, the bright light of morning streaming through the window. I smiled. Ryan was sporting another raging erection, and I idly wondered if I were woman enough to handle him for more than one night. I longed to have him, to take him inside me and fuck him awake, but I was truly hurting now. Even though our two A.M. romp had only lasted a half hour or so, combined with all the fucking we'd done before that, my womanhood had endured a thorough working over last night. Maybe another time. I smiled with the thought, hoping there'd be another time.",
        "I carefully extracted myself from his arms and made my way to the bathroom on silent feet. I felt gritty from my toils last night, and as I flushed, I wondered if he'd mind if I took a quick shower, just enough to rinse the sex off me.\n\nI decided he wouldn't and started the water. As soon as I had the water adjusted to a comfortable temperature, I stepped into the tub and shower combination and slid the door shut behind me. I was standing with my face in the water when I heard the shower door open.\n\nI whirled. \"I'm sorry. I hope\u2014\" I began, but I never completed the sentence before his lips closed over mine. He held me in a torrid kiss, pulling me hard into his chest and lifting me so that my feet dangled off the floor before he turned and jammed me against the wall. It didn't hurt and his tender violence excited me.\n\nOh, fuck yeah! my devil snarled. Let's fucking get it on!\n\nWe're already hurting! my angel countered.\n\nWho the fuck cares! When was the last time a man wanted us this much?\n\nI wrapped him in my arms and legs, squirming in excitement as he attacked my neck with his lips. He began probing for my entrance as his lips came back to mine for another torrid kiss. I flooded with desire. I wanted him. I desperately wanted to feel him inside me, but...\n\n\"Ryan... I can't!\" I gasped as I kissed him furiously.\n\n\"You can,\" he growled as he pressed me harder into the side of the tub, released my ass with one of his hands, and used it to try to steer his cock inside me.\n\nI debated womaning up and taking him despite my discomfort, but I had plans for him later, if he still wanted me, and I needed time to recover.\n\n\"I can't! Ryan... stop,\" I said, my voice firm. He stopped. Not only did he stop, he looked chagrinned.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, backing off and placing me on my feet.\n\n\"No,\" I whispered. \"I want you, I want you so much, but I... can't.\" I brushed his lips with my finger. \"You wrecked me last night and I need time to recover.\" He opened his mouth, and I could read the coming apology in his eyes. I gently pinched his lips. \"Don't you dare apologize. I loved what you did to me last night... but now I need some time to recuperate.\" I released his lips. \"And having you come in here, all horned up is hot as fuck!\" I smiled at him. \"If I wasn't so fucking sore I'd have worn your ass out!\"\n\nHe held my gaze for a moment, clearly trying to read me, and then returned my smile. \"I'm... You just... I can't get enough of you,\" he murmured before his lips closed over mine.\n\nI thrilled with his words and his kiss, and I pulled him to me, the water cascaded over us as we devoured each other.\n\n\"Take me to bed,\" I whispered as our lips slowly parted.\n\n\"I thought...\"\n\nI nodded slowly. \"I can take care of you.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do that.\"\n\n\"I want to.\"\n\nHe held my gaze a moment before he slapped the water off. I slid the door open, but before I could step out, or grab a towel, he picked me up and clasped me to his chest. I clung to him as he carried me to his bedroom, water dripping off us, and dumped me into his bed. He followed me down to kiss me fully, passionately. I reached between us to grip his cock, smearing his slickness down his shaft.\n\nTake him! Devil urged.\n\nWe can't! We're too sore and too old to\u2014\n\nFuck that! No woman could take the pounding we did last night without being at least a little tender afterwards.\n\nIt doesn't matter. We\u2014\n\nWe heard him! He said he couldn't get enough of us! Remember how hard we made him come? We rocked his world last night! Now, rock it again!\n\n\"Lay back,\" I growled as I shoved him off me. \"I'm going to take good care of you.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do this,\" he repeated.\n\nI offered him my best wicked seductress smile. \"Oh, yes I do,\" I purred.\n\nFor the next hour I tormented him in the most pleasant way possible, building him up and then holding him at the peak of pleasure, before allowing his near orgasm to wither away. I loved watching his face twist in erotic agony as I fucked him with my tits, wrapping my breasts around his hard shaft as he hissed and snarled in pleasure while thrusting, kissed and licked him with lips and tongue, and stroked him hard and fast in my tightly clenched fist.\n\n\"Don't you fucking come!\" I snarled as I stroked his shaft. \"You fucking hold it!\"\n\nHis hands were wadded in the destroyed linens of the bed as I lay in the crook of his arm, pressed against his side and watching his face, one leg thrown over him as I slowly rocked my hips against his leg.\n\n\"Fuck! Let me come, you sexy fucking bitch!\"\n\nIn another first, I'd never sensually tortured a man before, but doing so now was turning me on in a deep and profound way. His erotic struggle to obey me, the passion on his face, the control I exercised over him as I pleased him, all combined into the most sensual, most erotic, experience of my life.\n\n\"You better not come!\"\n\nHe was drying, and I didn't want to hurt him, so I turned and swallowed him, lubricating his shaft again, his deep moan as he pressed up with his hips incredibly sexy.\n\nAs I began stroking him again, he hauled my lips to his for another blistering kiss. \"I'm going to come!\" he snarled.\n\n\"Don't you fucking\u2014\" I sneered in return, but it was too late.\n\nHe erupted with a massive expulsion, his semen flying as I continued to stroke him hard and fast. I'd never seen a man come so much, his essence landing on my arm, a huge glob on his chest, an several smaller blobs landing everywhere else.\n\nHe shuddered and shook, every muscle taunt as he bared his teeth, his eyes crushed closed as his back arched, and still I stroked him, milking him dry of need and come. He began to wail, as he had last night, and I could imagine no sexier sound coming from a man. And still I stroked him.\n\n\"Fuck! Stop!\" he snarled as he gripped my hand tightly in his own.\n\nHe held my hand for a long moment as he continued to quiver before he began to relax, still grunting and jerking occasionally as he was rattled by aftershocks. I took his lips as I slowly caressed his cock, delighting in his occasional hisses, grunts, and spasms.\n\n\"Stop, please stop, fuck, stop, please stop,\" he begged, holding my hand as I gripped his cock.\n\n\"You liked that?\" I teased.\n\n\"Fuck...\" was his only response.\n\nI kissed him again, and this time, he wadded his hand in my hair and held my lips to his as he dragged me onto his chest. For a moment I thought he was going to fuck me, and I was so turned on I would have let him despite my tenderness, but he didn't, seemingly content to hold me to his chest as he kissed me.\n\nAfter a long moment of kissing I pulled back. He smiled at me as he brushed my hair back. \"I was wrong about your husband. He's not an idiot. He's the biggest fucking idiot this world has ever seen.\"\n\nI smiled, pleased by his words. \"You think so, huh?\"\n\n\"No... I know so.\" He held my gaze for a moment. \"Spend the day with me.\"\n\n\"In bed?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"If you want, but I was thinking maybe we could do something else. Maybe go to the park. It's supposed to be a beautiful day. A bunch of guys play basketball there, and I want to make them jealous.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I drawled. \"They're not going to be jealous. They'll think I'm your mother.\"\n\n\"Not if I have my way,\" he teased.\n\n\"Oh? What way is that?\"\n\n\"The way I'm going to hold you... and kiss you.\"\n\nI couldn't help by smile. \"Okay, maybe not you mother then, but still I doubt they'll be jealous.\"\n\n\"Then they're fucking idiots too.\"\n\nI kissed him quickly. \"Sounds like fun, but I can't.\"\n\n\"You can't, or you won't? Are you afraid of being seen with me?\"\n\nI spluttered. \"I'll make you deal. I'll go with you to make your friends jealous if you'll go with me to make mine jealous in return.\"\n\n\"Done!\"\n\nOh, God, how I hoped he was serious. \"You're sweet, but I still can't. I have to go home. I have things I need to do.\"\n\nHe looked shattered. \"Oh. Okay.\"\n\nI paused for a moment and then decided he need a nudge. \"This is when you ask me to dinner.\"\n\nHe brightened. \"Can I take you dinner? I promise something better than takeout Chinese this time.\"\n\n\"I actually enjoyed the Chinese takeout, but yes, I'd love to go.\"\n\n\"Pick you up about six?\"\n\nI smiled as I nodded. \"That'll be fine.\" I paused a moment. \"Want to join me for breakfast?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't miss it.\"\n\nI brought my lips close to his. \"I was hoping you'd say that,\" I whispered as my lips closed over his."
