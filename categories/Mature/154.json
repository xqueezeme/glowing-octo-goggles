        "Janice went straight to her master bathroom back at her own house with just enough time to get a quick rinse before her daughter Amanda got there. This was to remove the smell of sex from her previous encounter with young Allison. Less than an hour ago three of her fingers were buried deep inside the young girl's pussy causing her to squirt not once but twice with such force it splashed back onto herself. Since her daughter, Amanda, has always been a very observant person the quick shower was to wash away any hint of sex.\n\nBy the time her daughter arrived, Janice was dressed in the clothes she planned to go out to dinner in. Nothing flashy or sexy like she'd been dressing for the last week or so. She was back in Mom mode again not to give any hint to Amanda that her life had changed drastically. Trying to remember, the last time she had seen her daughter was probably over a month ago. They had talked on the phone occasionally of course, but physically seeing each other had been a while.\n\nSo many things had changed in her life that if Amanda knew all that her mother had done she would have sworn up and down that it was someone else, not her mother. The woman she knew growing up rarely kissed her father in public. If they did it was a quick peek that no one would have ever noticed. But at the same time, there was never any doubt in her mind that her parents loved each other very much.\n\nIf Amanda only knew how all her Mother's social mores had changed. She had walked arm in arm with Jason with the occasional very affectionate kiss in public. To a full-on make-out session, they'd had in the elevator, not to mention her mother sucking the young man's cock in between parked cars in the parking garage. Granted no one saw the last two things that she knew off. She still wondered if there were surveillance cameras on the elevator or in the garage that she just didn't see.\n\n\"Mom, mom where are you\" Amanda was hollering out, as she entered the house she grew up in. \"Mom, where are you?\" She hollered out again.\n\nThis time it startled Janice out of the deep thought she was in about how her life has changed so much. \"I'm here,\" she hollered back, just as Amanda walked around the corner entering what they all new as the study. This is the room John, Janice's late husband, and Amanda's dad, used as his home office. As a young child, she was never really allowed to come in here as she knew it as the room where adult stuff was done. Janice was now using it for her Allure Cosmetic office as there were all kinds of products from things that needed to be shipped out or brought in for personal distribution.\n\n\"Hi,\" Janice said, walking over to her daughter giving her a big hug telling her how much she has missed her. Mandy, as everyone called her since she was a little girl returned the hug, telling her mom how much she had missed her as well. \"How have you been Mandy,\" Janice asked, happy to see her daughter as she looked her over like all mothers do.\n\n\"Oh, I'm ok, but look at you mom you are looking great, what have you been up to? You look different, if I didn't know you better I would say you look younger, Amanda completed as she was taking her mom's new appearance.\n\nJanet thanked her for the compliment, then told her about the seminar she had attended earlier in the day. She explained how the makeup artist changed her makeup colors and how to apply them. \"I too was amazed at how much different it looks.\" She then asked Amanda if she would like her to touch up her makeup before they went out. Amanda declined, saying she was more worried about eating than she was about how she looked. They both got a chuckle from that with Janice asking where she wanted to go and that she was buying. Being a creature of habit Amanda opted for her favorite Sushi Bar that she loved going to when she was in this part of the city. Her mother quickly agreed as they each grabbed their purses and out the door they went.\n\nOn the drive over, they were talking back and forth, catching up on each other's lives. Amanda was telling her mom about how her job teaching was going. Telling her about the different kids she had in her class this year and their different personalities. In turn, Janice told her daughter about how her sales had been steadily increasing and how she was starting to do Cosmetic Parties which she hoped would bring in even more revenue. She had just started to explain the party plan's when they pulled into the parking lot of the Sushi Bar.\n\nThe packed parking lot was indicative of the way it was inside as well. The hostess, who was also the daughter of the owner. recognized them both, more so Amanda. \"Hello, it's been a while since you've been in. Where have you been?\" The hostess inquired as she led them to a booth in the center of the restaurant. Placing menus in front of them, she took their drink orders. Amanda ordered a cocktail of some sort and a glass of ice water. Janice couldn't hear from all the noise in the bar. Janice decided since she was driving that she wouldn't drink so instead she ordered a green tea of which she loved their green tea.\n\nA few minutes later their waitress came by with their drinks. She then took their meal order each getting what they normally got when they came here. Amanda had been the first to come here when she was in college with some of her girlfriends. She loved it so much that she talked her parents into coming with her.\n\nJanice was at first reluctant, with John always up for trying something different. Amanda was so excited to show them something new, it was like her first act of becoming an adult. It soon became a staple with the 3 of them with her brother, John Jr. joining occasionally. Her dad was a big fan and was determined to try everything on the menu with Amanda right along with him. Janice on the other hand was more reserved in her choices making sure not to get too exotic. They would cajole her into trying just about everything they got. Some she liked, some she absolutely couldn't stand and would be mad at them for making her try it.\n\nAll the food was as good as it has always been but the noise in the restaurant wasn't conducive to any meaningful conversation. Janice could tell that something was bothering her daughter, it was her motherly sense that was ringing alarm bells in her head. She wanted to hurry and get out so that she could talk to her daughter on the ride back home. She had the waitress bring their check, which she paid leaving a generous tip.\n\nAll during their visit, Janice noticed that Amanda hadn't mentioned her boyfriend even once. This wasn't normal for her daughter as she normally would say something about him. Janice knew their relationship was strained at times mostly due to his inability to maintain a job even though he was an intelligent young man or at least his education said he was. Being a protective mother, Janice was never fond of him, never understanding what Amanda saw in him.\n\nIn the car, Janice straight out asked Amanda what was going on. Looking out the car window Amanda avoided the question by not saying anything. Which anyone knows the words you don't say are the words that speak the loudest. Janice asked her again, \"Amanda what is going on, please tell me?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Mom. I guess I should have told you sooner but Tyler and I have decided to break up this past weekend.\"\n\n\"Oh Mandy, are you ok?\" Janice asked as she was pulling into her driveway waiting for the garage door to go up.\n\n\"Yes, I'm ok I guess. I actually thought I would be more upset about us breaking up. I've been tired of him for a long time but just didn't want to admit it, Amanda told her mother with less apprehension in her voice than when she had started telling her.\n\nThey both got out of the car, with Amanda coming over to her mom to tell her mother goodbye. \"Mom, I actually feel better now that I've told you. But I need to get back home before it gets too late. I love you, Mom, I'm so glad we did this tonight. You don't know how much better I feel now. Oh, what time do you want me here on Saturday?\"\n\n\"How does 11 sound? That way you can sleep in and when you get here we'll get lunch on the way to the mall?\" Janice said as she took her daughter in her arms giving her a big hug and kiss on the cheek. \"Please call me when you get home so I know you made it home safe ok? Please!\"\n\nReturning the hug and kiss, Amanda promised she would do what her mother asked. Janice watched her get in her car and drive off. She then walked into her house to call Jason like she had promised him earlier.\n\nJanice walked into the Master bedroom, a room she hadn't slept in for days, reluctant to do it tonight. She knew if she wanted she could be in Jason's bed within the hour and he wouldn't complain one bit. Nor would she as she would enjoy telling him about Allison and all that they did together. This would of course be while he was making love to her, something she would never deny him. But she knew they could both use some rest and time to themselves.\n\nPicking up her cell phone she dialed Jason's #, \"Hello Jason, I'm home now.\" Janice told him as she laid out across her bed.\n\n\"Hi Baby, how was dinner with Amanda,\" Jason asked her as he was excited to hear her voice.\n\nJanice replied, \"It was good, we had sushi at her favorite place, but it was so busy and noisy we couldn't really talk like we needed. She did tell me though, she and her boyfriend broke up over the weekend. She says, this time it's really over.\"\n\n\"Oh really, wasn't he the boyfriend you didn't like?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"Yes, so I'm glad it's finally over, or at least she says it is. I guess only time will tell, right?\" She said with optimism.\n\n\"Are you still going shopping on Saturday together?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"Yes, she's meeting me here at 11 am. I was thinking if you still want me to spend the weekends with you. I would leave your place by 9 and that should have me home well before she gets there. How does that sound with you,\" Janice said, as she was removing her clothes to get in bed?\n\n\"First, yes I want you to spend the weekend or even more if you wanted,\" Jason told her adding. \"If the weather cooperates, I'll be working Saturday so either way, we'll be apart during the day. I want to have as much time with you as I can Janice, I wish one day you would realize that.\" Jason told her with a little frustration in his voice.\n\n\"I'm sorry, you're right! I hope you know I just got in my bed, wishing you were here with me. I love you, Jason so very much.\" Janice told him.\n\n\"I love you too, Janice. I still can't believe how lucky I am to be with you,\" Jason told her. \"But you still have to tell me how your meeting with young what's her name, Allison, went today.\"\n\n\"Oh it went really well Jason, she's a real handful for sure. She wanted to go to bed as soon as she got into our apartment. I had to stop her so that I could try putting makeup on her, of which it went really well. Allison is going to be the perfect model for me.\" Janice told him as she was thinking about what all they did sexually.\n\nTeasing him she added, \"I won't bore you with all the details of what happened after we finished playing with the makeup.\"\n\nJason was having none of that as he told Janice to \"bore him with all the details\" just do it slowly, he said laughing.\n\nJanice began telling Jason in great detail how she enjoyed sexually kissing the first woman in her life, Allison. She described to Jason how Allison's lower lip is nice and thick which she enjoyed very much sucking and nibbling on. Then she told Jason that as they were kissing Ali was running her hands over her breasts then quickly removing her blouse and bra. True technically Nicole had been the first woman to touch her breasts in a somewhat sexual way. But there was no doubt her breasts and nipples were being vigorously fondled by Ali's young hands and fingers.\n\nJanice could tell that not only was her description arousing Jason by the sound of his breathing but also arousing herself as her nipples were becoming very hard and her pussy was becoming hot and wet. She asked Jason if he wanted her to continue. Jason replied to her was a simple, \"Yes, please!\"\n\nContinuing with her story, Janice told him that while she was enjoying kissing and sucking on Ali's lower lip. The little minx had stripped out of her clothes after she had removed her top. \"She then took my hands and placed them on her bare breasts. Again a first for me touching another woman's breasts and oh Jason her nipples were so hard and sensitive.\"\n\nJason interrupted her, by asking Janice to please describe Ali's breasts to him. She told him that first Ali is a thin girl with what she guessed was a B cup in breast size. Her nipples are large but proportionate to the size of her areolas that are smaller than her own but again were proportionate to her size and maybe not as brown or tan. You would like them. She asked Jason if that gave him a good idea of what they look like. He readily agreed and asked her to continue.\n\n\"Now, where was I before you interrupted me?\", Janice chided him. Jason apologized, then told her Ali had just placed your hands on her breasts. \"Oh yes, that's right thank you, I'm glad you're enjoying the story,\" Jason told her he'd enjoy it more if Janice were on top of him right now. She said she knew she would love that, too. If he wanted she could continue telling the story on Friday when she was with him.\n\n\"Aren't you getting your new bras on Friday?\", Jason asked her.\n\n\"Yes, I am. And who knows? There could be a whole new story to tell you then. You tell me what you want Jason, you know I'll never deny you anything that I can give you\", Janice told him.\n\nAfter deep thought, Jason opted to wait until Friday. Yes, he was very aroused. He was also very exhausted from his day at work. \"Janice, I hate to do this to you but I'm exhausted and need to sleep. Can I wait until Friday night when I'm with you? The thought of us making love while you're telling me what you did is so much more exciting than over the phone.\" Janice replied, \"Sure if that's what you want I'll be more than happy to do that for you.\"\n\n\"Let me remind you what I'm doing tomorrow afternoon, I'm meeting with Natalie to possibly change my hairstyle. I promise to keep you updated on that tomorrow as well. Thursday I've got to catch up on my orders with Allure so I'm having Allison come over after she gets off work at the coffee shop. There's a chance she may spend the night, so there will be more to tell you about Friday night if that happens. I do hope all this is okay with you, Jason, I don't want to do anything you don't want me to do.\", she asked him.\n\n\"Of course, it's okay with me baby. Why wouldn't it be, he asked her. Jason then told her, he wanted her to explore her sexuality, but just not with other men. She told him she had NO intentions of ever being with another man. With that, they both said they loved each other and they would talk tomorrow.\n\nWhen Janice hung up she was a little disappointed that she didn't get to finish telling him as she was still a little worked up. Oh well, she thought, she did keep him up late the night before, then she woke him up early wanting more sex. Even though he's still a young man, they both had been going at it pretty hard for the last couple of days. Plus his job had him working outside a lot in the Texas heat which is enough to zap the strength of any normal person.\n\nAs she was lying there in her bed, her mind went back to her daughter Amanda and her being single again. If only she could find a man for her just like Jason. Then again, why couldn't it be Jason? After all, Jason is in the same age group as Amanda. Not 30+ years older like she was.\n\nYes, they had both professed their love for each other but love is a funny word. Love has many different meanings and classifications. She loved being with him, she loved how it made her feel when they were together, she loved the sex, boy did she love the sex. But would she marry him? Yes of course IF they were the same age, but they weren't so NO she wouldn't marry him. She couldn't handle him being saddled with her as she got older and her health began to get weaker and he would still be in his prime. That would be selfish on her part to put him through that. This is on top of the fact that they both hadn't told their respective families about the other for the drama that would mostly bring down on them. Their level of love was not something she would selfishly put on Jason no matter what he thought.\n\nBut what if she could get Amanda and Jason together? Who knows? Maybe they could get married. If that were to happen at least they would still be in each other's lives just not sexually. Of course, she would miss the sex with him as she could never do that to her daughter. But at least they would still be in each other's lives.\n\nIf the relationship with Amanda didn't work out then if he wanted to be with her again she would consider it. But would it be worth sneaking around behind her daughter's back? That would be something she would have to take into consideration. Janice did know that being with Jason at this point in her life has been by far the best thing for her. The confidence he reinforced in her, even if it was with her first showing him her boobs. It took her out of the bleak hole she was in, to a new world she was so going to enjoy exploring especially with young Ms. Allison. Or any other woman that she so fancied having fun with. It was her life and she was going to live it to its fullest. With that in her head, Janice drifted off to sleep.\n\n***\n\nNervous with anticipation, Janice pulled into the parking lot of where Natalie's studio was located. It was 12:50 on her car clock. She didn't know if she should wait until 1 pm or go on in. She decided she'd rather be early than late. She checked herself one last time in the mirror, thinking this would be the last time she would see the old-style Janice again.\n\nWalking into the building she quickly figured out the suite numbering system which got her to Natalie's suite. The door was open, she could hear music playing in the background as she stepped in. To her relief, Natalie was there putting together the tripod she would mount her camera to.\n\n\"Hi Natalie, are you ready for me,\" Janice asked her, startling the young woman.\n\n\"Oh hi, yes come on in, I'm so glad you decided to do this,\" Natalie said excitedly to Janice as they both hugged greeting the other.\n\n\"Here please put your purse over on the counter and the makeup bag as well if you don't mind,\" Natalie said, pointing to the countertop next to the large mirror on the wall. \"Do you mind if I close the door so that we can have our privacy?\"\n\nJanice looked around the room which was just big enough to have a hair washing station, a styling chair that was in front of the larger mirror. On one wall, Natalie had all of her framed certificates and awards as well as few pictures of models for whom she had either styled their hair or makeup. Janice was very impressed and was becoming more at ease with what she was going to do. \"No, I don't mind at all in fact I prefer so that as you said, we'll have our privacy,\" Janice told her.\n\nAfter getting her camera set up as she wanted, Natalie asked Janice if she could stand against the one blank white wall so that she could take her picture. She then took pictures of her from the front, back, and on both sides. She then had Janice sit in the styling chair as she discussed the hairstyle she had in mind for her. While she was talking she was combing out her hair, then placing her hair clips to try and show Janice what she will look like when she was done.\n\n\"Now I know it's hard to completely visualize what you're seeing because of all the clips. But I want you to try and visualize the length mostly.\" Natalie was telling Janice, then she took her tablet computer using the pictures she just took of her. Natalie was able to edit the pictures to a Pixie hairstyle with long bangs in the front and very short on the sides.",
        "Janice was amazed at the technology that made her appearance with the hairstyle that Natalie had described. \"Wow, it's amazing that you can do this,\" Janice said, meaning the edited pictures. Adding, \"I love the hairstyle too, I'm convinced this cut is for me now.\"\n\nNatalie took the tablet back from Janice and did some more editing, handing it back to Janice to look at. \"I want to change your hair color to this platinum silver which would look amazing on you with your high cheekbones and your skin color. The makeup would look like this.\" Natalie was telling her, as she hit a button on the side of the screen. The picture went from no makeup to full makeup like she had done yesterday.\n\nAmazed again by the technology she was holding in her hand, Janice loved the new look. \"I can't believe that's me, in the picture. I'm just so amazed that you can do that just on a tablet.\" Janice told her as she kept looking at the images. \"I'm nervous about the cut and hair color but I trust you Natalie to do it right, so let's do it!\"\n\n\"I think you are really going to love it, Janice. I've done this cut on several clients but I really think it's going to look the best on you. I'm just not saying this to sell you,\" Natalie was telling her, as she was taking the clips out of her hair. \"Your facial bone structure will really be complemented by this cut. I can't tell you how excited I am that you're letting me do this.\"\n\n\"And I can't believe you're doing this for free just so you can take pictures for your portfolio,\" Janice said, uncomfortable with this arrangement.\n\n\"Janice, you don't understand how much this will help my career. When I can show before and after pictures of the transformation people will be amazed.\" Natalie was telling Janice adding, \"Look I don't want to get your expectations up, but I believe you are going to be amazed by your new look. So let's get started, by washing your hair.\"\n\nAs Natalie was washing her hair, Janice had really no other place to look than to admire the nice view of cleavage that was in her face. Natalie was talking to her but it was mostly chattering about, is the water temperature right or your hair feels nice or something like that. Janice was just smiling and saying, \"Yes and Right.\" Which sufficed Natalie enough to keep her talking and doing what she was doing which was swinging her breasts in Janice's face.\n\nWhen Natalie had finished washing her hair she wrapped a towel around Janice's head to get most of the water out. She noticed the top 2 buttons of her blouse had become undone which had caused her blouse to balloon out. She assumed that gave Janice quite a view. Buttoning her blouse, Natalie apologized to Janice for being so risqu\u00e9, \"I surely didn't mean that.\"\n\nJanice replied, \"Oh honey, I didn't mind at all, in fact, it was a very nice view.\"\n\nBlushing, Natalie told Janice to have a seat in the styling chair. Of which Janice dutifully did as she was told, now very intrigued by the young redhead. Natalie began combing out her hair telling Janice that once she had her combed out she would take some more pictures as she would need to document the process from A to Z. \"Sorry but taking pictures is necessary but it's what's going to slow us down the most,\" Natalie said, as she was having Janice now stand up so she could take the necessary pictures.\n\n\"Janice, would you mind if I turned on some music for us to listen to,\" Natalie asked as she went over to the counter that was on the wall where her certificates hung.\n\n\"No, I don't mind at all. What kind of music do you like to listen to, Natalie,\" Janice asked, as she posed for her pictures.\n\nAfter taking the required pictures Natalie hit play on her Bose stereo. The bluesy sound of female voices started flowing through the 4 speakers that were placed around the small room. Janice started listening to the female singer and really liked it as it was a voice she never heard before. \"Natalie, who is that singing? I really like their music,\" Janice asked, enjoying their vibe.\n\nNatalie had started cutting her hair, \"This a band called Larkin Poe I came across them on YouTube. I like blues music and when I came across them I fell in love, I'm glad you like them.\" Natalie said as she was now concentrating on what she was doing. \"I find music helps me center myself when I'm working. I'm so glad you like it.\"\n\nWith half of Janice's hair removed, Natalie took some more pictures. Then she went back to cutting Janice's hair. It was driving Janice crazy because the way Natalie had her seated she couldn't look in the mirror to see what she was doing. She could feel and see big chunks of her hair falling to the side. Natalie could see the worry in her client's eyes, so she reassured her that it's looking great just to listen to the music. Preachin Blues was the name of the song, as Natalie was singing along with the song. Janice thought her voice was just as sexy as the girl who was singing it. This helped calm her as she was really starting to get into the mode Natalie was putting out. So much so that she started unconsciously to move with the music, which caused a mild scolding by Natalie. \"If you can't hold still your hair is going to be even shorter,\" Natalie warned her.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I got lost in listening to the song and your singing, you have such a pretty voice,\" Janice said apologetically.\n\n\"Please my voice isn't that good, but thank you for the compliment. Now hold still while I take some more pictures.\" Natalie started snapping more pictures. \"Now it's time to color your hair, are you ready?\"\n\n\"You already finished cutting my hair,\" Janice asked incredulously. \"Can I see it?\"\n\n\"No, not yet, you will have to wait until it's all completed.\" Natalie teased as she started mixing the color dye for Janice's hair.\n\n\"When God Closes the Door\", started to play and again Natalie started singing flawlessly along with the song. Janice thought she looked so sexy as she was dancing around as she was mixing the colors. \"Have you ever sang professionally Natalie, your voice is so, so sexy!\" Janice told her with a seductive smile on her face.\n\nBlushing again by what Janice was telling her and the look on her face was really building Natalie's confidence that she was pleasing this older attractive woman. Natalie answered, \"No never professionally,\" she said with the air quotes, \"But I've been known to get up a time or two at Karaoke Bars.\"\n\n\"Please let me know the next time you go, I'd love to go watch you perform,\" Janice told her.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Natalie replied.\n\n\"Yes, of course, your voice is so sexy I mean really good,\" Janice said, now blushing herself.\n\n\"Ok let's get serious here, I don't want to mess you up,\" Natalie told her, as she started applying the coloring to Janice's hair. \"So tell me about how you and your boyfriend met,\" Natalie asked, not realizing this was a tricky question.\n\nJanice's heart about jumped out of her chest when she heard the question come out of Natalie's mouth. Not sure how she should answer this, she decided to tell the truth. She began to tell the story of how she knocked on Jason's apartment door hoping to sell cosmetics to the lady who lived there. As Natalie continued applying the hair color, Janice said she was surprised when a tall handsome young man answered the door. \"At first, I was taken aback by such a handsome man that I had to think fast telling him I had male products as well. For some odd reason, instead of closing the door in my face, he invited me in.\"\n\n\"I'm sure when he saw you, you could have been selling snow shovels he would have still invited you in,\" Natalie quipped. \"So what happened when you got inside?\"\n\n\"Thank you for the sweet compliment, Natalie.\" Janice said as she continued the story, \"So I looked around the apartment and it was immaculate, it was definitely not what I would imagine a young man's apartment to look like. He was such a gentleman as he offered me something to drink. I requested bottled water which he got me. I then started telling him about the men's product line. The whole time I'm talking I can feel his eyes on me or more specifically my chest.\"\n\nNatalie interrupted her, \"Are you serious, was he that blatant?\n\n\"No to be fair, he was trying not to be rude or perverted but you can tell when you're being looked at right? Do you know what I mean,\" Janice asked?\n\n\"Yes, I know exactly what you mean. In fact, I think someone was doing it to me when I was washing someone's hair earlier,\" Natalie quipped with Janice.\n\nKnowing she was caught, Janice fired back, \"Well it would have been rude not to have looked when two beautiful breasts were put in my face.\"\n\nNatalie stopped what she was doing looking Janice in the eyes not sure what to say. Janice raised her eyebrow and gave the sexiest look back at Natalie. She then reached out undoing the top two buttons of the young redhead's blouse. \"You look so much sexier with those undone, Ms. Natalie.\"\n\nNot saying anything as she continued putting the color in Janice's hair. Janice continued with her story of how she met Jason, her young boyfriend. \"After showing him all of the men's line of products he asked me to pick out my favorite men's cologne. Of which I told him I had two, so I put some on each of his wrists. I smelt them both and Natalie they both smelled so delicious on him.\n\n\"Bleached Blonde Bottle Blues\" started to come through the speakers which made them laugh out loud as they thought it was poetic for what they were doing.\n\n\"So which one did he get,\" Natalie asked as she finished applying the hair color then she put the plastic bag over Janice's hair setting the timer for the color to set for 30 minutes.\n\n\"For whatever reason Jason wanted the most expensive bottle but it came with a stipulation,\" Jason told her.\n\nNatalie was cleaning up her station as she was listening to Janice telling her story. \"Stipulation? What do you mean by stipulation?\" Natalie stopped what she was doing as he asked the question.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Janice told her, \"He said he would buy the cologne but I had to show him my breasts.\" Embarrassed that she told Natalie, it also felt cathartic to get that story off of her chest, so to speak.\n\nNatalie's eyes got big when she heard what Janice just said, \"Are you serious? I mean to be honest when you walked into the room yesterday the first thought that went through my mind was, I wonder if those are real and how do they look?\"\n\nBuoyed by those words, Janice sat up more in her seat pushing her chest as she said, \"First, yes they are NATURAL. Second, I told him NO! But then he kept asking me until eventually he wore me down or to be honest after I got over the shock of his proposition, I wanted him to see them. I wanted to show them off to this young man who wanted to see an older woman's breasts.\" Janice said, with distinct pride in her voice.\n\nNatalie's eyes were bouncing between Janice's chest that was covered by the smock and her eyes. She thought Janice had the sexiest eyes. \"When you say young how young is he if you don't mind me asking,\" Natalie asked.\n\nTaking a big gulp of courage or maybe even pride, Janice answered, \"Jason is 26\"\n\n\"And your how old, again you don't have to answer that,\" Natalie said, but she wanted to know.\n\n\"I just turned 57 two months ago,\" Janice answered, afraid of what Natalie's reaction would be.\n\nNatalie's jaw dropped down to her chest, as she said, \"Janice you're 57? No way I would have thought seriously late 40's maybe 50. Damn girl, you've been blessed with damn good genes. I promise you, after today you're going to look like you are in your early 40's for sure.\"\n\n\"Thank you Natalie for doing this for me, I guess I'm trying to drink from the Bottle of Youth for Jason, he means so much to me. I realize we may not have a long-term future but the time we do have I want Jason to at least be proud of me and how I look,\" Janice told Natalie with a sad look in her eyes.\n\nAt that moment the timer went off, Natalie started removing the plastic bag off of Janice's head. \"I'm going to make you so beautiful Janice that Jason is going to have to fight men off of you,\" Natalie promised her.\n\n\"There won't be a fight, Jason is the only man for me,\" Janice said.\n\n\"Let's quickly take some pictures and then get you over to the sink to wash the color out,\" Natalie was quickly taking the required 4 pics then got Janice over to the shampoo sink. The song \"Mississippi, by Larkin Poe\", started playing. Janice asked Natalie to turn it up so she could hear it over the water running.\n\nAs her client requested, Natalie, did as she turned it up 4 more notches, which was fine as it was after 5 and the adjacent suites were probably now empty. She started washing Janice's hair realizing that Janice had earlier undone two of the buttons on her blouse. If she wanted a show then a show she would get as she started singing along with the song as she ran her hands through Janice's hair.\n\nWithout even thinking about what she was doing as she would later blame it on the music. Janice reached up and separated Natalie's blouse more as she looked at the cleavage that was hanging in front of her. She then removed two more buttons so that she could put her hands on Natalie's breasts that were only covered by her white silk bra. Natalie never missed a note as she continued to sing along with the song as she continued washing Janice's hair.\n\nAs the song finished so did the fun the two ladies were having as Natalie told Janice it was time to take more pictures. Leaving her blouse completely unbuttoned provocatively exposing her bra, Natalie started taking pictures of Janice. She then had Janice get back in the chair as she completed styling hair with a few cuts here and there until she had it just like she wanted. She stepped back to look at Janice with tears welling in her eyes.\n\nSeeing this Janice instantly thought something horrible had gone wrong with hair. \"What's the matter,\" Janice asked in near panic as she was starting to get out of the chair to go look in the mirror.\n\nNatalie stopped her from getting up as she said, \"I'm sorry for my reaction but, I can't believe how much I have changed your look.\" Now with a big smile on her face, even as tears continued to run down her face. Natalie started telling Janice, \"You said you were looking for the \"Fountain of Youth\", well honey I think I found it with this hairstyle and color. I have been doing this for many years and I've never been happier with what I have done than I am right now. You look even more beautiful than when you first walked in here and at least 10 years younger.\"\n\nNow Janice really wanted to look in the mirror, to see for herself. \"Please Natalie, let me look in the mirror,\" Janice begged.\n\n\"No, not yet, I still have your makeup to do and pictures to take, please be patient,\" Natalie said, so excited to get the pictures taken.\n\nAfter the pictures were taken and makeup completed, Natalie had to take the final set of pictures. \"Are you ready for the big reveal,\" Natalie asked Janice. Not giving Janice a chance to answer as she already knew the answer Natalie removed the smock from her. She then spun the chair around until Janice was facing the mirror.\n\n\"OOOHHHH MYYYYYYY, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!!!\" Janice screamed, in an exuberated loud shriek of joy. Janice was no longer a brunette with shoulder-length hair. Now she had a pixie cut very short on the sides and back with long bangs that went from the left to the right side of her face colored platinum silver. Her makeup was done the same as it was yesterday but it suited her style even more today.\n\n\"I can't believe it, I just can't believe it,\" Janice kept saying over and over as she was looking at herself in the mirror from all different angles. Nicole handed her a handheld mirror so that she could see the back of her head. \"I don't even recognize myself, I actually look YOUNGER, I can't believe it, I just can't believe it.\" Janice kept saying and over.\n\n\"So do you like it,\" Nicole asked, as she thought she did but she wanted to hear it from Janice.\n\nJumping out of the chair, Janice took Natalie in her arms giving her a big hug and kiss on the cheek. \"Yes, I LOVE IT!\" Janice said as she kissed her on the other cheek. Then on the lips, this wasn't supposed to be what it turned out to be. It started as just a kiss, but then Janice kissed Natalie again. This time Natalie was more receptive to the kiss as her lips parted slightly taking in more of Janice's lower lip. Then they kissed again, this time both of their lips parted as their tongues began to touch going from one mouth to the other.\n\nAfter a few minutes of kissing, the two separated, each looking at the other. Neither not sure what to say or how to react to this sudden change. Janice was the first to speak saying, \"I, um didn't mean to um...\"\n\nNatalie stopped Janice from saying any more by saying, \"If you are going to apologize for kissing me please don't. I've been wanting to kiss you from the first moment I watched you walk into the room yesterday. When you walked in it was like you owned that room, your confidence was pouring out of you. That's why I think Megan, the other woman that was in our group. I believe she was intimidated by you, Janice, and I'm not saying that to be mean. I was watching her when I had you two putting makeup on the mannequin. Megan was getting frustrated by how easily you picked up my instruction. She thought she was the hottest smartest woman in the room and you crushed her Janice. You did it by not being mean or showy but by being you, a very confident woman. I have to tell you that's what really intrigued me about you. Then when you asked for my opinion about a new hairstyle, you were like a dream come true.\" Natalie told Janice, as she was holding her close with her hands on her upper arms.\n\n\"Really,\" Janice said, with excitement in her voice. \"Funny you should say that, when I sat down and was looking around the room you, Megan, and maybe one other, I don't even remember who it was now. But you and the two others would be my choice of who I would like to get to know, um better, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Better,\" Natalie said, as she feigned she didn't know what Janice meant better. This made Janice feel even more embarrassed, but Natalie finally confided in her that she knew what she meant and she would love to get \"better\" acquainted with her too!\"\n\n\"To be honest Natalie, a month ago I didn't have the confidence I do now. It's very weird for me to say this but if I hadn't shown my breasts to Jason the way that I did. I wouldn't be the confident person I am today. I don't know what that says about me but I don't care, I wouldn't change a thing. The reaction I got from what he saw and then the most incredible love-making since that time has been more than worth it.\n\n\"Janice,\" Natalie asked, in the sweetest of voices.\n\n\"Yes, Natalie,\" Janice replied, breaking her out of the trance she was in thinking about how her life had changed.\n\n\"Can I kiss you again\" Natalie replied.\n\nBefore she could answer, Natalie leaned into Janice and the two began kissing again this time with way more passion. Her hands rubbing Janice's back then down to her nice firm ass. As they continued to kiss, her hands started to work their way back up the front side of Janice, until firmly cupping and fondling her breasts.\n\nNatalie leaned back from Janice, breaking their kissing to ask her, \"Janice, can I see them?\"\n\nWith a sly smile on her face, Janice simply began removing her blouse then her bra. Revealing her breasts to others was becoming quite common for Janice to do, it was as if it was her source of power. Although gravity would eventually get past her good genes to where they wouldn't be as perky as they are now. But until that day comes she was going to get just as much enjoyment if not more showing them off.",
        "Natalie's eyes got big as she got her first view of them. \"Oh my Janice, are you serious! I can see why your boyfriend is so enamored with them, they are spectacular.\" Natalie's fingers went straight for Janice's nipples that at this point were as hard and sensitive as they could be. Natalie pulled and twisted on those hard sensitive nipples with her thumb and index fingers, causing Janice to flinch in her reaction to sensations this was causing her.\n\nNot believing they were real, Natalie was now roughly fondling and cupping the older woman's breasts. \"I would have sworn when I first saw them Janice your breasts were fake, but damn they are as natural as they get. I want you to know I am incredibly jealous but also thankful that you're letting me do this.\"\n\nRelishing in the compliments the younger woman was giving her, Janice was thoroughly enjoying this extra attention she was getting. \"Thank you Natalie for your kind words, I'm very fortunate to have very good genes in the breast department I suppose. You know I've been admiring yours as well, it's not fair that I'm the only one topless, you know,\" Janice said, as she began to fondle Natalie's breasts still covered by her bra.\n\n\"I hope mine don't disappoint you,\" Natalie said, as she reluctantly took her hands away from Janice's nipples so that she could undo her bra from behind her back. As the bra became free, Janice lifted it to reveal what had been the object of her curiosity since she first met Natalie yesterday.\n\nWhat she saw, was not what she had expected. She thought she would see perky breasts much like Allison's and her own. But instead, she saw breasts that looked like flat size B breasts. The areolas are slightly darker in color than the very white skin of her breasts. The nipples were but a button that was hardly there, she couldn't imagine her being able to breastfeed a baby. Trying not to show her disappointment, Janice tried to compliment Natalie by saying how nice they looked. She then tried to arouse Natalie's nipples by rubbing them with her thumbs. When her nipples still didn't react Janice even became more aggressive, pinching and pulling on them with her thumb and index fingers as Natalie had done with her own nipples.\n\nThis was still not giving her the reaction she had expected. To hide her disappointment, Janice began kissing Natalie again. Now, this was something Natalie was very good at. Janice was really enjoying holding Natalie against her, her hard nipples pressing against Natalie's less than spectacular titties. Never before had Janice felt superior over another woman as she did right now. Sure she felt in charge when she was with both Nicole and Allison. But not superior like she did with Natalie. This was a new feeling for her and she wasn't sure if she was comfortable with it but sure was going to take advantage of it.\n\nWith her hands on each side of Natalie's head, she pulled her away as they stopped kissing and guided her down to her right nipple, the one Jason loved the most. She didn't know why he gave it the most attention as she thought her nipples looked symmetrical to the other. Maybe he was just right-handed thus he went for her right nipple the most, she didn't know or really care as he always did a good job on both of them.\n\nNatalie quickly latched onto her hard sensitive nipple sucking it into her mouth as she began sucking and nibbling on it. This caused Janice to moan out in exhilaration, \"Oh, fuck yes that's it baby that feels so good.\"\n\nEncouraged by the response she was getting from this sexy mature woman whose tits were far better than her own. Natalie greedily sucked harder and with more urgency on Janice's right nipple as she tugged and twisted on the left nipple with her right hand. It was as if she was trying to cause nonexistent milk to begin to flow from Janice.\n\nBoth Jason and Allison, to some degree had both suckled from her teats but not like this. This was a whole new sensation, it reminded her of when she would breastfeed young John and Amanda. When they were really hungry they would suckle like this but the difference being the person suckling now was a grown woman with teeth. Although at times it was painful as she suckled from each of her nipples, there was no way she was going to stop Natalie from doing it. She only wished she could give Natalie what she was so desperately trying to get from Janice, her mother's milk.\n\nAfter several orgasms, her nipples became too sensitive to let Natalie continue any further. Pushing her back, Janice said, \"Baby, what you're doing feels amazing but my nipples can't take it anymore.\"\n\nNatalie looked up with a stunned almost glazed-over look in her eyes as if she was in a trance. She was enjoying suckling from Janice's tits so much that she didn't want to stop. \"I'm sorry if I was hurting you I guess I got a little carried away. I hope you can forgive me,\" Natalie told Janice with a sad look on her face.\n\n\"Oh no, you didn't necessarily hurt me as much as I'm just not used to that much attention. To be honest, I haven't had that kind of um, I guess I would call it, attention in a very long time. Trust me it was amazing, my panties are proof of that.\" Janice told her as she started to put her blouse back forgoing the bra.\n\n\"Really, can I see,\" the young redhead said, as her hand went down to Janice's crotch? She was trying to undo her pants so that she could get her hand inside. Janice quickly put her blouse on then grabbed Natalie's hands to push them away.\n\n\"Not now baby, there will be other times for that I promise. But it's late and I need to get going, Jason must be worried sick about me, I've been gone so long.\" Janice told her this just to keep her at bay. Jason knew she was going to be late and wasn't expecting a phone call until later that night. For whatever reason, she couldn't really tell why, but when the sex started she wasn't all that into it. The kissing was great, maybe it was the way she sucked her nipples until they hurt or maybe it was Natalie's own breast that Janice didn't find attractive. If it had been Allison she wouldn't have stopped her or maybe even Nicole, the Victoria's Secret manager. She would honor her promise though the next time she would let Natalie get a taste between her legs.\n\nKissing Natalie one more time, Janice asked her if there was anything else she needed to do before she left. Still, a little hurt that Janice was leaving, Natalie told her to keep her hairstyle looking like it is that she would need to come back in 6 weeks. They both agreed on a date putting a reminder into their respective calendars.\n\n\"Of course that appointment, I'll pay for it right?\" Janice asked as she finished putting all over her things in her purse, including her bra.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure we can work out a swap of favors. I'll style your hair and you let me have an hour with you to do whatever I want,\" Natalie said with a big smile on her face.\n\nJanice thought about the proposal for a minute, then told Natalie, \"I promised you next time to let you play more, so a promise is a promise. But I'll pay for the styling at the full rate but your tip will be the one hour as you requested.\"\n\n\"Janice, I apologize again for hurting you. I just haven't been with a woman in a long, long time and I guess I got a little over...\" Natalie was saying until Janice stopped her.\n\n\"You didn't do anything that I haven't already recovered from. After all, the number of times you made me climax was well worth it.\" Janice told her as she gave Natalie another hug and a quick kiss. \"Oh, thank you for my new look. I can't wait to show Jason.\" With that, Janice walked out of Natalie's suite, closing the door behind her. She quickly needed to find a ladies' room to clean herself up between her legs. She felt she had wet her pants from all the orgasms she just had.\n\nClosing the stall door behind herself, Janice pulling down her pants could see she had a very noticeable wet spot in the crotch of her pants. She laughed at herself, thinking thongs just aren't as absorbent as granny panties. Oh well, she thought to herself, the sacrifices a woman must make to be sexy. Before she started cleaning herself up, she quickly ran two of her fingers inside herself as she began to run her fingers in and out she pressed down hard on her clit with her thumb. This quickly resulted in her having the 4th or 5th orgasm of the day. She didn't really know as they had come so quickly with Natalie's attention to her breasts. She was still feeling the ramifications of Natalie's sucking. As she was coming down from the high of her own masturbation, Janice thought about her plans with Allison for tomorrow night. She had big plans for her and sore nipples or not nothing was going to stop that from happening.\n\nTo be continued, Chapter 15..."
