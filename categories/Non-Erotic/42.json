        "The chronological order of my stories is now listed in WifeWatchman's biography.\n\n Feedback and constructive criticism is very much appreciated, and I encourage feedback for ideas.\n\n This story contains graphic scenes, language and actions that might be extremely offensive to some people. These scenes, words and actions are used only for the literary purposes of this story. The author does not condone murder, racial language, violence, rape or violence against women, and any depictions of any of these in this story should not be construed as acceptance of the above.\n\n\n\n This story is dedicated to the memory of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes Canon, and creator of the greatest Detective Duo in all history, Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Hamish Watson, M.D.\n\n Part 8 - Flashback: Chain of Events \n\n Saigon, South Viet Nam, early 1973.\n\n Navy Corpsman Leonard R. Cordell walked into the office and stopped in front of the desk, rendering a crisp salute.\n\n \"At ease, Corpsman.\" said the four-star Army General behind the desk. \"The report of every soldier is that you went back and got your Captain while under enemy fire, and evacuated him to safety. That's damn brave, son.\"\n\n \"Not as brave as he was, General.\" said Cordell. \"Is he all right, sir?\"\n\n \"He made it through the operation.\" said the General. \"It looks like he's going to make it. But his war is over. He'll be shipped home. We're going to conveniently overlook his insubordination. None of you are going to be charged... unless you say so much as one fucking word about any of this, ever. Do you understand me?\"\n\n \"Yes, General.\" said the Corpsman.\n\n \"So, son,\" said the General, \"what do you want to do now?\"\n\n \"I want to go to medical school, General.\" said the Corpsman. \"I want to be able to help put these men back together again when they come out of the meat grinders.\"\n\n The General nodded. \"Well, you're on your way... Annapolis, then Medical School. We need doctors like you, Cordell. Okay, you'll get your orders within a day. Dismissed.\" Cordell saluted, and it was returned. As he walked to the door, he turned.\n\n \"Excuse me, General,\" he said, \"but is it possible for me to see the Captain before I go?\"\n\n \"No, son.\" said the General. \"He's being shipped to Pearl Harbor, then the States to recover. It could be a long time, and you'll be in Maryland very soon.\" The General did not mention that none of the Captain's men were going to be allowed to see him again in Southeast Asia.\n\n \"General, I respectfully recommend he be put in for the Medal of Honor.\" said Cordell.\n\n \"I wish I could do that, son.\" said the General. \"But you know how it is, where you guys went into.\"\n\n \"Sir, being on the wrong side of a politically drawn line should not prevent him------\"\n\n \"Cordell.\" said the General, stopping him. \"I understand. I'd like to put you in for a Navy Cross, too... but the politics are tying my hands. Now go, son. Go become the best damn doctor in the history of the United States Navy. But leave this behind. All of it.\"\n\n Cordell left. Yes, he'd be the best doctor he could for those warriors who would need his services in the future. \n\n But he would never forget what had happened here...\n\n Part 9 - Knocking on Heaven's Door \n\n Teresa Croyle opened her eyes. A bright light was above her. As she looked ahead of her, she saw a rushing stream, the water looking cool and inviting, going from her right to her left, cutting through a beautiful, grassy meadow. A bridge went over the stream, brightly colored, beckoning.\n\n \"Hello, Sister.\" said Alexis, who was sitting on a bench on this side of the bridge. Teresa looked and saw someone on the other side of the stream, standing by the bridge. It was Amy, looking brilliantly healthy and radiant, wearing a gossamer gown, smiling and happy, in no pain.\n\n And further up the meadow, under a tree, a couple was sitting as if they were at a picnic. Even from here, Teresa could feel the love between the man and the woman. And then they looked at her.\n\n The woman looked just like her, like Teresa. It was her mother, Teresa realized. And the young man with her, who looked like Alexis but with darker hair, was her father. He was wearing what looked like Army khakis from the Viet Nam era, the era that defined him, but he was happy... a happiness that Teresa had never seen. He seemed to be peering at her.\n\n \"All is forgiven here.\" said Alexis, reading Teresa's thoughts. \"Here there is no pain, no regrets. Only love and peace. Are you ready to cross the bridge and be with us?\"\n\n Teresa knew the answer in her soul, even as she contemplated what was before her.\n\n \"No.\" she said. \"I... I have work still to do. It... it's not my time.\"\n\n Alexis smiled. \"If you chose to stay here, it would be understood. But you are right: you will still make a difference if you go back.\"\n\n \"Then that's what I have to do.\" Teresa said. \"It is my 'giri'.\"\n\n \"From this point on,\" Alexis said, \"your duty is to yourself, and to no one else. Remember that... remember that... we'll be here waiting for you when your time comes...\"\n\n Teresa closed her eyes for a moment, seemingly just a blink of her eyes...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n When she opened her eyes again, she saw a bright light overhead... and realized it was the lights of the operating table in the operating room.\n\n \"Doctor, the patient is awake.\" a nurse said.\n\n \"Yes, I see.\" said the old man. \"More local anesthetic, but no more general. Hello, Ms. Croyle. My name is Leonard Cordell. I'm just fixing up this shoulder wound. The bullet got you just above where your armored vest ended. Unlucky ricochet. But you're going to be fine.\"\n\n Dr. Cordell was continuing to fix up her shoulder wound as he talked. \"Okay, we got the bullet where it hit your scapula. Fortunately it did not break it, nor hit anything else major. Just a bit of your lung. Take it easy... by they way, I knew your father in Viet Nam. When all this is done, I'll tell you about some of that. No, relax, take it easy... that's right, just relax...\"\n\n This man knew her father, and was now operating on her, Teresa thought to herself. An amazing coincidence? Or foreordained for nearly a half century? she wondered.\n\n Teresa closed her eyes for a moment. She would not open them again until the next morning...\n\n Part 10 - Loyalties \n\n \"'It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand in the dock. You hope to beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me. If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.'\n\n\"'You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,' said I. 'Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.'\n\n------ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 'The Final Problem'\n\n Back in Dr. Fredricson's office, Phyllis Troy yelled \"Stop it!\" as the men kicked Melina viciously.\n\n \"Shut up, bitch!\" yelled Dixon, \"or you'll be next!\"\n\n Even though the men had guns, Phyllis prepared to launch into them, hoping to disarm them with her own Aikido skills. Even if she were shot, it'd give the other women time...\n\n *FWUP!*\n\n Dixon realized that he was seeing Griswold's head explode like a watermelon. As blood flew, he turned to the cabinet between the doors leading to the anteroom and the clinic. The last thing he might've seen was the .22 WMR bullet from the silenced auto-pistol coming at his head.\n\n *FWUP!*\n\n The bullet hit Dixon squarely in his left eye. He fell back, dead before he even hit the floor.\n\n From out of the cabinet crawled Detective Joanne Cummings Warner. \"Wow, that was really a cramped space!\" she said. She rushed to Melina as Laura began examining her injured sister.\n\n \"Good shooting, Rogue 2.\" Melina whispered to Joanne.\n\n \"I had a good teacher.\" Joanne replied, trying to keep the tears out of her eyes.\n\n \"How did you ever get into there?\" asked a stunned Phyllis.\n\n \"Never mind that. Let's get Melina to the hospital.\" said Laura. \"We've got to check for internal injuries, and operate immediately if there's any bleeding.\" Gayle had already run into the clinic to get a gurney, and they soon had Melina on it and were rushing her to a vehicle...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n Cindy began walking towards the front of the Sanctuary. The seats were almost completely full. Mrs. Veasley was in her wheelchair at the front right, where the wheelchair-bound always were.\n\n \"Hello, Child.\" Mrs. Veasley said affably.\n\n \"Hello, Mrs. Veasley.\" Cindy said. \"What is going on here?\"\n\n \"I am not sure, Child.\" said Mrs. Veasley. \"It's past 7:00pm, and the Reverend Patterson was due here an hour ago. There has been no sign of him nor word from him.\"\n\n Cindy got on her Police radio. \"Captain Ross to Duty Desk.\" After getting acknowledgement, she said \"Has the Reverend Patterson's plane arrived at County Airport?\"\n\n \"No ma'am.\" said the Duty Desk. \"The Tower says they have no expectation nor flight plan of any plane from Texas, where the Oldeeds Ministry is, nor from Kansas City, where the Reverend Patterson was last known to be.\"\n\n Cindy and Mrs. Veasley looked at each other. \"I would say that the Reverend had a change of plans, Child.\" said Mrs. Veasley. \"Would you mind getting me a working microphone from the podium?\" \n\n As Cindy went to do so, the screens that were set up to give a good viewing of the speaker at the pulpit's podium lit up. It was a man in a suit, with a featureless white head, or a mask with no holes over his head. Horizontal lines cut across the screen like static, blurring the figure.\n\n \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said the voice, the voice of Pastor Westboro, \"do not try to leave the Sanctuary. If any of its doors are opened, bombs will go off, killing every person inside. All of you. If anyone tries to come in from outside, if any window or door is opened, the bombs will explode. This is being heard over KXTC and KSTD, as well as in the Sanctuary.\"\n\n Indeed, the signals on KXTC and KSTD were being jammed and overwhelmed by another signal, both TV and radio signals being so affected. The entire Town and County would be witness to the Consultant of Crime's grand scheme...\n\n \"Everyone,\" boomed a voice over the loudspeaker, \"please remain calm and in your seats.\" The voice was Mrs. Veasley's, having anticipated this and now moving to the front of the Sanctuary. Her reason for asking Cindy for the microphone was now understood. Cindy realized she was about to get a huge lesson in leadership...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n \"I heard you followed the advice to take helicopter flying lessons.\" said Pastor Raymond Westboro as I came up to him, next to the Bell 47-OH-13. \"That's fortunate. I will now tell you the only way you can save the two thousand people inside the Church.\"\n\n \"And what is that?\" I asked skeptically, tapping my red crowbar in my hand. It was the crowbar forged from the metal that had exterminated Jonas Oldeeds. Only this crowbar could be here for this day.\n\n \"You will take off in this helicopter and achieve an altitude of 500 feet.\" said Westboro. \"If you do not do so within the next... eight minutes now... then the bombs inside the Church will explode. Once you reach 500 feet, if you come back below it, the bombs will go off.\"\n\n I looked at the helicopter, and I could see the powerful bomb in the tail assembly. The picture, and a bleak picture it was, began coming into focus.\n\n \"Yes.\" said Westboro, seeing the understanding in my face. \"You see that iPhone-like device on the front dash between the seats? The little circle button can read your fingerprint. Once you've attained 500 feet, you can place any finger on that button, and it will defuse the bombs in the church...\"\n\n \"...but the bomb in the helicopter will explode.\" I finished.\n\n \"Not much gets by you, Iron Crowbar.\" Westboro said with no small amount of sarcasm. \"So that's it. It's as I told you... you are going to kill yourself, or the bombs will go off. There is a timer on that device, so you only have a few minutes to stop the timer with your finger; otherwise, the bombs in the church will explode.\"\n\n \"Or I can kill you now, and find another way to get them all out.\" I said.\n\n \"I'm sooooo sorry, there's just not enough time.\" said Westboro. \"This chopper must be airborne in minutes, and you are the only one here who knows how to fly it. And no one else's fingerprint can defuse the bombs; even my own will not work to set the bombs off without a special code first... a code you will never get.\n\n Westboro continued: \"The headphones in the helicopter are transmitting the police band frequency, so you can hear the agony of your Brothers in Blue as they die and watch others die. By the way, you have nothing else to lose; your family is all dead now. I told you last night this would happen.\"\n\n I looked darkly at the man, the desire to kill him overwhelming me. \"I can kill you before I take off. In fact, why don't I...\" I advanced toward him. Two men suddenly sprang out behind him, guns aimed at me.\n\n \"No, I'm not going to play that game.\" said Westboro. \"I'm so tired of you, Commander. I gave you every chance, I told you what to do last night. You didn't do it. Ergo, our time is done. I win. You lose. Period. Now get on that helicopter and get it up there, or watch a lot of people die------\"\n\n Suddenly, the guards fell on their faces on the ground as bullets slammed into the backs of their heads. As Westboro began to realize what was happening, a .38 Special revolver slid up his neck until the barrel was stuck into his right earhole. Looking down and behind him, I saw the holder of that weapon. It was... \n\n ...my sister Elizabeth.\n\n \"Troy Family Airlines will be taking off from Gate 'Number Four'.\" said Elizabeth. \"You'll be aboard with my brother... Number Four. Gino, Marco, put the Pastor in the passenger seat, please.\"\n\n \"You treasonous bitch!\" growled Westboro, whose face betrayed his total shock at this turn of events. I was equally shocked; I had not known Elizabeth had come back, much less that she was going to do this.\n\n \"You know all about betraying your friends, don't you?\" said Elizabeth. \"Roland and Newton in jail. And blowing up a building with me and Karen in it... next time, you better be more sure. But I suspect there won't be a next time, will there? Boys, take him away.\"\n\n The two Italian men came up and grabbed Westboro, forcing him to the other side of the chopper. They put a chain around the base of the seat and handcuffed his hands to it between his legs so that he could not move his arms at all. A chain around the helicopter seat top held his neck in place so that he could not bend over. A headset with microphone was placed on his head.\n\n As I prepared to climb aboard, I looked at my sister and said \"Merci beaucoup, ma soeur.\"\n\n \"De rien. C'est moi qui vous remercie, mon petit fr\u00e8re.\" Elizabeth replied. I got in the chopper and started it up, putting the red crowbar on the floor to the left of my seat, near the door. A moment later, I took off, seeing her standing there, watching us.\n\n \"Godspeed to you, mon petit fr\u00e8re.\" Elizabeth said as the helicopter climbed into the air and turned east. Then she and her young men turned and disappeared under the oak trees at the back right of the Church grounds.\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n Thomas the courier's gun was leveled at Paulina Patterson's head. He did not see the shift in her eyes. As the gun was grabbed and his arm pulled up, she was ducking for cover... and to grab her baby.\n\n Thomas was disarmed and held in seconds. He looked up to see the rapper T-Square in his face. Behind the rapper was his 'Regiment', all wearing suits and ties and shades, and all of them carrying crowbars. Black crowbars.\n\n \"How did you?....\" Paulina asked.\n\n \"The I.C. said you were being a bit stubborn, Sister.\" said T-Square. \"He asked me to check on my niece's safety. Good thing; not much gets by the I.C. Okay, men, you know what to do.\" They took Thomas away, and would in time get the full story of his employment with the Consultant of Crime. Then they would complete the job.\n\n 'The Regiment' would show the would-be killer no mercy.\n\n Part 11 - Blue Crowbar Rising \n\n The screens came back on in the Sanctuary. At first it was just audio, and was set off by the altimeter in the helicopter. The Iron Crowbar had taken the chopper to 550 feet as he flew southeast.\n\n \"I am so sorry, my friends and Flock,\" said Westboro's voice, \"but I have had to make a little demonstration to you and to the Iron Crowbar about real power. Here is the story. Commander Troy is aboard a helicopter...\"\n\n The screens came on. A camera was behind the Iron Crowbar's right shoulder as he flew the plane. The right side of his head, the dash of instruments, and the iPhone-looking device were all visible. The passenger in the passenger seat was not visible.\n\n \"If Commander Troy simply presses the button on that iPhone-like pad, the bombs in the Church will be deactivated, you'll be allowed to walk right out of here. If he doesn't, or if he tries to land the helicopter... then every single one of you will die.\"\n\n People began to chat nervously, some crying out, some beginning to sob. Mrs. Veasley got on the microphone and said \"Stay strong, everyone. Be calm. We will find a way out of this...\"\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n \"Oh yes,\" said Pastor Westboro, with surprising and unnerving calm, \"the answer I promised you. Jesus did not have to forgive Judas Iscariot... because Jesus asked Judas to 'betray' Him. It was all a final ruse.\"\n\n \"That's my thesis, as well.\" I said. I could hear him in my headset, but our voices were not being transmitted anywhere.\n\n \"And speaking of treason,\" said Pastor Westboro, \"your sister is more treacherous than I gave her credit for. The way she talked about you, I never thought she'd have taken your side like that.\"\n\n I smiled. \"Funny thing about blood, wouldn't you say, Pastor? Like Selena Steele... and her blood. Particularly her blood mother's side of the family.\"\n\n \"I see.\" he said simply. \"You know all about that. My whore of a wife betrayed me, left me, and was impregnated by another man. Well, the Black Widow did not get that whore's daughter Selena, thanks to you... so I'll have to settle for knowing that Officer Pete Feeley is dead... because you were just too slow to save him.\"\n\n \"Yes, so I sped up my game.\" I said. \"Figured you out, I did.\" Our repart\u00e9e, taking shots at each other, were verbal blows designed to deliver emotional pain.\n\n I listened in on the Police radio in the headset. I couldn't talk to them, only listen. I heard that they were seeing me on the camera. I reached back and tore the camera out, heedless to whether it would set off the bomb on board. It didn't, and I opened the slit window and threw the camera out.\n\n \"What, you don't like being in Pictures, after all?\" sneered Westboro.\n\n \"Not for what is about to happen.\" I said.\n\n I headed for Cemetery Hill. As I'd presaged, it would be there that this final confrontation would be resolved. Reaching the spot where Roy Chen's body had been found, I turned the chopper to face the Town, seeing the sun hanging over the horizon in the west, the side of the mountain where the Cabin windows were sparkling in a strange gold color in the light...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n Cindy Ross and the people in the Church saw the video cut out, and they groaned. The doors did not open; the bombs were still active.\n\n \"Every door has a bomb and a transmitter on it.\" said the police radio. \"All doors and windows to the Chapel are also covered.\"",
        "\"The burglar alarm system is activated,\" said Myron Milton into the radio, \"and is tied into the bombs. If you open any window or outside door, it'll activate the detonators.\"\n\n \"Break! Break! Break!\" said Cindy Ross, from inside the Sanctuary. \"Clear this channel of all but the most essential communications. Keep looking for an entrance. And somebody tell me where the helicopter is.\"\n\n \"Helicopter last seen flying east-southeast, towards Cemetery Hill.\" said a voice on the radio.\n\n \"Stay away from that helicopter.\" said Captain Ross. \"We have no idea what might trigger the bombs, including our proximity to it. Stay west of University Avenue.\"\n\n \"I concur with that order.\" said Chief Moynahan into the radio. He'd just arrived at the scene...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n \"Sergeant Rudistan, Sergeant Rudistan!\" cried out two boys as they rushed up to him. They were Davie Marsdon and Timmy Austin.\n\n The Police had set up their command post on the northwest side of the Church, in the parking lot near the copse of trees, the Chapel to their dead east. They also had the entire Church ringed and College Street blocked off at University Avenue. They did not close University Avenue, but anyone who tried to stop was told to move along. Elm Street, which ran by the Chapel side of the compound, was also closed off.\n\n \"Not now, boys.\" said Rudistan. \"We've got an emergency here.\"\n\n \"But the Iron Crowbar told us to give you a message!\" said Davie Marsdon. That got Rudistan's interest.\n\n \"What is it, boys?\"\n\n \"We told the Iron Crowbar about our secret passage into the Church, and he told us to show you.\" said Davie. Suddenly, all of the Officers were interested.\n\n \"Yes, boys, show me!\" said Rudistan. The boys took him to the wall where the panel was. Rudistan checked carefully, then got on the radio.\n\n \"There's a panel here, which doesn't seem to be wired.\" Rudistan said. \"I'm going to try it. Two thousand souls held their breaths as Rudistan edged open the panel. Nothing happened as it opened up to one side. Rudistan looked inside, seeing the dirt of the ground.\n\n \"There's a big hole over there.\" said Davie, trying to get in and point at it. Rudistan went in first, then had Davie come show him. Rudistan pushed up the panels, again without incident.\n\n \"Okay boys, you've done very well.\" said Rudistan. \"But I'm going to have to ask you to stay in the safe zone with Officer Gunddottar.\" The boys reluctantly allowed Officer Inga Gundottar to escort them back to the safety of the command post. Soon, they were joined by Chief Moynahan, who said they could be his special guests as long as they stayed with him and stayed out of trouble. The boys eagerly agreed, and would get a front-row view of what was unfolding.\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n The hole was big enough for Rudistan to climb up. He found himself in the utility room, seeing the large heating unit. He turned on the light, then slowly opened the door. It was not wired to the alarm system nor to any bombs.\n\n \"I'm in!\" he said over the radio.\n\n \"Roger that.\" said Cindy. \"But all the doors to the Sanctuary are wired, even the ones from the Pastor's Study next door....\"\n\n And the she saw it.\n\n \"The baptismal pool!\" Cindy cried out, almost exultantly. Mrs. Veasley nodded approvingly as Cindy got on the radio. \"The baptismal pool! The baptismal pool! Rudistan, go to the second floor. There should be a bathroom or shower room with stairs leading down to the baptismal pool! Check for wires!\"\n\n People in the Sanctuary heard her, and chatter began. Two thousand pairs of eyes watched the pool in the back, behind the choir loft, and the door on the left side.\n\n A moment later, they heard the door open. The bright, mischievously smiling face of TCPD Sergeant Micah Rudistan looked in. \"Well, everyone, step right up!\" he said. \"It's time to be baptized again!\"\n\n The Consultant of Crime had overlooked two small things. Tiny slips, tiny slips indeed, which would allow hundreds to be saved.\n\n Everyone cheered at the sight of Rudistan, and people were about to rush up, when Mrs. Veasley got on the microphone!\"\n\n \"No one move!\" she ordered. No one moved, frozen by the power of her voice, and her will behind it.\n\n \"We will go in an orderly fashion.\" Mrs Veasley said into the microphone. \"Families with children first. In an orderly line, please.\"\n\n \"Women and children first!\" yelled someone.\n\n \"Oh, please!\" replied Mrs. Veasley. \"What good will the mother and child do if the breadwinning father is dead. Full families! Let's go... orderly but swiftly. Let's waste no time, please.\"\n\n Eight-year-old Susie Haskins, who was a distant relative of the late Scrawny Haskins, and her parents were in front, and came up first, a line forming behind them. Susie went up to Mrs. Veasley. \"Thank you, Mrs. Veasley.\" she said. \"See you on the outside!\"\n\n \"Go, child.\" Mrs. Veasley said. \"And do great things with your life.\"\n\n That started a strange ritual, as everyone came up to Mrs. Veasley on the way to the baptismal pool, which was drained and dry, by the way. She shook hands or held hands with everyone that walked by, giving them words of encouragement. Cindy watched in fascination.\n\n Then she wondered... what about the Iron Crowbar? Fear began to creep into her soul...\n\n And then she heard singing. As the congregation formed the orderly line to the baptismal pool, a song broke out, from Psalm 23:\n\n \"Surely goodness, and mercy, shall fol-low me, all the days, all the days of my life... and I shall dwell in the House of the Lord, forever, and I shall feast at the table spread for me...\"\n\n Part 12 - The Master Plan \n\n \"Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from Professor Moriarty he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion. \"I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain,\" he remarked. \"If my record were closed tonight I could still survey it with equanimity. The air of London is the sweeter for my presence .... Your memoirs will draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in Europe.\"\n\n------ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 'The Final Problem'.\n\n \"So, Pastor,\" I said, \"let's play no more games. Tell me the code to stop the bombs, all of them.\"\n\n \"No way I'd ever do that.\" said Westboro. \"And there's no way for you to make me.\"\n\n \"Ohhhh, I don't know about that.\" I said with a bit of emphasis. I reached into my trenchcoat and pulled out a small leather billfold. Inside were two syringes.\n\n \"Oh my God...\" Westboro whispered. He understood. At long last, he truly understood. \"You did not destroy those drugs, after all.\"\n\n \"I'm afraid not.\" I said. \"And you can take my word for it, and Steven Moschel's word, that they work very, very effectively. Now, are you going to give me the codes? Or will a demonstration be required?\"\n\n Westboro said nothing, as he willed himself to not feel fear. I took one of the syringes and uncapped the needle. Turning to the side, I pushed Westboro's head forward with my left hand, as much as I could before the chains stopped him from going further forward. Then I stabbed the needle into his upper back with my right hand. The amount I shot into Westboro was at least five times what I'd injected into Moschel.\n\n \"AAARRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!\" Westboro screamed. His whole body tensed and shook as he screamed. His eyes were bulging out, sweat beginning to pour from his skin everywhere, tears and mucus coming from his eyes and nose. \"AAAAAUUUUGGHH!\" he screamed again as the excruciating pain racked his body.\n\n I felt no sympathy. I thought of the dogs this man had tortured and killed. I thought of Pete Feeley. I thought of Amy, lying there dying, waiting for an organ that would never arrive... because this bastard had arranged for it to be stolen from her. Mercy was not in my blood at this moment; there was no forgiveness in my soul. The pain he was feeling was more than well deserved.\n\n And I had no intention of giving him the antidote.\n\n Westboro shook and screamed. And then, with a mental power that I considered unbelievable, he looked over at me, through the fire that was burning uncontrolled in his head and body.\n\n \"Yes...\" he gasped... \"Yes, as long as I am alive, you can make me tell you... as long as I'm alive... so therefore, I will see you in Hell, Iron Crowbar!\"\n\n I saw his tongue move in his cheek. Suddenly, the cabin of the helicopter was filled with an overpowering, pungent, almond-like aroma. I had to open the slit window and stick my nose out to get air, holding onto the stick to keep the helicopter up. \n\n Finally, the air cleared, and I looked over. His eyes were looking sightlessly at the top of the canopy, and the sky. His mouth was open and his tongue lolled out, and the remnants of the foam that had come out of his mouth were on his chin and shirt. He had had a cyanide capsule in his mouth all along, or he had one secreted in his teeth or something. Either way, it did not matter...\n\n Raymond Kyle Westboro, Head Pastor of First Baptist Church, Town & County Councilman... and the most insidiously evil and genius mind of our generation... was dead.\n\n My work was done. I looked at the timer on the device. Fifteen minutes to go...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n \"All units,\" said the Police radio, \"be advised that several witnesses saw Pastor Westboro being put on the helicopter with Commander Troy. They are both airborne, and the helicopter is northeast of Cemetery Hill.\"\n\n Oh my God, thought Cindy, how in the world did Don accomplish that? She saw Mrs. Veasley staring at her, a seeming smile on the woman's face. She felt the power of Mrs. Veasley's mind, and tried to use her own mind, to feel what was going on.\n\n \"Yes, Child, that's it...\" was all Mrs. Veasley said. But it was too chaotic, too much going on...\n\n \"Also,\" said the Police radio, \"be advised that Dr. Laura Fredricson was seen at University Hospital, bringing in a patient. Dr. Fredricson is alive.\" Cindy was stock-still, totally stunned at what she'd just heard.\n\n Oh my God, she thought to herself. It was a trick. Another trick by the Iron Crowbar and he didn't say a word to me. And Molly must be safe, as well. I am really going to beat that man down for this, for not telling me...\n\n Then she thought of the enormous difficulties that would have to be overcome to make that crowbar beatdown possible. But if anyone could do it, it would be Donald Troy. She had to trust in the Iron Crowbar and his latest hair-brained scheme...\n\n The line to the baptismal pool extended up the stairs, through the bathroom, down the hall, down the stairs, and to the utility room. Police Officers were helping people along the path, putting their lives on the line to help others. Other Police were having them move away from the Church, but many wouldn't leave completely.\n\n The Media was all over the place. Bettina Wurtzburg and Priya Ajmani were trying to get interviews and information. Cameras were set up everywhere, waiting for the bombs to go off.\n\n Commander Harlow set up a media tent and manned it herself, listening to radios and relaying information. Lt. Scott Peterson could not be found; he had not responded to phone calls nor texts.\n\n Inside the Sanctuary, Cindy watched the screen. A timer had appeared on the TV when it reached fifteen minutes, and a recorded voice said that it was the timer in the helicopter. It was now counting down, inexorably towards zero.\n\n \"How many people left?\" she heard Chief Moynahan's voice on the radio.\n\n \"About three hundred.\" Cindy replied. Mrs. Veasley looked over at her as she greeted the line of people moving by. Cindy just shook her head... it would not be enough time to get them all out...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n I looked at my surroundings. I saw that I could shunt the altimeter bomb; it was crudely set up, and a circuit around it would keep it from triggering the Church bombs. It would also delay the bomb behind me in the helicopter.\n\n I shot the remaining chemicals from the syringes out the window, and put the empty syringes near the motor and the bomb behind me. I kept the helicopter where it was, to make sure the signal to the Church was uninterrupted... if the connection broke down, the bombs at the Church would be triggered. \n\n I had already searched Westboro's pockets and clothing for any markings, any scrap of paper that might clue me in to a way to survive this... nothing. There was no way out.\n\n I saw the clock tick down... five minutes to go...\n\n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n Less than 200 people left. There was a backup in the hallway and Fellowship Hall, though. They weren't going to make it.\n\n \"Any word on Lieutenant Croyle?\" Cindy said into the radio.\n\n \"Roger that, Captain, Lt. Croyle has come out of surgery and is expected to fully recover.\" said someone into the radio.\n\n Relief swept through Cindy's soul. \"Roger that.\" She then said what she knew had to be said: \"If I don't make it out of here, someone tell her that I love her. And tell my sister and my mother, too.\"\n\n \"You can tell them that yourself, Captain.\" growled another voice... the voice of Chief Griswold. \"You'll get out of there with the rest of them.\" Even with everything on a knife's edge, Chief Griswold was there, keeping calm and keeping everyone else calm, and focused.\n\n \"I love you too, Chief Griswold.\" Cindy said into the radio.\n\n \"He's right.\" said Mrs. Veasley. \"Believe that you will make it, and you will.\"\n\n \"Maybe.\" said Cindy. \"But I'll be the last one out of here... and that includes you, Mrs. Veasley.\n\n Mrs. Veasley had refused to allow anyone to remove her from her post. She had sat there, greeting everyone, calming the children, encouraging everyone. Cindy could not help but admire Mrs. Veasley's fortitude, and drew strength from it.\n\n Now how to get the Iron Crowbar out of that frickin' helicopter without killing anyone, Cindy thought. Damn, that was one insidious trap the Consultant had put him in... and knowing Don... he just walked into it...\n\n Oh my God, she thought to herself, realizing it... he did just walk into it. On purpose. He knew all along... hell, he's had to have known for months!... and he went right into it...\n\n Part 13 - The Totality of Self-Sacrifice \n\n I heard the police radio say that there was not enough time to get them all out. Cindy had tried, and she'd done a damn good job somehow. Most of them would live, but not all... if I did not do my duty.\n\n As the clock ticked down to less than three minutes, I thought of my life. I could not complain. I thought of my mother, my 'Mycroft', who would keep Cindy and Teresa and the rest in line and on the right path. I thought of my father, and that I'd avenged his death, as well.\n\n My heart felt happy but heavy as I thought of my wonderful wife Laura, the fantastic children she had given me... yes, they were alive, of course that had all been a trick to save their lives... Molly and the boys, Ross and Ian. Bowser and Buddy. No man could have a better family...\n\n There was Dr. Eckhart, a very great and kind man to so many people. All my Detectives, good people that would keep fighting the evil that constantly seeks to destroy us. Rudistan, and all the Uniformed Officers that I did not thank enough...\n\n I thought of Tanya and baby Pete, and the price they'd paid. I'd avenged Officer Pete Feeley's murder; the Consultant of Crime was dead. Tanya would raise her son, and they would go on to honor Corporal Feeley with their lives' work.\n\n I thought of Teresa Croyle, and remembered how I'd defended her, knowing that she had a Warrior Spirit in her that would prevail.. and it had. I knew she wasn't marrying Todd because of the nepotism laws; as my niece-in-law, she couldn't work for me... that obstacle was soon to be removed. I hoped she'd find peace and happiness, not just in her work but in her life.\n\n Chief Griswold... like a second father to me. He'd brought me in to defeat this insidious man who now was sitting dead next to me. I had done my best to honor the Chief's trust in me, and to rid his Town & County of insidious Evil. In that, I had succeeded.\n\n And Cindy. I began getting emotional as I thought of Cindy. No better partner, no better friend, could I possibly have had fighting this battle with me. And no better person to take over the mantle of Command than her. I'd brought her and her blood father together; she would learn from him. She would be okay. She would fight on.\n\n I looked down at the Cemetery below as the sun settled down to the horizon. I could swear I was seeing people looking up at me. I saw Pete Feeley in his uniform, and Dr. Heinz, and Amy, and the police dog Laika. \n\n And then, coming up from behind them, I saw Angela Harlan looking up at me, wearing a black, spidery negligee and high heels. Somehow, I could feel her looking up at me more closely than the others... waiting for me to join her in Death. All their deaths, caused by the evil of the Consultant of Crime, were now accounted for, and avenged.\n\n One minute to go... I thought of my kids again; I wanted my last thoughts to be of them. Carole would not have me walking her down the aisle at her wedding, but she would make that walk. Jim would grow up into a great man; I wouldn't be there for him, but he would grow up, and in a better world now.\n\n Last, I thought of Takaki Taichi, and the totality of his sacrifice. I had hoped then that my death would be as honorable as his... it would be, I knew.\n\n Fifteen seconds to go. I took one last look at my Town. A strange euphoria came over me. No, it was not too hard, I realized.\n\n The timer struck \"00:10\" as I reached out and pressed my finger to the button. I saw my name 'Donald Troy' flash on the screen, then the whole screen flashed bright green"
