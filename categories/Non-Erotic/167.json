        "Edited by the incomparable \"Wires\". His assistance improves my work drastically. I appreciate all he does for me.\n\nJason Lowery IV moved quietly down the hallway that connected 'the children's wing' to the rest of the house. He snorted when he thought that. Both of his parents liked to put on 'airs' as his grandmother called it. They did live in a somewhat nicer house than some but it was still a house, not a mansion. It had a split bedroom design with the master on one end of the house and the other three bedrooms on the other side. His parents always made out as if the house was much more pretentious than it actually was. After all, they were the city's (actually a small town of just over 10,000) bankers.\n\nJason was dressed in old faded jeans and a threadbare blue chambray shirt. His athletic shoes showed signs of hard use and age. Just as he reached the door to his sister's room he heard the door thump and the lock clicked. He froze a moment in fear of discovery. He was just about ready to run for it when he heard his sister Chastity say, \"Wait Tiff. I don't like this gown either. Can you help me find something else to wear?\"\n\nTiffany sighed and pushed the door until he heard the latch catch once again. He heard steps moving away from the door deeper into Chastity's room as Tiffany said, \"Come on Chas, you look fantastic in that outfit. You'll knock them dead in it. We've tried almost all our gowns on already. We're going to be more than fashionably late if you keep dithering around. What's the problem anyway?\"\n\n\"I just want everything to be perfect. Donald's going to be there and I want to make the right impression. He's not dating anyone since he and Amber broke up. I need to snare him before those other bitches get their claws in him.\"\n\nTiffany laughed and said, \"Oh, take it from me sis. When he sees you he'll never notice anyone else. All you have to do is play your cards right; maybe show a little tit or thigh, and you've got him in the bag. Now come on, let's go.\"\n\nJason was moving once again as his sisters discussed their dress. He barely heard the end of the conversation and knew he had to exit the hallway fast or they would come out of and catch him before he got away. He had to be out of sight when they and his parents made it into the main part of the house. He was supposed to accompany them to the Country Club for a dance and that was the last thing he wanted to do. His dad and mom were always trying to fix him up with the daughter of one of their friends or business acquaintances and, frankly, none of those bitches interested him in the least.\n\nWhen he got to the end of the passageway he slowed down even more. He was almost creeping by the time he got to the end of the hallway. He stopped and strained his ears for the slightest sound but heard nothing. Quietly, carefully, he moved so he could see into the main part of the house. He saw no one; nor did he hear a sound indicative of anyone's presence. He heaved a silent sigh of relief and moved like a wraith toward the door that would take him first into the large lavishly decorated dining room and, ultimately, the kitchen of his parent's huge home. \n\nJason knew he would catch hell when everyone got home that night but he just didn't care. If he was lucky he might put off the ass chewing until Saturday morning but he was sure he would receive one. His father had his life planned out for him and refused to consider what Jason wanted. His father had selected his college, his course of study, and was even trying to select his girlfriends and future wife. Jason did want to go to college but he had no desire to study business and finance. His father insisted on that because he intended for Jason to take over the family business. The family owned a chain of three small banks. His father was president of the holding company, and his grandfather was the chairman of the board. Other family members worked in various positions in the holding company or one of the individual banks. At least gramps wasn't a total asshole about Jason's future like his father was. Gramps said there was a position in the company for Jason if he wanted one but he didn't insist Jason go into the business.\n\nJason managed to move through the dining room and kitchen without getting caught. He closed the outside door and moved rapidly toward his old Ranger FX4 and freedom for another night. He had a date, just not with a girl his father would approve of. Oh, there was nothing wrong with Jody except her parents had no money or social standing in the town so she wasn't 'right' for Jason.\n\nJust as Jason started his truck his father came boiling out of the house. He could hear him yelling as he drove down the driveway. \"Jason,\" he screamed. \"Get your ass back here right now. I told you you're supposed to meet Melissa Tamerlain at the club this evening.\"\n\nJason continued driving as his father yelled but he didn't slow down. He had escaped and wasn't about to return for a confrontation or to accompany the family to the club. He could see his father in his rear view mirror. He was still yelling and his face was red.\n\nTen minutes later Jason pulled up in front of Jody Franke's home. He jumped from the truck and went to the door to collect her for their date. When he rang the bell Jody opened the door. Her father was standing behind her with his hand on her shoulder. He glared at Jason but stepped back when Jody asked him to come into their house. Jason entered the nicely decorated home and followed Jody into the living room. He saw her mother sitting on the couch and said hello to her. \n\nJody's father followed them into the room and took a seat in the chair he normally used. Mr. Franke sat looking at Jason for a moment then sighed. He said, \"Jason, this has gone on long enough. I don't want you seeing Jody any more. I don't know where you get off thinking you can treat girls like you do, but I do know I'm not going to let you treat my daughter this way.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir? I've always treated Jody like a lady. I don't understand.\"\n\nJody took his hand just as her father answered. He said, \"I've just been on the phone with your father son. He told me what you've done to these girls and I just don't approve. Just how did you plan to manage two dates for the same evening anyway? He says you have a date with Melissa Tamerlain as well as Jody here. What were you thinking? Well, it doesn't matter what you were thinking. You need to go on home and dress for your other date. We don't want to see you hanging around Jody again.\"\n\n\"Daddy, it's not like that. Jason doesn't-\" \n\nHer father cut her off saying, \"Yes, it is like that. Mr. Lowery told me Melissa was supposed to meet Jason at their club this evening at 8:00 p.m. for the dance. I suppose Jason was going to be with you for a while, then dump you and go to his other date. Well, that just doesn't cut it here.\"\n\n\"Sir, that's-\"\n\nMr. Franke interrupted Jason and said, \"That's enough. You need to leave now.\"\n\nJody was crying and said, \"No, Daddy, Jason told me about this. It's not what you think. His father wants him to date Melissa and made the date for him. He and I have always planned to go out together tonight. His father is trying to break us up because he thinks I'm not good enough for Jason.\"\n\nJason said, \"That's right, sir. I don't have two dates tonight. I only have the one with Jody here.\"\n\nMr. Franke sighed and said, \"Well, that's not the story your father told me. Be that as it may, he doesn't want you dating Jody and I'm not going to be responsible for trouble in your family and I certainly don't need your family angry with me. I do too much business with your banks to take a chance by angering your father. Now, you need to leave son.\"\n\nA crying Jody saw Jason to the door. She stepped outside with him and gave him a hug and kiss before she disappeared into her house. Jason stomped down the walk to his truck. As he drove away he thought he saw his parent's car turn onto the street down the block. Jason spent the rest of the night driving around hanging with his friends. It was almost three a.m. when he returned home.\n\nWhen Jason entered the house his father met him at the door. He grabbed his arm and pulled him the rest of the way into the house and down the hallway to his office. He pushed Jason onto the couch and stood in front of him breathing heavily. \"This is the last straw young man. Give me your keys. You're grounded until you decide to obey me. Your graduation ceremony is in two weeks. You will escort Melissa to the graduation and festivities associated with it. You will work in the bank this summer before you go to college and you will take the courses we have agreed on. If you don't, you are finished here. I'll stop the money and you can find a way to support yourself. Do I make myself clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. Goodnight, father,\" Jason said as he got up and headed for his bedroom.\n\nJason undressed and climbed into bed but he didn't sleep well. He was furious with his father and had trouble getting to sleep. He woke several times throughout the night thinking about his overbearing father. The last time he woke it was nearly 6:30 a.m. He was still trying to return to sleep when he heard his father up and moving around shortly after seven a.m. His father had an early tee time at the club and was off to play his golf and \"network\" as he called it with his cronies. He wouldn't be home until late afternoon and he would probably be three sheets to the wind, in other words, nearly drunk. It was a good thing his father was a big duck in the little puddle. The local police never seemed to 'see' him driving drunk.\n\nAs soon as his father left, Jason got out of bed and began packing. He decided he was done here. He took everything important to him and loaded it into his truck. He didn't worry about being caught. He knew from past experience his father wouldn't be back until late afternoon and his siblings and mother would sleep until nearly noon.\n\nThankfully, he was over 18 and through with high school so he could strike out on his own. He drove out of town headed for his refuge. His grandfather had a huge older house on 20 acres about six miles out of town on the shore of one of the largest lakes in the area. Jason loved the old place and had many happy memories of time spent there. After his grandmother died several years ago, grandfather closed the place up and moved to a small condo in the town's most swanky senior complex. The old place was slowly deteriorating from neglect and the elements as well as from occasional vandalism.\n\nJason moved into the small boathouse. He had kept it in good repair over the years because he and his grandfather still came out for some weekends to fish and hang together. As far as possible, he relaxed and tried to forget the last few hours of his life. No matter what he did, however, the memory of what went on remained, as did his fury. He slept fitfully Saturday night and was awake and moving shortly after sun up. He took his soap and a towel and walked down into the lake for a quick bath. Returning, he dressed in some of his better clothes. He piddled around the rest of the day and again slept poorly Sunday night.\n\nOn Monday morning, Jason hit the golden arches for a quick, cheap breakfast then headed for the Navy Recruiting office. When he entered, the recruiter smiled and stood up. He held his hand out and said, \"Good to see you again, Jason. What can I do for you today? You ready to sign up now?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I think I'm ready to do it. If you still have the papers lets get it done. I've had all I can take around here.\"\n\n\"Fine. Great. Come on back and we'll finish everything. You still interested in the Engineman specialty? There's still a nice enlistment bonus for that rate.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" Jason spent the remainder of the morning signing papers and talking to the recruiters. He had cut school and completed the necessary testing, physicals and so forth several days before so now, all he had to do was sign the final documents and await orders to ship out.\n\nWhile he waited on orders to ship out, Jason did odd jobs around town to make ends meet. He never spoke to his parents again. The night before he left he drove his truck to his grandfather's home to get permission to store it in the garage on the out of town acreage. When he found out why Jason wanted to use the garage, his grandfather asked, \"You sure about this, son? I can probably get you out of it if you want me to. I knew your daddy was being an ass about things but I would hate to think he ran you off. I'll miss you, boy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure, gramps. I can't afford to pay for college on my own and dad says I either go where he wants me to go and study finance or he won't pay. He's trying to make me date his friends daughters instead of who I want to date, and he's trying to control my entire life. Yeah, I'm sure about this.\"\n\n\"I knew things were bad between you but I'm sorry it came to this.\" The old man hugged his grandson, stepped back and said, \"Yeah, you can leave your truck out at the country place. You be careful now, boy, and you stay in touch.\"\n\nThe next years went past rapidly. Jason did well in his specialty and enjoyed the work immensely. Of course, the tour of the world didn't hurt, either. Jason kept in touch with his grandfather by mail and phone until, in the beginning of the third year of his enlistment, e-mail and snail mail stopped coming. His grandfather didn't answer his phone. Finally, the last paper mail Jason sent his grandfather came back stamped \"Deceased, return to sender\". His family had not even told him when his own grandfather passed away.\n\nThe evening he received the returned letter Jason found himself in a bar just outside the gates for the Pearl Harbor Navy Base. He was just barely 21 years old and now had no one in his life. Finally, he couldn't put it off any longer. He had to piss like a racehorse as the saying goes. He knocked back the last of his drink and staggered toward the restrooms. He bounced off several chairs and tables as he made his way through the room leaving several angry people in his wake.\n\nAfter he finished pissing--most of which missed the urinal--he turned to stagger out of the restroom. He barged through the door and slammed into a large man standing there. As he was falling, he recognized the man and felt fear. It was his Chief from the ship and he did not look happy.\n\nThe Chief (actually a Master Chief Petty Officer, the senior enlisted rank in the U. S. Navy) reached down to help him stand. As he lifted Jason the Chief said, \"Petty Officer (PO) Lowery, you're a disgrace to the Navy. I'm ashamed to even call you one of ours. Get on your feet. I'm going to get your ass out of here before you make another mistake. I like a drink as well as the next man but drinking like you have tonight is just plain dumb as well as dangerous. Do you have a tab we need to take care of before we go?\"\n\nJason stood swaying as he thought about the Chief's question. Finally, in exasperation, the Chief said, \"Never mind. Come with me.\" He turned and pulled Jason with him toward Jason's old spot at the bar.\n\nWhen they got to Jason's spot the Chief signaled the bartender over and asked, \"Does he have a tab we need to clear up? I'm getting him out of here before he does something else stupid.\"\n\n\"Naw, he's been paying as he goes. Don't be too rough on him, Hank, he's had a hell of a life from the sound of things. He's a regular here just like you are, and normally he's not a problem. I don't know what set him off tonight. I haven't had time to talk with him.\"\n\n\"Ok, thanks.\" Hank turned toward the door and pulled Jason along with him. As they walked the Chief said, \"I ought to write you up for this and I still may. I can't take you back to the ship like this or you would be written up for sure. Shit. Come on, get in the car. I'll take you home with me.\"\n\nJason was asleep when they reached the gate onto base. He didn't even rouse when the Chief pushed and rolled him around to get his wallet so he could show the guard his identification card. After they got on post the Chief drove into the residential section and pulled up in front of his home. \n\nJason was still out of it and the Chief had to carry him into the house. His wife, Wendi met them at the door. She looked at her husband and Jason before she said, \"What are you doing home so early? I thought you were at a Hail and Farewell tonight. Who do you have here?\"\n\n\"I was at a Hail and Farewell, but Jonsey wanted to stop off for one after it ended. We hit the Shack and I found Petty Officer Lowery there. He's one of mine and, as you can tell, he wasn't in any condition to take care of himself so I brought him home with me. Mac says he's a regular and doesn't usually get in this condition. He said Petty Officer Lowery here had some problem and really tied one on tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, bring him on. We'll put him in Sue's room tonight. She's staying with Norma tonight after the dance.\" Hank carried Jason down the hallway and into his oldest daughter's bedroom. He, none too gently, put Jason on the bed. He and Wendi removed Jason's shoes and pulled his pants off leaving him in his underwear.\n\nThe next morning Hank and Wendi were sitting on the back porch with their coffee when they heard a loud scream coming from inside the house. They quickly set their coffee down and rushed into the house and down the hallway. They found their daughter Sue standing in the doorway of her bedroom staring at a confused Jason. He was sitting on the side of the bed looking around the room while Sue yelled, \"Who the hell are you and why are you in my bed? And where's your clothes?\"\n\nJason flushed and stammered, \"Don't know and don't know. Who are you? Where are we anyway?\"\n\nHank pushed Sue aside and stepped into the room. As he moved past Sue he said, \"Quiet, honey. We'll explain later.\"\n\nJason saw him and muttered, \"Oh, shit.\" He swallowed visibly and continued, \"Master Chief, what are you doing here? And where exactly is here, anyway? How did I get here?\"\n\n\"You are in my quarters, Petty Officer Lowery. I brought you home with me last night after your disgusting display at the Shack. Mac says you don't usually get as shitfaced as I found you last night. Why don't you tell me why you were acting like you were yesterday before I decide whether I am going to write you up or not?\"\n\n\"Crap. You'd just as well write me up. That would be just a perfect ending to a perfect week.\"\n\n\"WHAT? You want me to write you up? Is that it?\"\n\n\"No, but I figure you will. I suppose you didn't get your nick name for nothing.\"\n\n\"What...\" Hank laughed and said, \"Oh, yeah. They still call me Hard Ass Hank don't they? Now, talk. Tell me why you made a spectacle of yourself and why I shouldn't write you up.\"\n\nJason spent the next few minutes explaining why he was so upset he tied one on and how he came to even be in the navy. After he wound down Hank said, \"Damn, that's cold. No one even told you your grandfather was sick or died? What about your family for God's sake?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Like I said, I haven't heard from them since just before I got out of high school. Gramps and I kept in touch until earlier this spring when it all stopped. I don't even know when he died or got sick or whatever.\"\n\nHank sighed and said, \"Crap, that sucks. Ok, Petty Officer Lowery. I'll let this go this time. If I find out you've been blowing smoke up my ass or if you ever disgrace the Navy like this again, I'll drop the hammer on you for sure. Now, get your clothes on and come out back. We'll have coffee, then we'll have some breakfast before I take you back to the ship.\"\n\nThe Master Chief and his wife turned away and headed for the back patio and their, by now, cold coffee. Sue remained standing just inside her room watching Jason. Finally, he said, \"Do you mind? Your dad told me to get dressed and come out to where he is.\"",
        "Sue sort of blushed and replied, \"So, get dressed. You're the one in MY room half naked.\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm not the one who chose to be here.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, too. I shouldn't tease you like that. If it bothers you that much, I'll turn my back.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Almost before Sue's back was turned Jason had his jeans on and up. He sat back on the edge of the bed and quickly put his shoes on. \n\nSue heard him pulling his jeans up and doing the belt so she turned back to face him. \"I'm sorry about your grandpa, and it really sucks about your family. I don't know what I'd do without my family. Come on. Let's get some coffee before Dad drinks it all. You know what Chief's are like when there's booze or coffee around. I swear I don't know why Dad doesn't walk around with a permanent crook in his finger from holding onto the handle of a coffee cup.\"\n\nJason laughed and said, \"Yeah, I know what you mean. You almost never see a senior Petty Officer without a coffee cup in their hand or nearby. I'm sorry I upset you earlier.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's nothing I haven't seen before. When I was young Dad was always bringing someone home and letting them use one of us kids beds while we got to sleep on the couch or floor. At least I had a bed last night.\"\n\n\"Well, I AM sorry.\"\n\nJason and Sue moved quickly down the hallway and into the kitchen. She poured them each a large mug of coffee and led the way out the back door to the patio. They found chairs and just sat quietly for a few moments looking out across the beach to the rolling waves.\n\nHank finally looked over at Jason and said, \"Do we need to get you some emergency leave so you can go home?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I mean, how long has he been gone. I'm sure I missed the service and I sure don't want to go back and see the 'rents. I didn't want to before and I sure don't now.\"\n\n\"What are your plans now, PO? If I remember correctly you only have a few months left on your enlistment. You going to reenlist or get out?\"\n\n\"You know, I'm not sure. I like the Navy fine, but I'm not sure I want to make it a career. I don't know what I'd do if I get out, either. I've managed to get some college credits the last three years but I have a long way to go for a degree even if I knew what I wanted the degree in. All I know now is what I DON'T want the degree in.\"\n\n\"Well, you need to decide soon. I think there's a small reenlistment bonus for your rate if you go that route. I can't advise you about jobs on civvy street though. How many hours do you have in college?\"\n\n\"After this semester ends I'll have enough credits for a two year degree. I'll have almost all my general education subjects out of the way.\"\n\nSue broke into the conversation saying, \"Cool. I'm going to the University of Hawaii studying Hotel and Restaurant Management. I'll get my AA degree this semester, too. Where are you going?\"\n\n\"University of Hawaii also, but I attend the classes they have on base or do it on the web. I almost never make it to the campus.\"\n\nSoon, the women went inside to make breakfast. While they were waiting on the food Jason and the Master Chief continued talking. To Jason's surprise he found himself liking the Master Chief immensely. He wished his father were as neat as was Sue's.\n\nDuring breakfast Sue asked if she could use the car so she and her friends could go to one of the local beaches. Her father said, \"No, I don't think so honey. I need to take Jason back to the ship and your mother needs the other car this morning.\"\n\nJason said, \"Hey, there's no problem here. I'll just walk or get a cab. I don't want to put you out any farther than I have.\"\n\nSue looked at Jason a moment before smiling. She said, \"Why don't you let me take Jason back to the ship so I can use the car after? Or did you need to go in and work today, too?\"\n\n\"No, I'm just going to hit the golf course this morning. I suppose I can have someone pick me up if you want to take Petty Officer Lowery back to the ship.\"\n\n\"Cool, thanks Daddy. Are you about ready to go, Jason?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah, sure,\" Jason said. He looked at the Master Chief and Wendi before continuing, \"Thanks for taking care of me last night and for the breakfast. I appreciate it. I hope I wasn't any trouble. I was having a rough time of things and really appreciate all you've done.\"\n\n\"That's fine, Jason, but don't make a habit of it. Remember what I said.\" The Master Chief smiled and continued, \"Now, you two get outta here.\"\n\nSue jumped up and grabbed Jason's hand. She said, \"Come on. I want to get to the beach before all the good spots are gone.\" When she realized she was holding Jason's hand she blushed and dropped it quickly. Jason followed her out the door and to the car.\n\nAs they drove the two young people talked. They talked about Jason's home, his family and college as well as their dreams. When she pulled up at the gate onto the pier where the ship was moored, Sue said, \"This has been fun. You don't have to work or have the duty or anything today do you? If you don't, why don't you come to the beach with us? I know you'd like it.\"\n\n\"Uh, I don't know. I mean, what would your father think about that?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about Daddy. I'm free and over 21. He can't say much, anyway.\"\n\n\"To you maybe, but he's my boss. I don't want to make him any more upset with me than he is now.\"\n\n\"Oh, poo. Don't worry about it. Come on. It'll be fun.\"\n\nJason finally agreed and went with Sue. To his surprise, her friends were way cool and they had a great time on the beach. They went to a place mostly used by local residents. The beach was really great without all the tourists and drunken military people he usually had to share a beach with. Besides, he was with a really nice, really beautiful woman.\n\nWhen she dropped Jason off at his ship that evening he found he didn't want to get out of the car. Not only had he been starved for female companionship the last three years, but he found Sue to be a fun, neat person. Oh, sure, like many sailors Jason had his share of bar girls and whores, but he did miss going out with nice girls. He turned slightly toward Sue and said, \"Thanks, Sue. I really had a great time today. I forgot how much fun it was to just hang with friends and swim or talk like we did today. I've never been much of one to hit the clubs or get shitfaced. You and your friends were great. I don't suppose you would go out with me sometime, would you?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Sue said with a smile. \"Just when is this sometime you're thinking about?\"\n\n\"Oh, uh, maybe next weekend? No, wait, I have the duty next weekend. How about the Friday after?\"\n\nSue smiled and said, \"I think that can be arranged.\"\n\n\"Great, I'll be there. Uh, I don't know about wheels. Oh, heck, I'll rent a car or borrow one from someone.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll just use Daddy's or Mother's car. How about if I pick you up about five here at the ship.\"\n\n\"Cool. You sure your parent's won't care?\"\n\nSue smiled and said, \"Yeah, I'm sure.\" She rummaged around in her bag and pulled her phone out. She said, \"What's your number?\"\n\nAfter Jason gave her his number, she sent him a text reminding him of their date. She smiled and said, \"Now, you have my number and if you get real bored you can call me, huh?\"\n\nTheir next date went well. They hit a local burger joint for their meal then went to the bowling alley on base and bowled several lines. After they finished bowling they drove down beside the beach and just walked and talked for several minutes before they headed back to Jason's ship.\n\nAt the ship, after he got to the gate onto the pier Jason stopped and turned to Sue. He placed his hands on each of her hips and looked deeply into her eyes. He said, \"This was great. Thank you for going out with me. You know, I'm not ready for the night to end. Can we do this again next week?\"\n\n\"I'm not ready to go, either, but we need to. It's almost 2:30 a.m. and the parental units will be worried if I don't get home soon. We're going to the beach again tomorrow. You want to come with?\"\n\nJason smiled and said, \"Yeah, that'd be great. Will you pick me up again?\"\n\n\"Sure. Say about 11:00?\"\n\n\"It's a date. Night.\"\n\nJason and Sue dated steadily for the next five months. They were spending more and more time together. They were now seeing each other at least three days a week and talked on the phone almost daily. Jason had quickly become one of Sue's \"gang\". He now had friends outside the navy. Some of the group Sue hung with were other military brats, some were locals, and one was even from the mainland going to college in Hawaii. He felt as if he belonged again.\n\nJason was doing well in his job, also. His happiness spilled over into his work life and he did better because of it. He took the test for advancement to Petty Officer second-class and passed it with a very high score. If things went well he could be promoted soon; maybe even on the next list. Things couldn't be better for a change.\n\nOn their by now carved in stone Friday night date, Jason wanted to do something special for Sue. He also wanted to celebrate his promotion so he convinced her to go to one of the more upscale restaurants. They arrived somewhat early for their reservation. After giving the ma\u00eetre de their name, they went to the outside beer garden to wait for their table.\n\nBefore taking a seat at an open table, Jason moved to Sue, gathered her into his arms and gave her a deep sensual kiss. She was grinding her crotch against the huge bulge he had in his pants when they heard a voice that struck fear into each of them. \"Sue, what the hell are you doing here? Well, well, well, if it isn't Petty Officer Lowery. So this is why you've been so happy the last few months is it? You've been chasing my daughter.\"\n\nWhen he heard the voice Jason quickly pulled away from Sue. He turned to see Master Chief Swartz standing behind him with Sue's mother, Wendi, and another of the Chief's from the ship and, he assumed, his wife. \"Oh, shit,\" he whispered.\n\nSue reached out and took Jason's hand before she said, \"Oh, Daddy, be nice.\"\n\nThe Master Chief glared at the young couple with a stern look on his face. Finally Wendi broke into a smile and poked him in the side. She said, \"Oh, stop it, Hank. Don't pick on the poor boy. Don't you think you've scared him enough?\"\n\nThe four older adults broke into loud laughter. After the laughter died down, Master Chief asked, \"So, how long has this been going on between you two?\"\n\nJason glanced at Sue, straightened, and looked the Master Chief in the eyes. He said, \"Pretty much since you put me to bed in her room, Master Chief.\"\n\nThe other Chief (a Senior Chief or E-8) laughed and said to Hank, \"What, you that worried about marrying her off, Hank? You shanghai sailors and dump them in your daughter's bed? I have to tell this one in the Chief's mess tomorrow. Hell, I never thought you would just dump one of your sailors into her bed like that though. Looks like it worked though, didn't it? Maybe I should try that with my daughter. Get rid of her and I'll have more room in the house.\"\n\nBy then, Jason looked as if he wanted to crawl under a rock and hide while Sue's super red face looked as if she could cook on it.\n\nWendi slapped the Senior Chief on the arm, \"You behave yourself, too, Tom. Weren't you young and in love before?\" She looked at Jason and said, \"Just ignore them, Jason. Their bark's worse than their bite.\"\n\n\"Uhhh, I don't know about that. I mean, I have to work for them and...\" Jason was interrupted when his pager went off. He pulled it from his pocket and quickly taking the opportunity said, \"Excuse us, we have to go. Our table's ready.\"\n\nHank smiled and said, \"Hey, no problem. We'll just come in with you and have them pull our table next to yours. We have reservations too.\" Hank and the other chief laughed loudly after he said that.\n\nJason stood in shock, his mouth hanging open as he tried to find something to say. \n\nSue looked at her father and said, \"Daddy, don't you dare!\" She grabbed Jason's arm and turned toward the door the ma\u00eetre de was holding open for them. \n\nThey heard a slap and Wendi said, \"Hank, I told you to behave yourself. Now leave the kids alone.\"\n\nThe young couple had just taken their seats when they saw Sue's parents and guests being led to a table two down from the one they were seated at. When Jason saw that he felt a knot form in his stomach and he muttered, \"Shit.\"\n\nSue heard him and placed her hand on his forearm before she said, \"Relax, Jason. That was just Daddy being Daddy. He doesn't mean anything by it. He was just doing his version of humor.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understood that. It's just that I was going to ask you to marry me this evening and I don't need him here...\"\n\nSue broke in on Jason's line and almost screamed, \"What? You were? I mean, yes, uh, was that for real a proposal or...\"\n\nJason felt his stomach lurch. His eyes flickered rapidly from the table where he had been looking, to Sue's face then across to her parent's table before they flicked back to Sue. \"Shit,\" he said. \"I can't believe I said that out loud. I...\"\n\nSue broke in once again, \"What do you mean? You mean you don't want to get married or...\"\n\nThis time it was Jason who broke into the sentence. He said, \"Yes! I do. It's not that. I mean, I just wanted this to be perfect for you. We could celebrate my promotion and getting engaged here alone, and now... Oh, hell, I don't know what I mean. I've totally messed it up now haven't I?\"\n\nSue reached out and touched Jason's forearm again as she quietly said, \"Hush. You haven't messed anything up. Especially if you mean it.\"\n\nJason didn't notice Sue's parents and their friend's stares. He was looking intently at Sue as he reached into his pocket and pulled an engagement ring from it. He opened the box and held the ring out toward Sue as he spoke. \"I really did mean it, Sue. I love you and want to marry you. I just wanted it to be special for you when I asked and now I've screwed it all up.\"\n\nSue put the ring on her finger, looked at it proudly then leaned over and kissed Jason deeply. When she pulled back people at the tables nearby were smiling and began clapping. When Jason became aware of his surroundings once again he saw Wendi holding Sue's hand as she admired the ring. The Master Chief stood beside her glaring at Jason and the other couple stood nearby.\n\nThe Master Chief looked at Jason solemnly and said, \"I think we need to talk tomorrow, son.\"\n\nJason felt a surge of fear but he looked Hank in the eye and said, \"Whatever you think, Master Chief, but you need to know I love your daughter and we're getting married, as long as that's what she wants, too.\"\n\nSue glared at her father and said, \"That's enough, Daddy. Leave him alone.\"\n\nFinally the Master Chief grinned and held his hand out for Jason to shake. He said, \"Welcome to the family, son. You take good care of my baby or we WILL have a rather strenuous discussion, though.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir. And I will.\"\n\n\"Don't give me that sir crap. I work for my pay.\"\n\nJason smiled at the old joke and said, \"Yes, sir.\" He ducked when Hank faked a blow at him.\n\nBefore the adults returned to their table, Wendi said, \"When you finish here why don't you drop by the house. We have a lot to talk about now, kids.\"\n\nThe couple did go to Sue's parent's home later that evening. They sat on the patio once again and gazed out over the ocean. More than a few drinks were tossed down their throats while they talked and enjoyed the night. Jason found himself sleeping on the couch this time. Hank woke him the next morning when he walked through the living room toward the kitchen for his first mug of coffee. Jason quickly dressed and followed. The two men were sitting on the patio watching the ocean and talking when first Wendi, then a few minutes later Sue, came onto the patio with their coffee. Soon afterwards Sue's two younger siblings came wandering out also.\n\nAfter the women were seated Hank asked, \"So, you're a soon to be newly promoted Second Class (Petty Officer Second Class--PO2--an E5). You can get by supporting a wife on that, especially if she works, too. What are your plans now, son? Are you going to stay in the Navy? You know you'll have to extend your enlistment for a year to sew the new rank on don't you? That'll give you, what? Five years in.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it'll be a little over 5 when my time's up. I'm not sure but I probably won't stay in. It's no life for a married man with a family.\" Jason felt some embarrassment and glanced at Hank before he continued. \"Sorry, you know what I mean. You're gone on deployment so much of the time and you miss so much. I don't think I would like that and I don't want to put Sue through it, either. I don't know. I think I'll get out when my time's up this time. I think I want to go back home. I'll have three years of college by then so I suppose I'll finish my degree on the GI Bill. We'll have to see what happens after that. I hate to admit it but I am following some of my father's plans. I'm going to get a degree in business except it will be in management instead of finance.\"\n\nA month later, just before their marriage, Jason received a certified letter from an attorney in his hometown. The letter informed him he was listed as a beneficiary in his grandfather's will. The estate was in probate at the present time and, because he was in the service, his presence was not required either at the reading of the will or any of the meetings. There were some papers he needed to sign enclosed in the letter. He was to sign them and return them along with the documents on an enclosed list as soon as possible. The letter requested he contact the attorney if he had any questions.\n\nJason's whole family and some non-family members gathered in the attorney's office for the reading of the will on the appointed day. The attorney informed Jason's father he was to inherit 51% of the stock in the holding company for the three banks. Jason's aunt would inherit the other 49% of the holding company stock. Jason's sisters would each inherit $250,000. The attorney then said, \"Personal items and family heirlooms are to be divided equally. If more than one family member claims an item and they cannot agree who is to receive it I, as the administrator of the estate, will make the final determination on who will receive it. Any items not taken by family members will be sold at auction and the proceeds divided between Mr. Lowery's children.\n\nJason's father sat a moment then said, \"This is fine as far as it goes but you haven't mentioned the old house and twenty acres on the lake. I think there is three or four hundred thousand dollars in investments and cash not mentioned this morning also. What happened to that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I have not mentioned all of the estate yet. Your son, Mr. Lowery's grandson, Jason, is to receive the house and 20 acres. He has already been informed of his inheritance. Since he is in the service, he was not required to attend this meeting. He has already signed all the necessary papers and submitted the documents necessary for us to distribute his share of the estate to him. The appraised value of the house and land is the same as the bequest to your two daughters. Some of the remaining funds and investments are bequeathed to others in this room. If you will allow me to continue, please, we will complete the reading as soon as possible.\"\n\nBy the time the attorney finished telling those gathered what their inheritance was Jason's father was livid. Finally he could not hold it any longer and said, \"This is total bullshit! I am his son. We children should have received all of dad's property but I can live with the token gifts he made to some of his friends and older employees. By my calculation, however, there is still the sum of nearly $500,000 in cash that has not been mentioned. Who receives that?\"",
        "\"That is still to be determined, sir. Your father was very explicit in his instructions for those funds. They are held in a trust and won't be available for complete and final distribution for at least the next five years. There are certain people who have to take a specific action for those funds to be disbursed. At the end of the period explicitly stated in the will and trust documents any funds remaining in the trust will be distributed according to the will.\"\n\n\"What people and what actions do we have to take in order to receive those funds?\" \n\n\"I am not allowed to discuss that sir. The people who may receive those funds are not aware of the potential inheritance and they are not aware of the actions they must take in order to trigger the payments. These funds are available to those individuals if they take certain actions of their own free will, not just so they will receive those undistributed funds.\"\n\n\"That's a total crock. We'll see about that. I demand you either tell us how we can obtain those funds now or you disburse them to me immediately.\"\n\n\"No, sir. I cannot do that. Now, if there is nothing else I believe this meeting is over.\"\n\n\"There certainly is something else. You will be hearing from my attorney about this.\"\n\n\"You certainly may go that route if you so desire, however, I must tell you, the will is very specific. Should anyone who is a beneficiary of this estate choose to contest the will their inheritance is reduced by the cost of defending the distributions. In other terms, if you contest the will all costs associated with that action will be borne by the person who files the action, their inheritance will be decreased by that amount. Now, since you have indicated you plan to dispute the will, I cannot make any distributions until I have a signed document from each of you that they do not intend to dispute the distributions.\"\n\nThe people still in the office became upset with Mr. Lowery when the attorney said that. They almost all turned on him and complained loudly about the delay he caused in the distribution. His daughters and sister were especially critical. You could still hear them arguing as they crossed the parking lot.\n\nMr. Lowery's attorney looked over the copy of the will he was given and told his client that his best interests would be served if he did not contest the will. He said there was little to no chance their suit could prevail. Finally, after much grumbling, Jason's father decided to accept the distribution. He and everyone who was a beneficiary signed the required documents and the attorney began transferring the property. Jason's father, however, began a campaign designed to discover what actions had to be taken by whom in order to obtain distribution of the remaining funds.\n\nJason and Sue had been married two months before they received any further correspondence from the attorney about his grandfather's estate. The estate had finally been settled after his father decided not to contest the will. Jason inherited the old family home and the 20 acres on the lakeshore as his first correspondence said he would. His father, Aunt, and sisters received the rest of the estate less those items given to friends and long time employees and the amount set aside for later disbursement by the estate if certain conditions were met within five years of the estate settling.\n\nJason smiled when he read the letter and hugged Sue. He explained the correspondence to her and said, \"At least we'll have a place to live when we go back to the mainland. I can finish my degree at the university at home and we can live in the old house. I suppose we'll have to make some repairs if we live there, but unless something has happened in the last five years the old house is structurally sound. I know gramps kept up on the maintenance and repairs while I was home anyway. I really like it here but I can't see living here the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"That's great, honey. I like it here, too, but I can learn to like it there as well, I bet. Dad's time is almost up and I don't think he intends to reenlist. He and mother were talking about retiring at the end of this enlistment. He'll have been in 26 years by then and he says it's time to do something else. She's from San Diego but I don't think they'll go back there to live. I don't think they've decided where they'll live. He was raised in North Carolina but he doesn't sound too interested in going back to his boyhood home.\"\n\nFinally, Jason's enlistment was up. They shipped their household belongings back to his old hometown for storage until he found a place to live. They were flying out in a week. They spent the last week before he returned home with Sue's parents. Just before they boarded the aircraft Jason shook Hank's hand and said, \"When you get out, come see us. You're welcome to stay as long as you want. There'll be plenty of room. I don't know what I'll find when I get home, but five years ago the house would have been livable with just a lot of cleaning even though it was woefully out of date.\"\n\nJason and Sue arrived at his hometown late on a Tuesday evening. They had rented a car at the airport a little over an hours drive away from his hometown and drove home. They checked into a hotel and crashed. At ten a.m. the next morning they had an appointment with the attorney to get the keys and paperwork on the property. Jason was looking forward to seeing the old place again and dreading it at the same time. He was afraid to find it damaged and forlorn. He knew there would be a lot of work during the next few months if he decided to live there.\n\nThe attorney seemed surprised Jason was married. He spent several minutes discussing the marriage and getting information about Sue. He asked for a copy of the marriage license. Jason told him it was in storage or transit with the remainder of their possessions. \"I really need proof of your marriage. Will you sign a form that will allow me to obtain a copy of the document?\"\n\n\"Of course, but what does my marriage have to do with all this?\"\n\n\"I'm not at liberty to say right now. Basically, we need to document your marriage and even your education to comply with the proper distribution of assets from the estate.\"\n\nJason was becoming upset when the questioning finally ended. The attorney apologized for taking the time, but explained once again he needed the information to help settle the estate. Jason said, \"I thought you told me the estate was settled. Now you say you need these items to help settle the estate. Which is it?\"\n\n\"A little of both, I'm afraid. The estate is settled. However, there is a trust fund set up containing a portion of the estate's assets. From time to time, I, as the trustee, have the obligation to disburse some of those funds and I occasionally need further information before I can make that distribution.\n\n\"Ok, I don't see what all this has to do with the trust funds, but I'll take your word for it.\"\n\nIn addition to the hoopla about his marriage, Jason noticed the attorney also seemed pleased he was almost through college and was planning on living in the old house while he completed his degree. All things considered, the meeting went well and Jason and Sue were driving onto the property before noon. Sue saw the house and exclaimed, \"It's beautiful, honey. And look at the water and shore! Oh, I love it.\"\n\nJason looked over at her in shock before he said, \"I guess. It looks sort of decrepit to me. I don't know if we can even afford to repair the old place enough to live in it while I finish college.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it needs some work but look at this old house! The design is just perfect. It looks like it belongs there. All it needs is a good cleaning and some TLC I'm sure.\"\n\nJason took Sue on the tour, showing her the dock, out buildings and grounds first, then they went into the house. As he walked around he took notes of the things he saw that needed repair. He categorized them as much as he could, prioritizing the repairs. To his relief, there was no indication the roof leaked and none of the windows were broken although they all should be replaced. They were all single pane and old style as were the doors. Much of the glazing was missing on the windows too. He did find some soft spots in boards where they had decayed, but on the whole, the old house appeared to be very sound.\n\nAfter they completed their walk through, Jason and Sue sat on the old porch (the house was two story and had a covered porch on all sides) and talked about the work. They decided to redo the kitchen, downstairs bathroom, and dining room first so they could move into the house quickly. They would use the dining room for a bedroom until the master suite was renovated. They would work on the downstairs first before tackling the upper story. There were 4 bedrooms, a bathroom, and lounge on the second floor plus two bedrooms in the attic. There were two bedrooms downstairs (one was the master bedroom with an en suite bath), the kitchen and dining room, a living room, and library, as well as a small room off the kitchen for the cook's use. There was a full bath and an old butler's pantry on the ground floor as well.\n\nThe first afternoon they were home, Jason and Sue got his old truck running and cleaned it out, did minor maintenance on it, and began getting the small tractor and mower ready to cut the grass and maintain the yard and garden area.\n\nOn the second day he was home, Jason bit the bullet and went to the family owned bank in town. He needed to give them his new mailing address and add Sue to the signature card. He dropped Sue off at the local Wal-Mart to do her shopping while he took care of the banking. He hoped his father didn't see him while he was at the bank but that hope was not to be. He was walking toward the teller's cage when his father came out of his office and saw him.\n\nJason stood in the middle of the room and watched as his father crossed the lobby to him. He said, \"Hello, Dad.\"\n\n\"So, you decided to come home, I see. Do you have a job yet?\"\n\n\"No, I've only been home two days. I'm going to finish college before I find full time work. I suppose I'll have to find something part time to help with expenses. I'll have my GI Bill to help though.\"\n\n\"So, where are you living? You want to get rid of the old house and land? I suppose we can help you out there if you do. I was surprised you got it in the will. I would be willing to give you $40,000 for it right now, as is. That would be enough to pay for most of your college tuition.\"\n\nJason laughed and said, \"I don't think so. Even I know that place with the lake frontage is worth more than that even without a house on the property. I wouldn't be surprised if the place wasn't worth ten times that. It doesn't matter though; I'm not interested in selling it to you or anyone else. I'm going to live there, at least until I finish college.\"\n\n\"You're making a mistake, boy. You think about it. That's a lot of money for a young person just starting out. Besides, what would you do with it? I have the contacts and finances to develop that property and turn it into a real moneymaker.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you do. It's always about the money with you isn't it, Dad? Well, forget it. Gramps and I were happy there with the place just as it is now. I'm not interested in seeing houses all over it.\"\n\nJason was so upset he just turned and left the bank. He decided he would move his account to a different bank. \n\nAfter he found Sue at the store they loaded her purchases into his truck and returned home. They took the rental car back to the airport and turned it in, and then went to Lowe's to purchase some building materials so they could begin working on the their house. Sue was excited about the kitchen area and insisted they retain the old cabinets, wainscoting, and other built in d\u00e9cor in the kitchen and dining room. She did consent to installing a hidden modern dishwasher and new range and refrigerator. They decided all the old features would be kept and restored where possible throughout the house.\n\nIt took them a week to just strip down the kitchen, dining room, maid/cooks bedroom, butler's pantry, and the downstairs bathroom. The next week they pulled the old plumbing and wires out, re-wired and re-plumbed the rooms they were working on. It took another three weeks for them to replace bad boards, insulate the rooms outer walls and refinish them. They were now nearly out of money and had to stop purchasing supplies to repair the old house. This didn't stop them from preparing the remainder of the rooms for eventual refurbishment.\n\nBy the time school started the young couple only had a smidgen over $3,000 in the bank. This was not a horribly low amount, however, because Jason's GI bill payments would begin when he returned to college full time. Sue was going to find a job and work to supplement their income and savings. They would work on the old house during the winter as time and finances allowed.\n\nThe week before college classes began Jason received a phone call from the attorney's office. He requested he and Sue come to his office to discuss \"some matters dealing with the estate of your late grandfather\". The lady who called either couldn't or wouldn't tell him what the meeting was about other than they needed to discuss some matters dealing with the estate as she said before.\n\nWhen Jason and Sue arrived at the attorney's office they were ushered into a meeting room. The attorney and his PA shook their hands and invited them to be seated. As soon as they were comfortable and had refreshment of their choice the attorney began speaking. He said, \"Thank you for coming into the office. I'm sorry we couldn't be more specific about the purpose of this meeting but our hands were tied. We have to follow the requirements of your grandfather's last will and testament and the trust documents in this matter.\n\n\"Now, as you know, you inherited the old house and the 20 acres on which it sits along with all the outbuildings. What you don't know, and what we were not allowed to tell you when we had our initial meeting, is that your grandfather funded some other bequests if and only if certain criteria were met. If the criteria for the disbursement of the remaining funds from the estate are not met, the balance is to be donated to the local senior citizens organization of which your grandfather was a member at the end of 5 years from the settlement date of the estate.\n\n\"I'm pleased to tell you that some of the requirements for disbursing part of these funds have been met. Your grandfather left instructions that if you marry within five years of his death you are to receive a wedding gift of $20,000.\" The attorney handed Jason a check for that amount and continued talking, \"The delay in disbursing these funds was caused by two things. We did not know you married until after you returned home several weeks ago. We then had to verify your marriage by contacting the entity issuing and recording your marriage license. Unfortunately, the State of Hawaii took quite some time to send us the required information.\n\n\"Another bequest is now payable also. You were to receive another $30,000 if you voluntarily returned home and began living on the property you inherited. This bequest would not be payable until you had lived on the property for at least three months straight. You have now met that requirement so here is another check for $30,000.\n\n\"The third requirement for the disbursement of funds was that you attend college. If you go to college and work toward a degree of any kind the estate will pay all your necessary college expenses for you and your wife while you are still in college full time. This means the estate will reimburse educational expenses you incurred while you were attending college in Hawaii. It also means the estate will pay your college and living expenses for your current enrollment. All you have to do is submit proof of the expense. There is a monthly stipend for living expenses of $1,000 while you are in college full time. The stipend is prorated if you are a less than full time student. There was some delay obtaining proof of your out of pocket expenses for the classes you took in Hawaii. This check is for the amount you personally paid for coursework done in Hawaii plus the monthly stipend for living and other miscellaneous expenses.\"\n\nJason and Sue were sitting in shock. Finally she reached out and hugged him. There were tears in the corners of her eyes. Jason looked at the pile of checks in front of him. He didn't know what to say. They went from worrying where their next meal would come from to being almost independently wealthy. Well, not really, but there was roughly $80,000 laying on the desk in checks with Jason's name on them.\n\nJason looked up and said, \"I, I don't know what to say.\"\n\nThe attorney smiled and said, \"There isn't much to say. You did all this on your own. The bequests were not to be paid out unless you did certain things on your own. We were not allowed to tell you about the pending funds. You had five years in which to make the decisions that would trigger the fund disbursement. You have done so and I have disbursed the funds currently payable.\"\n\n\"Wait. You mean there's more? What else do I have to do?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is more. There is funding available for your further education as I previously mentioned. There are sufficient funds in trust to meet all the financial requirements for some time. As for anything else that may or may not be covered by the will, I cannot say. Time will tell. Do you have any other questions?\"\n\n\"No. No questions. I just don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"Well then, I'll wish you a good day, sir. I hope we'll see you again, soon. As you have educational expenses, send us proof of them and we will reimburse you. You will receive your monthly stipend by deposit to your bank account after you document your enrollment and continued attendance at college. I assume you will use your current account here in the bank?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, probably not. I don't think I want my finances open to review by my family and, as you know, they own the local bank and many of them work there. I'll bring you the bank information for the bank I use now.\" \n\nInstead of going home from the attorney's office as he planned to do, Jason and Sue drove 40 miles to the next large town to deposit the checks into the account he opened when he returned home. Neither of the young people could believe the way their fortune had turned.\n\nOn the way back home Sue grabbed the deposit slip and looked at it once again. With her eyes glistening she turned to Jason and said, \"I just can't believe this honey. What are we going to do with all this money? Can we keep working on the house now? Please? If you don't mind can I not find a job and just do the things I can do on the house then, when you have time, you can help me.\"\n\nJason thought as he drove another mile or two. He said, \"I suppose that would be ok. Neither of us has to work for a while I guess. Between my GI bill payments and the money we will receive from the estate to live on we'll get by fine. We might even be able to save some of it. Hell, I know we can save some of it. Even if we decide to move off after I finish college the place will sell better if it's already been completely remodeled. Yeah, let's keep on working on it.\n\nThree days later when Jason got home from school he found his parents and sisters standing in the yard with an angry looking Sue. Hell, neither of his parents looked all that happy, either. He stopped his old truck where the driveway came the closest to the gathered family members and got out. He had walked almost halfway to the group when his father burst out, \"It's about damn time you got here. Why were you given all that money from the estate? Why wasn't I told about the payments in the first place? Its bad enough you managed to finagle your way into ownership of this land, but taking money from the estate is outrageous. When the will was read we were told the only thing you would inherit was this house and the 20 acres its on. Now I find out you have collected over $80,000 from the funds withheld because of some weird requirement your grandfather put in his will.\"",
        "\"Well, pop, I really don't think its any business of yours why I was given that money. When Gramps died he set out the criteria necessary to qualify for the additional funds. The reason I qualified for those funds is between the administrator of the trust in which they are held and me. The trustee determined I met the requirements for receipt of those funds and he disbursed them to me. Now, if you don't mind, I have some studying to do and my wife and I need to get to work.\"\n\n\"Your wife and you? I didn't know you were married. How did you have time to get married between the time you got home and now? I haven't seen any announcements or heard talk about you getting married.\"\n\nJason walked over to a shaking Sue. He wasn't sure if she was shaking from anger or fear but he wanted to support her and calm her down. When his father saw him put his arm around her waist he went ballistic. He shouted, \"You mean you married a foreigner? You went out and married some bar tramp instead of one of the nice girls I kept trying to set you up with? You're disgusting and no son of mine.\"\n\nSue broke down in tears when she heard his father say that. Jason felt his jaws clinch and his face reddened as he removed his arm from around Sue's waist and started for his father. As he moved, he said, \"You fucking asshole. I didn't marry some bar tramp and you never tried to set me up with any nice girls. You tried to push me into marrying the daughter of someone you felt would better your financial situation. If you want to see a tramp, you should look into the background of most of the bitches you tried to pawn me off on. Hell, most of them were the school bike. Anyone who was in sports or anyone they felt had some money could have a ride on them. Sue's better than all those bitches put together. Her father just recently retired from the Navy as an E9 Master Chief Engineman after 26 years of service. Now, it's time for you all to get the hell off our land. I've heard enough.\"\n\n\"You ungrateful son of a bitch. When your house of cards falls down around you don't come crawling to me for anything. You're just as ungrateful and unappreciative now as you were before you ran away from home. I don't know why you couldn't be more like your sisters.\"\n\nJason snorted and started to turn away. His father smiled and said, \"That's it. Run away again when you're faced with the fact I knew what was best for you kids. Both your sisters married men I picked out for them and are in a position of respect in the community. All you are is an unemployed delinquent.\"\n\nJason stopped and turned back to face his family. He was almost shaking with anger. He said, \"Well, neither of their husbands got much of a prize did they? How did you manage to hide the way they were slutting around long enough to get them married? How about Tiffany's abortion? What about Chastity's venereal disease? Do you really think a man who stole several thousand dollars from his father's business is a good husband for Tiffany? How do you keep him from embezzling from the bank? Or do you just ignore it? And what about Chastity's husband? Why is he too disabled to work but he manages to hunt and fish all the time? Oh, wait, none of that matters does it? After all, they come from the right families and their fathers keep a lot of money in your banks and use you for their sometimes shady loans.\"\n\nWhile he was ranting on, Jason's mother began crying. She put her hand over her mouth and the sobs shook her whole body. His father stood in shock. He looked at his daughters, then at Jason. Chastity hissed at Jason, \"You asshole! How could you say those things?\"\n\nHis mother moaned to Tiffany, \"Oh, my God Tiff. You didn't? How could you kill my grandchild? Who authorized your abortion? You really didn't have an abortion did you? Why didn't I know any of this?\"\n\nJason looked at his upset family and said, \"Well mother. Would you prefer to have a half black grandbaby? Rumor had it that one of the basketball team was the one who got Tiff preggers and gave Chas the disease. We all know 90% of the team is black. They took care of each other and the team took up a collection to help with the treatment. I expect they got the rest of the money they needed from you and dad. You both gave them money, large amounts of money, whenever they came to you for it. Most of the time they didn't even have a good reason, they just asked for money to go shopping with or to buy something they wanted. You really don't remember when Tiff was sick with cramps for an entire week? God.\n\n\"Just go. Get the hell off my land and leave us alone.\"\n\nHis father gently pushed the crying women toward their car. Just before she got in the back seat beside Tiffany Chastity glared at Jason and gave him the finger. By then, he was once again hugging Sue trying to calm her down. He tilted her head up and gave her a gentle kiss then let her snuggle and nestle her head under his chin. He felt the sobs gently shaking her body.\n\nFinally, she pushed away from him, stood on her tiptoes and gave him a gentle kiss. \"I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself. How can any family be like that? I know you told me about them but I was positive your memories had exaggerated themselves over time about how they were. I can't believe how you minimized their personalities and morals. Honey, I'm so sorry you had to grow up in a family like that. How did you ever manage to become the wonderful man you are after growing up in a dysfunctional family like yours?\"\n\n\"I can answer that with one word; Gramps. No, make that three words. Gramps and Granny. I spent every spare moment I could with them and they kept me grounded. After the girls came, mom and dad really didn't have much time for me. After all, they had two princesses to care for. I didn't become important to them until they decided they could marry me off to a rich bitch and reel her father's money and position into their camp or bank. I left home just before I graduated high school and lived out here in the boathouse for the last two weeks of high school and the five weeks before I went into the Navy. Gramps and I spent every minute we could out here together. I learned to fish, repair things, and how to treat people from him. He started the banks. Well, not really, he inherited the bank here in town from his father but he started the other two. Until he retired, the business grew constantly. All dad does is put on airs and throw his weight around. I would bet the banks are worth a lot less now than when he took over.\n\n\"Now, come on. Let's jump in the truck and go to town for supper. You don't need to cook tonight after facing my family like you did. We can just try and relax tonight. Maybe we can forget all this.\"\n\n\"Humph. I'm not sure I can ever forget that. When they got here, they tried to just walk into the house. When they found the doors locked, they came around back. I came outside to meet them and they tried to ignore me. They asked where you were. Your father actually ordered me to let them wait for you inside. He informed me he was your father and he was going to wait for you inside. He even turned to your mother and said, \"After we get things straightened out you need to talk to him and give him some pointers on hiring help. This chink bitch is way too uppity for her position.\" I was just about to tell him I wasn't some chink bitch, that I was your wife, when you drove up.\"\n\nJason hugged her once again and gave her another kiss. He said, \"I'm sorry honey. I did warn you how bad they were, but even I was surprised by this visit. I wonder if they are having some cash flow problems or how they found out about the disbursements from the trusts. Oh, well, I don't suppose it matters.\"\n\nThings settled down into a comfortable life for Jason and Sue after the confrontation with his family. During the colder months of winter they worked on the interior of the old house. By spring, they had the entire downstairs completed. The rooms were a strange blend of modern and original. The whole effect was absolutely beautiful. The house was old enough that it had natural, 100% wood trim and accents. They stripped and refinished all the old wood. They repaired and painted or papered all the walls after insulating them well and installing new plumbing and wiring.\n\nThe master suite was completed and they moved their bedding into it. The dining room was once again a dining room with the original solid walnut dining table, china cabinet and accessories. The living room was restored and filled with appropriate furniture. The library was turned into a library once again with two desks and their computers installed. It would serve as an office and, until his degree was completed, a study room. As each room was renovated, new triple pane windows were installed.\n\nFinally spring came. Jason was down at the lake working on his grandfather's old boat. He wanted to get it running and do some fishing. During the winter he made contact with a couple of his old friends from school. They were all outdoors type and had enjoyed fishing and hunting when they were younger. Jason never cared for hunting but he was always there for the fishing.\n\nJason had the old outboard motor torn down and was rebuilding it when one of his friends stopped by. Since he was at the boathouse and dock Sue sent him down there to see Jason. When Ronnie came into the shop he stopped and looked around in awe. \"Whoa,\" he said. \"This is awesome. I never saw a garage or shop this neat and bright. Whatcha workin' on there, slick?\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh, thanks. I picked this up from the Navy I guess. We always had to keep our workspace 'ship shape' as they said and I got to like it. Hell, you always know where something is because there is a place for everything and we kept everything in its place. I'm working on one of gramps old Johnson motors. Damn thing is an antique but I wanted to get it running I suppose. It was either that or spend money for a cheap-assed new one. The Navy taught me about engines and so forth, so what the hell.\"\n\nRonnie stood watching Jason work for several minutes and asked, \"You think you can fix these engines ok? I know a couple guys that have old engines that don't run or that run poorly. Most of the mechanics around here don't want to mess with them. If they can't hook a computer to them to find out what's wrong, they're lost.\"\n\n\"Sure. Have them bring them down and I'll look at them at least. I enjoy working on these engines and the boats.\" Jason replaced his tools, cleaned his hands, and grabbed two beers from the refrigerator in the shop. He handed Ronnie one and they walked outside. Jason locked the door then the two friends moved to a shady spot and sat drinking their beer and talking as they watched the few boats out on the lake.\n\nThe next day Ronnie returned with two of his friends and three older engines. Jason showed them where to put them in the shop and gave them a quick once over. He said, \"I don't know if I can repair them or not until I tear into them. Some of these engines are so old you can't get parts any longer.\"\n\nPaul snorted and said, \"Yeah. I've heard that before on a different engine. I hate to buy a new one if I don't have to. At least look at it for me.\"\n\n\"Hey, no promises, but I'll give it my best shot. Some of the parts I might be able to manufacture. Hell, I might even be able to find an old engine for the parts. I'll let you know.\"\n\n\"Great. What will you charge?\"\n\n\"Hadn't given it much thought. I've never done repair work and got paid for it before. I guess whatever the other shops charge.\"\n\n\"Well most of them are $75.00 to $110 per hour. They use book hours if they have a book for the engine and boat they're working on.\"\n\n\"Damn, that's kind of steep isn't it? I'll check around but I guess I could do it for $75.00 an hour.\"\n\nJason was able to repair all three of the engines. One of them, he found an old engine and used it for parts. One, he manufactured a shaft for and repaired it. The third one was new enough he could find parts for it. He made $1475 repairing the three engines and only worked about 20 hours. All three of the men were very happy with the work. One of them even said the engine now ran better than it ever had. Slowly, word of Jason's work, his 'magic fingers' if you will, made the rounds of the boaters on the lake. He began to get phone calls and visits from people who wanted him to work on their boats and motors. Jason seemingly stumbled into a very lucrative job, one he really liked and was good at.\n\nOne of the men whose engine he repaired asked if he would rent him a slip for his boat. Jason had several spots open and decided he would do that. He quoted a price and the man jumped at it. Soon, all the slips Jason had available were rented to local boat owners. One day, Sue brought Jason's lunch to him and was eating with him when a man came to pick up his motor. He apologized for interrupting lunch, but asked if they planned on selling bait, fishing gear, and snacks.\n\nJason said, \"Not really. We haven't even given it any thought. Why?\"\n\n\"Well, Maude's is the only marina on this side of the lake that sells those items and she told us this is going to be the last year she operates. She's 76 now and says she's getting too old to mess with the work any longer. She's only a mile or so from here and a bunch of us buy our fuel and supplies from her. She's trying to sell her dock but isn't having much luck. Her lease for the shoreline the dock is on is up for renewal and the land owners want so much for a new lease that someone buying the dock would have trouble making a decent profit.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Sounds like it might be a good deal, but I'm not sure I want to be tied down like that.\"\n\n\"Well, I just wondered. Sure would be nice if you did. You have a better place here than she does. I think she made pretty good money there until she got so old she had to hire so much help.\"\n\nAfter the man left, Jason and Sue talked about the dock. She said, \"I'm not doing much now Jason. It would be a way for me to put my degree to work and we could be here together. We almost have the house restored and then I was going to try and find some outside work. This would be better if we could do it. We already have a good road down here to our dock and there is a small parking area. We could put in some more piers and slips and do fine I bet. I think she has a floating dock too. We might be able to buy it and tow it down here instead of building something here.\"\n\n\"We're about out of money you know. I'm making enough to live on here but remember the winters are really slow. We can't be taking on much debt. I really hate to be in debt. We'll just have enough cash from what we got out of the estate to finish everything from the way it looks. I don't have a problem with you looking into it though if you want to. Just don't promise her anything.\"\n\n\"Great. I'll go see her tomorrow. We can look at her books and see how profitable she is.\"\n\nSue made several trips to Maude's dock over the next two weeks. She was convinced it was a viable business. Maude made an average of $2,000 a month profit on her facility after paying salary for two full time and three part time helpers. She only wanted $24,000 for the business. They agreed to pay an additional fee for the wholesale cost of her remaining fuel and inventory.\n\nThree nights later the phone rang and Sue answered it. She squealed and came running into the library carrying the phone. She was talking a mile a minute and had the phone on speaker. The first thing Jason heard was, \"Yes Dad. That'll be great. Yeah, we have plenty of room. You can stay as long as you want. I'm sitting with Jason now and have you on speaker.\"\n\nHank bellowed out, \"Hey there, boy. I finally did it. Made it to retirement and they've cut me loose. Suzie pie says ya got some room there for an old sailor without a billet. Mind if we come stay a spell before we find a spot to drop anchor?\"\n\n\"Hell, no, Master Chief. You know you're always welcome. We have plenty of room here. I have 8 empty bedrooms right now. How many ya need?\"\n\nHank just laughed and said, \"Well, we don't need that many, fer sure. If its all the same to you, though, we'd like to come stay a spell, see Sue again before we find a place of our own.\"\n\nJust before the in-laws arrived Jason received another phone call from his grandfather's attorney. This time, he asked if he could come out to the house and discuss the will and a bequest. Jason told him he was pretty busy but agreed to give him some time in the afternoon.\n\nThe attorney arrived at the agreed on time and greeted Jason. After they shook hands, the attorney remarked on how nice the old place looked. He was impressed with the restoration job. The old house was restored to as near original on the outside as it could be and was painted a glistening white. It stood out proudly nestled in its grove of trees. The attorney was so complementary of the house, Jason and Sue offered him a tour which he accepted with alacrity.\n\nAfter they had been through the entire house the attorney asked if he could discuss the bequest with them. Jason agreed he had time and led the attorney into the library where they all sat in the very comfortable easy chairs. The attorney leaned back and said, \"You have passed another milestone and fulfilled a requirement set out by your grandfather for a disbursement from the trust. This time the disbursement will probably be very substantial and is dependent on several factors.\n\n\"You qualify for this disbursement because you not only have chosen to live here in your grandfather's old home but you have restored it to its former glory. This bequest was made payable to you or any family member who may have purchased this house from you had you decided to sell it. As you remember, the will stated if you chose not to remain here after you inherited, you were required to offer the remaining family members right of first refusal before you sold the property to an outsider. You chose to keep the house, live in it, and restore it, therefore the bequest is payable to you.\n\n\"The bequest is for the cost of restoring the house. I have some discretion on how to structure the payment. For example, if the house is restored to near original condition, you get the full amount of the restoration costs. If, in my opinion, the restoration is less than original I must determine the percentage of the original structure that has been restored and pay that amount. To make a long story shorter, in my opinion, you qualify for the 100% reimbursement. I hope you kept receipts for the materials and labor involved because you will be reimbursed 100% for that. I understand you did almost all the labor yourself, therefore, you qualify for an additional amount to pay for your labor. The items you hired done such as the HVAC will be excluded from computation for your labor reimbursement because we will reimburse you for the help hired. You will be reimbursed double on the materials used for the work you did personally as payment for your labor on the restoration.\n\n\"As soon as you can present me receipts for the materials and work done I will authorize you a check for the restoration work.\"\n\nJason and Sue were once again shocked. He rocked back in his chair and looked at the attorney. He said, \"Right now, I don't know the exact amount we spent but I've kept all the receipts and invoices for tax purposes. Our accountant says I'll need those to document the cost basis we have in the house should we ever decide to sell. I can get a printout right now of the amount spent because we keep it on our computer. Right off the top of my head, I think we have about $127,000 invested in the repairs and restoration.\"\n\nJason stood and went to the desk. He started his computer and selected the file report he wanted then routed it to the printer. While it was printing, he opened a file cabinet and pulled a folder out that was stuffed with invoices and receipts. He carried the documents to the attorney and set them on the table beside his chair.",
        "\"Jason read the bottom line of the spreadsheet and said, \"I was a little off on my figures. Including labor hired we have spent $113,327 on the restoration work for the house. The remainder of the nearly $127,000 was spent on the dock and outbuildings or landscaping.\" Jason handed the printout to the attorney.\n\n\"\"This is just what I need. May I take these to my office?\"\n\n\"Yes but I would like a receipt for the invoices and receipts. You will be sure they get returned to me won't you?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. It may take us a week or so but we will return your documents when we bring the check out.\"\n\nAfter the attorney left, Jason and Sue sat on the back porch and talked. They mostly were silent, however, from the enormity of the information the attorney left them. Jason completely forgot the work he was doing in the shop. Finally, he turned to Sue and said, \"You know, that check will probably be nearly $200,000. I don't know what to do with all that money, honey.\"\n\n\"Who says we have to do anything with it? Why can't we just save it for future expenses, or to put the kids through college?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, but I mean, where will we put it. I don't know anything about investing and I sure don't want to leave it in a low interest checking account.\"\n\n\"Well, I know what we can do with nearly $30,000 of it. We can pay off Maude's dock instead of borrowing the money to purchase and move it. I know you didn't want to tie the land up on a mortgage and now you don't have to.\"\n\n\"That's a thought, but we will still have $170,000 or so to invest.\"\n\nThree days after Jason deposited the check for the house improvements and paid Maude for the boat dock his father showed up at the house. He came storming into the shop where Jason was working yelling about the most recent check from the attorney. When Jason turned to face him, he said, \"I don't know how you got that attorney to give you that check for $197,679 out of Dad's estate and I don't really care. I'm here to get it back. The bank can't afford to have that money withdrawn.\"\n\nJason had never seen his father act like he was acting. The man was red faced and shaking in his anger. He stood well back from him when he said, \"The attorney said I was due that money because of a clause in Grandpa's will. He left funds available to anyone in the family who owned, restored and lived in the house. Since I decided to keep the house and I restored it and we are living in it, we meet the requirements in the will to receive those funds.\"\n\n\"I never heard about that and I really don't care. We need those funds to keep the bank solvent and we need them back right now.\"\n\n\"Well, it's too late. I've spent most of the money. It was to repair the house and property and as you can see, that's what I've done.\"\n\n\"Well, you need to find some other bank to make you a loan on the place then so you can give me the money back. I'll call around for you, tell them you're my son and want to make it on your own is why we aren't loaning you the money.\"\n\n\"No, I'm fine. Don't need a loan. Now, why don't you just go. I've got work to do.\"\n\n\"You haven't heard the last of this. I'll sue if I have to. This just isn't right. Those funds have been in the bank for years under our name. We've used them for our solvency requirements and can't afford to lose them. If the bank examiners see the money gone we'll be thrown into receivership. The FDIC will take the bank and sell it out to a larger one.\"\n\n\"Sorry, pop. Most of the money's gone now. Looks like you should have ran a tighter ship, kept better track of your loans and deposits. Maybe if you hadn't loaned so much money to your friends and let them default you'd be in better shape.\"\n\nJason, Sue, and two of his friends decided they could move Maude's dock to its new home instead of hiring the job done. They all had powerful boats and thought they could just unhook the floating slips from the floating dock and move it a piece at a time to its new home on Jason's and Sue's land. They were in the middle of the move when they saw a man, woman and two younger children standing on the dock watching as they neared with the floating dock building. \n\nJason could see Sue was very excited because they recognized her family when they got closer to the shore. It was all she could do to keep working, driving her boat until they got the floating dock situated and they could begin securing it to the shore and pilings driven into the lake for it.\n\nWhen they got the dock safely, but temporarily, secured they put the boats they were using in slips and went ashore to greet Hank, Wendi and Sue's siblings. Jason introduced his friends to Hank and Wendi. They visited for a few minutes then Jason said, \"Ronnie, you and Sam are welcome to stick around if you want but I think we'll call it a day here. I have to catch up on things with this old squid here.\"\n\n\"Naw, that's fine. I need to get home and catch up on some honey-do's anyway. Tabbi was a little put out when I told her we were going to be busy all day moving the dock and slips.\"\n\n\"Well, ya all're welcome if ya wanta stay. I'll give ya a call in a day or two and let ya know when we're gonna move the rest of the dock. Thanks for today.\"\n\nThe reunited family moved up to the house and grabbed some drinks before they sat on the back porch and looked out over the lake to drink them. Hank said, \"You sure have a great place here, Jason. I can see why you wanted to come back to it. The old house sure looks a lot different from what it did when Sue sent us pictures right after you got home.\n\n\"I hear you had a little trouble with your family. How are things going with them now?\"\n\n\"Don't know and don't really care. Dad's been a manipulative, scheming bastard as far back as I remember. Mom's just submissive enough to let him run over her and the girls; well, I guess they take after Dad. They push, shove, lie, and finagle to get what they want, no matter how unethical it is. I've never caught one of them in anything completely illegal but they skirt the line pretty closely at times. I just keep away from them and let them live their lives as they choose. I even had to move our bank accounts to another town and different bank to be sure they weren't snooping on us.\"\n\nAfter about an hour the ladies left the porch for the kitchen to prepare the evening meal. After the meal everyone visited a short time longer then went to bed. Jason and Sue were tired from their long day's work and Sue's family were exhausted from the long drive they just completed.\n\nJason woke the next morning at his usual time of 6 a.m. He followed his normal daily routine and grabbed a cup of coffee on his way through the kitchen headed for his shop. He normally worked on engines until Sue called him for breakfast about 7:30.\n\nJason had just began working when he heard someone walking into the shop. He turned and saw Hank looking around. Hank grinned and said, \"Nice looking shop, here. Looks a lot like one you might have in the Navy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, old habits die hard. I learned how to set a shop up and manage work while I was in and adapted the processes to this one.\"\n\n\"Have anything I can give you a hand with? Looks like you have several engines sitting around.\"\n\n\"No, nothing that's gonna bite me on the ass. You're welcome to just sit and straw boss. Hell, that's probably the only thing you're good for since you were a Chief for so long.\"\n\nHank laughed and said, \"Enough of that talk. I can still tear an engine down and put her back together faster and better than any young whippersnapper like you and my work would be right the first time.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I know. Same ol', same ol'. Anyway, the trouble tag is on each engine. I charge by the clock hour and there isn't a markup on parts I order for folks. If I use a part from my inventory though I charge retail for it. I just keep a running worksheet for each job, log in on it, record each part I use and its cost. I use the same sheet and log out if I change jobs or stop working on the job for any reason like, maybe, some used up old squid comes in and interrupts me.\"\n\nHank sat down in one of the old chairs in what Jason called his break area and watched while Jason worked. They talked and enjoyed their coffee (Jason had made a pot when he got to the shop).\n\nAfter he finished his third coffee, Hank got up and wandered over to look at the trouble tags on the engines. He selected one and lugged it over to an unused workstation. Before long he was happily tearing the engine down and inspecting it. He had it completely torn down before Sue sent her brother Toby to get the men for breakfast. Hank and Jason cleaned the grease off their hands and arms and walked back to the house in a sea of silence.\n\nWhile they were eating, Sue asked Jason what he planned for the day. He said, \"I haven't thought too much about it. I've got a couple of engines I need to get out as soon as I can. I promised them by Wednesday. I also would like to get the dock secured better in case we get a wind or something.\"\n\n\"I thought I might take mom and Janet to town if you don't need me for a while. I need some groceries and a couple of other things. Can I pick up anything for you while we're there?\"\n\n\"No, I think I have everything I need. After I get the dock secured better I may take Hank and Toby out in the boat for a while.\"\n\nJason stood and moved toward the back door, headed toward the dock. Sue met him there and gave him a quick hug and gentle kiss. They both said, \"Be careful\" at the same time and laughed.\n\nHank stood and followed Jason. As he got to the door he turned and said, \"Come on, Toby, you can help us until we get ready to go.\"\n\n\"OH, Dad. I wantta play my games. I'm almost to a new level and I want to get it before the rest of the guys do.\"\n\n\"You can do that this evening after we quit for the day. I'm sorry we let you have that I-phone now. We should have just got you another flip phone.\"\n\nBy the time Hank and Toby got to the dock Jason was already laying out the cables to attach the dock to the pilings and winches on shore. They had just tied the dock to some of its support pilings the day before. Now they needed to attach the cables to the shore side winches and attach it correctly to the pilings driven into the lakebed. It took the three of them almost 5 hours to completely secure the dock and place the walkway from the shore to the floating dock and fueling station.\n\nAfter the job was complete Jason stood back and looked over their work. He turned to Hank and said, \"Thanks Hank--and you, too, Toby. I really appreciate your help. I couldn't have completed this today without you two. Now all we have to do is run the water, sewer, and power lines and the dock will be ready to go. I have several feet of walkways and slips to tow over and attach and we'll be ready to open for business.\"\n\nHank said, \"How far away is the old location? Could the two of us make it there and back with one of the sections before its too late?\"\n\n\"Yeah, probably. It's a little less than a mile by water and only a mile and a half or so by road. If you really want to, come on, let's go.\"\n\nHank and Toby took one boat, Jason the other. They took off for the old location and were back in a little less than an hour and a half with one of the floating sections of boat slips and walkways. It was nearly full dark before they had it attached to the dock and secured to the pilings that were pre driven for it.\n\nAfter they fueled the boats and completed the after operation checks the three men cleaned up and raided the refrigerator in Jason's shop for a drink. Hank and Jason had a beer and Toby had a root beer. They sat in chairs in front of the shop and looked at the dock floating and bobbing slightly in the gentle swell.\n\nHank said, \"It sure is quiet and peaceful here. I almost hate to see you open up the dock. You'll have noisy boats and people around all the time then. What, exactly, are your plans here, Jason?\"\n\n\"I can't really say we have a plan. Everything you see here just sort of happened and we went along with the flow. I inherited the house and these 20 acres from granddad, and Sue and I decided to live here until I got my degree. We decided to fix up the house a little to live in and then we decided to do it all because it would sell better if it was ready to live in if we decided to sell out and move on. Then I found out gramps set aside money to restore the house if a family member restored it and lived in it. I got the restoration costs plus compensation for the labor I personally put into the work. \n\n\"Then, one day I was working on one of my engines when a bud of mine saw me and asked if I could fix some of our friends engines. People kept calling me and asking me to work on engines or boats until I work nearly full time now.\n\n\"One of the guys asked if we were going to sell snacks and fuel because Maude was closing and there was no other place on this side of the lake to fuel. We checked with Maude and she sold the business so cheap we had to buy it so now Sue's going to run the dock and store and I'll run the shop and outside sales. We're already so busy neither one of us can even think about an outside job, but ya know, we're lovin' it. We're our own boss and we just go at our own pace. Its great. Only problem is, we're to the point where we need to hire two or three people to help. Sue can't run the dock alone and I'm about snowed under with the shop. Maude had herself, two full time, and three part time employees just to run the dock, fuel point and slip rentals during the summer. We haven't had a day off now for weeks because of the work we're doing here.\n\n\"Sue wants to put in a small snack bar as well as a small store catering to the fishermen. We're going to need a bunch of help right now or we'll have to cut back on what we plan to do.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I can see that. Ya got 'nother one of these beers?\"\n\nThe next week sped by. Jason and Hank worked in the shop and actually got completely caught up. They used Toby as a 'gofer' to his disgust. They got all the slips and dock paraphernalia moved from Maude's old site and had everything set up and working. They were still waiting on the various licenses to come in but were operating still using Maude's permits. To make it legal (and because she agreed to teach Sue about the business) she worked the dock as she always had. They managed to retain one of the full time helpers and one of the part time helpers so that lightened the load somewhat. Wendi and Janet helped Sue in the dock. The kids didn't complain about the work as much when, on the first Friday after their arrival, Jason handed them each some greenbacks and told them it was their pay for helping during the week.\n\nWhen he saw Jason giving the kids the money Hank tried to intervene and said, \"Jason, there's no need for you to pay the kids for helping. You're putting us up, and feeding us. That's enough.\"\n\n\"No, its not Hank. You have all pitched in and been a great help and we owe you. I have some money here for you and Wendi also. If you hadn't helped like you all did we would be way behind instead of caught up. If anything, we owe you still. We would have paid as much or more if we had hired someone off the street and still might not have been as caught up as we are now.\"\n\nThe dock they purchased from Maude was 80 feet by 40 feet. It had a store area 25 by 40 feet and an enclosed fishing area 20 by 40 feet. The remainder of the floating dock building was devoted to restrooms, a snack bar and kitchen with a small inside dining area. Wendi and Janet jumped in and took over the dining area. Outside the enclosed area of the dock was a wide walkway. On the end where the snack bar was there were six outside tables for guests to sit also.\n\nIn addition to the typical sandwiches and appetizers sold in such places, Wendi offered a few authentic Chinese meals. The menu varied from day to day but her staples were Broccoli Beef, General Tsao's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and Mongolian BBQ. Of course, she also had egg rolls, plain steamed rice, and fried rice. She also sold several types of seafood such as fried shrimp, clam strips, scallops, and, on weekends, Lobster and Crab legs. It soon became obvious to the family that people were coming to the restaurant for a meal then leaving. She was actually getting business not related to or brought in by the boating and fishing part of the company. They had to add more enclosed floating room to feed the larger crowds that showed up for meals.\n\nAfter Sue's family had been with them for three weeks they were sitting in the back yard relaxing after yet another busy day when Hank took Wendi's hand and said, \"Jason, Wendi and I have been talking and we have a proposition for you. We weren't sure where we wanted to live when I left the navy. No longer than we've been here, we've been happier than most places we've been before. We like working here on the lake and we especially like having all the family together. This seems like a nice little town, too.\n\n\"We wondered if you would mind if we just found a place to live here and we kept working here for you? Hell, you've said yourself you are going to have to hire more full time help. Why don't we just stay and keep doing what we're doing now and you just quit looking for more help?\"\n\nJason looked over at Sue. She was smiling wider than he had seen her for quite a while. He raised his eyebrows slightly. She smiled larger and gave a slight nod to her head. He said, \"That's fine with me. We both appreciate the help you've given us. We feel guilty for working you so hard though when you're supposed to be relaxing in retirement. Are you sure you want to jump into something like this? You know the hours we'll have to work to stay on top of things.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're sure. Wendi loves to cook and is already making friends with some of her regulars. I like to tinker with engines and small boats and I'm making friends with some of the men that come to the shop. The kids like it here also, so yes, we're sure.\"\n\n\"Heck, then its a done deal. We'll have to get you set up as employees, though. I've just been paying you all under the table since we thought it would be a temporary deal. I might even have an idea for your house. There is a guesthouse behind our house you know. We haven't done anything with it yet but it is a two-bedroom building with an entertainment room that could be made into a third bedroom. The kitchen and dining area are together and there is a small living room. We can fix it up for you and we can call it part of your pay if you want.\"\n\n\"That might work. How about we look at it tomorrow?\"\n\nEarly the next morning Jason and Hank went out and looked over the guesthouse. They carried their coffee with them and sat on the porch drinking the coffee after their cursory inspection of the building. Hank leaned back in the old chair and put his feet on the porch rail. He sipped his coffee then looked around the yard and out over the lake. He took a deep breath and said, \"Well, I reckon this will do just fine but I suppose I better let maw see the house before we get too carried away. Could sit here for hours looking at this view and listening to the quiet.\"\n\nJason laughed and said, \"I agree with you on the view, but you better enjoy the quiet while you can. I suspect during the busy season this will be one noisy place. You'll have people all over yelling and carousing. You'll have boats coming and going hitting the dock for fuel or supplies and none of them seem willing to move slowly and quietly. It'll be even worse if Sue gets her way. She's talking about putting in pads for some campers and clearing spots for tents to rent out. She's even talking about turning two or three of the bedrooms into a B&B. I swear, you let that woman get a whiff of money and she tries to figure out some way to get it out of your hand and into hers.\"",
        "Hank laughed and said, \"Yep. She sure takes after her momma that way. I aint seen any Chinese woman that wasn't like that. They're all hard working people and know how to make a buck.\"\n\nHank tilted his head back and drained the last of the coffee from his mug. He started to get up and head back to the kitchen for more when he saw Wendi coming toward them carrying the pot. After she filled Hanks and Jason's cups Hank said, \"Well, woman, I've looked the house over and it suits me just fine. Now suppose you look it over and see if you wanta live here or find someplace else.\"\n\nWendi set the pot down and smiled at Jason. She said, \"I see. House look good outside. If inside as good, will be fine.\"\n\nWendi made her way inside the house leaving the men sitting and drinking coffee. From time to time they heard her as she opened or closed a door or moved from room to room. Finally she came back outside and said, \"House ok. We clean and move in just fine. You and Toby clean today. Rest of us have other work to do.\"\n\nWendi scurried back to the kitchen carrying the now empty coffee pot. Hank watched her a moment and then said, \"Well, I guess I've got my marching orders. Can you spare me from the shop for a day or two? And I guess we'll take you up on your offer.\"\n\n\"No problem. You need a hand on heavy stuff, give me a call. You can use my truck, too, if you need to haul anything.\"\n\nA week after Hank decided to stay and work with Jason they were interrupted in the shop almost at closing time by Jason's father. He came storming into the shop and grabbed Jason's shoulder. He pulled and turned him around away from the workbench. He was breathing heavily and his jaw was clenched in anger. He screamed, \"You ungrateful son of a bitch. I hope you're happy now you asshole. You're no son of mine. The damn government's taken the bank from us and is trying to either sell it or close it down because you took all that money out.\"\n\n\"Look, dad, I'm sorry you've got into trouble but I had nothing to do with it. You're the one that let your non-performing loans get you in this shape. I strongly suspect that piddling little check wouldn't be enough to have kept you solvent. At least, not for long. What are you and mom going to do, now? They haven't taken your savings have they?\"\n\n\"They got most of them, but, no, we still have four or five hundred thou in the brokerage account I don't think they can get to. All the rest I had put into the bank to help keep it going.\"\n\n\"Look, I don't know what to say. I just took what was owed me and I spent it for what it was meant to be spent for. I really don't have much of it left. I'm sure I don't have enough to make a difference and what I have is tied up in long-term investments I can't redeem easily. I'm sorry, dad, but I just can't help you.\"\n\nThe next morning the large headline glared from the front page of the daily paper, \"FDIC CLOSES LOCAL BANK. A local institution has sadly been taken over by the FDIC. A spokesman from the Federal Deposit Insurance Company said yesterday that the Shoal Creek State Bank no longer met the required asset to liability ratio and has been seized by the FDIC. He stated that all depositors were protected up to the maximum allowed by law. There were only three depositors who might lose any of their funds. They will keep the bank open for the foreseeable future while they try to find a buyer for the three bank chain. The Lowery family has owned and operated this bank since it first opened in 1887. Frederic Lowery was founder of the bank and his direct descendants have owned and operated the bank continuously since then. It proudly weathered the financial storm of the great depression and several other banking disasters since then, however, what everyone is calling the 'housing bubble' has proven too much for the bank and it was unable to maintain reserves required by the FDIC.\"\n\nAfter Jason read the article he put the paper down, took his coffee cup and walked silently out of the house. He headed down the path toward his favorite spot on the lakeshore, not speaking a word to anyone else in the kitchen. His family watched him until he was out of sight then Sue handed her mother the spatula, wiped her hands on a towel and followed him. As she left she said, \"You all go ahead and eat. We'll be back sometime and I'll make us something.\"\n\nWhen Sue got to the shoreline she saw Jason sitting on his favorite stump looking out over the lake. He had his forearms resting on his knees, his head slightly lowered and an expression of infinite sadness on his face. Sue walked up beside him and rested her hand on his shoulder then leaned slightly down to give him a hug.\n\nJason sighed and said, \"Dad never could say no to one of his buds. All my life I heard him complain about someone who was a big wig here in town having trouble making his payments. I never heard of him doing anything to force the big name guys to pay but boy would he go after someone he considered a nobody. I hate that this has happened but I'm not surprised. He only has himself to blame so why do I feel so damn guilty? I'm sure that piddling amount we got for this place wasn't enough to keep them solvent but what if it was? What if I could have kept this from happening?\"\n\n\"I can't answer that honey. In the full scheme of things, does it even matter? If it hadn't been you taking that money out, it could have been someone else, or one more loan could have gone sour and then the asset to liability ratio would have failed. If it really bothers you, why don't you see if you can talk to the FDIC? If it did matter and you want to, maybe you could infuse some of our cash into the bank and save it. I don't care honey. We can live just fine on what we make here. We don't need the couple hundred thousand we have in the investment accounts. Now come on. Let's get breakfast and get to work. We can't let mom and dad do it all.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right. I think I'll go to town and see if they'll talk to me.\"\n\nAfter breakfast Sue went to the dock and began working. On her way, she detoured past the shop and told her dad that Jason was going into town for a while.\n\nJason went straight to the bank when he got to town. He asked the manager's secretary, a woman he had known all his life, if he could see the man in charge. She looked around and said, \"I'm sorry Jason but he won't see anyone about their accounts. Those of us who worked here before have been told to close accounts if the customer wants and to transact business as normal while the FDIC does what it can to minimize their losses.\"\n\n\"Look Mable, I just want to see if I can help here. Dad says the money the attorney pulled from the trust account caused all this and most of that money was paid to me. He wanted it back to prevent this takeover and I told him he couldn't have it. I did spend a lot of it but I have a couple hundred thou if it would help.\"\n\nWhile Jason was talking to Mable a man came out of what used to be his father's office and listened to part of the conversation. He looked Jason over for a moment then said, \"Did I hear you correctly? You want to return some money you got from the bank that you think caused us to take it over?\"\n\n\"Yes, if it would make a difference.\"\n\n\"Would you come into my office for a moment please sir?\"\n\nAfter Jason was seated the man introduced himself and said, \"Now, what did you mean you took some of the money out of the banks reserves and you might want to return it?\"\n\n\"Well, I really didn't take any of the bank's money. I just cashed some large checks that were paid to me from a trust account held here in the bank. In all, I received around $250,000 from that account. Dad came to me wanting it back before you took over and I refused to give it to him. In fact, I spent some of the funds but I have a couple hundred thou I can put into the bank if it would help.\"\n\nThe man relaxed after Jason told him the whole story. He leaned back in his chair and said, \"Thank you for your offer Jason but you need to forget about it. We have reviewed that account and all the others. We couldn't find any problems with the depositor accounts and they are insured through our organization. The problems are all the non-performing loans this bank holds. Your father would have been better off to sell the loans to another institution that would bundle them and resell them to investors. He did sell some of the smaller loans but he held several loans from prominent people in the area. Many of those loans are non-performing and caused the bank to fail. Even if you returned the quarter mil the assets would not be affected enough to forestall seizure. The bottom line is, your father made some bad loans and they bit him on the ass. Thankfully, it appears as if the only ones who will be hurt by this failure are the shareholders of the banking corporation. That isn't always the case.\"\n\nJason sighed and stood. He leaned forward and offered his hand to shake as he said, \"Thank you for taking the time to clear this up for me. Dad laid a huge guilt trip on me when this came up and I've been afraid I caused all this by keeping the money.\"\n\nThe man laughed once, then looked guilty. He said, \"Forgive me. I know it's not funny and your family has lost a lot. Don't let him lay the guilt trip on you though. The paltry amount you received didn't even cause a ripple in the pond compared to the loans that really caused this failure. If he wants to lay a guilt trip on anyone, he should lay it on the loan officer that made those loans and on himself for not only approving them but for not foreclosing and trying to recoup some of his losses. Now we have to step in and clean up the mess. You have a good day now, Mr. Lowery.\"\n\nJason left the bank feeling somewhat better but he was still sad the family lost the banks. He made a couple purchases for the business while he was in town then returned to the marina. When he pulled up beside the shop he saw Sue leaning over the rail of the dock throwing up into the lake feeding the fishies.\n\nJason rushed up to Sue and put his hand on her shoulder. He asked, \"Are you ok honey? If you're sick why don't you go to the house and lay down? We can handle things without you.\"\n\n\"No, I'm ok. For some reason I've been nauseas off and on the last few days. I throw up a time or two and then I'm fine again. Must be allergies or something.\"\n\nSue continued to throw up occasionally and Jason finally made her go to the doctor. When she got back from her appointment she walked into the shop to see Jason. When he saw her, he smiled and wiped his hands off before he walked over to her. He said, \"Well, what did the Doctor say? Are you ok?\"\n\n\"I'm fine. He said my nausea will get better along and eventually go away.\" Sue looked up at Jason and smiled before she continued, \"Honey, I'm pregnant. I've been having morning sickness. That's all.\"\n\nSue looked at Jason worriedly as she watched his face. He looked shocked then he grinned and grabbed her in a tight hug. He lifted her up and gave her a kiss before putting her down on the ground again. \n\nAs Jason set Sue down he staggered forward from the hard hand slamming into his back. He turned to see his father-in-law standing there with a big smile on his face. Hank said, \"Congratulations, you two. That's great. How far along are you, honey? Do they know if it's a boy or a girl, yet?\"\n\nSue laughed and said, \"No, daddy, they don't know if it's a boy or a girl. I'm only about 8 weeks right now. And I'm fine. Now I have to get back to work.\"\n\nJason grabbed her hand and held onto it for a moment. He said, \"Are you sure you can go back to work? Do we need to hire someone to help you now?\"\n\n\"Jason, I'm fine. Now let me go. I have to help get ready for the lunch bunch. We'll talk about hiring someone to fill in for me later. I will need someone in the store and the snack bar later and after I have the baby but I'm fine now.\"\n\nThree weeks later Jason's youngest sister came to the shop to see him. When he saw her he was scared she was going to throw a fit or something. She stood looking at him for a moment then took a deep breath and said, \"Jason, I know you don't have any reason to want to help me, but I'm here asking anyway. You know I was using the stock dividends on the bank stock I inherited and my wages from the part time work I did at the bank for spending money at college. Now, I'm in trouble all around. Dad can't afford to pay my tuition any longer and I don't have the dividends or my job to live on or pay tuition. Do you have any job I can do? I really need a job. I'm afraid I'll have to drop out of school anyway but I know I will have to if I can't find a job.\"\n\nJason cleaned his hands off and walked up to his sister Meagan. He placed his hand in the small of her back and guided her to the chairs in what he still considered his break area. They sat down and Jason said, \"I can give you a job, Meagan, but it won't pay much. We haven't told anyone yet other than Sue's parent's, but she's pregnant and we'll need someone to fill in for her in the store and snack bar. I don't know how long the job will last after she has the baby, but it will be for a while. I pay minimum wage to start and I'll give a raise after you learn the job but it still won't be a lot.\"\n\nMeagan smiled and said, \"Thank you, Jason. I really appreciate it. When can I start?\"\n\n\"Monday works for me if it works for you. We almost need some part time help now so I'll just bring you on now to help with the summer rush and you'll be up to speed when the baby comes this fall.\"\n\nMeagan jumped up and hugged Jason. She kissed his cheek and said through her smile, \"Thanks again. I really appreciate it. And, Jason, I'm sorry about what Dad and sis said during the reading of the will and after. I know it isn't your fault gramps did things the way he did. At least, this way someone in the family still has some of our heritage. I really love the way you've made the place look since you got it.\"\n\nNovember 23 of that year, Jason Edward Lowery V was born. By the time his sister Gwendolyn was born two years later he was toddling around the shop and dock making sure pawpaw, mawmaw, dad, and mom, and auntie M did their jobs correctly. The bank was sold to one of the larger national banking corporations and remained open but now gave impersonal cookie cutter service that none of the patrons liked as well as what they lost.\n\nJason's father died three years after Gwendolyn was born. He was an embittered middle-aged man that still blamed Jason for the bank failure. Meagan remained an employee of the company Jason and Sue founded for the rest of her working career. Her husband was also a lifelong employee of the company. Their older sister left town and they lost touch with her. Jason's mother never completely forgave Jason for the perceived wrongs he did and she had little to do with him and not much more to do with Meagan. Sue's parents worked for Jason and Sue until their death, reducing their hours and responsibilities as they aged. They lived on site the entire time and watched their grandchildren grow and take their place as the future owners and operators of the business. Toby became the best known fishing guide on the lake, operating from the family dock his entire career."
