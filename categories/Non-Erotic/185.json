        "By Woodmanone copyright May, 2015\n\nIn this concluding chapter there are some ...well legal details that may not be strictly correct procedure. Please don't beat me up over it; I'm not a lawyer; just a guy trying to write a story.\n\nConstructive comments, critiques, and emails are welcome and I thank you for taking the time to make them.\n\n<center>********************</center>\n\nThe Hard Case Tavern is a large shotgun type space; in that it is narrow and long. No more than thirty feet wide it ran seventy feet to the back wall. There were small two person type tables along one wall and across a six foot wide aisle was an open front bar top with stools for the customers that ran almost the whole length of the room. At the far end of the room was a wide space that had five or so larger tables.\n\nI'd called Frank at 8 PM and he and three patrolmen were waiting for me in front of the building. At my suggestion, Frank was dressed differently than when he worked. A nice sports coat, a pinstriped shirt and dress jeans made him look like a regular guy out to have a drink. I motioned for him to come with me since he didn't look like a cop and that the three patrolmen should wait outside. \n\nEntering The Hard Case, I knew for two reasons that the big man at the end of the bar was Wiley Thornton. For one, he matched the description that Jasper and Boyd gave me. And the other reason was he was bending the ear of Sammy Hands, the manger of the tavern. Sammy works for Mr. Sigliaire and Wiley was trying to make a point as to why Vito should hire him. I pointed Wiley out to Frank and we walked to the end of the bar where Wiley and Sammy were standing.\n\n\"Let me buy you a drink Wiley,\" I offered. I motioned to the bartender.\n\n\"I know you?\" Wiley asked. He sort of puffed up like he was trying to impress or intimidate me.\n\n\"Not yet but you will.\" The bartender sat Wiley's new drink down. I stuck my fingers down inside his old glass, pulled it toward me, emptied the ice and remains of the drink into the sink behind the bar and stuck the glass into a clear plastic evidence envelope like the ones the police use. I handed the bag to Frank, he signed and noted the time and date on the bag. \"Hi Sammy, I'm Matt Steele. Give us a little room please.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sigliaire called and said you would be coming in.\" Then Sammy turned, walked to the end of the room and went into a door with the word Office on it.\n\n\"You're not very smart Wiley. I mean bragging about how you can make hits on people and other illegal things. Not very smart when you don't know who might be listening.\n\n\"So what if I talk,\" Wiley said and took a sip of his new drink. \"Can't be arrested for talking.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily so big guy,\" I answered. \"Jasper and Boyd aren't happy you let them rot in jail so they rolled over on you; told us about Robinson and the jobs you did for him.\"\n\n\"Big deal, it's their word against mine. A good lawyer will get the case dropped.\" Wiley stood and said, \"I'm done talkin to you punk. Now get out of my way.\" \n\nHe stood and walked toward me and when I wouldn't move he took a big round house swing at my head. One rule of bar fights, or any other fights for that matter, is you don't leave yourself open for a counter attack. I stepped inside Wiley's wide punch and put a short right hand deep into the V under his ribs where the sternum ends. \n\nA sharp blow to the solar plexus will disable even the largest tough guy. My well place fist drove the air out of Wiley's lungs and paralyzed his diaphragm for a few seconds. Wiley bent over, trying to catch his breath; just the result I had intended.\n\nI slid my jacket aside, let my Glock show and put my hand on the butt of the gun. \"Hey Wiley, I've heard all about how crazy you are...well, I'm a little crazy too. We're just having a good talk here,\" I continued. \"Why don't you stay for awhile?\" Wiley looked at my pistol from his bent over position and then into my eyes; he climbed back on his stool. Beside me Frank grunted to show he wasn't happy about me showing the gun.\n\n\"It's more than your word against Jasper and Boyd's. You see there were finger prints at the Hamilton fire and on the console of Cynthia Robinson's car. The prints weren't in the system but...\" I pointed at the evidence bag, \"I bet the prints on that glass will match up. Then we got you Wiley.\"\n\nTurning a little, without taking my eyes off Wiley, I said, \"This is Detective Wends of the St. Louis Police. He's here, among other things, to maintain the chain of evidence on your finger prints.\"\n\n\"You can't take my fingerprints unless you arrest and charge me,\" Wiley protested. \"You got nothin to charge me with.\"\n\n\"So wrong my large friend. That glass is public property after you pushed it aside...so we can use it. Plus your boy's dropping a dime on you gives Detective Wends here enough reason to take you in for questioning.\"\n\nWiley glanced at Frank. \"So go ahead and take me in.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Frank said, stood up and pulled out his hand cuffs. He put them on Wiley and said, \"Wiley Thornton you are wanted for questioning concerning the murders of George Hamilton and Cynthia Robinson. You have the right to an attorney.... and finished reading Wiley his rights.\n\n\"Now Wiley, I've...we... have a deal for you,\" I said. \"Between your boys rolling over on you and these fingerprints,\" I pointed to Wiley's glass. \"You're going to pay for killing Hamilton and Cynthia Robinson. How bad you pay is up to you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean how bad,\" Wiley said. He wasn't as arrogant and fearless as he had been.\n\n\"Testify that Robinson hired you and paid you to kill Hamilton and his wife. Detective Wends and I will tell the DA how you cooperated and get you a deal.\"\n\n\"What kind of deal?\"\n\n\"You're going down Wiley. I'm pretty sure the detective and I can get the DA to take the death penalty off the table. You'll still go to jail for a long, long time but at least you'll be alive.\" I looked at Wiley. \"What'da you say Wiley?\"\n\nNow it was Wiley's turn to stare at Frank and me. After a few seconds, that seemed much longer he answered me. \"I think I'll wait and talk to my lawyer.\"\n\nFrank nodded and used his radio to call the patrolmen waiting outside to come in. We watched as the cops lead the suspect out to a patrol car. They would take Wiley to Central Booking at Police Headquarters downtown on 9th street. Frank would have to go the headquarters and do the paper work on the arrest. He poked me when we got to his car.\n\n\"You realize that as soon as Thornton meets with his attorney, the attorney will demand the report on the finger prints,\" Frank said in an exasperated voice. \"And we won't have anything to give him. Thornton will walk and I'll be lucky not to be walking a beat again. Matt, I'm too old to go back to foot patrol.\"\n\n\"Not true,\" I replied shaking my head. \"I checked with an attorney friend of mine who works for Markham and Sylvester.\"\n\n\"You mean that damn high priced criminal defense firm?\" I nodded and continued.\n\n\"My buddy, he wants to stay anonymous, said that we have to charge Thornton and then the DA has to get the Grand Jury to indict him and a prosecutor assigned before we have to hand over the evidence. Don't charge him; just hold him for questioning for 48 hours.\"\n\n\"What good would that do? I can't manufacture evidence and all we have is Jasper and Boyd's statement.\" \n\n\"You interrogate Thornton, with his attorney present, but follow my lead,\" I answered and grinned. \"We'll get him Frank, I'm sure of it.\" \n\n<center>********************</center>\n\nFrank set a large digital tape recorder on the table and turned it on. We were in an interview room at the Police Central Booking building; in the days before political correctness it was an interrogation room.\n\n\"For the record, I am Detective Frank Wends of the St. Louis Police and will be recording this interview. Also present are the perp... I mean suspect Wiley Thornton.\" Frank pointed at Wiley's attorney and said, \"Please identify yourself for the record counselor.\"\n\n\"Attorney Phillip Stone, Public Defender's Office, representing Mr. Thornton.\" \n\nFrank said, \"Thank you Mr. Stone. Looking at me he added, \"Also in attendance is Matt Steele, a consultant on this case for the St. Louis Police Department. Mr. Thornton you are a suspect in the murders of a Mr. George Hamilton and Mrs. Cynthia Robinson; do you have anything you would like to say at this time?\" \n\nBefore Stone could respond, Wiley said, \"Prove it.\" He sat back in his chair and put his shackled hands on the table in front of him. He looked unafraid and pleased with himself.\n\nFrank's cell phone beeped at him, letting him know he had a text message. He punched a button, looked at the message and stood up. \"Excuse me,\" Frank said and stood up. Holding up his phone he said, \"This is something I have to attend to. I'll be right back.\" He reached over, turned off the recorder and left the room.\n\nNow it was my turn to put the pressure on Wiley. \"We've got you seven ways from Sunday Wiley,\" I told him. \"When the results of the fingerprint test come back, you'll be placed at the scene of both murders.\" I looked from Wiley to his attorney and back. \"Unless of course you are innocent,\" I offered. \"And we both know that ain't so.\"\n\n\"We will of course expect you to turn over any exculpatory evidence that you have,\" Stone interrupted me before I could continue. \"In fact, I would like to see that evidence before you continue to talk with my client.\" He sat back, now he was the one that looked very pleased with himself.\n\n\"I'm not an attorney,\" I replied. \"But I believe that since Mr. Thornton hasn't been charged or indicted that the state isn't required to give you investigative results.\"\n\n\"He hasn't been charged? Then why is he in jail?\"\n\n\"We brought Mr. Thornton in for questioning,\" Frank answered as he reentered the room with a well dressed young woman. She was tall, slender and very pretty; she would have been a huge distraction if the situation wasn't so serious. Frank pushed a button and turned the recorder back on.\n\n\"Wiley if you decide to tell the truth, you'll a nice prize.\" Turning to Frank I said, \"Detective Wends please tell our contestant what he'll win.\"\n\n\"This is Assistant District Attorney Geraldine Sawyer.\" He pulled out a chair for the ADA and she sat down across from Wiley and his attorney. \"If you give us a statement as to your involvement and the person or persons that hired you she will personally talk to the DA in your behalf.\" Frank sighed and added, \"You're going down Wiley; your might as well make it as easy on yourself as you can.\"\n\nStone pulled on Wiley's arm and they put their heads together to talk. After several minutes, Stone looked at Sawyer and Frank. \"You have to take the death penalty out of the equation. Then my client will make a statement.\"\n\nADA Sawyer waited for about 15 seconds before she responded; I'm sure it seemed longer to Wiley. \"If Mr. Thornton will be truthful and forthcoming the DA's office will not be seeking the death penalty.\" Stone whispered something to Wiley and turned back to Sawyer. \"However,\" Sawyer continued, \"A life sentence or life with the possibility of parole after twenty five years is very probable and acceptable.\"\n\nI looked at ADA Sawyer, trying to catch her eye. Geraldine, Gerry, and I had worked together several times while I was still a Detective First Class for the St. Louis Police. We were friends and that is why I'd asked her to participate in our little play. Her statement was a little less than I'd hoped for; I'd wanted her to apply the screws to Wiley. I guess she had rules and such that she had to follow and so far she hadn't stepped over the line. \n\nWe hadn't officially told Gerry about the little escapade with Thornton's drink glass, so technically we hadn't stepped over the line either. I didn't have the same rules and since it was me doing the talking at the bar, Frank had sort of turned his head.\n\nEveryone was quiet for a while and then Frank said, \"Thornton?\"\n\nTurning back from talking to his lawyer Thornton said, \"Okay. What'da you want to know?\"\n\n\"Did you murder George Hamilton and Cynthia Robinson?\" Gerry asked. \"And if so why?\"\n\nGetting a nod from his attorney Wiley answered. \"Yeah, I did them two. The broad's husband,\" at a look from Gerry he said, \"A guy named Robinson, hired me to put them down. He paid me a hundred Gs to do it.\"\n\n\"Would that be Jonathan Robinson, Cynthia Robinson's husband,\" Gerry prompted. Wiley nodded. \"A verbal answer is necessary Mr. Thornton.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's the guy.\"\n\n\"Did he say why he wanted them dead?\" \n\nAt first Wiley shook his head, saw the look on Gerry's face, remember her instructions and answered, \"Naw, he just said to do em both. First Hamilton and a few weeks later the wife.\"\n\n\"How did you murder them?\"\n\n\"That Hamilton guy had a boat he kept up on Alton Lake. I disconnected the air pump that keeps the, what'da you call it....oh yeah, the bilge free of gas fumes. Then I scraped the insulation off the starter wires and when he turned the key it caused a spark. \n\nThat ignited the gas fumes and the boat blew up and burned. The guy was sitting behind the wheel when it went off. I watched from up on the high dirt berm above the marina...you know, in case it didn't work I could go down and finish the job.\"\n\n\"What about Cynthia Robinson?\"\n\n\"I car jacked her comin out of one of those fancy stores out in Frontenac. Her arms were full of packages and she was havin a problem getting them into the car. I snuck up behind her and smacked the hell out of her.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Robinson was severely beaten,\" Frank put in.\n\n\"The bitch didn't go down the first time I hit her and it made me mad....Anyway, after I knocked her out, I threw her into the passenger side and drove down under the Eads Bridge. Then I shot her.\"\n\n\"Where did you shoot her and what type of gun did you use?\" Gerry was going to get all the information so there would be no way Wiley could slip out of the deal.\n\n\"Used a silenced .22 and shot her in the back of the head.\"\n\nI was upset that two innocent people, who I sort of knew, had been killed because of information I'd given to Robinson and killed so viciously. What bothered me more was Wiley's total lack of shame and the dispassionate way he told what he had done. In fact he seemed almost proud of his actions. Gerry looked at Frank and then at me to see if we had any more questions; we shook our heads.\n\nTurning back to Wiley she said, \"Mr. Thornton, the DA's office will honor the agreement we made due to the facts you've given us tonight and because of your agreed forthcoming testimony in court.\" Wiley smiled and leaned back in his chair. \"But,\" Gerry continued, \"I'm going to do my best to see that you go to a particularly tough prison. Like the Jefferson City Correctional Center also known as Booneville.\" \n\n\"Booneville is as bad as Attica or Alcatraz ever were in their day, isn't it Assistant District Attorney Sawyer?\" I asked.\n\n\"The correctional Center is considered to be one of the worst prisons west of the Mississippi,\" Gerry answered. \"I mean as far as prisoner safety.\"\n\nI turned and smiled at Thornton. \"Hope you enjoy your new home Wiley. I'm sure the guys there will welcome you with open arms....I mean a nice looking fresh young man like yourself and all.\"\n\nFrank rose and walked around the table to stand beside Wiley. \"Stand up,\" he ordered. When Wiley was on his feet, Frank continued. \"Wiley Thornton you are under arrest for the murders of George Hamilton and Cynthia Robinson.\" He pulled a laminated card out of a compartment in his police ID leather folder. Frank read Wiley his Miranda rights for a second time. \n\n\"You should have read my client his rights before questioning,\" Stone protested.\n\n\"He was just being questioned now, he's under arrest.\" Frank gave Stone and Wiley an evil grin. \"And I did read him his rights when I brought him in for questioning. Sides you were with him during the questioning so his attorney was already present. So we're good.\"\n\nWalking to the door, Frank opened it and called out to one of the jail house police. \"Put this piece of garbage in a cell until he's arraigned; a cell not the holding tank.\" The cop grabbed Wiley's arm and marched him deeper into the building. Stone left to make arrangements to talk with his client some more.\n\n\"I hope this holds up,\" I said. \"I want Wiley to pay for this but I want Robinson more.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about your actions at the Hard Case Tavern,\" Gerry looked at me and smiled. \"But this was legal,\" she reassured me. \"And if we push hard Stone will go along. Next time call me for an easy one guys. See ya.\" She left the room to go prepare her case.\n\n\"That young lady is as hard as nails,\" I said.\n\n\"Geraldine Sawyer wants to be our next DA,\" Frank replied. \"And I wouldn't bet against her.\"\n\nFrank and I left the Central Booking complex and got to where his police car was parked illegally in a loading zone. \n\n\"Should you be parked here in a loading zone?\" I asked and grinned.\n\n\"I was unloading a case for a killer. Besides, who is gonna give what is obviously an unmarked police car a ticket.\" He smiled back at me. \"Men and women in the Traffic Division aren't stupid; the car could belong to one of the brass and that's a load of crap the patrolmen don't need.\"\n\n\"When are you going to get Robinson? I'd like to go with you; I have a vested interest in this.\" Frank hesitated for a bit and I waited hopefully.\n\n\"Well Partner,\" Frank answered in a bad John Wayne imitation, \"I reckon we could go to his office and corral him right now. Guess it wouldn't hurt if y'all moseyed along with the posse.\" Frank changed his voice back to normal and added, \"I thought I'd arrest him in front of the people who work or do business with him. Sorta in front of God and everybody.\"\n\nI went to the passenger door of Frank's car, opened it and said, \"I like your style cowboy. Let's hit the trail; we're burnin daylight.\"\n\n\"Your imitation is worse than mine. Get in the car.\"\n\n\"Called a mutual friend early this morning,\" Frank said. He gave me some interesting information.\"\n\n\"What mutual friend?\"\n\n\"Ricky Willard.\" Frank sounded a little angry.\n\n\"Oh, Ricky,\" I answered brilliantly. I didn't like Frank's tone because I didn't want Ricky to get into trouble for helping me.\n\n\"You remember Ricky don't you?\" Frank continued in a sarcastic voice. \"The guy who is a consultant for cyber crimes for the St. Louis Police Department not for Matt Steele Investigations. The same one that gave you information on the Robinsons.\" \n\n\"C'mon Frank. Ricky just did me a favor. Hell, it took him less than an hour: I'll pay the damned Department for his time.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you ass.\" Frank paused and added, \"You can't use police resources to help with your business Matt. Understand?\" I didn't answer or reply. \"You're not gonna listen to me are you?\" \n\n\"The only resources I use are friends and colleagues: like you and Ricky. \"I don't ask you guys to do anything illegal and in Ricky's case he said he did the work on his lunch break.\" I smiled at Frank for the first time since we'd gotten into the car. \"What did you find out?\"\n\nFor a minute I thought my friend was going to ignore me. He stared straight ahead and then took a deep breath and let it out. \"I had Ricky look into Robinson's financials.\"\n\n\"That's all he did for me,\" I offered. \"Cynthia had all the money.\"\n\nFrank nodded. \"Yeah, but that check didn't show a withdrawal Robinson made just after Hamilton's boat blew up with him in it. There was another withdrawal, of the same amount, after Cynthia Robinson was killed.\" He glanced over at me to make sure he had my attention. \n\n\"Each withdrawal was for fifty thousand dollars. In case you can't add, that's a total of one hundred thousand; the same amount Thornton said he was paid.\" Frank smiled. \"Along with Thornton's testimony that should tie up Mr. Jonathan Robinson.\"",
        "\"\"How are we going to do this?\" \n\n\"We... aren't going to do anything,\" Frank answered. \"In my capacity as a Detective for the St. Louis Police, I...will arrest Robinson. I got a warrant while you were talking to ADA Sawyer; that's why I left the room for a few minutes. You can come along, but understand Matt it is only as a favor from me. Don't screw it up.\"\n\n\"You know I told Robinson just after his wife was killed that I was gonna make sure he answered for Cynthia and Hamilton.\" I smiled at Frank and asked, \"Can I at least tell him I told you so?\" Frank shook his head, smiled and kept driving.\n\n<center>********************</center>\n\nThat girl gets prettier every time I see her, I thought as Frank and I entered Robinson's outer office. \"Hello, Mr. Steele, nice to see you again,\" the efficient young woman said. \"Mr. Robinson is in a meeting; please have a seat. He shouldn't be too long.\"\n\nFrank stepped up to her desk and showed her his detective badge and ID. \"I don't think we'll wait Miss.\" He turned and I followed him through the thick carved wooden door into the main office. I saw the secretary reach for her phone, but I held up a finger and shook my head. She replaced the receiver onto its base.\n\nJonathan Robinson and three other men were sitting at a conference table placed in front of the floor to ceiling windows in the north east corner of the huge office. There was a fourth, younger, man with a very large computer monitor mounted on a sort of cart standing between the table and the windows. He was giving some type of presentation because there were graphs and pie charts showing on the screen.\n\nHow anyone can pay attention to a computer monitor with that view of the Mississippi River is beyond me, I thought. Frank stepped toward the table with me following in his wake. He held up his ID when he got to Robinson who had stood as Frank and I walked in.\n\n\"Jonathan Robinson, you are under arrest.\" Frank said.\n\n\"What is the charge?\" Robinson asked. His voice showed more anger that someone would disrupt his 'oh so important meeting' than fear.\n\n\"We'll start with premeditation to commit murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder; both before and after the fact and conspiracy to commit a felonious act. That will do for a start.\" Frank again took a laminated card out of his ID folder and started to read Robinson his rights.\n\nRobinson made a break as soon as Frank looked down at the card. He got past Frank and headed toward the door at a run. Unfortunately for Robinson he had to get past me as well; he didn't make it. I snapped a straight left hand into his jaw. He took a step backward and fell onto the seat of his pants. \n\nMoving until I was standing over Robinson I said, \"I told you I'd see you got what is coming to you Jonathan.\" The name Jonathan was said with sarcasm. \"The fact that I just reminded you doesn't seem to be enough but it will have to do.\"\n\nFrank rolled Robinson over onto his stomach and none too gently handcuffed him. \"Guess we'll have to add fleeing from an officer and obstruction of justice to the charges.\" He pulled and helped his prisoner to his feet.\n\n\"Did I get involved too much?\" I asked with an innocent look.\n\n\"Shut up,\" Frank replied with fake anger. \"Let's get Mr. Robinson to his new home.\"\n\n<center>********************</center>\n\n\"I think we should sand and refinish the wainscoting,\" I told Abby. \"I've never understood why people would want to paint over outstanding wood like this.\" \n\nWe were working on the renovation of the huge old house in Compton Heights that I'd bought for us. We'd decided to restore the place to its former glory while updating things like the plumbing, wiring and windows plus the heating and cooling systems. The large floor to ceiling windows were open to let in the soft summer breeze. This helped get rid of the paint smell from the other rooms. \n\nBefore she could answer my cell phone gave out its loud annoying ring. \"Matt Steele,\" I answered in a less than friendly voice. I hate that damn phone; it's a necessity but I still hate it.\n\n\"It's Frank, Matt. Thought I'd let you know that the DA threw the book at Robinson; wouldn't let him plea bargain down to lesser charges. Told Robinson he was going to pay fully for his crimes.\" Frank chuckled and added, \"The DA said he was going to prosecute the case himself. After all, it is an election year.\"\n\nIt had been better than three months since we...I mean Frank Wends had arrested Jonathan Robinson. \"Good to hear buddy. Let me know when the trial will start; I'd like to see his face when the charges are read to him and I'd like to see his face when he hears the guilty verdict. By the by, if you and the Mrs. would like to join Abby and me, we are going to Rigazzi's about 7.\"\n\n\"Robinson?\" Abby asked as I hung up. I nodded. \"Good, now you can get your mind back on our house.\"\n\n\"Our house is it?\" I asked in a serious voice with a serious look on my face. Abby looked hard at me; not knowing if I was kidding or not.\n\nI walked over to my jacket lying on the old dining room table and took a sheave of papers out of the inside pocket. Handing her the papers I waited for her to read the top one. After a few seconds she looked at me again but this time with a little smile.\n\n\"That's the new deed and as you can see it lists the owners as Matthew and Abigail Steele,\" I told her. \"To make it legal, I suppose we should get married.\" I watched as her smile got bigger and put an engagement ring on her finger. \"And by the way, I love you.\"\n\nAbby looked at the ring then slipped it up and down on her finger. Holding it up to the light she said, \"I've always wanted to be a property owner.\"\n\nThe End"
