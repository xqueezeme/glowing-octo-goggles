If I remember right it is also the launching point of our race to the twelve planets of the realm.\"\n\nTypree could still only stare opened mouth at his cousin. What was going on? This was earth it had to be but Tikal and Acropolis? Shutting his mouth Typree was having a most difficult time wrapping his mind around the whole idea.\n\n\"So you pretty much knew this whole damn time exactly where we were?\" Typree stated incredulously.\n\n\"Since you got here yes. I wasn't all that sure when we first arrived. I had to factor in everything that I saw before I could come to that conclusion. You forget I had been doing research in our present time about all of this on the earth of our time.\" Ambrose told Typree.\n\n\"So you really believe that this IS the actual launch point of our people to the realm.\" Typree said still in shock.\n\n\"Oh yes, I most certainly do. Though at the moment we need to get as many moved from here as we can. The city is about to be attacked within a minton. We have to get all of them out that we can. I believe that the introduction of both your ships will facilitate that at a greater rate.\" Ambrose told his cousin.\n\nNodding Typree jumped to his feet as he and Ambrose started to direct the emptying of the other two ships as fast as possible.\n\n\"Roth?\" Ambrose said a moment later into his com. \"Any more movement with the attackers?\"\n\nIt was silent a moment before Roth came back. \"No sire it appears that they are holding ceremonies before they decide to attack. From the few scouts that we have captured they are really in no hurry to attack as they think that the city will fall no matter what.\"\n\n\"Alright keep an eye out for anything that you perceive as a threat to what we are doing. With the addition of the other two ships this should go a hell of a lot faster. We've only three hundred there right now. Not nearly enough as far as I am concerned.\" Ambrose advised Roth.\n\n\"Yes Sire, we will keep on it 'til the last.\" Roth replied.\n\nAmbrose nodded at his comp. at least they were being afforded the time to move these people. Four hundred had been a help though most of them was by far better. Watching he just hoped that six hundred more moved each time would speed things up.\n\nA moment later the king walked up nodding his head. \"It makes my heart soar that the other gods have granted you more help lord Cit-Chac-Coh. It appears that most of the gods wish for our people to continue. This is great news to me and the warriors.\" Then with a more determined look the king bowed. \"You will not be disturbed great lord. We will make sure of that, this honor will strengthen us.\"\n\nBoth the king and Ambrose watched as the three ships were now being loaded. Sighing Ambrose was glad that they were taking eight hundred this time rather than two hundred. He just hoped that it was enough to start things as they should be. Then shaking his head he felt that it wasn't even half of what they needed but it felt a hell of a lot better that was sure.\n\nFinally loaded all three ships started toward the new world for the people. Upon landing they were again greeted by Timora and her father a wide smile on his face. \"So it seems that the other gods also wish for our continued survival.\" He said as he surveyed the other two ships and the amount of people leaving the ship.\n\nAmbrose could only nod as he took the Doctor aside. \"Soon we will need to give the cure to the rest of them. I am more concerned getting them here for now. We have twelve hundred now. A small part of the city, though I feel we need all that we can.\"\n\nHippacamp nodded as he thought about all that had been said. \"Though that is a good many, the city held by far a great many more than that. Though as I said lord this many is a great start to us being here. We are doing all we can to set up everything that we can. Many have seen great amounts of game that they seem eager to start providing food for us with.\"\n\nAmbrose nodded he too could already feel the great shift that was occurring with time and among those that had already changed. It seemed that their feline side was trying to come to the surface already.\n\nLooking back Ambrose saw that the last of the ships were unloaded. \"We will return soon, watch them well see if you can get guards set up as soon as possible. Though you are stronger there still may be dangers that need to be faced.\n\nAll three ships launched as soon as the doors were closed. \"We need to keep going as much as possible. I know we have twelve hundred there now though as I said we need as many as we can get. I am so afraid that we will miss someone changing our time for the worse. On the way back I need everyone to give the units of blood that we are going to need.\"\n\nTypree made his way to me as soon as we landed. \"I just hope that we have enough now. From what you told me we have enough for at least five thousand.\"\n\nAmbrose nodded as he started to do the numbers in his head. It was a fair start though he wasn't all that sure about using his, Typree's or Adina's blood considering the abilities that their three geno's contained. \"I suggest that we keep yours. mine and Adina's plasma and blood out of most of the people. I know for a fact as I am sure you do also the headache these abilities can be.\"\n\nTypree was smiling when Ambrose said this. \"Well to you cousin I can see that. Remember that the rest of us only got one maybe two. You are the only one that I have ever seen have far more than the rest of us.\" Ambrose was about to speak when his com went off. \"What's wrong Roth?\" Ambrose said concerned.\n\n\"I've got a prisoner that you might want to talk to. He tells a very interesting story.\" Roth reported.\n\n\"Alright I'll be there in a specton,\" Ambrose told his knight.\n\n\"You want company?\" Typree asked as soon as Ambrose signed off.\n\n\"No for now we are still secure here. I am just hoping that it holds long enough for us to get most of them away.\" A specton later Ambrose was walking toward Roth and Glenna. He could see Roth was hanging on to an obviously struggling youth.\n\n\"Ah! Here he comes now!\" Leaning close Roth whispered in the youth's ears, \"I suggest you not lie to him he will know.\"\n\nThe youth started renewed struggles 'til the tall, long shadow of Ambrose fell over him.\n\nLooking up the youth started to laugh even though Ambrose towered over him. Roth smacked the teen across the face, \"I told you to be respectful! So you really want to incur his wrath!\"\n\nAgain the teen began to laugh at Ambrose and Roth. \"This is no god! A very powerful warrior yes but no god. He...\" Then the teen was struck silent as Ambrose started to shift into his feline form. Suddenly the teen's face held a look of abject horror as he tried to throw his body on the ground at Ambrose's paws. \"I am sorry Cit-Chac-Coh! We did not realize that you were protecting this city.\"\n\nAmbrose looked over at Roth and Glenna who both had huge grins on their faces. Shaking his head he drew himself up to his full height as he looked down at the teen. \"For now I am protecting this city. The others will be here in a few of your days to exact that which they will want. I know that your leaders were told to attack here. This I will not stop as it is written that Tikal will fall.\"\n\nThe teen was nodding too terrified to look up at Ambrose. \"It is as you say lord. Much ceremony is being done before this happens. You are a god, you are invited to celebrate with us.\" The teen said thinking he could get in good with Ambrose.\n\n\"I have no time for such as this!\" Ambrose roared making the youth tremble. \"I will say this though, if they attack before the appointed time I and the warriors from the slave pits of the underworld will exact a most terrible revenge. I will release you though I will keep my eye on you. Do not make me have to rip your soul apart in disgrace!\" Ambrose growled feeling he'd gone a little over the top with the teen. The teen gasped as Ambrose lifted him off the ground. Staring into the teens eyes Ambrose could see that the young man was about to lose control of his bodily functions. Throwing the young man away from him Ambrose pointed to the enemy camp. Scrambling the youth bowed at Ambrose's paws then ran as fast as he could from where they were.\n\n\"A most masterful performance Sire, again I am more than sure your father would be proud.\" Roth said a huge smile on his face.\n\n\"That's all and good Roth, though I wonder if that will really help? He is just a youth they may not take him at his word. Hell the way things are going I may have to make an appearance in their camp.\" Ambrose told a suddenly serious Roth and Glenna.\n\n\"You do realize that we would of course go with you. One wrong move I can guarantee that they would lose a substantial amount before they got us.\" Then Roth was rubbing his human chin, \"then again to die in battle would be most honorable.\"\n\n\"I know my old friend though as meaningless as this battle would be I don't advise it.\" Ambrose told Roth.\n\nRoth's eyes were wide then he nodded as what Ambrose meant struck home. \"I know though it is still a shame that we can't battle a little. You know I am anxious for battle again!\"\n\nAmbrose could smile at Roth, he himself was anxious for battle though it was more for his uncle than anyone else.\n\n\"I believe we will have far more than we can handle when we return home.\" Ambrose told the still anxious Roth and Glenna.\n\nA flicker of delight seemed to light up Roth's face as he nodded. \"I am truly looking forward to that Sire. The chance to put things as they should be has my blood boiling with anticipation!\"\n\nAmbrose nodded as he then headed back to the ships. They had moved a few though they needed to keep going.\n\nIt was several Totons later that the ships settled after another three loads of people. So far today they had forty four hundred people to the new home world of Xendra. Shaking his head Ambrose felt more was right though he still felt that a lot was missing.\n\nSkylos walked up a moment later with a worried look on his face. \"Sire? I was just checking the readings on the taak'in. As I said before we can make the solid form work though I am afraid it starts to destabilize after a time. After this trip I am afraid I am going to have to replace almost all of it. I could really use the liquid form better.\"\n\nAmbrose was nodding with a grim look on his face. The way things were going right now they might not get a chance to actually get any of the liquid form. Most of the smelting pits were cold and dark plus it appeared that they had been that way for a while. \"Alright let's get this latest group then we'll worry about that when we return.\"\n\nSkylos nodded moving off though the still worried look on his face wasn't boding all that well with Ambrose. Shit! He thought that was all we needed was for the ships to fail just when they were starting to make actual headway!\n\nOpening his com. Ambrose called his cousin. \"Is everything alright?\" Ambrose heard Typree ask.\n\n\"I was just talking to Skylos. He seems to have concerns about the solid taak'in that we are all using. Apparently it has started to destabilize in our ship. I am just hoping that we can make at least this trip before it starts to fail. We have a small supply on board though as I remember it took a bit of time for Skylos to fit what he needed in the reactors.\" Ambrose told his cousin.\n\n\"So you think that you might have problems with them on the way there or back?\" Typree asked.\n\n\"I'm not all that sure. Skylos and Twitty are far better engineers than I am. For now I am going to have to trust what he says. He does after all knows the ship better than almost anyone.\" Ambrose replied.\n\n\"Alright cousin we'll be ready in case there is any type of failure, though I hope it doesn't accrue. Having you in danger both these times hasn't sat all that well with me, especially with Adina. Uh...\" Typree said suddenly serious.\n\nAmbrose's eyes raised as he waited for his cousin to continue. \"Is there a problem cousin? Ambrose finally asked.\n\n\"It's just a hard feeling I have been getting lately. About you and uh...\" Typree started then hesitated.\n\nSighing in frustration Ambrose stated, \"just tell me cousin you know hardly anything can startle me.\"\n\n\"Well it's about Adina, she uh ... well it appears that she was serious about there being no other that she was interested in. It appears that you and you only are the ideal male for her at least to her mind...\" Typree finally let out.\n\nThere was an outraged shout as Adina's thoughts were suddenly interjecting. [That happens to be none of your business!] They both heard her shout.\n\nGruffly Typree answered, [It happens to be ALL my business! You are still my sister and the princess of Mandria as well as the sub princess of Xendra! Don't you dare try to cross me on this Adina!]\n\nGrowling fiercely Adina answered, [I still think it is none of your business! My life as it is, is my own! I will take a mate with whomever I wish. I dare you to try and stop me!] Adina's thoughts roared to the both of them.\n\nAmbrose started to laugh 'til he felt Adina's angry thoughts turn toward him. [Don't think I am letting you off the hook either cousin! When there is time we WILL discuss this further!] Ambrose groaned this was all he needed was another pissed off female at him.\n\n[Yes, we will much later after all these people are safe. Until such time as that this is closed, for the BOTH of you! I mean it Typree there is far too much left to do with the time we have left.] Ambrose said forcefully making the brother and sister cringe a bit.\n\n[Yes Sire,] they both answered before they were both quiet. Shaking his head Ambrose wondered what Pandora's box had he opened now?\n\nAmbrose breathed a sigh as they made open space. This would make 5200 that they had moved. Not as many as he hoped but a fair amount that now all that he felt wrong with time was finally starting to feel more like it should.\n\nLanding Ambrose saw that those there were working as fast as they could to get shelters up. Walking to Hippacamp Ambrose handed him a box full of a great many vials. \"You need to start while we are gone. There is enough here for all that haven't gotten it yet. Remember that some will react rather violently.\"\n\nHippacamp nodded as he listened intensely to every word that Ambrose told him. \"I will get started as soon as I can. As fast as I can though the worse are cured I am afraid that those that are healthy may soon succumb.\"\n\nAmbrose nodded then thought of the other problem he was having. \"It may be a bit of time before we return. We are having a bit of trouble that we have to take care of. Then there is the threat to all those still back in Tikal. I am afraid that I will have to go to the camp of the enemy to put their ideas of attacking early away.\"\n\nHippacamp was listening again with rapt attention, \"they are not to be trusted my lord. They have always been deceitful, hateful neighbors jealous of all our great city has done. It is good that our people will be able to exist without the hatred of them.\"\n\nAmbrose nodded then clapped the man on the shoulder as he again boarded the ship for the return trip. They were a full twenty two spectons into the trip within sight of earth when the ship started to slow.\n\nTwitty flew past Ambrose as she head toward the engine room. \"Keep one going as long as you can Skylos!\" He heard Twitty shout as he heard her opening and closing several locked components.\n\n\"I'm trying!\" He heard Skylos shout back. \"The odd shapes are starting to destabilize the entire power unit. No! Not that one the next! Round! More round, better now the next.\"\n\nAmbrose could feel the ship getting slower and slower. Not now damn it of all times! Walking on the command deck Ambrose asked. \"How bad is it?\"\n\n\"We appear to have lost over half our power, that plus one of the engines has stalled out. It's taking all I can to keep the other going. If we lose that we are dead in space. Yes! better Queen Twitty that got us another five percent. Try the next! Oh shit!\" Skylos suddenly shouted as he grabbed two masks handing one to Ambrose then he took off at a run to the engine room. A moment later the entire ship went dark, oh shit was right Ambrose thought."
