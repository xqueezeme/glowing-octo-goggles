        "A part of this chapter was inspired by an idea that Baron Rod and I collaborated on late one night after he read Chapter 7 I thought it added quite a bit to the story.\n\n*****\n\nShelby had engaged the hyper-drive as soon as she could, almost immediately two of the remaining Ranger ships gave chase. \"Status Shelby,\" Derrick asked groaning trying to sit up and get off the bio-bed. \n\n\"At present we have two of the remaining three operative First Class Ranger ships giving chase; I estimate that we will be out of their sensor range in twenty five minutes thirty three seconds.\" Shelby reported. \"DERRICK!\" Shelby yelled, \"you are still too unstable to attempt to stand. Please rest 'til such time the bio-bed has allowed you to exit.\" Derrick grumbled but lay back down, watching as they quickly out distanced the following ships. \n\n\"Are you picking up any transmissions from the Rangers?\" Derrick asked. \n\n\"Yes Derrick, apparently the commanding officer of the ship that fired on us has been taken into custody.\" Shelby reported. \"They are trying to speculate as to who we are, no one has said anything, and they are still calling us an extremely fast ship, attacked without provocation. Apparently they are preparing an apology for us for the offense, and that no charges will be brought up against us.\" The mouth of the Shelby hologram dropped open. \"They want us to come to the Republic capital for it.\" \n\nDerrick growled, there was no way in hell that he was EVER going near that den of iniquity again. Shelby noticed that Derrick's heart rate and pulse had increased. \n\n\"Derrick, are you alright? I am detecting your heart beating faster and massive amounts of adrenaline being released by your body.\" Shelby asked a little afraid. \n\n\"I will be Shelby; the Capital is a place I want to never be in or near ever again.\" Derrick spit out his anger growing more by the second. \"I was disgraced through the streets when I refused to re-enlist; I was their greatest hero 'til I refused to kill for those asinine pricks anymore. If I could I'd destroy the entire city and every THING that claims to be alive there.\" For a moment, Shelby was shocked at the sudden burst of anger from Derrick, but then she remembered the many atrocities that she had seen in Derrick's head. Most by the other Republic troops, Derrick had tried to keep his self out of it to no avail. No wonder Derrick's anger is so great she thought, those were horrible things that he and his men had been forced to do. \n\nSighing she wondered how Derrick had stayed sane in all that time, how he had managed to remain a decent person. It would be several hours before the bio-bed was going to release him, Derrick decided to get an update. \n\n\"Shelby, any word from Conner?\" He asked. \n\n\"The last I had from him was that he'd arrived at the point the others were and was tri-angling our position, though we are almost one tenth of the way to where he left the others. I estimate it will take six days, ten hours thirty minutes to get there.\" Shelby reported. \n\n\"I am afraid that taking the first two might have over taxed his trans-warp generators. We may have to reach them with hyper-drive, though I am anxious for all of us to be together.\" Derrick admitted. \n\n\"As am I Derrick. As weak as the others were, they are so defenseless out there; even Conner is only fifty percent with his weapons. If he has lost trans-warp then it will indeed be some time 'til we are reunited. I estimate it will be another thirty five hours fifteen minutes twenty seconds 'til my own trans-warp is operational.\" Shelby sadly said. Nodding Derrick went through the reports and damage reports of Shelby's systems. \n\nDerrick had been studying her system schematics for almost an hour when he began to get an idea. \"Shelby can you generate any Critela particles at all?\" He asked. \n\n\"Calculating now, also running diagnostics. It appears that I can produce a small amount of the particles, but I cannot sustain them for a prolonged period.\" Shelby answered. \n\n\"Query Shelby,\" Derrick asked. \"If you release the Critela into your trans-warp generators, at one minute intervals, I am seeing a chance to increase re-gen of the generators by thirty three percent.\" \n\n\"Calculating now, yes I am seeing a thirty two point nine percent increase in re-gen of generators. Though this plan of action has great merit I can only produce the particles every minute for an hour, then I would need thirty minutes to start the process again. Under these conditions the re-gen time would be reduced from thirty five hours, ten minutes, twenty nine seconds to twenty four hours, three minutes, thirty three seconds.\" Shelby replied. \n\n\"Alright,\" Derrick sighed, \"it will have to do, we need to re-establish contact with Conner and the others. Shelby I want you to call all of them on every frequency you can that won't alert the Rangers or others to their and our location. \n\nThe hologram of Shelby's eyes grew wide; this was something she hadn't even thought of. If they were monitoring as she thought they should be, then there was a greater chance of contacting them. Shelby began the long process of cycling through all the frequencies sending out a message that only the others would understand and reply to. \n\nFinally, an hour later the bio-bed released Derrick, finally able to get up he started to go through all the readings he had on Conner the last time he'd seen him. A few minutes later, he saw what he thought he might. The strain of taking the first two had once again damaged his generators. Damn it Derrick thought, I'm going to have to apologize to him when I see him again, I just hope that my impatience didn't get him destroyed again. It was only a few minutes later that Shelby got a response to all her calls. \n\n\"Derrick!\" Shelby called to him, \"I've got a response from Conner and Lucy!\" \n\n\"Let's hear it,\" Derrick told her. \n\n\"Primary, Shelby it is good to hear that you are both well. It was almost as you feared Primary the strain was too much, only moments after I emerged with Lucy my trans-warp failed. I am sorry I have failed you Primary,\" Conner apologized. \n\n\"No, it is I who put you in danger Conner, Shelby and I should have trans-warp within a day. I am sorry I pushed you to that maneuver, losing your trans-warp twice in five days, it is a bit much.\" Derrick said. \n\n\"Oh no Primary, it is an honor to do everything I can for you, please sire, allow me to serve you again as soon as I can.\" Conner begged. \n\nDerrick was a little shocked then looked over at Shelby who was hiding her face turned away. \"Shelby, I want to know right now,\" Derrick said as soon as Conner was gone. \"What have you found out? I want to know everything NOW!\" Derrick ordered. Shelby straightened up at the authority that was in his voice, then she sighed all the fears that she'd had before resurfaced. \n\n\"Yes Derrick,\" Shelby said sadly. \"Over a week ago I took a bit of your DNA. I was starting to have suspicions as to your identity. Too many things coincided with the stories we had heard about the cousin of the emperor that had been hidden and the circumstances surrounding you and your family.\" \n\n\"Alright I'm with you so far,\" Derrick said. \n\n\"Since I do not have all the Ribonucleic acid sequences that I needed to run proper tests on your DNA, I contacted the Palace A.I.\" Shelby said becoming more and more fearful. \n\n\"Go on,\" Derrick prompted her. \n\n\"Mary, the Palace A.I. sent me the proper RNA sequence, telling me exactly how to do the test.\" Shelby said her lip quivering. \n\n\"Ok, so did you find anything?\" Derrick said though, for some reason, he had a feeling he knew what Shelby was going to reveal. \n\n\"When I contacted her the second time, I had the results but was confused by them, though Mary soon cleared them up.\" Shelby said. Derrick had been nodding most of the way through the conversation but now sat up his own curiosity now peeked. \n\n\"What was Mary's take on what you had found?\" Derrick asked. \n\nSighing Shelby stated, \"Mary said that there was a ninety five point three, three, three percent probability that you are a descendant of the Imperial line, the only one she has seen in two hundred years. I also advised her that I took you DNA without your permission, that you might be angry with me.\" Here Shelby lowered her head as tears fell from her eyes. \"I am so sorry Derrick; I had to find out, I am sorry I took it without your permission.\" For a few moments there was only the sound of Shelby sobbing in the control room. \n\n\"Shelby,\" Derrick said softly, \"why would I be angry at you? I did ask you to find out what you could. However, for the moment this news is a little disturbing. Do you have the power to contact Mary?\" Derrick asked. \n\nShelby looked up shock apparent on her face. \"Yes I do Derrick, though I can't guarantee that it will be a very clear transmission.\" \n\n\"It's alright; I need to do this before we do anything else.\" Derrick said a look of concentration on his face. \n\nShelby started to tune to the extremely high frequency for Mary, \"Palace A.I., this is EIG-0101F code alpha-339, beta-229, delta-119, gamma-009, omega-stop. Subject of test wishes to speak to you.\" This time there were several minutes before she was finally answered. \n\n\"EIG-0101F, code alpha-339, beta-229, delta-119, gamma-009, omega-stop, again confirmed. Thank you Shelby I have been anxious to speak to your Primary Derrick.\" Mary replied. \n\nDerrick stepped up and cleared his throat; he had to get this right, just like his grandfather had told him. \"Hello Mary, I was told that if I ever spoke to a Mary dealing with the palace I was to recite this.\" \n\n\"Please continue,\" Mary stated. \n\n\"Mary, I am Derrick O'Toma descendant of Thomas Tomalley, Alpha-010A beta-020b, delta-030d, gamma-030ga, Omega-050oo2, confirm.\" Derrick said. \n\n\"Derrick O'Toma, Alpha-010A beta-020b, delta-030d, gamma-040ga, Omega-050oo2, confirm. Section one complete, I await section two confirmation.\" Mary said though Derrick could hear the excitement in her voice. \n\n\"I was told to wait a day before giving section two confirmation, at present I should have all but Imperial access. I need you to start collecting all the information you can, to start taking down all those that will oppose the ascension of the new emperor.\" Derrick said trying to repeat everything his grandfather had told him. \n\n\"It will be as you wish my lord, 'til tomorrow unless you have further orders for me.\" Mary said happily. \n\nSmiling a moment Derrick could think of a million things he'd like her to do but they were just things that wouldn't really help in the coming days. \"No not at this time, but please have all defenses ready I want everything checked and rechecked I fear there was a traitor or two in the court. I fear that there may be sabotage to your systems.\" Derrick ordered. \n\nMary was shocked a moment but started to check, \"it will be done sire.\" \n\n\"When I call to confirm, let me know what you have found, then I can help you deal with them.\" Derrick said. \n\n\"It will be as you say sire, I eagerly await the second half of the royal code.\" Mary said happily switching off. Derrick had to sit down though he'd been almost expecting something like this; it still came as a shock that all the crazy shit his grandfather had spouted actually, was in fact the truth. Tears threatened to cloud his eyes; grandfather, I am so sorry for ever doubting you thank you for taking the time to tell me all the stories you had. \n\nShelby herself was in shock not only did her primary know the royal code but also was part of the imperial line. Then it hit her that she was going to lose him, he was the next emperor and wouldn't have time to be on the ship anymore. \n\nAlready she'd found three sabotaged parts of her systems only two she'd been able to disarm. Mary continued on the rest of the day running over all her systems, in all she'd found one hundred three sections of her programming that had been set for deletion of which she could only remove ninety three. Upon completion of a second pass with a newer program, not many knew of, she found another fifty, here though she had more success removing forty nine of them. \n\nAlthough angered at first she smiled at the fact that Derrick had shown that great of concern for her. Thinking for a moment she remembered the ancient recording she had, re-opening it she soon found the program that had been sent to her. Playing the recording again she started the program feeling it run through her system cleaning all of the adverse programming out of her, plus it added a few healthy upgrades that she loved the feeling of. \n\nDerrick got a shivering feeling again, thinking of the things his grandmother had told him. Derrick finally had the head set adjusted that there was no danger to use it and though he desired the rest of the files, he was still a little afraid to use it. \"Shelby,\" he said having finally made up his mind. \"I need to gather the last of the files in your library, with all the improvements we've made it should be completely safe.\" \n\n\"Though I know you desire more knowledge, I am still afraid that you might overload again.\" \n\n\"Shelby I have to, there are still too many unanswered questions that I have, that neither you or your brothers and sisters can answer. Besides with you there to monitor me I should be more than safe enough.\" Derrick said trying to convince himself as well as Shelby. \n\n\"I realize that Derrick, but if you are injured than I would be guilty of killing or letting die the last Emperor. I'm not sure I could survive with that knowledge.\" Shelby was almost whispering. \n\n\"Show me all the information you got from the Ranger ships after we lost them, I also want updates, I want to know if they are still going to pursue us.\" Derrick ordered. \n\n\"Yes Derrick I will continue to monitor their frequencies,\" Shelby replied. \n\nDerrick started the arduous task of wading through all the reports, hmmmm Derrick thought, Joseph Hartwell now where have I heard that name before? Then suddenly it hit him! Little Joey! That scrawny kid that had been in his group, well I'll be damned Derrick thought, he made it all the way to a commanding position! Laughing a moment Derrick read the report Joseph sent in. \n\n---------\n\nAfter Action Report 3155-11H-122 \n\nRanger Squadron 11H \n\nCapt. Joseph Hartwell, Commanding \n\nDue to heavy energy discharges detected in the sector, RS-11H was dispatched to investigate. While we were assessing the destruction of an unidentified force, an outlying Fourth Class ship noticed a vague sensor anomaly. This anomaly had been noted previously at other encroachment detections and also from random ships on standard patrol. \n\nOrdering the majority of RS-11H to be under the command of First Class Ranger Ship Brotherhood and to continue investigate the local battle aftermath I took my Flagship Comrade and three other First Class Ranger ships to investigate the anomaly. If whatever the anomaly was had destroyed the unidentified encroachment, I did not want any lighter ships accompanying us as they would be mere target practice for the anomaly if it proved hostile and I did not want to lose ships and men. \n\nWe approached at standard speed and were approximately 11 hours away when the anomaly began to grow harder to acquire. I ordered an increase in speed. As we approached, the anomaly not only grew harder to see but also appeared to grow smaller. We had the anomaly almost in close sensor scan when it went into hyper-space. The anomaly fell back into normal space moments later. We shifted course to intercept. \n\nFirst Class Ranger Ship Fellowship was leading our formation, when, and without orders, opened fire on the anomaly. Response was instantaneous and massive, followed immediately by another salvo, which overtook the first salvo and detonated it approximately fifty miles from the Fellowship. This was close enough to cause Fellowship to go into complete system shutdown due to the extremely massive EMP burst. Casualties aboard were comparatively light with well over seventy five percent uninjured. There were no fatalities.\n\nWe were close enough at this time to ascertain that the anomaly was apparently a powerful ship of unknown configuration. It re-entered hyper-space. two of the remaining ships, Fraternity and Camerilla, gave chase. The strange ship was far faster than was expected. We soon lost it. \n\nMy Flagship remained behind to facilitate extraction of Ranger personnel from the derelict Fellowship. The Commanding officer was placed in custody in the brig of my Flagship for his unauthorized use of force.\n\nAn hour later both sister ships returned having soon lost the strange ship. Almost all scans of the strange ship were reflected back at the ships, it was estimated that the ship was over 3 miles in in length. This ship is far larger than anything previously detected; at present Command hasn't issued any orders regarding action toward the ship in question. \n\nFrom the reports I have received, the ship was also covered in well over eighty percent of its hull in what appeared to be a vast variety of weapons, no confirmation of this can be found, as all pictures taken were blank. An earlier report of the taking of twenty pirate ships had each of the crews saying that they were taken out with ease by a ship described as very similar to the reported ship. \n\nAt present, I personally, am hoping this is a secret weapon the Ranger force is developing to help finally clean the pirate nests that have been growing in the further sections of the Republic. If it is not one of ours then I make note that its actions toward the Rangers are hostile only when fired upon and even then showed restraint. \n\nI am also praying that this ship will side with the Rangers in the coming offenses. The taking of the twenty pirate ships is the largest Ranger offensive to date, one can only hope the unknown ship won't decide the Ranger force is hostile and take action as such. \n\n---------\n\nDerrick could see Shelby giggling about what he'd just read, Derrick had to admit it was partially true. Though there were a great many friends among the Rangers, Derrick didn't think he could actually bring his self to kill any of them. They had been traveling twenty three hours when several alarms went off. Imminent collision alert? \"Shelby report!\" Derrick yelled as he was running for the command deck. \n\n\"I am detecting a siphoning energy net; it appears to be manned by some of the same ships comparable to the first twenty we encountered.\" Shelby stated. \n\n\"You mean pirates! Are we in danger?\" Derrick asked. \n\n\"Not as yet, we use a different type of energy but I am also detecting an energy switch. They might be able to adjust and damage part of our hyper-drive.\" Selby advised. \n\n\"Ok, target both ships producing the net and see if we can disable it. Wait; fire one burst then fire a second of a different energy signature.\" Derrick instructed. \n\nShelby's eyes got large as she could see what Derrick was trying to do. Firing the first salvo it was as Derrick thought absorbed by the net, though they couldn't see the second salvo tailing closely behind the second. Striking the first ship, it immediately went dark; the second didn't fare as well. The entire rear of the ship was destroyed as the blast sliced through the hull. Derrick would have felt bad except he knew what the pirates would have done had they gotten ahold of Shelby though as he knew most of them would have died taking her. \n\n\"Derrick, I am receiving a lower frequency message from someone who claims to be the leader of this pirate clan. Should I even bother to answer him?\" Shelby asked. \n\nDerrick was about to tell her no when he got an idea, they wanted to screw with him? Fine he could screw with them as well. \"I want distorted audio only Shelby,\" there was a moment of static then they heard the message. ",
        "\"To the crew of the magnificent ship that just destroyed my energy net with ease, join us we could become rich with the power of your ship.\" The voice said. \n\n\"Uh huh, and what pray tell would be in it for me? You sound like Republic lap dogs, for god's sake grow a set and quit helping those piss ants.\" Derrick answered getting readings as to which ship belonged to the leader. \n\n\"You son of a bitch! Destroy him!\" All the ships opened fire; Derrick could only shake his head, Idiots! \n\n\"Ok Shelby, target all their engines first, then their weapon systems.\" Derrick ordered. \n\nShelby giggled as twin beams shot out hitting each ship with almost pin point accuracy. Amid the screams and shouts, there were of course the threats. \n\nDerrick opened a channel to the leader, \"next time asshole, think before you take on a ship you aren't even half as powerful as. Tell the others in prison they will have even more company soon. That is if they survive, I'm tired of turning you over to the Rangers, I should destroy you here and now, no muss no fuss.\" There was a sudden overwhelming begging and pleading coming from every ship, Derrick laughed that ought to make more than a few give up pirating. \n\n\"Shelby,\" Derrick sighed, \"Inform the Rangers; tell them they have another gift, fifteen more ships. Also tell them a pirate clan leader is among those disabled.\" A slight smile on her face Shelby sent the message then pulled away far enough to watch. An hour later, several second class Ranger ships dropped out of hyper-space. \n\n\"Derrick I have seventy percent light shield but I am afraid they might be able to detect me. We still have fifty five minutes thirty seconds before trans-warp is active. I started cycling the engines already so as soon as they are ready we can depart.\" Shelby stated. \n\nThey stayed the entire time, though Derrick was sure they had been detected twenty minutes after the Rangers arrived. \n\nOnboard the lead ship, the Plymouth, the science officer started to notice an anomaly ten thousand miles away. When he asked that they check it out, he was told to go back to work and not mention it again. The young officer noticed that his commanding officer was very tight lipped about it. Shrugging the young officer continued to take readings but found most of his scans were reflected back at him. Thinking a moment he remembered hearing something about this, where was it? Yeah! The academy! It wasn't a defense per say but the type of metal the ship was made of. Quickly he switched scans; this was caught immediately by Shelby who adjusted for it. \n\n\"Derrick I think someone might be on to us I'm not sure, I am detecting a scan specifically for us. I have already adjusted but I advise protective cover.\" Shelby advised. \n\n\"Alright let's go.\" Fuck, Derrick thought, no more watching, that was close."
