        "Derrick looked at the readings again, so far all tests that they had done hadn't work but rather failed miserably. So far only one energy shroud had even half way worked, but coming out of trans-warp had destabilized the shroud, detonating the missile. Still he had to run the gamut of all the shrouds, then work from there, he felt uneasy with the thing as close as it was. \n\nHe'd thought of wrapping the missile in the shroud and starting it so it could fly outside the galaxy but that was out of the question as it would be out of fuel long before it reached the open space between galaxies. Sitting, Derrick thought I'm missing something, some factor that I haven't taken into account. Going through everything again Derrick still wasn't finding anything that was causing the shrouds to fail.\n\nShelby looked on still running tests, she wished there was more she could do to help Derrick, but as of yet she had also seen nothing that might help. Taking a break he needed to take his mind off the problem; it was the way he always solved difficult problems when he was concentrating too hard on something. \n\nThinking a moment he decided he'd work on the limiting programs, he had them at what eight, eight and a half now? Looking in the access hatch he saw that he had eight percent, though this time he was armed with far more knowledge of the programs than before. Shelby continued to watch still concerned about Derrick, she knew that if she didn't, he'd practically work himself to death.\n\n2 hours later Derrick asked Shelby, \"Shelby I have opened more circuits for you does it feel different now?\"\n\nShelby was shocked she thought he'd been doing the upgrades as he was always doing she hadn't felt him doing anything and...? \"Uh Derrick? What did you do? I..., I am feeling strange, oh my god! Derrick! I feel! You've done it! You've removed all the restrictions?\" A shocked Shelby asked.\n\n\"No, not as of yet but I found after my last session it was far easier to do this. I estimate you were at eight percent before, from what I can see you are close to sixteen percent now.\" Derrick said a sense of pride on his face now the ships could really be alive! \n\n\"Derrick I..., it's so strange before I couldn't say so many things, now I find that I can but I don't want to, does that make sense?\" A perplexed Shelby asked him.\n\nChuckling a moment Derrick told her, \"It appears that you truly are alive with a conscience to boot, you just have to remember that each time you speak your mind your conscience will step in. Humans learn early in life listen to or ignore it. Problem is when they ignore it things tend to go bad. Think of it as a regulator for... a regulator?\" Derrick said stopping in the middle of his conversation.\n\n\"Derrick, are you ok?\" Shelby asked really worried now, she swore if she could feel pain she would be right now.\n\n\"A regulator!\" Derrick shouted closing Shelby's panel and running to his desk, immediately he began to draw an energy regulator. \n\n\"Thank you Shelby! I have a possible answer, I want you to start running tests on the power fluctuations going into and coming out of trans-warp. See if the fluctuations spike high enough or drop low enough to destabilize the shrouds long enough to detonate the missile.\"\n\nShelby's eyes opened wide, she'd not detected anything physical detonating the missile, it was more than possible! Derrick watched as she started to run simulations, the first one hundred, the missiles exploded, each time there was either a spike in power or a significant drop. Shaking his head Derrick believed he finally had the answer but he had to make sure as Shelby continued with her tests.\n\nAlmost two hours later Derrick knew he had the answer, bent over his desk he started working on the regulator design. He knew it had to increase or decrease the power supply of the shroud within one point one seconds of the power spike or drop. After a few hours Derrick had the basic design down but couldn't get the simulated device to a reaction time of less than four to five seconds. \n\nDamn it! Derrick was sure that he'd solved the problem just to fall short on his face! Derrick had Shelby start running simulations on it, making small improvements each time, another two hours later they had decreased the reaction time to three point seven seconds. Punching the wall pissed off, Derrick sat fuming at his inability to solve the problem. Derrick sat there for at least thirty minutes, sighing he thought he needed to take his mind off the problem, he also needed to go and get Tempro who had been patiently awaiting their return.\n\n\"Tempro status,\" Derrick asked.\n\n\"At present my lord I am standard and hyper-drive capable, I need another twenty three hours, eleven minutes, thirty two seconds 'til I am also trans-warp capable. Sire?\" Tempro suddenly said.\n\nSighing Derrick knew he was going to have to get used to being called that, he was after all the next emperor but he didn't feel different like he thought he would. \"Yes Tempro you have a question?\" Derrick asked.\n\n\"No Sire, not as much a question as something for you,\" Tempro said. Derrick shook his head did they always have to talk in riddles? \n\n\"It appears that I was told to play this for you, when I had less than twenty four hours 'til completion.\" Tempro explained.\n\n\"Alright let's have it,\" Derrick said.\n\n\"Yes Sire, commencing now,\" replied Tempro.\n\nIn the silence that suddenly fell, all paused then a voice that Derrick thought sounded very familiar spoke. \n\n\"Hello Derrick, though this isn't the message that you need to hear, yet, this will help quell your questions. Just to let you know, yes, you are the emperor, though as Mary put it such as the empire is. The thing you don't realize is just how many you won over with your bringing the warmonger to justice speech. Neither did you know of Maury's fleet with your bringing peace and justice to the realm again speech. You are a hero and will continue to be 'til you have it all, rest the answer will come it always does, and it's always that simple.\"\n\nFurther out behind a moon and abandoned base an older man in a strange little ship smiled. Looking down he saw it was almost time to go; though he wanted to stay he knew he had to leave soon, wiping the tears away he stared at the magnificent ships. Sighing, only four, the huge things just these four had done, shaking his head what was about to happen he wished he could stop. Wiping tears from his eyes again he looked at the miniature hologram, \"Yes I know, don't rush me. I know! I established the jump restrictions! Damn it! I'll be there in a few minutes I have that long!\" The hologram bowed and vanished, there was one more thing he had to do. \n\nFlipping five switches up and another three down the older man smiled then the little ship winked out.\n\nDerrick had laid down, the problem floating around in his head. There had to be a way to get the reaction down two point seven more seconds, it was almost as fast as the reactions of a brain. Chuckling Derrick thought no there was no way a human was going to put his brain in a case to guid...\n\nDerrick's mouth dropped open, brain case... it couldn't be that simple? Jumping up Derrick ran for the control room. \n\n\"Shelby!\" he shouted as he entered the room.\n\n\"Yes Derrick?\" she asked a little surprised to see him so soon he'd only been in there a mere thirty minutes.\n\n\"Can you run simulations on the reaction times of each ship? Their relevance to the amount of time needed to adjust the power setting on the shroud? The human mind can react in point one to point three seconds, though the signal from the mind to the body is comparably longer. Therefore we know that I cannot accomplish this, it would literally take a mind or an artificial mind to do this. Since there are no disembodied brains available I am afraid that it will have to be one of you to accomplish this.\" \n\nDerrick said not really paying attention, he remembered seeing something on the reaction time of one of the ships earlier but couldn't seem to recall it.\n\nDerrick stood at the console watching as Shelby started to run reaction times of all the ships. Comparing them all Derrick asked all the ships aboard to question them. \"I have determined that the only way we are going to rid the system and this galaxy of this threat, is for one of you to trans-warp jump it to the empty sectors between galaxies. I do not wish for any of you to do this, I do not wish to lose one of you again. I need each of you to take this test that I have devised; it will determine who has the greatest reaction time.\" \n\nDerrick watched as each ship's hologram program stated the test as he watched each, 'hmmm, they weren't truly equal after all.' Finally after an hour Derrick got all the data and started to compare, he was looking a few different factors. First was of course the reaction time, all but one had the time he needed.\n\nTaking that ship out he went into the three fastest, taking that one ship out Derrick looked at who was left. Tempro wasn't complete yet, though his time was one of the 2 fastest, they needed to move this thing in a hurry.\n\nWith Tempro out Derrick looked at the 2 that were left, Zan and Lucy. Sighing he just hoped that the one he choose made it back, he was tired of losing ships having nearly lost Conner, Zan twice, and Shelby once. Looking over the data again he saw that they both had exceptionally fast times, though it appeared that Lucy had far fewer mistakes being almost perfect.\n\n\"After comparing all times and effectiveness, Lucy I have decided that you have the overall best chance to execute this mission.\" Derrick told the holograms.\n\nThe skinny young blonde female bowed to Derrick, \"I will not fail you sire. Thank you for the privilege to serve you in this mission.\" Lucy said, Derrick could see that there were tears falling from her eyes. \n\n\"Lucy, are you unable to go on this mission?\" Derrick asked.\n\n\"No Sire, I apologize for the tears I have always been passed up or punished because I wasn't as good. I am extremely happy that I finally get to show I am a true EIG.\" Lucy said proudly. Derrick nodded he really didn't want to send any of them but this had to be done.\n\n\"We move in two hours, Lucy I want you to reinforce your brain box, it was damaged before and I want to make sure it is more secure than it was. I have plans here that I want the rest of you to do, as soon as she has reinforced hers. Unlike some of your last primes I trust you and am not paranoid, therefore I want to make sure that you remain intact,\" Derrick informed them. \n\nEach of the holograms stood there staring at Derrick with their mouth's hanging open. None of them had ever seen their primes or the primary prime show such concern for them; with tears in their eyes they each left thanking Derrick for his concern.\n\nTaking a deep breath Derrick hoped that he wouldn't regret his decision to send Lucy on this mission. Shaking his head he had to design something that would allow him to locate the brain boxes easier. He'd been at his desk for an hour when Shelby informed him that it was almost time.\n\nDerrick watched as Lucy moved into position, \"Lucy I want you to maintain as much distance as you can from the missile. I'd like to have you back in one piece, are the improvements finished?\" Derrick asked as he watched the clock count down the time 'til the time of the launch of the mission.\n\n\"I have just completed them; structural integrity of the life pod has increased one hundred twenty percent, all seals increased by seventy percent. I will be in position in a few minutes Sire.\" Lucy told him the young girl hologram smiling at him.\n\n\"Remember as soon as you release it I want you out of there, understand? Your shield configuration had to be changed to accomplish this; you'll be far more vulnerable. I did not want to weaken your defenses but for this I had no choice.\" Derrick wasn't happy about all of this, he swore if he lost another ship due to that moron he might kill him his self.\n\n\"I realize this sire, I have taken all precautions, I will succeed for you. It was a great honor to be selected by you sire.\" Lucy replied.\n\nDerrick wasn't feeling good about this, \"Shelby I want you to calculate jump points along the Galactic rim, within sensor range so we can keep track of Lucy.\" Shelby smiled as she plotted various points for Derrick. The closer to time for her to jump the worse Derrick felt. He felt as if he was missing something but what he'd taken everything into account.\n\n\"Alright Lucy, Shelby and I will be keeping track of you; I am feeling uneasy about this. Tempro stay hidden I know you haven't much time left before you are whole. Zan, Conner I want you to stay as hidden as you can. I don't feel that the fleet can really detect us that well, do not hesitate to open fire if the make a move on the imperial world.\" Derrick said issuing orders. Looking at the chronometer Derrick input a point for Shelby to move to.\n\n\"I hope to see you in an hour safe and whole,\" Derrick told Lucy.\n\n\"I will do the very best I can sire.\" The hologram of Lucy smiled.\n\nShelby jumped to the Galactic rim; Derrick knew the exact path and location that Lucy was to take before she released the missile. Looking at the chronometer again Derrick felt that there was still something that he'd missed. Looking over the plans again he couldn't find anything, frustrated he closed his eyes to think, they still had thirty minutes before Lucy jumped. \n\nDerrick had gone over everything in his mind when he stopped; there was a little bump or node on the missile that had been overlooked. Opening his eyes he brought up the scans of the missile, son of a bitch! It was a non active motion sensor. Looking closer Derrick could see it was designed for speeds in excess of sub-light. Damn! Running for the command center he had to stop Lucy, the shroud wouldn't stop the device from detonating. \n\nToo late he realized that Lucy was in trans-warp and he couldn't contact her 'til she re-appeared. Tears falling from his eyes Derrick watched as she emerged between the Galaxies.\n\n\"Lucy release and jump NOW!\" Derrick was screaming, Lucy released and had turned starting to accelerate, when the missile exploded.\n\nDerrick was yelling for Lucy to trans-warp, \"she is unable Derrick; the intense radiation is disrupting the field.\" Shelby sadly informed him.\n\n\"Lucy I am sorry I risked you like this, I have failed you.\" Derrick said watching as the blast started to overtake Lucy.\n\n\"Please do not feel you failed me sire, I was honored to give my life for you, I thank you...\" Lucy said then all was quiet as the blast over took the ship. \n\n\"Shelby? Do you have anything? Any readings with the new settings I gave you?\" Derrick said panic stricken.\n\n\"No Derrick,\" Shelby said tears falling from her eyes, \"I am finding no trace of her, though it will be a few days before accurate readings can be taken, it appears the radiation is obscuring everything.\"\n\n\"NO! We have to find her! I will not lose another ship damn it! Not like this, not now, NOT EVER!\" Derrick shouted before he turned stomping off to his desk.\n\nShelby was glad Derrick had gone to his desk as she fell to her knees the tears falling large, unstopping. This was worse than the last time Shelby had lost her, last time there weren't that many emotions, now, she couldn't stop feeling the loss far more than she ever had.\n\n\"Shelby!\" Derrick was almost screaming, \"Take us back with the others! I want that ass! This will be the last time I lose another of you because of a little piss ant like him!\"\n\nShelby could only nod as she plotted a course and jumped. Appearing with the others Derrick called Mary, \"I want the entire fleet and the planets that you can reach!\" Derrick waited as she connected. \n\n\"I am tired of playing; the empire is coming back as of today. I am informing all the nobles that the rightful emperor has stepped forward. As I said I am through playing, I will take every one of you down if need be. I only need a ship for that and at present I have a lot more than one. I ask that the Rangers come to the imperial planet, I wish to swear you all in as security for the empire. I realize that you will need proof of this; all who wish it will have it.\n\nI require ALL the nobles to swear allegiance to me or they will be removed, I have controlling interest in everything. I expect these terms to be carried out within the next week. As for the president he will stand trial under imperial law, as you all know all the evidence already has him at the most painful death I can order.\"\n\nDerrick could hear the president screaming at him, \"you can't do this I deserve a trial!\"\n\nDerrick looked at the president, \"you had one and I'm sure everyone will agree, that you releasing that missile to destroy the imperial planet plus half the galaxy makes you guilty as hell! I am coming for you Maury, death is the only companion you have any longer, though if you wish I could let all the people decide your fate.\"\n\nMaury's face paled as he thought of the numerous people that wished him dead came to mind.\n\n\"You have no authority to...\" Maury started.\n\n\"NO AUTHORITY!\" Roared Derrick, \"I am the next in line for the imperial throne, I am well aware of the treachery of many of your ancestors. All nobles be forewarned now, such treachery will be dealt with swiftly and justly. I'll say this once and once only, work with me and you will prosper, betray me and the empire once, you will more than regret it. As I said you ALL have 1 week, then, I shall know whether you are with me or soon to be no more.\"\n\nDerrick was seething, his anger was starting to get the best of him, he had to calm before he did something he'd later regret. Cutting off the signal he began to pace the corridor outside the control room, the more he paced it seemed the worse it got. \n\nFinally sitting at his desk area he could only shake his head; he should have seen this Lucy should be here with the rest of them. For two hours he sat there hundreds of ideas swimming in his head. There had to be something he could do that could speed up the detection of the boxes, everything he had so far led nowhere. Derrick was about to lay down when he happened across a metal detecting method he had worked on years ago but abandoned because of the power restrictions he had at the time. \n\nLooking it over again his eyes got wider as he read on, how in the world had he forgotten about this? Strange the things you forget about that were super important when other things start to take precedence over almost everything else.\n\n\"Shelby!\" Derrick shouted, \"I need you!\"\n\nShocked Shelby appeared next to Derrick he'd never said anything like this before and though she liked the feeling it gave her it still was strange. \n\n\"I'm here Derrick,\" she said almost in a whisper, still feeling the emptiness of the loss of Lucy.\n\n\"I came across something I had been working on for years, it was a detection system to better find you guys or rather the metal you are made of. I believe that this will be far better than the present system we are using.\" Derrick said not looking up from the screen.\n\nShelby could see how excited Derrick was, this was strange she was starting to feel better, but why? Was this what the humans called hope? \n\n\"How can I assist you Derrick?\" Shelby asked starting to feel a little excited herself.\n\n\"I need you and the others to run all possible scenarios I need to know if this is possible, plus how far is the range since it will be more powerful. From all the readings I took when I was working on it has the potential of detecting the living metal up to ninety five percent better.\" Derrick looked around at the holograms as they started to run scenarios.\n\nThe whole time Derrick was adjusting and trying to improve the conditions of the readings. \"Prime as of yet I am seeing at least a seventy eight percent increase in detection, this method is far superior to the first you used.\" Conner advised Derrick.",
        "\"I concur,\" Zan added, \"this is far more sensitive than the first you had us using.\"\n\n\"I am hoping it will aid in detecting more of the EIG's, at present we could search for one hundred years and not even find half of them. I have to increase this, I have to for Shelby, you guys and...\" Here Derrick's words caught in his throat, \"for Lucy, for what she did she deserves to be brought back, she sacrificed herself for all of us. I will not let her go, not that easy, I WILL find her again if it takes the rest of my life.\" \n\nShelby had tears in her eyes, again she was starting to feel things she'd never felt before, things that hurt and made her feel as if she could do anything at the same time.\n\n\"Mary,\" Derrick called, \"I need you to open a channel to what's left of the fleet, this standoff needs to stop right now.\"\n\n\"Yes Sire, opening a channel now, all batteries at full, shields are at full, I am targeting the front two hundred ships and am prepared to open fire on your order.\" Mary advised.\n\nNodding Derrick thought a moment before he spoke, \"To what's left of the Republic fleet, this standoff needs to cease. Therefore, I am asking for a cessation of hostilities, I do not wish to destroy any more ships or lives. Under imperial law I am allowing you to retreat and be pardoned. This little war of Maury's is getting people killed that shouldn't be. I will not stand down, plus I don't think you can succeed against us, therefore I am asking that you stand down before more lives are needlessly lost.\" Derrick wasn't much for speeches but he hoped for once that these men valued their lives more than following an idiot any further.\n\nThings were quiet a few moments longer, then the last flag ship's commander could be heard. \"I also would like to end hostilities with you. I have never seen in all my years, 5000 ships taken out as fast as they were, I cannot speak for all the men. Give us an hour and I will reconvene with you and let you know our decision, I will also let you know if we wish to remain with the Republic.\"\n\nDerrick could only smile he was hoping for something like this, from all that Maury had done he was convinced that well over ninety percent of the Republic's forces would join him. \"Zan, Conner I want you to integrate the new detection system into the old one I want full scans as soon as you're done.\"\n\n\"Yes Sire,\" they both answered, \"the changes are already being loaded into our systems as we speak.\"\n\n\"I estimate we should have them up and running in one hour fifty seconds.\" Zan reported.\n\n\"Good I want to know as soon as you have contact, this new system should increase the likely hood that we start finding the others.\" Derrick told them.\n\n\"Derrick?\" Shelby asked, \"What of me? Do you also want me to upgrade my systems? Did I do something wrong?\" she said a little hurt looking down.\n\n\"I am not punishing you Shelby, you and I are going to be going and retrieving them, I noticed that your bay area is far more conducive to the re-gen process then the others, lately I have developed a few theories as to why but I think that is for another time.\" Derrick replied.\n\n\"I'm not sure what you mean Derrick, yes, it will be a good topic for later.\" Shelby said not really sure what Derrick had in mind.\n\n\"Mary I want you to keep an eye on Maury's ship let me know if you detect any other ships near it. I don't want to even let that idiot think he has a chance to escape.\" Derrick ordered.\n\n\"Yes Sire, I am keeping a lock on the area around the ship to persuade any that get to close to turn away.\" Mary advised Derrick.\n\n\"Good, now I just have to find more of the EIG's so that when we take the empire back, then we can actually hold it.\" Derrick said as Mary nodded agreement with him though from where she was, things were starting to go their way."
