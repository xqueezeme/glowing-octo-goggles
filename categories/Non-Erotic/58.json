Opening the air lock Ambrose shouted into the darkened ship.\n\n\"I suggest if you want to stay alive you haul your asses in here!\" There were a confused number of voices then several men came tentatively through the airlock followed by Typree. \"Cousin? Where in the hell are we? The last I saw you disappeared into some type of energy tunnel.\"\n\n\"How long ago was that?\" Ambrose asked trying to gauge long it had seemed to his cousin.\n\nLooking at the chronometer on his furry arm Typree replied. \"Only an hour ago, why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Cousin,\" Ambrose clapped Typree on his shoulder. \"That was almost a week ago! Obviously you were on the fringe of whatever transported us here.\"\n\nAmbrose could see that Typree's eyes were bulging as he was trying to get his head around what his cousin had just said. \"Uh ... by here where exactly are we?\"\n\n\"The nearest that we can tell we are in orbit around the planet earth.\" Ambrose told his cousin as Twitty closed the airlock then they were heading to the other ship. Docking Ambrose repeat the same actions as Jankuis and several men stumbled through the airlock.\n\nBowing low Jankuis was at Ambrose's feet. \"I thought I recognized your ship, Sire.\" Jankuis said from the floor.\n\nAmbrose sighed as he tried to get the male off the floor. \"I'm sick of all this damn floor bowing! Why can't all you get it as quickly as my command crew did?\"\n\nThis of course started Typree laughing as Ambrose growled at him. \"Get used to it cousin. I've had that for the last four to four and a halg quants. You rule the entire kingdom it's going to happen no matter what.\"\n\nSighing Ambrose nodded. \"I know but when I ask them not to, I expect them not to after a while!\"\n\n\"I could never disrespect you or your father like that Sire. I respect you and him far too much for that,\" came from Jankuis whose head was still bowed.\n\nSighing Ambrose nodded his understanding. Then as Twitty closed the airlock an idea came to Ambrose. \"Typree? Just how many can these ships carry?\"\n\nTypree's eyes narrowed as he stared at Ambrose. \"Almost three hundred comfortably, though I have to ask why?\"\n\nAmbrose nodded again explaining about moving the people of the city, and then he turned back to Skylos. \"You think you and Twitty can get them restarted?\"\n\nSkylos was deep in thought as Twitty walked up to the three of them. \"Not sure sire, I haven't seen the configuration of their engines.\" Then he looked at Typree. \"How much more power does it have than this ship? I saw them in combat. I could swear that you had twice the power and armament.\"\n\nTypree was staring back and forth between both of them his mouth hanging open. \"I ... I'm not sure. Jankuis!\" Typree called of the male. After explaining their need for both ships Jankuis thought a moment. \"The configuration of the engines is the same, though we do have an extra to provide more power. Though not as fast, they are a force to be reckoned with.\"\n\nSkylos nodded as Twitty looked at both of them as if they had lost their mind. \"You want to do an orbital restart? With no power, no air, nothing?! Have you lost your fucking mind! Now I know you have a death wish.\" Shaking her head she stared at Skylos like he was a lunatic.\n\n\"Queen Twitty they just went offline. With any luck we shouldn't need much to get them restarted. Besides we still have all that extra Taak'in onboard.\" Skylos told Twitty.\n\nTwitty's eyes opened wide as she nodded. \"That takes care of that, what about breathing? I'm not a fan of passing out possibly dying from lack of air!\" Twitty snapped at Skylos.\n\nSkylos held up a small mask with a hose and a small box at the other end of the hose. \"We can use these emergency air breathers, or had everyone forgot that we had them?\" Twitty nodded as she grabbed it from Skylos heading to the airlock.\n\n\"Well?\" Twitty said with exasperation. \"You said we need to hurry! Let's go!\"\n\nSkylos nodded as he donned another emergency air breather. Turning to Ambrose he whispered, \"You are so lucky sire to have such a strong mate!\"\n\n\"You wouldn't always think that if your mate was like any of my three!\" Ambrose whispered back.\n\n\"I heard that!\" Twitty shouted from the airlock. \"One should consider one's self lucky that I accepted your claiming!\"\n\nTypree laughed as he clapped Ambrose on the shoulder. \"Ah cousin. Glad I am it's you and not I!\"\n\n\"Don't worry Typree Maxor; all three of the Queens have plans to have you married within three or four Malants.\" As Typree's face went from elation to one of horror, it was Ambrose's turn to laugh.\n\n\"I don't have the time for such things, Queen Twitty I...\" Typree started.\n\nTwitty stared at him with a serious look as she said, \"it is one of the THINGS that you WILL make time for. Like your cousin you have no heirs for your part of the kingdom.\" Here Twitty turned throwing over her shoulder. \"Not to worry Typree Maxor we do have a female that would be perfect for you. That is after we are done here. Skylos! Let's go!\"\n\nA shocked to silence Typree turned to Ambrose a look of desperation in his eyes. \"Sire you have to do something! I don't have the time for a mate. I have to...\" Typree was suddenly silent as Ambrose held up his paw. A moment later after Skylos and Twitty had entered the other ship\n\nAmbrose spoke. \"I have found cousin that to argue with them only invites more of their brand of concern. I suggest you go along then disappear for a time perhaps you will grow lucky and they will forget.\" Then Ambrose leaned closer to Typree whispering, \"Though I wouldn't count on it. I've seen all three take hold of an idea riding it to the end. No if you wish to fight this then you do it on your own.\" Again Ambrose held up a paw to quiet Typree. \"If, as I think you are thinking of fight this, then be prepared for a very long siege, in a battle that I personally know you won't win.\"\n\nTypree's head dropped as he started to formulate plans to hide in plain sight. A wicked smile lit up Typree's face as his plans started to form. 'Yes,' he thought, 'they'd never find him!' A mere two spectons later the second of his ships suddenly powered up.\n\n\"Alright sire we were able to restart with little trouble. I have the ship at fifty percent and climbing. All air recyclers are online. Be back in a half specton,\" came Skylos voice over the communicator.\n\n\"Good, sending Jankuis and his crew back onboard.\" Ambrose replied.\n\nAfter the exchange they went to the other ship. Moving in, Skylos and Twitty were there four spectons when Skylos called. \"Sire I'm afraid it might take far longer to restart this ship. I'm afraid that...\"\n\nIn the back ground they could hear Twitty cursing as she was struggling with something. \"Skylos! Get off the com! Help me remodulate this before we lose everything!\"\n\nSighing Skylos whispered, \"I have to go sire, I...\"\n\n\"Sire?\" They heard Twitty say. \"I'm sorry mate, I WILL CALL you when we are done. I told him it wasn't a good idea to try a restart in space. Now get off there we have to save what we can!\" With that the com went dead. Ambrose had a huge smile on his face. Damn but he was falling more for his mates that was sure!\n\nIt was almost a half toton later when Twitty appeared at the airlock dragging an unconscious Skylos. Ripping off her EAB, she fell to her knees, doubling her fists she came down on Skylos chest. \"Breathe you stubborn idiot!\" Again three more times she came down on his chest, then blew air into his lungs. \"Don't you dare die on me Skylos! Breathe you piece of shit!\" She was shouting as she came down on his chest.\n\nSuddenly Skylos gasp a huge lungful of air. Then he started to cough uncontrollably. Opening his eyes he first saw a relieved, then an angry Twitty. \"Ah I am dead, I am in the afterlife with an angel attending me.\" Skylos weakly said.\n\n\"Don't you EVER do that again, you hear me! You do? I might just let you die, if I don't break something first!\" Twitty was yelling in his face.\n\nSkylos was nodding as he groaned, \"I knew it, and I knew I'd probably go to the other place.\" Trying to sit up Skylos yelped loudly his eyes large when he felt at least two ribs broken. \"Looks like you won't have to Queen Twitty. It appears you broke at least two ribs.\"\n\n\"Damn it! I thought I felt something give on that last hit. Sorry Skylos I was afraid that I wouldn't get your lungs started.\" Twitty said as she started to grab several rolls of bandage. With Ambrose and Typree they got Skylos up as Twitty started to wrap up Skylos's ribs.\n\n\"Sire,\" Skylos said as soon as he could move with as much pain. \"We managed to get one of the engines started. I was moving to start the second when I found a problem. As you know the engines need a certain amount of air internally. I found that all the air had bled out of the second. So when she wasn't looking I used over half of my air supply. Though it turned out to be almost all of it.\"\n\n\"He was heading toward the manual restart right behind me. I had just started to ignite the engine when I noticed that Skylos wasn't with me. I hit the switch then ran to find him on the deck around the corner. I took hold of his arm and drug him to the hatch. You are heavier than you look! I am strong though I couldn't get you very far off the deck.\"\n\nSkylos nodded as he started to take a numerous amount of tools off his belt, out of his pants and in his shirt. Each time they hit the deck with a resounding clang. Skylos looked at Twitty a little smug when she saw all the tools. \"I can understand why you might have had a little trouble.\" Skylos said sheepishly.\n\nTwitty could only stare at the pile of tools on the deck. \"By the great feline! What were you carrying forty tacs worth? No wonder you felt so heavy! Why in the hell were you carrying so much?\"\n\n\"Actually it was only thirty tacs worth though I am working toward that amount. As to why, I always try to be prepared for whatever emergency might arise. I assume you saw that I always had the right tool?\" When a shocked Twitty nodded her eyes flew wide. \n\n\"That's why your ribs broke! All the tools;. again, I apologize Skylos.\" Twitty said upset.\n\n\"Hey I'm not, for once I was injured in the line of duty for the King. Maybe this will shut my mate up about how unimportant my job is!\" Skylos said a wide smile on his face.\n\n\"If she needs further proof I will go with you.\" Ambrose said a new respect for the male on his face. Looking at the pile of tools Ambrose could only shake his head. Thirty tacs, not even his armor was that heavy!\n\nSkylos's face was first in shock then a broad smile slowly spread across his face. \"Thank you sire, I think that might make her believe that I was truthful. Then he looked at Ambrose. \"Though if she continues on this path I could have a k'aat k'iimil declared.\" Ambrose's head snapped up as he stared at Skylos.\n\n\"Has your mate made your union that bad Skylos?\" Ambrose asked. A k'aat k'iimil! Shaking his head there hadn't been one since his father was alive. The shame it brought upon the female alone was a near death sentence. Looking at Skylos he thought the shame on the male wasn't all that far off either.\n\nTwitty's eyes were huge as she also stared at Ambrose. \"You have to come to an agreement.\" She said a look of horror on her face. \"Though I don't personally know your mate, there has to be something that can be done besides this. You do realize that you will not be able to claim another female? That your kits will be frowned upon no matter where you go.\" Shaking her head she turned away. She hated to see one as brave as Skylos had shown to be the subject of ridicule.\n\n\"It was a suggestion that I have thought about since I brought you back from earth.\" Turning toward Twitty Skylos stated, \"I know what this will entail Queen Twitty. My mate has as of late become more and more vocal about not believing me. I do not wish to do this as I do love her. The pressure she has started to put upon me and our union is stretching very thin.\"\n\nTwitty and Ambrose both nodded though the laws had become more lax the last few quants; it was still frowned upon by a female trying to shame a male mate. Ambrose looked at Twitty seeing the look of horror in her eyes.\n\nSighing Ambrose nodded, \"We'll revisit this if and when we return. For now we need all three ships to get this done.\" Skylos nodded as he slowly started to repack all the tools back in all the places he'd had them in. Grabbing two fresh EAB's they both moved back to the airlock though this time far slower.\n\nIt was a mere two spectons later when Ambrose's com. went off. \"Have you managed to get the second up?\" Ambrose asked.\n\n\"Yes Sire, the first is good thought the second still seems to be leaking. We've just got the third going, and re-energizing the systems now.\"\n\nSkylos said as the lights came on in the other ship. A few moments later they both walked back out. \"Sire,\" Skylos said as he bowed to Typree. \"I've managed to repair part of the leak that your second engine had. I estimate you have another thirty percent boost in power, though I suggest that you have it repaired as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Thank you Commander Skylos. As I said if you weren't my cousin's I'd steal you away; though I might be able to convince him to loan you to me, on occasion. For uh hum ... training of the others you realize.\" Typree said when Ambrose gave him a slightly cold stare.\n\nAmbrose smiled as soon as the words left his cousin's mouth. \"We'll have to see about that. Captain Skylos might be a little busy!\" Skylos's head snapped around as he stared at Ambrose. \"Captain Sire?\"\n\nAmbrose hid his smile as he stared at the male sternly telling him, \"I don't see any other here. What? I assume you don't want it? Too bad! CAPTAIN Skylos!\" Ambrose said to enforce what he'd said.\n\n\"I ... I ... I am speechless Sire! Thank you!\" The male said as he tried to snap to attention. Groaning, Skylos started to stumble as Ambrose, Typree and Twitty grabbed him lowering him to the deck. \"I'll be alright, give me a moment.\"\n\n\"Alright, as soon as we move I want you to follow us. Land on either side of us. One ship scared them enough, three might cause a city wide panic.\" Ambrose told Typree. \"Let Jankuis know also.\" Typree nodded as him and his men entered the other ship.\n\nSkylos sat up, \"Alright sire sat around enough.\" Moving into the command room, Skylos called back. \"Sire you want to contact those on earth?\"\n\n\"Yes I think that might be prudent. I shudder to think how worried and angry Glenna and Niaco are.\" Ambrose replied.\n\n\"Channel open sire.\" Skylos told him.\n\n\"Sire? Came Roth's voice. We were worried when you didn't arrive back sooner. I...\"\n\nThere was a brief struggle then Niaco voice could be heard. \"You have worried both your Queens plus all your knights and Paladins! Twitty is an excellent swordswoman though she is only one! Are you about to land?\" Niaco fired off her rapid questions.\n\n\"Yes we are in orbit around earth now. We 'found' help so we will all be there soon. Please tell the king so he can keep the people calm.\" Ambrose replied.\n\n\"Help? Alright though we need to hurry. We were just informed that the army outside the boundaries has started to grow.\" Niaco stated. Growling Ambrose told Skylos, \"We need to get back now!\"\n\n\"Yes sire on approach now.\" Within two spectons all three ships landed. Stepping out Ambrose was met with the grim faces of his mates, knights, paladins, and Adina.\n\n\"Cousin!\" Adina was shouting as she threw herself at Ambrose kissing his whole face. \"I was so worried about you!\" Stepping back she started to wag her finger at Ambrose. This of course brought a smile to the faces of the others. \"Don't you EVER do that again,\" she said admonishing him.\n\n\"Still getting into everything aren't you Adina?\" They all heard from behind them.\n\nAdina turned her eyes large as she stared at her brother. \"Brother?\" Running to him she hugged him fiercely. With tears running down her face she said, \"I thought none of us would ever see you again!\"\n\n\"Yes, cousin and his wife have already explained where and when we are. I expect it has something to do with the final power of royalty. Though even with father I never remember it being this strong.\" Turning to Ambrose Typree asked. \"So just how long were you unconscious when all of you arrived here?\" Typree asked.\n\nAmbrose shook his head with a smile, \"not as long as you think, though this happened on its own. I felt the power grow 'til nothing I did would stop it. I embraced it then Adina wrapped herself around me. As soon as she touched me it started to fade, though not before it knocked the both of us senseless.\"\n\nTypree was nodding as he took in everything that Ambrose was saying. \"You say that this started after you used it though not at full power. Then you said you felt the power build?\" Typree looked at Adina a moment then he asked. Adina do you remember when father used his to stop those rebel forces?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was what killed him! I never want you to push that hard Ambree! I know that you said that each time you use it, it gets easier for you. I am still afraid that it will kill you as it did father!\" Adina stated.\n\n\"So it appears that two or more times using them makes it far easier for you.\" Here Typree stared at Adina as he waited for what he'd just said settled in.\n\nAdina was staring back at Typree not paying much attention to the others thinking of what her brother had said. Suddenly her eyes went wide as exactly what he'd said made something click in her mind. Turning to stare at Ambrose her bother started to nod.\n\n\"No I refuse to believe it! It was hard enough to accept that these people think he is the great feline Cit-Chac-Coh.\" Adina cried out.\n\nTypree's eyes shot over to Ambrose they thought he was the great feline Cit ... What? That was the old language! They hardly used it anymore. Then Typree looked at the huge temple building, as his mouth dropped open further. Sinking to his knees he could only stare at it as he shook his head, Acropolis!"
