        "The hunter walked slowly down a trail that wound through the oak and hickory forest. He paused now and then, cradling his rifle, the barrel pointed down. In the distance could occasionally be heard the sound of rifle fire and shotguns. The autumn hunting season was at its peak.\n\nThe man was in his mid-thirties, with black hair and dark features, a two-day growth of beard on his face. As a young man he had been handsome enough to attract any girl around. But the years had hardened him; had given him a grim visage. Even strangers could now see at a glance that here was not a man to be trifled with.\n\nHe came to a wide, almost flat rock along the trail, some two feet in height. He sat down on the rock and leaned his rifle against it. From the breast pocket of his red and black checkered wool coat, the man drew out a pack of Chesterfields. Pushing his John Deere cap off his forehead, he lit a cigarette. He took a deep drag, enjoying his cigarette and the tranquil forest around him.\n\nThe rifle that was trained on the man was partly hidden in a wild azalea thicket about a hundred yards away. The weapon, however, was too heavy for the young boy who held it. He tried to sight through the Leupold 3x9 scope, but his heart was pounding, his whole body trembling. The image of the man's head in the viewfinder danced about wildly. \n\nA turmoil of thoughts raced through the boy's mind. Once chance, he said to himself, one chance! But it was hopeless. The Browning .27 caliber rifle was too heavy. He was too small and too scared. It was hopeless.\n\nDo it, he thought frantically. The images in his mind began to take shape. Now he could see soft blonde curls; a gap-toothed smile. He began to hear a song in a little girl's voice: \n\nJesus loves me this I know, <br> For th' Bible tells me so,<br> Little ones to him belong, <br> They are weak but He is strong.\n\nThe song began to ease the boy's nerves. A cold fury welled up and spread through him. His arms became steady. The rifle now seemed to weigh almost nothing as he gazed at the man's face in the viewfinder. Centering the crosshairs on the man's forehead, he exhaled, then waited half a second. He pressed gently on the trigger.\n\nCrack! The rifle's recoil slammed it into the boy's shoulder. I'll have a bruise there, he thought to himself. The loud report of the rifle echoed through the forest. Crack! Months and even years later, the boy would hear that sound with absolute clarity. It would follow him through life.\n\nHe looked down toward the man, at first with his naked eye and then through the viewfinder. The impact of the bullet had driven the man back against two hickory saplings that grew beside the rock.\n\nThe boy watched the figure for almost half a minute. Now slumped across the rock, the man shuddered once or twice as if he had caught a chill. Then he became as still as the rock itself. A pool of blood appeared beneath his head. Small rivulets began to flow aimlessly across the rough face of the rock, forming a bright red network over its patchwork gray and lichen-covered surface.\n\nThe boy strained to hear other hunters' voices or footsteps. But he heard only the gentle wind in a nearby white pine; only the peaceful solitude of the Appalachian forest. He glanced down to the ground, searching until he saw the bronze-colored spent shell of a .27 caliber rifle. Tucking the shell into his coat pocket, he hurried out of the thicket and up across a low ridge. The boy occasionally paused beside a tree trunk to see if the way ahead was clear.\n\nNow he was breathing hard again. You'd kill a rattlesnake if you found one in the barn! he said to himself. You'd shoot a rabid dog if it came into the yard! Tears stung his eyes as he made his way through the forest. \n\nAfter a few minutes the boy reached a small creek, about ten feet across. Without hesitating he walked into the creek's freezing water and began to wade up the shallow stream. Soon he came to a stretch where the edge of the creek was lined with flat rocks. \n\nSupporting himself with one hand on a rock, the boy quickly removed the Wolverine work boots he was wearing, boots that were two sizes too large. Then, holding them in one hand, the rifle in the other, he stepped onto the rocks, one after another, until he was in the forest again.\n\nThe boy continued on until he could hear and see the Santeetlah River. Here it rushed past heavy gray boulders; there it murmured quietly where its water formed deep green pools.\n\nAt the edge of the forest, the boy pulled out a burlap sack that was half hidden beneath a rock. He removed his dirty wet socks; then, withdrew dry socks and a pair of rough work shoes from the sack. After he had put them on, the boy glanced up and down the river, and then walked to its edge.\n\nHe stuffed his wet socks down into the boots. Then he filled them with river stones. Lastly, he tied the boots at the top with their laces and placed them into the burlap sack. Once again glancing around furtively, he advanced from one gray rock to another until he was part way out in the river. \n\nThe boy stood for a second, and then casually dropped the sack into the swirling water beneath him. Within seconds it was gone from sight; gone, he hoped, forever.\n\nNow the boy retreated into the forest again, working his way upstream along a deer trail. Soon he reached another pool, wider and deeper than the first. Above it was a lively cascade that poured a never-ending stream of water into the pool.\n\nOnce more he gazed up and down the river for a moment; then, quickly moved across the rocks until he was at the edge of the pool. His heart pounding, he drew both arms back and flung the rifle as far as he could out toward the churning green waters. \n\nHe watched it arc through the air, almost as if it were in slow motion. Then, with a loud splash, the rifle entered the water and disappeared from sight. The sound of the rifle hitting the water was another that the boy would remember for a lifetime. \n\nThe boy stuck his hands in his pockets, glancing around once more. Taking a deep breath, he spoke silently to the river. I've swum and fished in you all my life. You've been like a friend to me. Now you must hold my secrets; I'm depending on you. The river murmured its reply: my depths harbor many secrets.\n\nThe boy quickly disappeared into the forest and began to walk. After about half a mile he came to a gravel road and a stone bridge over the Santeetlah. He crossed it, soon leaving the road and walking over another ridge along a well-worn trail, finally emerging into the yard behind a house. On his left was a small woodshed. On the right was the garden, and beyond that a barn. \n\nThe tin roof of the wood frame house was rusted in places. The clapboard siding had been painted off-white and needed a fresh coat. A thin cloud of smoke could be seen rising above a brick chimney at one side of the house.\n\nNear the woodshed was a stack of oak and hickory, sawn in lengths that would fit the kitchen stove and the iron stove in their living room. The boy picked up a piece of oak, about a foot in diameter, and placed it on a chopping block. He grasped a double-bitted axe that he had left next to the chopping block. He came down on the wood with all his might, shattering it into two parts. \n\nAfter a few moments a woman emerged from the kitchen onto the back porch. She lit a cigarette and, leaning against a post, watched the boy chopping wood. Eva McCarter was wearing a flower-print shift under an apron that she wore all day. \n\nIn contrast to her son, who had the dark hair and square chin of his father, Eva was fair-skinned and freckled, her blonde hair in loose curls. Eva's father had once declared her the prettiest girl in Emory Cove, but that was a long time ago. Although she still had smooth skin and good features, there was now an air of resignation about her. The light in her blue eyes had faded. \n\n\"Where you been?\" she finally asked.\n\nThe boy looked up and gazed at his mother, feeling numb, entirely devoid of emotion. \"Heard a dog barkin' over near the road. First thought it might be the Cogdill's coon hound that wandered off last week.\"\n\n\"Was it?\"\n\n\"Don't think so. Followed it a while, but I decided it barked more like a feist than a hound. Never did see it.\"\n\nHis mother took a deep breath. \"Your Daddy'll be home in a couple of hours. Better have enough wood for tonight. You know he'll fly off the handle if you ain't got th' wood box filled.\"\n\nThe boy and his mother regarded each other in silence for a few seconds. Both understood the meaning of what was said. Hard slaps awaited one, perhaps both of them, if the stock of wood fell short of his father's expectations.\n\n\"We'll have plenty,\" the boy said in an even voice. \"He won't say anything.\"\n\n*******\n\nThe two men stood looking at the body lying on the wide rock, whose surface was now covered with a maroon layer of dried blood.\n\n\"Reckon it was a stray bullet?\" Deputy Paul Bryson asked. \"Lots o' hunters out today.\" \n\n\"Could be,\" Sheriff George Ramsey replied. \"But if it was, Floyd McCarter was the unluckiest son of a bitch around. Look at that. Right above the eyes. Just about took the top of his head off.\"\n\n\"Never knew what hit him,\" murmured his deputy.\n\n\"Nope.\" After a moment the sheriff looked over to the man resting against a hickory tree trunk, and spoke again. \"Now Lester, he was like this when you found him?\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" the burly young man replied. \"Just layin' there peaceful like.\"\n\n\"You didn't mess with the body? Try to see if he was alive?\"\n\n\"No sir. Anybody c'n see he was dead as a doornail.\"\n\n\"What's that you're carryin' there? Remington?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. Just a little .22 rifle. You couldn't blow a man's head half off with this thing.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\nSheriff Ramsey took off his hat and ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. He looked back to Deputy Earl Toineeta, the fourth member of the party. Toineeta had the typical dark skin and broad nose of a Cherokee Indian. He was full blood.\n\nThe man was clad in rough chino pants and a heavy denim jacket. A new fedora hat sat incongruously on his head.\n\n\"Earl,\" the sheriff spoke, \"this ground's damp from that drizzle of rain we had last night. Can you make out anything from the tracks?\"\n\nToineeta walked over to Lester, pulled up one leg, and examined the bottom of his boots. In a deep rumbling voice he said, \"Well, the dead fella came down the trail, same as we did; stopped for a smoke at the rock.\"\n\nMotioning to Lester, he went on. \"This fella came the other way, stood near the rock and looked at the body, then walked on, in th' direction of the logging road where his car was.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Lester interrupted. \"Went straight down to Conley's store 'n called th' police from there.\"\n\nSheriff Ramsey drew his hand across his chin. \"Earl, did anyone come near the body from off the trail?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\nRamsey glanced around the forest. Light from the dull overcast day shone on the scene through the bare limbs of oaks and hickories. The ground was carpeted with ochre-colored leaves that had fallen a month ago.\n\n\"I want you to do a circuit, Earl. Cover this whole bowl of forest where McCarter could be seen. See if you can find any footprints.\"\n\nToineeta began to walk slowly out into the forest, head down, as if he were deep in thought. \n\nAfter about ten minutes three more men, one bearing a stretcher and a body bag, came down the trail. One of them, the medical examiner for Nantahala County, gave orders to the second as he took photographs of the body and the surroundings. Just as they were loading the body of Floyd McCarter onto the stretcher, they heard a cry from Toineeta.\n\n\"Yo!\" he said, waving to the sheriff. \n\nSheriff Ramsey hurried up to Toineeta, who had leaned against a tree trunk and lit a cigarette. \"What you got?\"\n\nInhaling deeply from his Lucky Strike, the man replied. \"Somebody stood or hunkered down just inside this azalea thicket here. Squirmed around a bit. Then walked back thatta way, same way as he come.\"\n\n\"Hm. Let's ...wait, any spent shells around?\"\n\n\"Nope. There's a clean line of sight from where this fella was to where McCarter sat. But if the shot was fired from here, he must of picked up his shell.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see where he went.\"\n\nThe two men began to walk toward the ridge, Toineeta in the lead. Occasionally he stopped and backtracked, but always made progress. How the hell does he do it, Ramsey thought. It would be all I could do to track a wild boar through here.\n\nSoon the men descended to the small creek. Toineeta pointed out a footprint plainly outlined in the soft ground near the creek. \"If you need to make a plaster cast of the print, there's a good one.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nToineeta paused to study the footprint. After a moment he said, \"This fella don't weigh much.\"\n\n\"Is that right.\"\n\n\"Uh huh. That's maybe a size ten boot, but the print ain't deep. He ain't a heavy man, probably 140 pounds tops.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the sheriff said, \"that helps some, I guess.\"\n\nAfter slowly examining the ground around them, Toineeta waded across the creek. Sheriff Ramsey lit a Pall Mall and smoked half of it as his deputy carefully studied the ground, in ever widening circles, on the other side of the creek.\n\nThen he waded back across. After a moment of silence, the sheriff said, \"Well?\"\n\n\"Funny. He didn't come out on the other side. Must of waded up or down the creek for a ways before he came out. Gonna take awhile to pick up the trail again.\"\n\n\"Ah, damn,\" the sheriff swore quietly. This was no hunting accident, he thought. It was murder, pure and simple. He glanced at Toineeta, saying, \"Okay, that's your job, Earl. Cover both sides o' th' creek until you pick up the trail. I don't care how long it takes.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna walk back to the cruiser and call in. It's.. let's see, two o'clock now. Th' McCarters don't live far from here. Reckon I might as well go give them the bad news. Keep on with your trackin'. Figure out where the son of a bitch went. I'll have Paul wait for you at the loggin' road. Okay?\"\n\n\"Yep.\" Without another word, Toineeta began to work his way along the creek bank, his eyes again on the ground.\n\n******* The McCarter house had a front porch that extended the width of the house. It offered a view of pastureland encircled by blue ridges. On clear winter days one could look west and see the Unicoi Mountains in neighboring Tennessee. \n\nA little girl sat in a wooden swing on the porch. She was playing with a Raggedy Ann doll and humming softly to herself.\n\nBonnie McCarter, like her mother, was fair-skinned, blessed with an abundance of soft blonde curls. The only distraction from her little-girl charm was a wide gap in her front teeth. She had great expressive blue eyes which only added to the air of delicacy and innocence about her. \n\nNow eleven years old, Bonnie was in the fourth grade. She had been held back a year in school when she was eight. She isn't retarded, the teachers explained; just a bit slow. She has difficulty reading and doing basic math. But she's such a sweet child.\n\nBonnie heard the sound and then watched as a 1948 Chevrolet, black and white, wound its way up their gravel driveway and pulled into the yard. On the car's white front door was inscribed Nantahala County Sheriff's Department. \n\nBonnie watched as a tall man in his late 50s got out. Sheriff George Ramsey walked to the porch steps, saying, \"Howdy, young'un. Your mama around?\"\n\nAt that moment Eva came out the front door, and the sheriff removed his hat. \"You're Miz Floyd McCarter?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes I am.\"\n\n\"Miz McCarter, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. The worst kind.\"\n\nThe boy had quit chopping wood when he saw the police cruiser drive up to the house. His heart now beating fast, he walked down to the side of the porch and looked up to see Bonnie and his mother embracing, sobbing quietly. \n\nThe sight was like a dagger in his heart. I knew it would shock them, he thought. Knew there'd be tears. But how it hurts to see little Bonnie crying like that. At once tears came to his own eyes. He shed tears for his mother and sister and for them alone.\n\nHe glanced over to the sheriff, now aware that an inevitable part of the drama was being played out. He mounted the porch. His mother, seeing him, cried, \"Oh lord, Jim Roy! Your father's dead! It was a huntin' accident!\"\n\nMustering a stunned look, he crossed the porch and embraced his tearful mother. Soon Jim Roy was holding his little sister, tears streaming down both their cheeks. \n\nSheriff Ramsey watched the piteous scene; one that he had witnessed dozens of times as sheriff. Odd, he thought. Is it my imagination, or did that boy start crying even before they told him the news? \n\nAfter a few moments, Jim Roy came part way down the steps and said, \"How did it happen?\" \n\n\"We guess maybe it was a stray bullet from another hunter,\" Sheriff Ramsey replied. \"A fella found him shot in the head, over on the other side of the Santeetlah, down Windy Gap trail.\" He made no mention of the tracks in the forest and the fact that he considered it a case of premeditated murder. Don't yet need to tell these poor folks that, he said to himself.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Jim Roy asked.\n\n\"Miz McCarter, does your husband drive a '42 DeSoto, black coupe?\"\n\n\"Yes, he does.\"\n\n\"We saw it parked at the old logging road at the trailhead. I'll radio my deputies and have one of them bring it home. Can you drive it?\"\n\n\"No, I can't.\"\n\n\"Got a telephone here?\"\n\n\"Do you see a line!\" For two years she had begged Floyd to pay for a telephone and lines to the house.\n\n\"Hm. Don't Earnest Wilson live down the road here from you? Raises Herefords?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're our neighbors.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Earnest or his boy to come pick you up and drive you into Millsboro. We got the body there at the county morgue, and you'll need to identify it. Do you have a funeral home?\"\n\nEva McCarter brushed away another tear. \"Yes, we got burial insurance with Oakley's there in Millsboro. They buried Floyd's mother last year.\"\n\n\"Well, have Earnest drive you over to them and make arrangements.\" He paused, once again drawn to Jim Roy's eyes but seeing only grief there. \"I'd better be goin' now. Just wait for Earnest to come pick you up. About supper time I reckon.\"\n\nEva took a deep breath. \"Thank you, Sheriff. We'll manage somehow.\"\n\n*******\n\nThat night Sheriff Ramsey sat at the Grapevine Caf\u00e9 in Millsboro, having the blue plate special: meat loaf, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn. Earl Toineeta sat across from him sipping a cup of coffee.\n\n\"So tell me what you found,\" the sheriff said.\n\nToineeta lit a cigarette, then spoke in his deep voice. \"Followed the creek, both sides, for th' better part of a mile. But no tracks on the other side.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Dunno. Found one place where something had come out of the creek. Wasn't a bear or a deer. But there weren't no tracks like we seen.\" He took a sip of coffee, then went on. \"Couldn't find any tracks leading in from the far side of that creek either.\"\n\n\"Hm. Well, I'll need you to go back and take another look tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Don't think so.\"\n\nThe sheriff looked up from his meal. \"How come?\"\n\nToineeta took another draw from his Lucky Strike. \"I can track a man across a linoleum floor if he don't know I'm after him. But it's different when the fella knows.\"\n\n\"I think this fella knew his tracks would give him away. And he done some things to be sure them tracks wouldn't lead us to him. The smarter the man, the tougher he is to follow. Your best bet is to make a plaster cast of that footprint by the creek, and see if you can match it.\"\n\n\"Okay. You and Paul go out there and do that tomorrow mornin'.\"\n\n\"Reckon this fella killed the hunter?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Waited for him up there in that laurel, and shot the poor bastard down in cold blood. And that's murder. So let's find the son of a bitch who did it.\"",
        "*******\n\nThe next evening, Jim Roy sat on the sofa in their living room. The house was now filled with grieving kinfolk and friends who had come to offer, in equal amounts, sympathy and endless platters of food. The kitchen table was groaning with casseroles, bowls of fried chicken, jello salad: a great banquet. Regardless of their sorrow, no one would go hungry.\n\nOnce again the boy's eyes were drawn to Bonnie, now sitting in her Aunt Carol's lap. The older woman gazed lovingly at the little girl, offering words of solace and comfort.\n\nThey're all like that, the boy thought. Something about Bonnie draws them. I'm the same way. You want to reassure and protect her any way you can. You'd do just about anything for a little girl like her.\n\nHis mind wandered back to that fateful day in September. Like the sharp crack of a hunting rifle, he could recall every detail of that terrible day. A day in which a man's death warrant had been drawn up.\n\nIt had been the first cool day in months; one that signals the end of summer. The air was crisp, the sky deep blue. Jim Roy had been doing his algebra homework on the front porch, and for no particular reason decided to go into the house.\n\nEva and Bonnie were on the back porch, canning the last tomatoes of the season. The little girl, wearing a thin blouse and cotton shorts, had come into the house and was going to her room to put on a sweater.\n\nFloyd had been in the living room, listening to the radio and drinking Schlitz beer, relaxing after another day at the saw mill. Jim Roy entered the front door just as his father got up to get another beer, meeting Bonnie at the doorway from the living room to the kitchen.\n\nFloyd stopped her, a hand on the little girl's shoulder. She looked up at him, a shy grin on her face. Then her eyes grew large as he placed his other hand on her chest and moved it around.\n\nBonnie looked at him in shock. She began to struggle as he roughly caressed her. \"Daddy, don't! I don't like that!\" the little girl cried.\n\nFloyd McCarter chuckled. \"You'll be ready to bleed pretty soon, little gal,\" he smiled. \"Yep, ready to bleed.\"\n\n\"Please, Daddy! No!\" the child whimpered. But her father only held and fondled her. Then he saw that Bonnie was looking toward the front door. His own eyes followed. Jim Roy stood there watching them, a sickened look on his face.\n\nFloyd roughly pushed his daughter away, then turned to Jim Roy. \"What you lookin' at, buster? Ain't you got nothin' better to do! Go see if your mama has enough wood for th' cook stove. Git your ass outta here 'fore I kick it out!\"\n\nJim Roy turned and rushed from the house. Down the porch steps and down the driveway. He did not stop until he was halfway to the road. He sat down on the mossy ground under a great sugar maple tree and looked off toward the distant ridges.\n\nHis heart was pounding; tears filled his eyes. In his mind he began to speak to his father.\n\nI've put up with you kicking and beating me. Gone to school with a black eye you gave me, Daddy. And watched you slap my mother around. I've run up into the woods just so I wouldn't have to listen to you yell at her. So I couldn't hear the 'whack' when your hand strikes her. And her pleading cries.\n\nI've taken all that. And somehow learned to live with it. But little Bonnie? The most innocent, trusting child in the world? She just wants her daddy to love her! But that's not what you want, is it? You're going to use her. Daddy, she's eleven years old. Still a child, and your own daughter! What kind of man would do that!\n\nJim Roy thought he might explode from the anger and helplessness. \n\nBut then, quite suddenly, an eerie calm swept over him. It was a cool, almost reptilian feeling. At long last came certitude. In a few seconds the decision was made, there under a maple tree on a gorgeous late summer day. Jim Roy felt something like relief.\n\nThe idea had first come to him almost a year ago. He had blushed in shame that such a hateful, despicable thought could enter his mind. For a year that idea, from time to time, had crept into his thoughts like an evil genie. \n\nHe had resisted and rationalized. Half an hour ago he was certain that his conscience would never allow him to do something so unthinkable. But that was before he saw the look of terror on little Bonnie's face; felt the same hurt and fear she must have felt. \n\nAt that moment the boy became, in some way, a man. An odd thought crossed his mind: the hardest part is now over.\n\nJim Roy calmly rose up and began to walk back home. Had someone stopped to talk to him, they would have noticed a quiet resolve about him. They would have seen that his brown eyes had grown dark; as dark as night.\n\nHe felt that same sense of purpose later when he reclined on his bed, looking at a recent issue of Field and Stream magazine. He turned to the back of the magazine where ads were listed, including ads for mail-order rifles. In the calm detached manner of a good hunter, the boy carefully read each ad.\n\n*******\n\nHis Uncle Rafe McCarter, Floyd's older brother, came over and sat beside Jim Roy on the sofa. \"How are you holdin' up, son?\"\n\n\"I'm doin' okay.\"\n\nThe man had thinning dark hair; a moustache that was beginning to show gray. \"It's an awful thing for a boy to lose his father. Now ole Floyd, maybe he wasn't the easiest fella to get along with, that McCarter temper and all. But I know he wuz a good provider, and wanted the best for y'all. Ain't that right?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, that's right.\"\n\n\"Well, just remember all the good things about your daddy. Th' times you and him went huntin' 'n fishin'. He taught you how to shoot a rifle, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, he did.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you're a good shot. Can you hit what you aim at?\"\n\n\"Yes, most of the time I can.\"\n\nThe conversation lagged. Jim Roy began to recall what followed that September afternoon. How the wheels were set in motion. \n\nTwo days later he had ridden his bicycle to school, and afterwards peddled all the way into Citico County and the little village of Hayesville, which had just been awarded a post office. He opened a post office box there, paying cash that he had earned working the tobacco fields that summer.\n\nThe next day, summer's heat returned one last time. He spent part of the sweltering afternoon in study hall. That previous spring, students in his English class had been taught how to write a business letter. Now Jim Roy recalled what he had learned. On his school notebook paper he carefully composed a letter:\n\nSeptember 19, 1949\n\nDear Sir or Madam: I would like to order a Browning .27 caliber hunting rifle (Item #433) that was advertised by your company, H & M Products, in Field and Stream magazine. I have enclosed with this letter a mail order check for $74.95 plus $10 for shipping. Please send the ordered item to Box Holder<br> P.O. Box 7<br> Hayesville, North Carolina\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this order.\n\n*******\n\nOn the day after Floyd McCarter was laid to rest in the Bethel Methodist Church cemetery, Sheriff Ramsey paid a visit to his family. He sat on the sofa in the McCarter living room as they eyed him with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.\n\n\"Miz McCarter,\" the sheriff began, \"could the little girl maybe go into her room for a while? She don't need to hear this.\"\n\nEva turned to her daughter. \"Honey, why don't you go in your room and read those funny books cousin Stella brought you? Be a dear.\"\n\nAfter the child had left, the sheriff turned to Eva and Jim Roy. \"Now, they'll be a hearing on your husband's death, Miz McCarter. Most likely it'll be declared an accident. There was a lot o' dern fools out in the woods hunting that day, some of 'em liquored up, bangin' away at anything that moved. It's possible your husband was hit by a stray bullet.\"\n\n\"But I have to be able to tell the judge that it was not anything else. That it could not have been murder, premeditated or otherwise. Now, did your husband have any old enemies? People he's quarreled or got in a fight with? Did you ever hear anyone threaten to kill him?\"\n\n\"No!\" Eva replied. \"I mean, Floyd had a temper, everbody knows that. He'd get into fights now and then. But I never heard of anyone wantin' to kill him.\"\n\nLowering his voice, the sheriff went on. \"Miz McCarter, I been told that ever once in a while you'd come to church or go shopping with a black eye. Bruises on you.\"\n\nThe woman eyed him for a moment. \"What are you sayin'?\"\n\n\"And Jim Roy,\" the sheriff went on, \"didn't you show up for school once or twice with a black eye?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute!\" Eva cried angrily. \"That's none of your business! And if you think one of us would want Floyd dead, you can just get out of my house right now! You got no right to talk to us that way!\"\n\nColor came to the sheriff's face. \"You listen to me, both of you!\" he growled. \"I been sheriffin' here in Nantahala County for nearly thirty years. I know blood kin will gun each other down, because I've seen it. Plenty of times! And I ain't leavin' here 'til I get some answers! Floyd McCarter was a wife beater, wasn't he? And he beat up on this boy here too.\"\n\nTears welled up in Eva's eyes. \"Yes,\" she said miserably, \"he'd hit us once in a while, but we put up with it! We wouldn't do him no harm for it!\"\n\nSheriff Ramsey had been eyeing Jim Roy during the conversation. Kid's not shown an ounce of emotion, he thought. Looks at me with snake eyes. \"Son, were you here at home the morning your daddy was shot?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. He told me to stay here 'n chop kindling and wood for th' stoves.\"\n\n\"Miz McCarter, was this boy home all morning? Can you vouch for him?\"\n\nFor a fraction of a second Jim Roy's eyes met his mother's. After a brief hesitation she replied. \"Yes. He was here the whole time. I heard him choppin' wood.\"\n\n\"Hm. Son, do you own a rifle?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. It's in my bedroom.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look at it.\"\n\nA moment later Jim Roy was taking down his Savage .22 caliber rifle that was mounted on the wall above the chest of drawers in his room. He handed it to the sheriff. Ramsey looked at the rifle, and smelled the end of the barrel.\n\n\"Ain't been fired in a while.\"\n\n\"No sir. Maybe a couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"Only gun you own?\" The sheriff looked at the boy. One cool customer, he thought. Snake eyes.\n\n\"Yes sir.\" \n\n\"Now, show me the bottom of your shoes.\"\n\nWithout hesitating Jim Roy raised up his foot so that the sheriff could see the soles of his Sears-Roebuck work shoes. The Wolverine boots that now lay in the bottom of the Santeetlah River had been bought a month ago in Hayesville. And worn only one time.\n\n\"You own any boots?\"\n\n\"No, just my go to church shoes, and some galoshes.\"\n\nA few moments later Sheriff Ramsey was back in the living room, again eyeing the boy and his mother. Drawing his hand across his chin, he said, \"Son, how's about if you and me have a little talk, man to man, out in my car? Get your coat.\"\n\n\"He didn't do nothin'!\" Eva wailed as Jim Roy put on his coat. \"He's just a boy, only fourteen! He couldn't hurt a fly! You can tell that just by lookin' at him!\"\n\n\"Yes Ma'm,\" the sheriff replied as Jim Roy put on his wool jacket. The man and the boy walked onto the porch and through sprinkling rain to the police car. As they got in, the rain began to intensify, drumming loudly on the car's roof.\n\nSheriff Ramsey, now in his own element, lit a Pall Mall and gazed through the windshield at the driving sheets of rain. \"You know, son, when you've been a law man long as I have, you get a nose for crime. You get to where you can smell guilt on a man, just like he was a skunk.\"\n\nThe boy made no reply. \n\n\"Now, I don't know how you done it. But I can smell guilt on you. I think you shot down your own father on account of the way he treated you and your mama. Did you?\"\n\nJim Roy looked into Sheriff Ramsey's eyes, never wavering, as he said, \"No sir. I did not.\" Once again he was hearing in his mind a little girl's voice. \n\nBlessed assurance, Jesus is mine! <br> Oh what a foretaste of glory divine!\n\nWith absolute clarity he remembered Bonnie in church a few weeks ago. Wearing her straw hat with blue ribbons trailing down, she had sung that hymn, the soft morning light on her. Bonnie has such a pretty voice, he thought.\n\nSheriff Ramsey now spoke in his most soothing, fatherly tone. \"Son, I know it's rough on a boy, havin' to take punches from his old man, and seeing his own mother slapped around. Now, you tell me what happened out in them woods, right here and now. I'll do everthing I can to see you get a fair shake. I'll put in a word for you with the judge. I just want to do what's right. Will you tell me?\"\n\nThe child's lilting voice now filled Jim Roy's mind. Somehow the image of Bonnie in church was as real as sitting in a police car with the rain pelting down.\n\nWatching and waiting, looking above, Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.\n\nFor a while the law man and the young boy eyed each other in silence. The rainstorm now reached a crescendo, obliterating from sight everything beyond the car. Jim Roy turned to watch rainwater flooding down the windshield. Finally he spoke. \n\n\"Sheriff ...\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Ever night when my little sister goes to bed, she won't turn off the light 'til me and Mama have kissed her goodnight. She tells me how much she loves us. Last night Bonnie told me she was glad she had a big brother to look after her, now that Daddy's gone. Don't you think it was sweet of her to say that?\" \n\nOnce again the eyes of the man and the boy locked together. A shudder ran through Sheriff Ramsey as the light of comprehension began to dawn in him. I never thought about the little girl! he said to himself. Never thought about her at all! \n\nHe noticed that Jim Roy's eyes were much darker than he realized; almost black. Now, with cool defiance, his eyes spoke: if you think I killed my father, prove it. But until then, I'm going to be Bonnie's big brother, and take care of her. Just as I always have.\n\nIs that it? Sheriff Ramsey thought. Was that your breaking point? Something that would drive even an innocent boy to do the unthinkable? \n\nHe gazed into the boy's dark eyes, now grown cold. As he had often done on long sleepless nights, the sheriff reflected how life seldom presents choices in black and white. But rather in subtle shades of gray.\n\nIf he did it to protect that little girl, how do I serve justice here, the sheriff thought. Or has justice already been served? Right and wrong. Where is the line?\n\nAs quickly as it had begun, the rainstorm began to abate. Sheriff Ramsey took a deep breath. \"Son, do you realize how your life just changed?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Whatever your daddy was, he was the breadwinner. Now he's gone. And you're goin' t' have to step forward, help support your family. You'll need to get a part time job, afternoons and weekends. Full time job all summer. You willin' to do that?\"\n\n\"Of course I am.\"\n\n\"You won't be able to do lots of things young fellas your age do. You've got to be a man now.\"\n\nI am already a man, Jim Roy thought. I became a man on a perfect sunny day back in September.\n\nSheriff Ramsey stubbed out his cigarette and lit another, now angered by the moral dilemma facing him. Glaring at the boy, he said, \"You McCarters been livin' in these hills since Andy Jackson was president. And you've all got hot tempers. When you have a grievance, you settle it your own way, no matter what the law says. Ain't that right?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Jim Roy paused, then went on, \"\"Am I considered a suspect?\"\n\n\"Son, you'll always be a suspect as far as I'm concerned. But a man is innocent until proven guilty. I can't point any suspicion toward you until I've got hard evidence. But I meant what said about helpin' your folks. You got a duty now. If you run off and leave them, I'll hunt you down and bring you back. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Now get out of my car. I'm sick of the sight of you.\"\n\nJim Roy quickly left the car and sprinted to the house without looking back. The sheriff watched him go, knowing that the investigation into the death of Floyd McCarter would be brief. With one final quiet \"Dammit all,\" he started up the motor and drove down the driveway. \n\n*******\n\nThe storm passed quickly through Nantahala County and was gone by evening. When Jim Roy came into Bonnie's bedroom to say goodnight, a half moon was shining through the window. The room was moonlight and shadows and pale golden light from a small lamp on the little girl's nightstand.\n\nThe boy bent down and quickly kissed his sister on the forehead. In the dim light he could see a pensive look on Bonnie's face.\n\n\"What are you thinkin' about, sweet pea?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just thinkin' about Daddy,\" she replied quietly. \"How I'll never see him again. He won't never bring me Hershey's Kisses no more, or take my hand when we walk into church, or buy me a birthday present. I've got you, but I'll never have a daddy any more.\"\n\nThe little girl's words cut like a knife. Now washing over Jim Roy was unbearable guilt. Dear God what have I done, he thought. I took a gun and killed a man. How can I live with that every day?\n\nTears welled up and filled Jim Roy's eyes. Tears for his lost innocence. Tears for wanting to make their lives better. Tears for being able to look at his father through the scope of a rifle and then squeeze the trigger.\n\n\"You'll miss him too, won't you?\" Bonnie asked.\n\n\"I'll never forget him.\"\n\nJim Roy felt smothered in black despair. Unable to be in the little girl's presence, he got up and hurried to the door. \n\nAt the last possible second, Bonnie spoke. \"Jim Roy, come back a minute.\" \n\nHe returned and sat on the bed, wiping away searing tears of guilt. The little girl took his hand.\n\nIn a low voice, she said, \"Daddy wasn't a good man, was he?\"\n\n\"No, not always.\"\n\n\"He scared me, Jim Roy, the way he would grab me when Mama wasn't around. And lookin' at me, like a snake watchin' a mouse.\" She paused and took a deep breath. \"I think Daddy was gonna hurt me. He was gonna hurt me real bad, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, Bonnie, he was.\"\n\nHer voice near breaking, she said, \"Jim Roy, some part of me is glad that Daddy's gone. Glad that you 'n Mama don't have to take any more beatin's from him. Somehow I'm relieved that I don't have to be scared of him no more.\"\n\nThe boy sighed but said nothing.\n\n\"Am I bad for thinkin' that? For feelin' grateful that he's not here and can't hurt us?\"\n\n\"Of course you aren't bad, sweet pea. Now, can I ask you to do something? It really means a lot to me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Me 'n Mama are goin' to work hard so's we can stay a family. But in some ways, Bonnie, you're the most important one of us. You're the one who holds us together when you laugh and play and sing. When we see you happy, we know it's worth it. So I want you to be the sweet little girl you've always been. I want you to grow up happy 'n carefree, the way girls were meant to. Can you do that for me?\"\n\nBonnie smiled. \"Yes,\" she murmured. \"Now I can do that.\" \n\n*******\n\nBethel Methodist Church sat on a high knoll overlooking the Santeetlah River. The church had recently built a flagstone pavilion on one side. When weather permitted, special events like wedding receptions were held there.\n\nOn a warm May afternoon in 1958, a young man, uncomfortable in his navy blue suit, stood watching the celebration on the pavilion. Jim Roy McCarter was considered handsome, his features marred only by a somber look that never left his face.\n\nHis eyes were riveted to two women enjoying the dancing. Mama's put on some weight, he thought to himself. But still good-looking. Can't say the same about the man holding her hand.\n\nWill Hampton had been a widower, ten years older and two inches shorter than Eva. He was homely and balding. But Will was a gentle and decent man. He was a hard-working farmer, shy and soft-spoken. And his adoration of the widow Eva McCarter knew no bounds.",
        "Jim Roy recalled the Christmas day two years ago when Will had proposed marriage to Eva. She had accepted at once. After he had left, Eva celebrated with her two children. \"I thought he'd never get around to it,\" she had laughed. Once again light was shining in her blue eyes.\n\nNow Jim Roy's eyes moved to the young bride dancing with her groom on the pavilion. She was lithe and graceful, attractive in a country girl way. She's Mrs. Bonnie Chastain now, the man thought. I guess prettier women have been married in this church, but I'll bet there's never been one more radiant than my little sister. \n\nAfter a moment, Jim Roy noticed that an elderly woman was motioning for him to come to her. He approached the lady, whose name, he remembered, was Mrs. McCall. She had been wheelchair-bound for most of her life, the result of a bout with polio.\n\n\"You know who I am, don't you?\" she asked as Jim Roy drew near.\n\n\"Yes Ma'm. You're Ellen McCall, Carl Chastain's grandmother.\"\n\n\"That's right. Here, sit down and talk to me.\"\n\nThe young man sat beside her in a cane chair. For a moment nothing was said as both watched the couple on the dance floor. \"Nice couple, aren't they?\" the woman finally murmured.\n\nJim Roy managed a smile. \"They sure are.\"\n\nThe old woman turned, gazing at him with hazel eyes whose pupils had faded around the edges. Her white hair shimmering in the breeze, she said, \"I guess an old lady like me can speak her mind.\"\n\n\"When Carl first brought Bonnie home to meet us, we didn't know what to make of her. If you don't mind my sayin' so, most of the other girls he courted were prettier, and smarter too.\"\n\n\"But I swear, that Bonnie had more life to her than any three women. Always smiling and cheerful. She's got a knack for makin' folks feel good. You know what I like to call her?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Our little ray of sunshine. Nobody can light up a room like Bonnie when she walks in. And that sweet voice of hers. They asked her to sing 'Amazing Grace' at my last birthday, you know. And my goodness, she was like an angel come down from high to sing for me. We just love her to pieces.\"\n\n\"It's nice of you to say that.\"\n\nThe old woman turned to Jim Roy, studying him carefully. \"How come you're so different from her? You take after your late father, I reckon.\"\n\n\"In some ways I do. Not all.\"\n\n\"Your problem, son, is that you go around with such a long face. Like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders. You need to brighten up, now your mother 'n sister are married off. You've got a good job, managing the hardware store. But the girls, they like a fella who can smile and make them laugh.\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\n\"So try to be a little more cheerful, Jim Roy. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll try.\"\n\nThe old woman's smile faded. In a low voice she said, \"I don't know that you will.\"\n\nNow uncomfortable, Jim Roy said, \"It was nice talking to you, Mrs. McCall.\" He got up and slowly walked to the back steps of the church. From there he looked out over the cemetery. His eyes were drawn to a marble tombstone near the back on the right side. \n\nHe did not need to read the name chiseled there. He had stood before that grave dozens of times; watched as his mother and sister placed flowers there. That tombstone wandered through his dreams, sometimes accompanied by the sharp report of a hunting rifle.\n\nShaking his head, Jim Roy walked down a path to the river. He sat down on a wide gray rock at the edge. \n\nWell, river, he said to himself, here we are again. You've held my secrets. And Sheriff Ramsey even now looks at me in a certain way. But whatever his suspicions, he's kept them to himself.\n\nThe young man's face grew dark as he looked across the boulders and green water of the Santeetlah. Again came more thoughts. River, I have a question for you. Why is the cost of human happiness so high? Why must it sometimes be bought with blood and guilt and shame? I'd really like to know, because I've lain awake so many nights wishing I knew the answer.\n\nFrom his pocket Jim Roy withdrew a small bronze-colored object: the spent shell of a .27 caliber rifle. He felt its smooth cool surface in the palm of his hand.\n\nAnd another thing, river. Was it worth it? Was happiness for those two women up there at the church worth the price paid? The life of Floyd McCarter, and the shadow over mine? I'll never be free of this burden of guilt. What I did will haunt me for the rest of my life. Was I right to give up any chance of real happiness in exchange for theirs? Tell me, river.\n\nThe river's cold waters flowed around the boulders, seeming to murmur as they went, \"Did you love them that much?\" \n\nA sad smile came to the young man's face. \"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"I loved them that much.\" "
