        "Standing on the edge of the cliff looking out to sea, I watched in the distance, the silhouette of an oil tanker going out to sea. Putting a hand on either side of my hips then taking a deep breath of clean air at the same time listening to the ocean crash on the rocks below. Kneeling down I scooped a handful of dirt then bringing it up to my nose smelling the soil. A tradition of mine before I start a run. \n\nAs I start my daily 10k run to the village and back, I can feel the rays of the sun on my neck. Straight away saying to myself, \"You will need to start earlier next time, or it will be too hot to run in the heat.\" As I entered the village going through the streets, people that I knew began to greet me. Approaching the small roundabout which is in the centre of the village, that is my turning point to return. The run back was much more challenging as the road was ascending. This time the sun is shining directly at me, blinding me as I force myself to finish the last two kilometres. \n\nOn reaching the cottage, tiredness made me crouch on one knee, as I tried to catch my breath. As my breathing started to become regular, I got up slowly, I commenced making my way inside the cottage. Taking a clean towel from the cupboard to wipe the sweat from my face. Unrolling my exercise mat, I started doing some pull-ups, then finishing off with some push-ups. Stretching for another ten minutes before I made my way to the shower. \n\nTwenty minutes later I was sitting in my kitchen with a bowl of porridge in my hand. That is when the doorbell rang. \n\n\"It's open Mrs Watson!\" I shouted. \n\nShe entered the kitchen with a carrier bag in either hand. Quickly putting my bowl down, I got up and went over to help her with the bags. \n\n\"You didn't have to Mrs Watson.\" \n\n\"It's the least I can do George.\"\n\nMrs Watson is my landlady, she is a sweet seventy-two-year-old lady. She lost her husband five years ago. She has been living in a five bedroom house ever since she got married. They bought the house planning on having a big family when seeing Mrs Watson was unable to conceive they made an appointment to see the local GP. That is when they discovered Mr Watson was sterile.\n\nShe always says. \"We should have adopted.\" \n\nWhen I first arrived, my priority was to find somewhere to rent, a small cottage or flat. The locals directed me to Mrs Watson's property. She showed me around the estate, the cottage which was for rent wasn't very large it comprised of two bedrooms, living room and kitchen. It Required some work, a fresh coat of paint and a good clean. I said. \"It's perfect how much will it be per calendar month.\" We agreed on a price in which I wrote her a cheque for twelve months rent. \n\nIn the beginning, she wasn't too delighted about renting to a stranger, but as time went by we built a friendship on the grief, we both suffered. We both lost someone we loved dearly. \n\nShe is always cooking something for me, bringing fresh fruits and vegetables from her gardens. In return when she needs, something to be done on her property like DIY, she calls me. Also, I accompany her to her doctor's appointments, or shopping runs as she doesn't drive.\n\nWhen the rent was due after a year, with my chequebook in my hand, I went to see Mrs Watson.\n\nOn seen open the chequebook she said. \"George that money is not beneficial to me.\"\n\nEmbracing her in my arms while whispering in her ear. \"If it weren't for you I would have gone insane.\" \n\nWhen we released each other, she slapped me on the bum. She said. \"I've made a lovely apple pie sit down we'll have some with our tea.\" \n\n\"Can't say no to that Mrs Watson,\" Was my reply.\n\nNext day I went to the bank opened an account putting \u00a310,000 in it. With the instructions, this money goes to Mrs Watson under my instructions or if anything happens to me. From that day, the word rent was not mentioned again between us.\n\nLet me tell you about myself, my name is George Michaelides I am thirty years old, my height is 6ft. Growing up in London I went to a public school in North London. My hobbies are boxing and reading. At the age of fourteen, I joined a boxing gym just to keep fit. \n\nShowing an interest in boxing, Mr Brown took me under his wing and became my mentor. Been awarded a sports scholarship I went to University to study Sports Science and English Literature. It was in university that I became a semi-pro boxer that is when the decision was made to become a professional boxer. My parents were not happy with my decision as they didn't want me to get hurt.\n\nMy parents worked all their life to give my sister and me a better life. Mum works as a cook in a secondary school, while dad works for a well-established garage in Enfield. My sister Tina was two years older. She got married young she has two lovely boys, Terry nine years old and Jim eight years old. \n\nAt twenty-five I met my wife to be Sarah, she was two years younger than me, Sarah came from a wealthy background, her parents were solicitors, she did not want to follow in their footsteps. After getting a degree in law which was their wish, when she finished her studies she worked with people, helping in charity organisations. Something that did not go down to well with them. \n\nAfter a year of courting, we decided to get married. It was a small wedding, in which Sarah's parents did not agree too, her mother wanted a big wedding since Sarah was their only child. \n\nWe purchased ourselves a two-bedroom flat, struggled with money, but she would not accept her parents help. She would always say. \"Our love is above the power of money.\"\n\nMarried for a year, Sarah was eight months pregnant, I remember it like yesterday. My next fight was critical for me if I win it will put me in the professional middleweight class. She was home that night. She would always say. \"Come back home to me.\" But this time she said. \"Come back home to us.\" Those words still linger in my head.\n\nThe fight was at the O2 Arena, tickets for the event got sold out weeks ago, I was getting ready in the changing rooms when my coach told me to sit down. He sat next to me. Putting his hand on my shoulder, he said. \"This is your big opportunity Son. I want you to go out there and give it your best.\" \n\nStanding in the ring, facing my corner, looking at the crowd while warming up by shadow boxing. Suddenly the crowd erupted in applause, on turning I saw my opponent climbing through the ropes into the ring. When he stood straight, that is when I saw why his nickname was The Serbian Giant, Radovan Brankovic was ranked number three in the world with a height of 7ft 2'. The fight presenter introduced both of us, then presented the referee, that is when the ref took over he called us both into the middle of the ring. Explained the rules in which we both had heard many times in the past. He then told us to go to our corners to wait for the bell to begin. \n\nDing. The Serbian sprang out of his corner coming towards me throwing left and right punches at me. My first thought was, \"Serbian Express should be his nickname.\" I avoided him for three minutes with light blows to my body. \n\nThe second round was like the first, didn't get one chance to land a single blow, was mostly blocking and dodging. I tried to penetrate his defence, but he was too quick for me. I held in for three minutes by moving around the ring. \n\nSitting in my corner waiting for the third round my coach said. \"You have to try to land some blows to his body that is his weakness.\" Nodding my head to say yes as I got up for round three, this round was slower, but still, I could not infiltrate his guard. Near the end of the round he caught me under the chin, I went down for the count. The second time I've been knocked down in my career, the first time I slipped, but this time it was from a punch a powerful punch. Slowly getting up on the eighth count, shaking my head left to right, the referee checked me saw I was ok. He said. \"Carry on.\" Then the bell sounded.\n\nThe coach was checking my chin at the same time putting pressure on my swollen eye. Sitting there exhausted I repeatedly kept on saying. \"I need to make it back home to Sarah.\" Coach grabbed the towel was about to throw it in the ring when I shouted. \"No!\" \n\nDing. Round four began, slowly getting up approaching The Giant, he started swinging punches at me straight away, that is when I saw a break in his rhythm. It was a split second gap, but it was there. Patiently counting his moves taking my time, suddenly it came I ducked, swayed a blow with my left into his rib cage, he stepped back, he put his hand down to protect his side. I hurt him. It was my turn, tapping on his face with my left, waiting for my next opportunity. He moved his hand up to protect his face that is when my second chance came. Putting everything in it, I punched him in the same place just below his ribs this time to work my way up, this punch pushed him off the canvas onto his toes, making him fly back onto the ropes. Ding end of the round. \n\nMy corner was celebrating; the coach was jumping up and down like a Jack in a box. When I sat in my corner coach was explaining something to me, but my eyes were focused on my opponent, waiting for the bell to ring, waiting to finish him off. Round five started, this time It was me who went out first throwing punches with my right at his face, at the same time he was blocking them with his left. I was focused on the other side, watching him put pressure on his side injury to subside the pain. Swinging a punch with all my power to the unprotected side of his face, he flew into the ropes then bounced forward, collapsing onto the canvas. The referee started to count. \"one, two, three.\" When he reached ten there was no movement from Radovan, the referee shouted. \"You are out.\" \n\nMy corner was screaming with joy, while I just stood there watching Radovan waiting for some movement. His coach plus others jumped to his side, while other boxing officials filled the ring blocking my view of him. \n\nAfter the referee had announced me the winner, reporters flooded me with questions, when my next fight was due, will there be a rematch, etc. \n\nWhen I was alone with my coach waiting for the doctor, I asked him. \"Is Radovan ok, did he get up after I knocked him down?\" \n\nCoach looked at me with a sad look on his face he replied. \"The only news I have is they took him to University College Hospital.\"\n\nThe doctor came to the changing rooms to give me a quick examination. When he finished, he was getting ready to leave, I Grabbed him by the hand. I said. \"How is Radovan?\" \n\nHe looked at me then turned to my coach. He said. \"Didn't you tell him?\" \n\nI shouted out. \"Tell me what!\" \n\n\"He's in a coma son.\" Coach said. \n\nI quickly showered and got ready to go to the hospital. When I got there, I asked to see Radovan Brankovic explaining to the nurse the situation, but the nurse couldn't give me any information as I wasn't family. Ending up driving around Central London, replaying in my mind the events of what happened earlier. \"Why didn't I let the coach throw in the towel, that would have stopped the fight, all this would not have happened.\" Was my thought.\n\nEntering our flat at 5 am in the morning. Sarah appeared from the living room straight away. \"I was worried sick. I thought something happened to you.\" She said. \n\nTaking her by the hand, we went to sit in the living room. I explained to her all that happened that night. Eventually, it was all true the Serbian was in a coma. \n\nThe money in which I made from that fight paid the mortgage we had on the flat and still had some money left over. My manager tried to arrange another contest for me, but I did not want to know. All week chat shows kept leaving messages on my mobile for an interview. All I could think of was Radovan coming out of a coma. \n\nFor two weeks, I couldn't sleep or eat. Every day going to the hospital to see how he was, at first his family didn't want to see me there. Eventually, they saw I was suffering too. His wife Malina came up to me one day, she said. \"Go home if there is any change we will inform you.\" \n\n\"Call me if there is any change,\" I said.\n\nTwo days after my last visit to the hospital, Sarah was trying all day to cheer me up. We made plans to go out for a meal that night. I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was raining all day, in the evening it had stopped. We left the flat at around 8 pm. Sarah was so happy that night, I hadn't seen her like that for a long time, she was laughing and joking. \n\nWe were stopped at the traffic lights, all of a sudden, there was a big crash forcing the car to judder forward into the traffic ahead, I saw some lights on my right coming towards the car, then everything went blurry to black. Coming around I was face down on the tarmac, hearing sirens in the distance, while people were speaking around me, then everything darkened again. \n\nWhen I woke up I was lying in bed, everything around me was white I blinked a couple of times for my eyes to adjust. Then I heard a familiar voice it was my mother. \"He's waking up.\" Rushing towards me to the side of the bed, mum grabbing my hand while dad and my sister were behind her. \n\n\"Where is Sarah,\" I said. \n\nThey put their heads down while my father answered. \"We lost her son,\" \n\nI shouted. \"NO, NO, NO!\" \n\nTrying to get out of bed, I felt a jab on my arm, everything went black again.\n\nA drunk driver caused the accident. We were waiting at the traffic lights, he hit us in the rear, due to the road been wet he pushed the car into a dual carriageway. The car got hit by a van which instantly flipped to its side. The drunk driver died instantly, Sarah died in hospital in the operating theatre.\n\nThe funeral was held two weeks later in a private part of Southgate Cemetery. Keeping my distance from Sarah's family, especially her parents. On leaving the cemetery we crossed paths with her parents, her mother started to cry as soon as she spotted me, but her father looked at me with hate in his eyes. \n\nHe said. \"You killed my little girl you bastard!\" \n\nSarah's father tried to take me to court for the manslaughter of his daughter. He had a lot of influence on the court, but it did not help him win the case. That is when I decided to leave London never to return. \n\nThat was just over three years ago since then I have moved to a village in North Wales. Porthmadog is my home now. No one knows where I am, not even my family. The only person I have spoken about what happened was Mrs Watson. One night of recognition in the boxing world was not enough for people to know me in a small village in Wales. \n\nNow living day by day, I have written a novel which took me two years to complete. Had it published under an anonymous name? It surprised me, it wasn't a number one hit, but it stayed in the top ten for a couple of months. Sarah would have been very proud of me if she was still alive. Now, most evenings I spend with Mrs Watson, keeping each other company.\n\n*****\n\nIt was a warm Sunday afternoon, Mrs Watson and I were enjoying one of her delicious blueberry pies with a cup of tea on her porch. From where the porch was you could see the road leading to the village. In the distance, we saw something shining from the reflection of the sun. As it got closer to the house, we noticed it was a black sedan. I did not recognise it as one of the residents of the village, that is when I knew it was here for me. \n\nThe car stopped twenty metres from the house, the sun was reflecting on the glass so you couldn't see who was inside. I slowly got up supported myself on the porch rails waiting in anticipation to see who it was. As the car door opened, a lady got out of the car. It was as if I saw a ghost, Sarah's ghost. But it wasn't. It was Jacky Taylor my ex-mother-in-law. Dressed up like she came from a funeral, all in black. She approached the house, just before the steps leading to the house she took off her sunglasses while she looked up. \n\n\"It took you a while to find me Mrs Taylor, has new evidence been found against me!\" I said.\n\nShe looked at me for a few seconds before answering. \"Hello George, I knew where you were when you moved here, did not want to cause you any problems, we all suffered enough.\" \n\nThat is when Mrs Watson spoke. \"Please come up join us for some tea.\" \n\nMrs Watson reorganised the chairs, then asked Jacky to have a seat. \n\nStill standing in the same spot holding onto the porch tight looking towards the village, not wanting to look at her. I said. \"Why are you here?\" \n\n\"Your father-in-law passed away.\" She replied. \n\nSlowly turning away, I started walking towards the cottage. \"I'll send some flowers with my florist,\" I said\n\n\"The baby survived!\" she shouted. \n\nFreezing on the spot, I felt a tear run down my cheek. Still facing away, I carried on walking. I said. \"Leave all the details with Mrs Watson.\" \n\nPacing up and down the living room of the cottage, trying to think, at the same time saying to myself. \"Jacky is lying, why come to tell me that my child is alive.\" Needing air, I opened the back door I stepped outside. I had a stack of logs piled on one side of the cottage. Taking my axe, I started to chop firewood, carried on till my arms ached.\n\nThen a voice from behind said. \"We won't need wood until winter George.\" \n\nThat's when I collapsed onto my knees put my head down I started to cry. Mrs Watson came behind me kneeled down to put her arm around my shoulder. \n\n\"Why don't we go inside George.\" She whispered. \n\nSitting on the sofa just staring at the TV. The show Britain's Got Talent was on with Simon saying something to Amanda while laughing. The volume was off, I didn't hear what he said, but what came into my mind was. \"Will I ever laugh like that again.\"\n\nMrs Watson came into the living room with two mugs of tea. She put one of them in front of me on the coffee table held the other one in her hand. She sat next to me rubbing my back with the palm of her other hand. \n\n\"It is a long drive back to the hotel, so Jacky is staying at the house with me tonight.\" Mrs Watson said. \n\nAngrily turning to look at her I said. \"That woman and her husband tried to destroy me.\"\n\n\"George, you will have some time to calm down, in the morning you can come to my house, all three of us can have breakfast then you two can talk.\" \n\nStill looking at her I said. \"Ok Mrs Watson, but I am only doing this because I respect you.\" \n\nAll night all I could do was toss and turn in the bed. Thinking \"What if it's true. Could the baby have survived.\"\n\nManaging to fall asleep in the early hours of the morning, I was late getting up. It was the first time I did not go for a run. After a shower, I got dressed then made my way to Mrs Watson's house. Approaching the back door which took me directly to her kitchen, I could hear there was a conversation between the two ladies.\n\nKnocking on the door, I waited for an answer.\n\nMrs Watson called out. \"It's open George!\"\n\nOn entering the kitchen. Sitting at the table was Mrs Taylor, Mrs Watson was preparing something on the stove. \n\n\"Good morning, Mrs Watson, good morning Mrs Taylor,\" I said.\n\nThey both responded with \"Good morning George\" at the same time. \n\n\"Didn't see you go for a jog this morning George.\" Mrs Watson said. \n\n\"I felt a little down today.\"\n\nHelping her with the preparation of the breakfast we both sat as well at the table to have something to eat. When we finished, I got up to clearing the table. \n\nMrs Watson told me. \"Take a seat George let me do that later.\" \n\nThat's when Mrs Taylor spoke. \"You've become very close to my son-in-law Mrs Watson.\" \n\nI looked at her angrily saying. \"Son-in-law!\" \n\nShe got up walked out of the kitchen rushing upstairs. \n\nMrs Watson looked at me with frowned eyebrows. She said \"she found out about her grandson two days ago, Jacky didn't know what to do, you were the only person she could think of to help her find him. Yes, George, she did not know the baby survived.\"",
        "We heard the front door close. Running to the door I quickly opened it, Jacky was getting into the car. Sprinting to the car putting my hand to block the door from closing. \n\n\"Sorry seen you suddenly like that shocked me it made me angry, please come back so we can talk,\" I said\n\nWe went back into the house sat back down at the kitchen table. Mrs Watson made us each a cup of tea, then said. \"I need to attend to my flowers in the garden.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a couple of minutes. It was starting to get acquired. I said \"How did you find out about the baby,\"\n\nShe explained that she had no indication of what her husband had done. Two days ago, she was cleaning up his office when she found a file which contained a birth certificate for a baby boy who was born on the day Sarah died. The file also included adoption papers, signed receipts, for money Ian gave to the family to move somewhere far away.\n\n\"Would you like a cup of coffee, because I could do with one,\" I said\n\n\"Yes please.\"\n\nI put the coffee in front of her then sat back down. \n\nShe started to speak again. \"My daughter loved you very much, she would come to visit me, yes when her father was at the office she would come home, we would sit and talk for hours. It was George this, George that, it came to a point I knew you more than I knew my husband. That fatal night I didn't lose a daughter, I also lost a son.\"\n\n\"Did you bring the file with you so we can study the the paperwork?\" I asked.\n\n\"I didn't bring anything with me.\"\n\nStanding up walking up to the window looking outside thinking of Sarah. \"What do I do Sarah, where do I begin looking? Can your mother be trusted, what if she is lying, trying to set me up, put me in jail? Then again what have I got to lose?\"\n\n\"I will Return to London in a couple of days,\" I said \n\nBy midday, Mrs Taylor got ready to drive back to London. Mrs Watson prepared something for her to take with her on her journey. Standing on the porch with Mrs Watson watching her get in her car to go. She opened the car window smiled while waving goodbye as she started to drive away. I stood there staring until the car disappeared.\n\nGoing back inside sitting at Mrs Watson's kitchen table just staring into space. She came in sat down next to me, she put her hand on mine. She said. \"George I have faith in you, you will find your son. You are a good man, what happened with that boxer and your wife was an accident. You will find happiness again.\"\n\n\"It scares me Mrs Watsons, how do I know she is not lying to me. What if there is no child, if there is will I find it. Will I be able to go through this heartbreak again?\"\n\n\"You have to try to find your son George, you have to do it for Sarah. Jacky is lying to you I don't think so. Did you not see her eyes, how much love there was for her son-in-law. Yes, George, her son-in-law. You don't want to live here with me all your life. You need to go out there in the world to start living again.\"\n\nNext day packing my clothes, in the same suitcase, I used three years ago when I came to Wales. Putting my things in the car, I then popped the bonnet to check the water and oil after finishing my inspection, I turned, standing there was Mrs Watson with a bag in her hand.\n\n\"I Baked you an apple pie last night to take with you.\" She said as a tear ran down her cheek.\n\nTaking the bag, I put it in the car. Embracing Mrs Watson in my arms, I said. \"Thank you for been there when I needed you.\"\n\nReleased her, to kiss her on the cheek, taking a last look at the cottage which was my home for three years then turned to get in my car. \"Let's go home George,\" I said to myself. \n\n*****\n\nThe drive from Porthmadog to London took longer than I anticipated, as my car was overheating I needed to pull over a few times at service stations for the car to cool down, every time enjoying a piece of the pie Mrs Watson baked for me. Getting on the M25, I knew another hour, then I'll be home.\n\nI was considering to go to my parent's house first but changed my mind. Driving straight to my flat I found an empty parking space. Sitting here for the last forty-five minutes, just looking at the entrance. The neighbourhood hasn't changed much, all the houses on the street look the same. Like time has stood still for the last three years. People walking up and down the street, entering or exiting properties, I recognised a few faces I use to see when running in the morning, but to them, I was just another face in the crowd.\n\nOur flat was in the residential part of Enfield Town, away from the town centre, it was mostly families in this part of Enfield. In the summer you would get the sound of children playing outside. Over the weekend neighbours always had barbeque parties.\n\nFocusing back on the property Sarah and I bought. Originally it was a four-bedroom house which was converted into two flats, each one had two bedrooms. We purchased the ground floor apartment. The price was a little higher, but you had the advantage of the small garden it came with. On viewing the property, Sarah fell in love with it. Already renovated when we moved in, we didn't need to do much, but Sarah insisted on painting each room a light pastel colour.\n\nThe sun started shining directly into my eyes, it will be nightfall soon there is one more hour of daylight. If I'm going to go inside, I will need to go now. All the utilities were disconnected before I left for Wales, electricity, gas, water, etc. Once it gets dark, I will not be able to see anything inside the flat.\n\nCrossing the road, making my way to the main front door I had my key ready to put in the keyhole, As I turned the key, you had to give the big Victorian door a hard push to open. Entering the passage the door closed behind me with a loud thump. On my left was the entrance to my flat, I stood there just glaring at the door, scared to open it, wondering what I will find inside.\n\nSuddenly the main door opened behind me, I turned, standing there was a lady maybe a few years younger than me. With a shocked expression on her face, she held the door open as if she was ready to run out.\n\n\"Hello, my name is George, George Michaelides,\" I said.\n\nStill uncertain what to do she just stood there at the entrance. I guess when you walk into the property you live seeing a six-foot stranger in the hallway you get scared. Putting my hand in my pocket, I removed my wallet to retrieve my driving license, then handed it over to her to inspect. \"If you have been here a while, you must have seen some letters with that name on them,\" I said.\n\nShe nodded her head up and down to say yes. \"Sorry, seeing you like that was a shock. Wasn't used to seeing someone else in the building.\"\n\nShe closed the main door then entered her flat quickly slamming the door behind her, I could hear her footsteps as she ran up the stairs.\n\nUnlocking the front door to my flat, needing to give the door a hard push for it to open. The apartment had been closed up for three years, it had a smell to it. The smell of dampness, the first thing I did was open all the windows for fresh air to circulate in the flat. Everything was just how I remembered it. Family pictures of Sarah and I, magazines we use to read scattered on the coffee table, even our slippers next to our side of the bed. Feeling a heaviness in my chest as I entered each room.\n\n\"Hello is there anyone there.\" It was the ladies voice from upstairs.\n\nAt the front door, standing there was my neighbour from upstairs. Peeking inside, in her hand a cup of something hot, maybe tea. After a five-hour drive, my first thought was just what I needed a cup of tea.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb you, I wanted to apologise for earlier, I didn't know who you was, all the things you hear all the time you can't be too sure about someone. By the way, my name is Vicky, Mr Michaelides. The least I could do was make you a cup of tea if you just moved back in I thought your utilities might be off.\" She handed me the cup over. She still stood on the outside to the entrance of my flat, understanding her reason, better be safe than sorry.\n\nWith the cup of tea in my hand, I said. \"Thank you. You don't have to call me Mr Michaelides. George is OK.\"\n\n\"OK, George.\" She said with a smile. \n\nThere was a telephone ring coming from outside, probably upstairs, she excused herself, going back to her flat. \n\n\"Hopefully next time we meet we have a longer conversation than that,\" I said to myself.\n\nLooking around the apartment, it brought back memories of Sarah. Sitting down on the sofa I started to cry while holding my head. When I looked back up the room was darker, I must have been sitting like that for a good half hour, quickly getting up to check the utility metres, writing down the readings, they will need them when I call the utility companies in the morning. Took a last look around, locked up everything then left.\n\nThe drive to my parent's house was only twenty minutes from my flat. They lived in Palmers Green, on a side road just off the high street. I stopped at a Tesco Express store to buy some flowers for mum. Picking a bunch of pink roses, as mum liked that colour I paid for them then started making my way out of the store. Walking towards my car, I noticed a group of boys outside were intimidating whoever entered the store. Ignoring them, I got in my car and drove off.\n\nStanding at the front door for a few minutes, considering to ring the bell. What do you say to your parents after disappearing for three years? Then turn up on their doorstep. How will they react when they see me after three years, will they be happy or angry with me.\n\nPressing the doorbell, I could hear my mum inside telling my dad. \"Can you get the door, Michael, my hands are full.\" \n\nAfter a short wait, I see a shadow behind the patterned glass door. The outdoor light came on lighting up the patio. When the front door starts to open, I feel my mouth dry up, my heart skips a couple of beats, at the same time thinking of what to say. My dad appears at the front door when he sees me he just stiffens. For a minute he just stands there, his bottom lip trembling, trying to say something with no words coming out.\n\n\"Hi, dad.\"\n\nHe doesn't answer back he just shouts out. \"Helen!\"\n\nI hear footsteps then mum appears behind him, looking over his shoulder, part of her cooking apron showing.\n\n\"Hi, mum is there enough for me as well.\"\n\nShe heaves dad to the side, runs towards me grasps my head with both hands kissing me on the forehead while shouting. \"you stupid boy where did you go!\" Shakes my head, while tears are running down her cheeks. She then clutches me into a bear hug, squashing the flowers I was holding.\n\n\"Can you both come in George is probably famished,\" Dad said.\n\nWe both release each other, look at my dad at the same time while Mum says. \"We all know who is hungry.\" \n\nAll three of us start laughing as we began to make our way into the house. In the kitchen, mum had the table set up for dinner, all she had to do was set up another plate. Mum would always cook enough food to feed an army. We sat down, me and dad filled up our plates, then tugged into our food. Mum just sat there watching me while I was eating, asking me questions. \"Where did I live the last three years, what did I do for money.\" When we finished eating, I got up to start clearing the table. \n\nMum looked at my dad. She said. \"I can get used to this.\"\n\nMum went into the other room, dad came beside me, got a clean napkin to dry the plates I finished washing. \"You disappeared for three years after Sarah's death without a word,\" Dad said.\n\n\"I know dad I'm sorry, all the trauma of Sarah's death. Also, Radovan Brankovic going into a coma was too much for me. I just needed to get away.\"\n\n\"You are here now. whatever is on your mind just talk to your mum or me.\"\n\nOn mentioning mum, I said. \"Where has mum gone.\" \n\nBefore my dad could answer, the doorbell rang. Mum must have responded to the door.\n\n\"Where is he I'm going to kill him?\" It was my sister's voice, Tina.\n\nShe ran into the kitchen slapped me on the cheek, which shock me to the core. Grabbed me and started kissing me all over the face. Turned around called her boys. \"Come over say hello to your Uncle George?\" The kids came, didn't say anything but hugged me. They were a little shy after not seeing me for so long. We sat at the kitchen table, asking each other what we have been doing for the last three years. I told them about living in Wales, renting a cottage from a lovely old lady, who had lost her husband a few years back.\n\nTina and her husband were having some marital problems. Eventually, he left my sister for another woman. She lost contact with him just after I had left. Within six months he had stopped the child support as well.\n\nI said to her. \"Do you need any money, are the boys ok do they need anything for school, clothes, shoes, anything.\" Putting my hand in my pocket, pulling out my wallet.\n\nOn seen this she put her hand on mine. She said. \"George we are ok, I am glad you are home, we missed you so much.\" That is when she started to cry. I sat next to her, putting my arm over her shoulder giving her a tissue to wipe her tears.\n\nWe all went to sit in the living room, as mum prepared the kettle to make some tea. Sitting with the others on the sofa waiting for mum to come. Everyone was focused on the TV watching The One Show. Alex Jones with Matt Baker were interviewing a celebrity, which I knew from a show, but which one I couldn't recall. Mum came with a tray, my sister cleared the coffee table so mum could put it down. She was preparing the tea, at the same time I was composing myself for what I was about to tell them.\n\nAs mum finished, she sat down next to me. I Asked my dad. \"Can you turn the volume down, Dad I have something to tell you all.\"\n\nDad was turning the volume down while mum got hold of my hand and squeezed it saying. \"What is wrong George, you have something on your mind?\"\n\nI got up, paced up and down the living room, stopped, turned to face them, waited for a while I said. \"Someone visited me two days ago, it was a visit from Mrs Taylor, my mother-in-law.\n\nDad asked. \"How did she find you?\"\n\n\"Apparently, she knew where I was living.\"\n\nTina with a frowned eyebrow said. \"What did the wicked witch of the west want?\"\n\n\"She came to see me, to tell me some shocking news? A few weeks ago my father-in-law passed away. She was packing away the items in his home office when she came across a file. Inside was a birth certificate for a baby boy born the day of the car accident, the day Sarah died. Also, some adoption papers. She believes the baby was Sarah's, that it did not die that fateful night.\" At telling everyone this news, everyone just paused, even my sister's boys.\n\nAfter mum had come out of her shock, she said. \"We are going to Jacky's house tomorrow together.\"\n\nTina started cursing. \"Those stupid bastards, how could they do that to you, they knew about the baby. What kind of people are they for three years they didn't say anything. Tomorrow I'm coming with you and mum.\"\n\n\"Jacky did not have a clue about the baby. Tomorrow I will be going on my own.\" Mum gave me a stare I haven't seen for years, that look our parents gave us when we were young when we did something wrong. They didn't have to say anything they just looked at us, then we would stop. Looking at mum, I said, \"Only one person will come with me, mum.\" \n\nMy sister was not too happy about my decision only to take mum, to make up for that I promised her, we will inform her of any developments. She gave me a hug, kissed me on the cheek, then got up to get the boys ready to go home. We said our goodbyes then she left.\n\nWe chatted for a while longer with my parents they asked me if I will be staying or going back to Wales, telling them I wasn't sure yet. Seeing their faces, they were not happy with my answer.\n\nGetting up I said. \"I better get going so we can make an early start tomorrow.\"\n\nMum said. \"Where are you going to stay tonight.\"\n\n\"I've booked a room at Marriott Cheshunt,\"\n\n\"You are not staying at any hotel tonight; we have plenty of room here.\"\n\nMum went upstairs prepared the bedroom and came back ten minutes later. Giving both my parents a hug I said. \"Thank you for the support, I am sorry for putting you through all this.\" Then started making my way to my car to get my suitcase. \n\nEntering my bedroom, it was like I left it almost four years ago when Sarah and I moved to our flat. All my books on the shelves, the trophy's from the amateur boxing competitions, all in their original place. Getting ready for bed, to get a good night's sleep as I knew tomorrow will be a long day.\n\nLying there in bed looking up at the ceiling, I said. \"Sarah, whatever happens, I will find our son.\"\n\n*****\n\nI woke up to mums singing, mum would always sing while she prepared breakfast. Reaching to get my mobile to check the time, it was 7:00 am it was time to get up. How much I wanted to put my trainers on to go for a run, but today we had a full agenda planned. Alternatively, I did ten minutes of stretching, then my regular schedule of pull-ups and push-ups. Had a quick shower, then made my way downstairs to the kitchen. \n\nMum was pouring a cup of tea when I walked in. \"Good Morning mum.\"\n\nMum looked up. \"Good Morning. Did you sleep well? Come sit down have some breakfast. Then we have to go to see Father Petrou before we go to Mrs Taylor.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ mum do we need to go to church this early?\"\n\n\"Don't you speak like that about the Lord. Father Petrou last night said he wants to see you.\"\n\nI sat down to have breakfast. Mum just sat there with her cup of tea. \"Have something to eat mum.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me son. I had breakfast with your father before he left for work.\"\n\nQuickly finishing my food, then helping mum clean up the table before we left.\n\nWe entered St. Mary's church, both of us lighted a candle, made the sign of a cross then kissed the icons. Mum went and sat down on one of the stalls then put her head down to pray.\n\nThat is when I felt a hand on my shoulder. The voice was familiar. \"Your mother would come every day when you was gone, she would sit in that same spot to pray for your safe return.\" It was Father Petrou.\n\nTurning towards him, we both opened our arms to embrace each other. We stayed like that for a while like two friends who had not seen each other for years. \n\nFather Petrou was about five years older than me. He was different from other priests. When you had a conversation with him about religion, he would never force you to go to church or pray, but still, you felt closer to God.\n\nOn releasing him, I said. \"It's good to see you, Father Petrou. My mother told me you wanted to see me about something.\"\n\n\"Let us walk George.\" We walked out of the church, making our way to St. Barnabas Church which was a small walk away. \"Your mother has told me about the discovery of your child, that it may still be alive.\"\n\nI replied. \"Today we will visit my mother-in-law to see how we can find the child.\" We reached St. Barnabas church, that is when I remembered, next to the church was a small hall, they used it for small parties. \"Father Petrou, do you use the building next to the church for anything?\" \n\n\"we haven't used it for many years, I wanted to do something with that space for the community, but the church does not have the funds. There is so much I want to do to help.\" He said those last words while his eyes became moist.\n\n\"The Lord works in mysterious ways,\" I said as we started making our way back to St. Mary's. Mum was waiting for us at the entrance of the church, talking to some ladies she knew from church. When we got near, mum introduced me to her friends, they all welcomed me back, telling me how much my family missed me.\n\nOne of the other priests called Father Petrou. He left in a hurry leaving us to conversed a little with the ladies. They were telling me how much the neighbourhood had changed in the last few years. How much Father Petrou wanted to help the youngsters in the area, but the church would always turn him down when he asked for help.",
        "Father Petrou appeared, coming towards us with a worried look on his face, excusing myself, I walked to towards him, on reaching him I said. \"Is everything ok.\"\n\n\"There is a youngster that comes from a broken family he was found sleeping inside the church this morning. He broke one of the side windows to get inside, so he can just get a little sleep.\"\n\nMum came next to me took my arm, looking at her then at Father Petrou. I thought. \"I have never done anything to help the community, maybe this is my chance.\" looking at my mum again, she knew what was in my mind, she nodded her head up and down. \"Father Petrou I have a proposition to make, meet me here tomorrow so we can talk.\" He looked at me with hope in his eyes. We said our goodbyes then he left so that he can attend to his duties.\n\nThe drive to my mother-in-law's house took longer, as we got caught in the morning traffic. Watching mum from the side of my eye, she was just glaring out of the car window. \"Nearly their mum.\" The next turning would bring us to Broad Walk, Winchmore Hills most prestigious road. Turning into the carousel drive, parking the car to the side of the house. A habit I acquired from my father-in-law, he once said. \"Can you park your car on the flank of the house and not in the driveway.\" Looking at my car with disgust.\n\nAs we got out of the car, mum looked down at the block paving just staring at it. I remember when the Taylors had it done, it cost them over twenty thousand pounds, now hundreds of weeds sprouting through the gaps of the blocks. The building itself an old Tudor style house was in need of restoration. \"I think after Sarah passed away, life had stopped for the Taylors\" mum said. We approached the front door avoiding the front door hedge box plants on either side. Once nicely trimmed square, now uneven full of spider webs.\n\nMum rang the doorbell, we heard a female voice inside shout. \"Let me find the key!\" A few moments later the door opened with a deafening scraping sound. As Jacky appeared, she said. \"Hello George, Hello Helen, please come in. Sorry about that, I haven't used this door for a long time, I'm always using the kitchen door that leads outside.\"\n\n\"Hello, Jacky,\" Mum said as she entered the house first, walking in looking around her at the once beautiful reception hallway, seemed it was uninhabited now. There were boxes piled on top of each other, labelled with the contents that were probably inside. \"Hello, Jacky.\" Leaning forward to kiss her on the cheek.\n\n\"Sorry about the mess, just packing to move somewhere smaller, come this way we can sit in the office, everything is there.\" We followed her there. It was how I remembered it, wall to wall oak wood panels all around the room. Sitting at one end an office desk with piles of folders on it. Nearer the entrance two long leather sofas facing each other with an oak coffee table in the middle. Scattered all over the table top were documents. \"Take a seat I'll just go to make some tea,\" Jacky said.\n\nWe both sat next to each other looking at the different documents in front of us. Sitting there for a while, mum was getting uneasy she reached to pick up one of the papers to read it. \"Mum stop being nosey.\"\n\nShe pulled back turned to look at me. She said. \"I am not nosey these papers are about my grandson, I have every right to look at these documents.\"\n\n\"Yes, George your mum has every entitlement to observe the papers.\" We both turned to see my mother-in-law walking in holding a tray. I quickly made some space for her to put the tray down. She prepared a cup of tea for each of us, at the same time explaining to us about her discovery. Picking up a pink piece of paper which looked like a birth certificate she handed it over to my mum.\n\nMum stared at the document, quickly scanning the words written on it. \"His name is Charlie, he was born the day Sarah died, his father's name is Gervasio Fabrizio, that's Italian isn't that Italian George.\" Then mum's eye's turned to Jacky. What have you done with my grandson, my boy's son, we want an answer now do you hear now!\"\n\nJacky looking down at the table said. \"Sorry Helen, this is all new to me as well while cleaning Ian's office I discovered the folder in a locked drawer, in that desk.\" Pointing to the desk that was opposite. \"The day I found that envelope my first reaction was to hire a private detective to find those people on the birth certificate, even to trace where the money went, Ian gave them almost two hundred thousand pounds to disappear.\" Grabbing a bunch of document from the table she started waving the papers in the air. \"Why do you think I put this house for sale, to raise money to find my grandson, he is the only person I have!\" she shouted throwing the papers in the air.\n\nMum quickly got up went over to Jacky embracing her as she said to her. \"Calm down, we will find him. No matter what it takes, we will find him. Let's go outside to get some fresh air.\" They made their way to the kitchen leading outside. \n\nI started gathering the papers which were all over the floor, aligning the documents to put them back in the folder I spotted something that looked familiar. It was the father's signature, looking at all the documents he had signed, there was something very familiar in the name. Putting everything back in the folder then looked at the painting of Ian which was hanging behind his desk, wondering what his game was.\n\nOutside mum and Jacky were sitting on a bench overlooking the garden. Mum had her arm over Jackie's shoulder. She was saying something to her probably words of comfort. I gave them some time alone. Maybe they could make peace between them. Walking to my car, wondering what to do next.\n\nWhile I was leaning on the car door, I felt a hand on my shoulder on turning to look who it was I saw mum smiling at me. \"Shall we go, George.\"\n\nJacky was standing some feet away from us. I said to mum. \"Just a minute mum let me say goodbye.\" \n\nWalking up to Jacky I hugged her while whispering in her ear. \"No matter what we will be together again as a family. You are my family.\" I kissed her on the cheek then turned to go.\n\nBefore getting in the car, remembering something. Calling out to Jacky. \"I need copies of the documents!\"\n\nWith a smile she said. \"Already made your copies, let me get them.\" She ran into the house appearing a few moments later with a similar folder.\n\nWhen we left, I said. \"Do you mind if I go to the cemetery to put some flowers on Sarah's grave.\"\n\n\"Let's go I haven't gone for a while.\"\n\nI stopped at a florist on the way to buy some flowers, mum came with to pick the flowers, she chooses a beautiful bunch of daisies. She said. \"These are flowers of Innocence.\"\n\nWhen we got to the cemetery, I parked the car a near where Sarah was buried. Mum walked with me to the tombstone, just before we reached it she stayed behind to give me some time alone at Sarah's grave. I put the daisy's beside some flowers that someone had already brought recently as they looked fresh.\n\nKneeling down by the tombstone I said. \"My love I will find our boy.\" Feeling a great sadness as I felt my tears run down my cheeks.\n\nMum came next to me. \"Are you ok George.\"\n\n\"I'm ok mum, It's kept clean around her grave.\"\n\n\"Jacky come's once a week to bring fresh flowers and also to clean up,\" Mum said.\n\nWe stayed a while longer than we started to make our way back to the car.\n\nOn the drive back home mum was silent for a while then she said. \"She is not a bad person. It was her husband, he was indoctrinating her all those years.\"\n\n\"You two gonna become Facebook friends now,\" I said while grinning.\n\nMum punched me lightly on the shoulder. \"Come on your going to take me shopping. Let's go to Tesco's, were going to have Mousaka tonight.\n\nThat put a smile on my face no one made Mousaka like mum.\n\n*****\n\nAll week Jacky and I spent going around looking for answers. The hospital that Sarah left her last breath, the office where the baby was registered. There was no stone we did not turn. We asked everyone, the people who were employed there, even the once that left or retired, nothing. We went to see the private detective, went through everything with him. We did not find anything.\n\nIt was Friday evening, my mother-in-law was exhausted from running around all week. It was late in the afternoon we'd just finished with her accountant when I was driving her back home, we did not say one word for the whole hour back. \n\nStopping the car in her driveway, I turned towards her. I said. \"Don't worry something will unfold. Someone will remember something. It's only a matter of time.\"\n\nPutting her hand on top mine, she said. \"George I wish everyone was like you, Sarah was so right about you. Tomorrow is Saturday, we both need a break from all this, do something with your family.\" She released my hand then got out of the car. Turning her head towards me, she said. \"I've meant to tell you to use one of the car's I have in the garage. They are just sitting there.\"\n\n\"It's ok this car is very sentimental as you know.\"\n\nIt was still early, so I decided to go to see Father Petrou since meeting him with mum I haven't had the chance to see him again. Spoke to him on the telephone but did not have the opportunity to go around to talk.\n\nParking the car in the churchyard, I was making my way to the front of the church. Walking along the path leading to the main door, I could hear shouting coming from inside. Rushing to the entrance I quickly opened the main door, standing in front of me was Father Petrou, opposite him a tall young man. Behind the young man, a couple of priests just standing there frozen from fear. The young man turned towards me. He angrily said. \"Who the fuck are you!\"\n\n\"Hello George, let me introduce you to Mario. He is the young man who broke the window a few days ago,\" Father Petrou said.\n\n\"Don't tell him my business bro!\" The young man angrily said.\n\nThat is when I spoke. \"First a good Christian does not swear in church. Secondly, you don't call Father Petrou, bro. Know you seem to have a lot of anger inside you, why don't you take that anger out on me.\" Opening the door, directing him with my hand to the churchyard.\n\nFather Petrou said. \"Please don't hurt him, George.\"\n\nI just winked back at him.\n\nMario removed his tracksuit top and just threw it on the floor. Started moving around flinging punches in the air yelling. \"You are dead meat bro!\"\n\n\"Whenever you are ready Tyson,\" I replied.\n\nWith that comment, he hurled himself at me. He was trying to punch me, push me, basically do anything to hurt me. I moved around dodging him, occasionally blocking a punch with my shoulder. I let him carry on until he was out of breath, in the end, he went down on one knee holding his side.\n\nCrouching next to him while I put my hand on his shoulder I said. \"Are you calmer now, are you ready to talk to Father Petrou without getting angry.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ, don't you get tired.\" He replied.\n\n\"What was that all about Mario,\" I said\n\n\"All I wanted was somewhere to sleep.\"\n\n\"Is that what all that commotion was about, I think we can solve that problem. Come on let's get you a bed for the night.\"\n\nHe looked up at me with wide eyes he said. \"Really.\"\n\nWe both got up, I turned to Father Petrou. I said. \"Is tomorrow morning ok to meet about the proposition I have for you.\"\n\nSmiling at me as he said. \"Will see you in the morning after ten, I am free all day.\" \n\nThen he said. \"Thank you.\" With just the movement of his lips.\n\nTurning to Mario, I said. Have you had something to eat? I know this place the food is great. Then we can arrange for you somewhere to sleep. Come on let's go.\" We started to make our way to my car.\n\nThe drive to my parent's house was short, just around the corner from the church. Not much was said on the drive there. On getting out of the car, Mario just sat there staring out the window. \"Come on Mario were here,\" I said.\n\n\"Why are you doing this bro, I'm just a bum.\"\n\n\"Let's make a deal, come to have one meal with my family, at the end of the evening if you are still unsure I'll take you wherever you want. One more thing enough of the bro, call me George.\"\n\nHe smiled. Then said. \"OK.\"\n\nOn entering the house mum greeted Mario with open arms, one thing I forgot to warn him about was mum's interrogation. She always wanted to know everything about people. I guess that is how she judged people. My sister with her two boys came around, we all sat down for a meal, mum made her speciality tonight, meatballs (Keftedes) everyone's favourite. After eating, all the guys went to the living room. My sister's boys asked dad if they could play a bit on their PlayStation on the big TV. Once they got the go-ahead, they got their console games to show Mario. A while later my sister and mum came as well with tea and biscuits. It was a long time for me to enjoy an evening with my family. My parent and sister just sat there watching the boys playing video games, enjoying themselves, Mario appreciating the company of my two nephews.\n\nIt was about 9 pm, my sister said to the boys. \"Come on you two. It's time to go you have Greek school tomorrow.\" They protested about going to Greek school, but then again we did the same when we were their age. Just after they left, I told mum Mario, and I was going as well.\n\nGrabbing my car keys, I said to Mario. \"Ready to go?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He replied.\n\nI made a booking for Mario at the Marriott Cheshunt Hotel. On the drive there I asked him. \"What do you want to do with your life.\"\n\nHe looked out the car window as he answered. \"What life, I have no life, I failed at school, I failed everyone. Even my parents hate me.\"\n\nThe rest of the drive to the hotel we were silent.\n\nOn arriving at the hotel, at the front desk was a young lady. While check-in Mario, she explained everything that was needed to know. Even subscribed him to Marriott Rewards so he can get free wifi.\n\nI put out my hand to handshake him, but instead, he embraced me with a hug, whispering in my ear. \"Thank you very much for everything tonight.\"\n\nOn releasing me, I said. \"You have breakfast included with the room, that way in the morning you can have something to eat before you go. I'll be meeting up with my old coach at 10 am. He lives nearby. I can come to the hotel. We can have breakfast together then go to see him. If you don't have anything to do that is.\"\n\n\"I would love that.\" He replied.\n\nI gave him a light punch on the shoulder. \"I'll be here at 9 am for breakfast be ready. Have a good night.\" Waving my hand as I left.\n\n\"Good night and thank you again for everything.\" \n\nNext morning I arrived at the hotel a little late 10 am, approaching the front desk I said to the gentleman. \"Can you call room 110 please.\"\n\nThe receptionist dialled the room twice then put the receiver down. He said. \"There is no answer sir let me try housekeeper the guest may have checked-out.\" He spoke to someone on the telephone than came back to say. \"They have checked-out of the room fifteen minutes ago.\"\n\nI said. \"Thank you. Is it ok if I have a look in the restaurant, my friend may be having breakfast.\"\n\n\"Be my guest.\" He said.\n\nWalking near the glass which separated the lobby with the restaurant glancing in the restaurant to see if he was sitting at one of the tables having breakfast. Thinking. \"Why didn't you ask mum if he could stay in the spare room.\" Strolling to the entrance of the restaurant at the same time scanning all the tables, he wasn't there. Turning to leave I saw him. He was sitting in the lobby by the fireplace just glaring into the flames.\n\nWith a feeling of relief, I walked up to him. He didn't notice me until I spoke. \"Hey, buddy sorry I was late.\"\n\nHe quickly turned around looking up at me he Smiled. \"Hey you came, I thought for a moment you just dumped me here last night.\"\n\n\"Have you had breakfast yet.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Let's have something to eat I am starving. I guess you must be too.\" He nodded his head to say yes.\n\nWe had breakfast at the hotel, me just picking from the nutritious variety on the buffet, mostly fruit. On the other hand, Mario was stacking on the plate bacon, sausages, fried eggs, baked beans, etc. When we sat at the table to eat our breakfast, I looked at my choice, then Marios I said to him. \"I will need to change your diet, my friend.\"\n\n\"You can always try.\" We both started laughed while we had our breakfast, talking about life in general. It seemed he was starting to get comfortable around me. \n\nWe finished our breakfast then started making our way out of the hotel, turning to him I said. \"you're still ok to go with me to see my old coach.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\" He replied.\n\nThe drive to coach Browns house was very short as he lived in Goffs, driving down Goff's Lane I noticed Mario was amazed seeing all the big houses. \"Houses are very impressive in this area,\" I said.\n\n\"My god I bet you have to be rich to live in a neighbourhood like this.\"\n\nAs I parked my car in front of Coach Browns driveway, I noticed a lady attending to some flowers at the entrance of the house. I recognised her straight away. It was Mrs Brown. On approaching her, I called out \"Good morning young lady.\" \n\nShe quickly turned to look. A big smile appearing on her face. \"Haven't heard that comment for almost three years. Come here you big hunk.\" She took me in her arms to hug me. When she released me, I introduced her to Mario, telling her he's a family friend, which put a smile on Mario's face. She thanked me for calling as soon as I was back and that she was jubilant on hearing the news about the baby.\n\nI said. \"Thank you, where is my mentor hiding?\"\n\n\"He's in the garage. He spends a lot of his time in there now. It cost him a lot when you left. Six months later he closed the gym.\"\n\nWe walked over to the garage, making a small fist I banged a couple of times on the door. A few seconds later the motor that worked the big door started. Watching the door go up waiting for it to open fully. As we entered the garage, all the equipment that was in Mr Browns gym was sitting in his garage. In a corner sitting behind a small desk was Mr Brown, it seemed he had aged ten years. His wife was right it did cost him when I left.\n\n\"Hey Coach what are you up to.\"\n\nLooking over his glasses just staring at me I wondered for a second if he recognised me or not. He slowly got up came round his desk put his arms out embracing me. For a moment I thought he would never let go when he eventually released me, he said. \"I should have thrown in the towel that night. All this would not have happened.\"\n\n\"Coach it was not your fault. We mustn't dwell on what happened three years ago we must look ahead.\"\n\nWe talked about the last three years of our lives, telling him about my time in Wales, he said to me after I had left, for him, boxing just died inside him. He told Mario how I was his best achievement in his life, how I was a son to him. At some point, Mrs Brown came in with three mugs of tea for us.\n\nAfter conversing for almost an hour, I approached him with what my plans were. \"Coach Brown I need your help. There is a church hall in Palmers Green I want to turn into a gym to help the communities youth. You are the perfect mentor for youngsters. Together we can do good for the community.\"\n\nHe looked at me for a few seconds before answering. \"You do not need me.\" Looking at Mario then back at me. \"You have the help you need, by the look on this young man's face. He has the spirit and fire you had in his eyes. God has brought you together for a purpose.\"\n\n\"Whenever you want to come to the gym you are more than welcome,\" I said.\n\n\"The wife and I are going to Brighton to see her sister this afternoon, will be back on Sunday evening. We will be home all next week.\"\n\n\"Your point coach.\"\n\n\"For you to come to collect the equipment.\"",
        "With a confused look on my face, I said. \"What equipment.\"\n\nShaking his head, he said. \"All this gear, I want you to have it for the gym. It might be a little old, but it's all broken in. That way it will look like a proper gym, not like these new places that do not even resemble a gym with the new shiny machines.\"\n\nTaking his hand to shake it, I said. \"Thank you, you do not know how much this means to me.\"\n\nMario also thanked him. He said. \"I will help him as much as I can, in any way I can.\"\n\n\"Just one last favour coach, I need Radovan Brankovic contact details if you have them.\"\n\nImmediately his face expression showed sadness. He went over his desk put on his glasses then flicked through an index card holder, pulling out a card giving it to me. \"This is his home telephone number plus his home address. But like you said earlier you should leave the past alone.\"\n\n\"Is he ok, I was told he came out of a coma six moths after I had left.\"\n\n\"He's doing ok now George, that's why I said put the past behind you.\"\n\nWe said our farewell then started to make our way back to the car. \n\nOn the drive back to St Mary's Church, Mario said. \"Is it ok if I can help you in the gym when you get it running.\"\n\n\"Let us make a deal. You enrol in a college to pass your exams and the evenings plus weekends you work in the gym.\"\n\n\"It's a deal.\" He replied.\n\nWhen we got to St Mary's, I asked a priest. \"Can you tell me please father where can I find Father Petrou.\"\n\n\"Father Petrou is at St. Barnaby's Church.\" He replied.\n\nOn entering St. Barnaby's Church, Father Petrou was on his knees at the altar praying. We both waited at the entrance of the church for him to finish. A while later he got up making his way towards us. He greeted both of us with a handshake, then facing me he said. \"Let's hear your proposition, George.\"\n\n\"I would like to rent the hall you are not using to start a gym. It will be for all the youngsters in the neighbourhood. It is a chance for them to take up boxing to keep them off the street. I have all the equipment that we need the church will not have to fund anything. I will pay rent to the church for the hall. That way the rent I pay you can do some maintenance the two church's need. The youths will not pay a penny towards the training, all I will ask from them is to respect their place of physical activity.\"\n\nHe just stared at me, then he turned to Mario. He said. \"Can you slap me as hard as you can Mario.\"\n\n\"I forgot to tell you Mario will be my assistant in the gym,\"\n\nHe made the sign of the cross then said. \"The Lord has sent you to us George.\"\n\n\"I guess that means yes Father,\" Mario said.\n\nAfter seen Father Petrou Mario and I went to have something to eat at Vrisaki, a small tavern near my parent's house. When we finished our meal, we sat to talk a while about his future, mostly what his plans were. I explained to him the different options he had. What I noticed with him was he would listen to my advice then ask questions. In the short time he knew me, he saw me as his mentor. We were in an intense discussion when we didn't notice the time. It was time for the restaurant to close, I paid the check then made our way out.\n\nWhen we got in the car, I said. \"where to know buddy.\"\n\n\"Can you take me home please George, I have to face the music sometime?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\nHe explained to me how to get there when we got there I stopped the car in the middle of the road as there was no parking. Looking at him I said. \"Thank you for coming with me today.\"\n\n\"No thank you.\" He replied.\n\nWe said our goodbyes. Mario then got out of the car, making his way to the house. I wanted to go with him to explain to his parents why he was late but a car behind me was flashing me to go.\n\n*****\n\nNext morning I was up at 6 am. By 7 am I was in the kitchen having breakfast with my parents. Just sitting there watching my parents spending Sunday together, something I had missed when I was away. They were always griping at each other, but they loved one another very much. After breakfast, I helping mum clean up while dad went into the living room to read his paper. When we finished, we joined dad as well. Told them both about my plans to make the church hall a gym to help the community. That Father Petrou was jubilant about the idea.\n\n\"That means you are going to stay,\" Dad said as they both looked at me.\n\n\"We will see. Let's take a step at a time, let's see how this project works out. Also how this recital unfolds regards finding my son.\"\n\nDad asked me if I could help him tidy up the garden shed. Mum was planting some flowers while dad and I were in the shed looking through some boxes. We found some boxing equipment of mine, which could be handy for the gym. \n\nIt was around 10 am when I said. \"I'm going to go round the flat to see if the Utilities have been turned on. Also to clean up a bit.\"\n\nMum said. \"Your sister will be here soon. We'll come in a while to help you.\"\n\nEntering the flat, there was a damp smell, straight away I opened all the windows to get some fresh air inside. Checked that all the utilities had been turned on, I didn't want to be left in the dark once it got dark. With a pair of yellow rubber cleaning gloves on I started, a refuse bag in one hand, with the other, I started filling it. Cupboards were full of out of date food, magazines Sarah and I use to read, now old. Coming across Boxing Monthly, there was a cover picture of me throwing the final blow at Radovan Brankovic which knocked him out. In a different situation, this would be framed and put on the wall. That went straight into the refusal bag as well.\n\nThere was a knocking sound at the front door \"Hello.\" The voice was familiar it was Vicky, the lady from upstairs.\n\nOn opening the front door, Vicky was standing there. \"Hi Vicky, just doing a bit of spring cleaning. I hope I'm not making to much noise moving all the furniture around.\" I said\n\nLooking at me curiously she said. \"I like the yellow gloves.\" we both looked at the gloves then started laughing.\n\n\"look it's Sunday, I don't have anything to do, would you like a hand,\" Vicky said.\n\n\"That's very kind of you,\"\n\nWhile we were cleaning, we chatted at the same time, asking questions about each other. Vicky wasn't from this part of London. She was from Croydon, the company she worked for transferred her to their Enfield office last year. She is an associate solicitor under the supervision of a Barrister. I told her about myself that I was away for three years, that I came back to search for my son.\n\nWe were in the kitchen washing down the units. Vicky was washing them while I was going over them with a wet cloth then drying them with a dry one.\n\n\"Ahem hello.\" \n\nWe both stopped then turned. Mum and my sister were just standing there looking at us. I said, \"Hi Mum, Tina this is Vicky she lives upstairs, she was just helping me clean up.\"\n\nMum came over to embrace Vicky in a hug, on releasing her she said. \"Hello Vicky I am George's mum, this is his sister Tina.\" Pointing towards my sister who was standing there looking at me with squinting eyes.\n\nPoor Vicky just stood there frozen, not knowing what to say I just looked at her with a grin on my face while raising my shoulders.\n\n\"Hello, Mrs Michaelides it's a pleasure to meet you,\"\n\nMum opens a bag she brought with her took out some cleaning products, some gloves she handed out to Vicky and Tina, turned to me. She said. \"Come on out of the kitchen, let the ladies do their work.\" You need to go to St. Mary's Church Father Petrou wanted to speak to you.\"\n\nI said. \"Can I have a word with you, sis?\" Starting to walk to the front door, when we reached the entrance I said to her. \"Don't let mum interrogate Vicky. She's just a neighbour.\"\n\n\"Yes, little brother didn't take you long to get to know the neighbours, especially the opposite sex once. Get out of here before I decide to help mum.\" Pushing me out of the flat while she closed the door behind me.\n\nWhen I entered Father Petrou's office, he was speaking with a woman in her mid-40's. I could only see the left side of her face as she was facing Father Petrou. As soon as he noticed my presence, he turned to me. \"Hello George, let me introduce you to Androulla, Mario's mother.\"\n\nAs the woman turned to face me, the other side of her face had a bruise. \"Is everything ok father,\" I said.\n\n\"Last night when you dropped off Mario his father asked him why he was late then started beating him. Androulla tried to protect him by jumping between them. As you can see the result.\" Pointing his hand at Mario's mum.\n\n\"Where is Mario!\"\n\nAt that moment, a big bald guy marched into the office. Walked up to Androulla, grabbing her by the arm. \"Come on you've dropped off the little shit let's go.\"\n\nWith fear in her face Androulla said. \"Just a minute Harry let me speak to this gentleman.\" \n\nHe started to pull her towards the exit of the office, that is when I blocked his path, grabbed him by his shirt slamming him against the wall, which forced him to let her go. Putting my face close to his I could smell the repulsive scent of booze lingering on his breath. \"I guess you are Mario's father, I haven't seen him yet, but for your sake, let's hope he is ok!\" I shouted.\n\n\"What are you going to do put me in a coma big shot.\"\n\nMaking a fist, I pulled back my hand ready to punch him.\n\n\"No, he's not worth it!\" I turned standing there was Mario with both his eyes black and a bandaged-up nose.\n\nI turned back to Mario's father with my voice raised I said. \"Mario will be staying with me for a while, till you straighten up your life. If I hear you've hit your wife again, I will come and find you.\"\n\nWhen I released him, he looked at Father Petrou then his wife, he said to her. \"Let's go.\"\n\nLooking at Mario, I took a deep sigh then said to him. \"Can you wait for me in the car Mario, I've parked it in the church car park.\" When he left, I turned to Father Petrou. \"That wasn't a good example of me was it.\"\n\n\"You had to do, what you had to do my son.\" He replied.\n\n\"Find a rehab that can help Mario's dad, don't think about the cost I will cover that.\"\n\nWhen I got back to the car, Mario was just sitting there glaring out the window. \"Sorry, you had to see that,\"\n\n\"He deserved it the fucking asshole!\"\n\n\"Don't you ever speak about your father like that again, he just needs some help. Do you hear me he just needs help!\" I said with a high tone in my voice. We drove around for a while just so I could calm down. My adrenaline was too high to go back to the flat.\n\n\"If you drop me off here I'll be alright,\" Mario said.\n\nTurning the steering wheel to my left bringing the car to a halt inches away from the pavement. Sitting there just staring straight ahead. The passenger car door opened, I reached over to my left, putting my hand on Mario's shoulder. \"Sorry for shouting at you,\" I said.\n\nHe closed the door. \"Causing problems, that's all I am good at, been a burden to everyone,\" he said. He put his hand over his face and started crying.\n\nGetting out of the car just to give him some space, I walked to the front of the car sitting on the bonnet. A few minutes later Mario joined me sitting next to me. We both sat there for at least ten minutes thinking. My thoughts were my family I had lost, probably Mario was thinking of what will become of him.\n\nLooking at my watch, it was 3 pm. \"Come on let's go before the shops close,\"\n\nHe looked at me as if I had just gone crazy. \"You want to go shopping now.\"\n\n\"Didn't see you with a suitcase earlier. Unless you are planning on wearing the same clothes for the next couple of months.\"\n\n\"But I don't have any money.\"\n\nGetting in the car. I said. \"Consider it a small loan.\" We went to Enfield Town, for two hours we went from one shop to another buying whatever Mario needed. It was 5 pm when we got back to the car. I said to Mario. \"God helps us when we get back. I was only supposed to take one hour. We'll have to stop to get some food on the way.\"\n\nWhen we got back to the flat, we both carried the clothes bags to the front door. While Mario went back to get the pizza's, I took the bags inside, on seen me with bags with brand names on them the ladies came at me like vultures. Tina started by saying. \"We are killing ourselves here trying to clean his flat while he goes shopping.\" \n\nA few seconds later Mario walked in carrying the box's of pizza's, their eyes focused on him, seen him all bruised and bandaged, all you heard was ooh's and aww's. Tina took the pizza's from him, mum guided him to sit down. For the next ten minutes, I explained to them what happened when I went to see Father Petrou.\n\nTina went to get some plates and cutlery from the kitchen while mum opened one of the pizzas. She said. \"The other we take back home for your dad and the boys.\"\n\n\"It's ok mum I've ordered one for them, they are probably eating as we speak.\"\n\nVicky said. \"I better make my way home, it was a pleasure to meet you all.\"\n\n\"Vicky, you are not going anywhere, sit down to have something to eat before you go!\" Mum ordered her.\n\nThe busy day we all had we were famished, we devoured the pizzas in a matter of minutes. While we were eating, the only sound you heard was munching, and the chimes cutlery make on porcelain plates. When we finished, mum said. \"We should have brought some coffee or tea with us when we came. I could do with a nice cup of tea before we go.\"\n\n\"I'll make some,\" Vicky said.\n\n\"let me help you,\" Tina said.\n\nThey both got up and left, going to Vicky's flat to prepare the beverages.\n\nMum waited for them to leave then said. \"I like her.\"\n\n\"She seems a real good person. I met her last week when I came to check the flat when I arrived from Wales.\"\n\n\"Such a sweet girl did you know she isn't married, doesn't even have a boyfriend,\"\n\nJust to change the subject, as I knew where mum was taking this I said. \"Let me show you where you would be sleeping, Mario.\" We took the bags, then he followed me into the spare bedroom. \"I will arrange for you a bed and wardrobe tomorrow. You can sleep on the couch tonight.\" He just stood there while a tear just rolled down his eye.\n\nHe wiped his face. \"Why are you doing all this for me.\"\n\nThat's when I heard laughter from the ladies in the other room. \"Let's go to have some tea,\"\n\nWe all sat had our tea, Vicky also brought a cake which she baked earlier this morning. It seemed that my sister Tina had found a new friend, they were in deep conversation as if they had been friends for years. It had just gone after 8 pm when Tina said. We better make our way home mum, the boys have school tomorrow. They got ready, hugged and kissed Vicky saying their goodbyes. I walked them to the car kissed them. I said. \"good night.\" Waited a few minutes till they drove off.\n\nWhen I got back to the flat Vicky was waiting for me at the entrance of her flat. \"Thank you for all your help today,\" I said.\n\nShe came forward. She said. \"It was a pleasure. I usually sit around on Sunday, watching TV. I enjoyed today very much. Your mum is a lovely lady. Also, with your sister, we have so much in common.\" She stepped nearer stretched forward and kissed me on the cheek. I stepped back straight away.\n\nShe said. \"Sorry.\" Turned ran into her flat closing the door behind her.\n\nI wanted to apologise for my reaction but thought it's better this way, the least I need is more distractions.\n\nWhen I got back to my flat, I showed Mario were the towels were and how the shower worked. By the time he finished his shower, I had got the sofa ready for him. We said our goodnights. I climbed into the shower, turned the water on semi-hot, then stood under it, letting it just run on my head feeling the water roll down my body. I Stayed like that for thirty minutes with my eyes closed imagining Sarah was with me in the shower, just holding me tight.\n\n*****\n\nWhen I woke up, it was still dark, checking my watch it was only 5 am, I got up to use the bathroom, on returning to my bed I noticed the light was on in the living room. Checking to see if Mario was ok, he was lying there watching TV with the volume very low.\n\n\"Hey, everything ok?\" I said\n\nHe quickly got up. \"Sorry for wake you, I had a terrible nightmare it woke me up, I couldn't get back to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mario you didn't wake me up. You're living here now make yourself at home, there is no need to ask me if you want to do something. I'm going for a run, we'll go to have breakfast when I come back.\" \n\nHe smiled then asked,\"Is it ok to join you?\"\n\n\"Of Course you can. be ready in ten minutes.\"\n\nFinding my running gear, I got ready then made my way to the living room. Mario was also ready to go. When we got outside, there wasn't a single soul in sight. Mario was about to start running when I put out my hand to stop him.\n\n\"Before you start to do any form of exercise it's best you stretch those muscles first to get them ready. That way you avoid any unnecessary injuries.\" We did together some stretching for five minutes, showing him how to stretch the different muscles on your body.\n\n\"Now we can start our run, I usually do a 10-kilometre run, your just going to do 2-kilometres today. When you reach 1-kilometre, I will tell you to make your way back.\" Handing him over a set of keys. \"These are your keys, you will need them to get back in the flat. You don't want to wait for a half-hour outside for me to return. Also, don't forget five minutes of stretching when you finish.\"\n\nWe started our run, trying to keep a pace that Mario could keep up with. He was doing ok for half-kilometre, then I noticed he began to get tired, slowing down a little, so he can finish his kilometre. When my Fitbit watch beeped on 1-kilometre, I said. \"It's time for you to go back.\"\n\nPicking up my pace, listening to my trainers every time they hit the pavement in the quietness of the night. Checking my Fitbit to see how much more I needed to run before reaching 5-kilometres, the date showed up, that is when I realised in a few day it will be my birthday. \n\nBringing back memories of the last time I celebrated my birthday with Sarah. She made my favourite Chinese meal. Sweet and Sour Prawns with rice. When we finished our meal, she reached into her bag, pulling out a little white box. Reaching out kissing me on my lips she said. \"Happy Birthday my love.\" Then handed me over my present.\n\nOpening the box, inside was a small white gold cross on a matching white chain. Reaching over I kissed her. \"It's beautiful,\" I said.\n\nPutting my hand up to check that it was still there, then checking my fitness tracker it said 7-kilometres, I had done more kilometres. I turned around making my way back to the flat. On entering the living room, Mario was stretched out on the couch, as if he had just run the London Marathon.\n\nI said. \"Give it some time your muscles will get used to it.\"\n\nAfter my shower, we went to have some breakfast at a local cafe. From there we went to Tesco Extra in Tottenham for food, finishing off in Ikea for the bedroom suite. By the time we got back home it was 10 am. When we finished putting everything away, I made some phone calls to some removal companies to collect the gym equipment.\n\n\"There will be a van coming here at midday. Can you go with the driver to obtain the gym equipment from Goff's to take it to St Barnaba's Church? I have some other pressing business I need to take care of.\" I said\n\n\"No problem.\" he replied.\n\nMy mother-in-law and I had an appointment to see someone in the Italian Embassy to see if we can trace the name Gervasio Fabrizio in Italy. We were told it would take a week to check the records in Italy. If there is anything, we should know by Friday.\n\nWe also visited some close friends of Ian's in Central London, again nothing a dead end. By the time we finished, we were both shattered. On the way back we stopped at a restaurant to have something to eat, both of us silent in our thoughts while we had dinner. By 10 pm we were driving back to Jacky's house.",
        "On reaching Wood Green, I said. \"I need to stop somewhere for five minutes, is that ok?.\"\n\n\"OK.\" She replied.\n\nParking the car outside St. Barnaby's Church, I noticed the lights were still on in the hall. \"Good thing I came by, Mario forgot the lights on. Give me two minutes to switch off the lights.\"\n\n\"Take your time.\"\n\nOn approaching the entrance of the hall, the door was slightly open, I could hear talking inside. Preparing myself mentally I opened the door quickly to confuse any intruders inside. With my hands open ready to grab anyone who tried to run out. \"What the Fu.\" Good thing I didn't finish off my sentence, as Father Petrou was standing in the middle of the hall.\n\n\"Hi George, Mario had some difficulty putting the equipment together, since I've work on the gear for so many years I came to help him. I hope this is how you wanted everything? The only thing left is the boxing ring which will go where Father Petrou is standing.\" Mr Brown said.\n\nLooking around the room at all the equipment in place, then where the boxing ring will go. I said. \"I don't know what to say, it's perfect.\" I was going to each piece of equipment just giving it a quick check when I heard Father Petrou speaking to someone.\n\n\"Are you ok may I help you.\" He said.\n\nStanding at the entrance was Jacky. \"I am so sorry Jacky for making you wait in the car. I just got distracted, I'll take you home straight away.\" I said.\n\n\"Are you going to start fighting again.\" She said.\n\n\"No, it's a project we are trying to put together to help the youngsters in the community. You see Father Petrou, and I are working on helping kids get off the streets to learn something. We've just started the project. Hopefully, it will be successful.\"\n\n\"You are such an incredible man George. Your back for one week and you are trying to help others. Sarah would have been very proud of you.\"\n\nIntroducing Jacky to Father Petrou, I excused myself so they could talk. Went back to checking the equipment, at the same time explaining to Mario how each piece of equipment worked. Mr Brown occasionally explaining things in more detail. \n\nWhen Father Petrou and Jacky finished their conversation, we left. \"Father Petrou is excellent if you need someone to talk too,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, we have made arrangements to meet up. It's time I spoke to someone about all this.\"\n\nWhen we reached her house, I walked her to the entrance, embraced her in a long hug then said. \"Good night.\"\n\nThe rest of the week went slowly, every morning I would go for my morning run. Mario would join me, going a bit further each day, when I got back, he would wait for me to do some pull ups and push ups together. After breakfast, it was straight to the gym, a few kids showed up half of them showed interest the other half left after a while. My mother-in-law would come to see Father Petrou every day, before leaving she would come to the gym to update me on our progress in finding my son.\n\nFriday afternoon Mario and I were sparring in the ring when I looked over. Jacky was standing there, not looking too happy. Putting my hands up to tell Mario to stop, I went over to see if everything was ok.\n\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\n\"They called me from the Italian Embassy, they have nothing. We will never find him, George.\" That is when she started crying, putting her hand over her face.\n\nQuickly embracing her, she put her head on my chest while I rubbed her back. I said. \"Hey, we'll think of something. There must be someone called Gervasio Fabrizio who has a three-year-old boy out there.\"\n\n\"Is everything ok?\" Mario said.\n\n\"Just a small problem with this Gervasio Fabrizio, he exists on paper but not in person,\" I replied.\n\n\"Gervasio let me think a second, Glenn, Gale, Garth, got it it's Gary the translation Gervasio to English is Gary,\" Mario said.\n\n\"How do you know that Mario?\"\n\nHe took off his boxing glove's then grabbed his smartphone, writing something while he was talking. \"It was a project we did at school. We had to find our name translation in different languages. Here it is Gervasio means Gary.\" Showing me the screen on his mobile.\n\n\"Mario, you are a genius.\" Kissing him on the forehead, then grabbing my jacket. \"Do you have the documents with you, Jacky.\"\n\n\"I have some copies in the car,\"\n\n\"Mario you are in charge, make sure you close the gym at 6 pm.\"\n\n\"Ok boss.\"\n\n\"Let's go, Jacky, we need to go somewhere.\" On the way to my car, I dialled my sister's number, she answered on the third ring. \"Are you home sis,\" she answered yes. \"Good I'll be there in five minutes don't go anywhere.\" Hanging up, we both got in the car to drive to my sister's.\n\n\"Why are we going to your sister's,\"\n\nI carried on driving without answering her question. Focused more on getting there as quickly as possible. On reaching her house, I leapt out of the car with Jacky following me with a confused look on her face. Looking back I said. \"The documents Jacky don't forget the folder.\" Turning back she grabbed it coming after me. Banging on the front door, Tina rushed to open the door.\n\nWhen she opened the door, she said. \"What the fuck is she doing here.\"\n\n\"Shut up Tina!\" I shouted.\n\nSpeaking to her like that came as a shock. I had never talked to my sister in that way. There was always that older sister respect between us. We went straight to the living room, took the documents from Jacky spreading them on the dining room table, finding a couple of papers with Gervasio Fabrizio's signature. \"Tina gets me some documents Gary signed,\" I said.\n\n\"Why do you want to...\" \n\nI didn't let her finish \"Just fucking do it.\" She quickly ran upstairs, returning a few minutes later with a handful of papers.\n\nScanning through the documents, comparing the signatures on all the documents. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is the same G on all the documents.\"\n\nTina and Jacky quickly came to my side to inspect the papers as well. On seen the signatures, Jacky raised her hand, putting it over her mouth. \n\n\"Ohh my god you are right it's the same handwriting,\" Tina said.\n\n\"What do we do now,\" Jacky said.\n\n\"Let me make a quick call,\" I said.\n\nGoing outside in my sisters garden closing the patio door behind me. I dialled the private detective's mobile number, speaking with him for quite a while, Jacky and Tina looking through the patio glass in suspense. He explained to me exactly what to do. Giving me some address's, to write them down I had to put him on the speaker that way I could write them on my mobile. When I finished the call, I went back inside.\n\n\"Sit down ladies, What we do know is get the original documents to have them analysed to see if both signatures match up to the same person. He gave me an address in Silchester near Reading to send the papers. Since Reading is not too far, I will be driving down there early tomorrow morning. Hopefully, they will give me the results the same day.\"\n\nJacky said. \"We are going together tomorrow.\"\n\n\"What about Gary will the detective be able to find him,\" Tina said.\n\n\"He said he shouldn't find any difficulty in finding Gary, he will just need some ID's to be able to trace him. His passport number or driving license number.\"\n\nTina went back upstairs to find Gary's passport returning a few minutes later with all the details we needed.\n\n\"George thank you. Without you, I would have not been able to get this far.\" \n\n\"Jacky, we got this far together. Every time I said there is no hope you was there to encourage me to keep looking\" Taking her hand in my hand giving it a light squeeze. \"We're going to find him soon.\"\n\n\"Mum called she's made dinner she said we have to go around. Jacky, my mum, would like you to come as well. Also, I want to apologise for the way that I acted earlier. Tina said.\n\nTina called her boys from the bottom of the stairs. \"Come on you two, where going to your grandparents.\"\n\n\"Ooh, mum we just finished our homework we want to play FIFA on our PlayStation.\" They protested.\n\n\"Now!\" She shouted.\n\n\"Tuff mum,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't think, because I let you off speaking to me like that earlier it's going to happen again.\" She said with squinted eyes.\n\nWhen my sister and boys were ready, we started making our way out. My sister got in her car with her boys, I was parked behind her. Reversing out of the driveway into the road. Putting the car in drive, I heard a car horn. Looking towards Tina's car she was running towards my car. Opening the window, I said. \"What's up sis?\"\n\n\"It won't start again, any space for three more passengers.\"\n\n\"That's what younger brothers are for right.\" Her boys were getting out of the car. \"Come on boys let's go!\" I shouted.\n\nWhen we reached my parent's house, I parked a few houses down the street. We started walking down our street when my sister said something to her boys. They quickly ran in front of us, Terry shouting to his brother. \"Race you there!\"\n\n\"Silly boys forgot to close the door behind them again,\" Tina said when we reached the house.\n\n\"Why are the lights out,\" I said pushing the front door to open. Suddenly the lights went on.\n\nHappy Birthday to You\n\nHappy Birthday to You\n\nHappy Birthday Dear George\n\nHappy Birthday to You.\n\nFrom good friends and true,\n\nFrom old friends and new,\n\nMay good luck go with you,\n\nAnd happiness too.\n\nThen everyone came up to me wishing me a Happy Birthday. All my family kissed me, mum was so happy she started to cry. When my sister kissed me, I said. \"you knew about this didn't you.\" She nodded her head up and down to say yes. \n\nSeen Mario in front of me I pointed the finger at him shaking it up and down. He came up to me embracing me in a tight hug. \"Happy Birthday.\" \n\nMr Brown and his wife were there as well. Standing alone looking over was Vicky. I walked up to her. \"Hi.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to intrude, but your sister insisted I come.\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad that you came. I also want to apologise for the other night, it just came as a shock.\"\n\nShe smiled then kissed me on the cheek. \"Happy Birthday.\" She said.\n\nJacky and Father Petrou came up to us, Jacky put her hand on my cheek, then said. \"Happy Birthday George. Two surprises in one day.\" Father Petrou shock my hand then congratulated me on our discovery. Then they both left to mingle with the other guests.\n\nMum and my sister made enough food to feed the whole street. Dad was most of the time outside making sure that everyone had a piece of BBQ. Everyone congratulated me on our progress we made on finding my son. Next time I came across my sister, I said to her. \"I see news travels fast around here.\" She just smiled at me.\n\nAround 10 pm Jacky said to me. \"I'm going to go now George, enjoy your family I'll see you tomorrow at 9 am.\"\n\nTaking my keys out of my pocket I said. \"I'll take you.\"\n\n\"The taxi is outside waiting for me.\" She hugged me then left.\n\nIt was nearly midnight when the party started to die down. Mario and I stayed a little longer to clean up. Before we left, I thanked my parents for everything. When we left I gave my sister a lift home, her boys were over the moon when she told them they didn't have to go to Greek School tomorrow.\n\n*****\n\nNext day Mario and I were up at 8 am getting ready to go for our morning run, both of us gliding through the streets of Enfield Town, my watch beeped to tell me it was 3-kilometres, Mario turned around while calling out. \"I'll see you home in a while!\" I carried on running as I smiled, thinking. \"we will be running the whole distance together soon.\"\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment, Mario was just finishing off his other exercises then headed for the shower. I did my stretching until Mario was done, then I went to get cleaned up as well.\n\nI was finishing off drying my hair when the doorbell rang. \"Mario can you get that mate.\" A few minutes later I heard a female voice. It was Jacky, \"I'll be 2 minutes Jacky!\" I shouted.\n\n\"Not before we have breakfast!\" Mario called out.\n\nEntering the kitchen, Mario was sitting there in front of a Mcdonald's takeaway bag just grinning. Jacky sitting opposite looking at the kitchen clock all guilty. \"Jacky you are spoiling him. Ok, just today tomorrow back to healthy food.\" Walking to the fridge getting myself some yoghurt. Watching him feasting on a muffin, I put down my food, grabbed the bag, taking one as well. They both looked at me in shock then started laughing. \"What!\" I said.\n\nAfter we had finished Jacky said. \"Come on boys let's go.\" All three of us got up.\n\n\"Where are you going, Mario?\" I said.\n\n\"Someone has to open the gym before you say anything else Mr Brown will be coming to help me out,\" Mario said.\n\nWalking towards my car with Mario, Jacky stopped next to a Range Rover TDV8. As I learnt to open the driver's door, she shouted. \"Today we go with this car George.\"\n\n\"Come on Jacky I know the way it's best I drive,\" I said.\n\n\"Who said your not.\"\n\nWhen I approached her, she handed me the keys. \"Happy Birthday George.\" \n\nLooking at the keys then the Range Rover. I smiled pressed the button a couple of times locking and unlocking the car, then doing it again to make sure I understood it. \"One beep the car locks, two beeps it unlocks,\" I said.\n\n\"Are you ok with an automatic boss,\" Mario said while chuckling.\n\nWe dropped off Mario at St Barnaby's, Mr Brown was waiting there for him. Pulling up next to his car I said. \"Thank you for coming to help Mario.\"\n\n\"No problem George. by the way are you ok driving an automatic.\"\n\nI looked at Jacky, she looked back at me. \"You do seem to be getting confused with the pedals there.\" She said.\n\nThe drive to Salisbury took just under two hours. Getting on the M25, I was doing 60 to 70 kph. Just before we reached Junction 15 to get the M4, I pushed this monster to 120 kph. It was just after eleven when we reached our destination.\n\nThe sat nav said, \"You have reached your destination.\" Pulling over the monster, we got out. Walking along the parade of shops looking for the storefront signs with the name Riley Forensic Documents. We checked all the stores twice but could not find it. Jacky decided to ask one of the store keepers. I waited outside giving all the shops the second scan, just in case we missed it. When she came out, she said. \"They told me it's in that block of offices across the road.\" Pointing to a newly built building opposite.\n\nAt the entrance of the building was a high board which had about twenty different companies on it. Scanning the names quickly I saw it in the middle of the board. Walking up to the main door, to it's left a row of buttons with the names of companies in order as they were on the board. Pressing the button which said Riley Forensic Documents we waited for someone to speak through the intercom.\n\n\"Good morning, Riley Forensic Documents may I help you?\" A female voice said.\n\n\"We would like to see Dr Riley,\" I said.\n\n\"Sorry, but we are closed on Saturday, and we can only see someone by appointment.\"\n\n\"Please just five minutes of your time,\" Jacky said.\n\nThere was a long silence. Then the voice came on the intercom again. \"Take the lift to the second floor we are on the left as the elevator opens, you will see the name on the left of the door.\" There was a buzz which unlocked the door for us to enter. Reaching the second floor, we turned left like the lady said, waiting there was a woman in her sixty's. \n\nJacky said. \"We are sorry we did not call you before coming.\"\n\nTurning around walking back in she said. \"Come in your here now let's see if the doctor can help you.\" looking at each other we followed her.\n\nEntering a large room with a conference table in the middle with chairs all around it, facing a flip board at the end. The wall opposite was glass looking into a lab with large magnifiers overlooking documents. Behind one of the magnifiers was a grey haired gentleman in his sixty's wearing blue latex gloves handling a piece of paper, being careful he doesn't damage it. Walking up to the glass the lady knocked on it to get his attention. Looking up he quickly took off his gloves, coming to the other room.\n\n\"Thank you for seen us at such a short notice Dr Riley.\" My name is Jacky Taylor, and this is my son-in-law George Michaelides.\" Then Jacky explained to him that we wanted to know if the two signatures were the same, that it was the piece of the puzzle to finding my grandson, my son-in-law's boy.\n\nWhen Jacky finished, the lady said. \"I am sorry, but we are three months backlogged.\" We both dropped our shoulders on hearing that.\n\n\"I think the Romans papyrus can wait, they've been dead for over two thousand years Debbie.\" He said to her. Focusing on us he said. \"Now let's have a look at your documents.\" Taking them in his hand, he pulled a small magnifier from his pocket putting it close to his eye while leaning forward to study the signatures on the paper. \"Mr Michaelides when I was a young lad I wanted to be a boxer. I didn't have it in me. But I followed it all my life. One of the greatest fights was the one you had with Radovan Brankovic. I remember that fight, you fought with your heart. Go enjoy our village I will have these documents ready by 2 pm.\"\n\nTrue to his word, he had the results for us by 2 pm. The signatures were 100% the same person on both of them. I asked him how much for his time. Revealing a poster of Radovan and me on the night of our fight he put it on the conference table. Pulling a marker out of his inside pocket he handed it to me saying. \"Just your autograph son.\"\n\nWe drove back to my parent's house to tell them the good news first. My sister Tina was there, she was a little ashamed of the situation as it was her ex-husband that caused all this. \"Hey, mum can you look after the boys a while,\" Tina said. Putting on her coat then going out the front door.\n\nI followed her, looked both sides of the road to see which way she went. There she was leaning on her car trying to light up a cigarette. \"You know mum doesn't like it when you smoke,\" I said.\n\n\"Give me a fucking break George!\" As she flicked the cigarette across the street then broke down in tears. Grabbing her I embraced her in my arms, leaning her head on my chest holding her tight.\n\n\"I am so sorry for all this George If I knew what kind of a man he was I would have thrown him out a long time ago.\"\n\n\"Hey calm down, it's not your fault, you're my sister I love you.\" Looking over, standing by the entrance of the house was Terry and Jim. \"What are you doing tonight?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Why?\"\n\n\"I would like to take my big sister and her boys to have something to eat. Maybe watch a movie after.\"\n\nThat's what we did after dropping off Jacky home. I surprised them by going to Stevenage. We had a meal in Prezzo's, leaving from there I said to the boys. \"We can go to watch a movie at Cineworld, or we can have a bowling competition between us.\" On hearing bowling, they started jumping up and down.\n\nBy the time we got home, it was after midnight. Both boys fell asleep in the car. I helped my sister carry them from the car to the house, even put them to bed. I went in the living room looking at all the pictures above the fireplace. Tina came next to me with two mugs of hot chocolate, handing me one of them. \"I missed so much in three years, your boys growing, my big sister our parents.\"\n\nShe rubbed my back while she said. \"You are here now, that is what counts.\"\n\nWe talked a while about life in general, that is when the truth came out. She was just about keeping up with her payments on the mortgage. Mum and dad were helping her with food plus clothe's for the boys. She hadn't bought anything for herself the last two years. It was nearly 3 am when I left.\n\nSunday was quiet, my parents always taught me on Sunday was the day people should rest. By the time we got up, it was midday. Mario called his mum, as soon as she said his dad was out the whole day he decided to go to visit her. I went to have lunch at my parent's house, my sister's boys were there when I asked where Tina was mum said. \"She went with a friend to Southend-on-sea.\"",
        "After we had lunch, all five of us went shopping in Wood Green. Mostly shopping for the boys, dad kept them preoccupied with the game consoles in Game. I gave dad \u00a3100 to buy them some games they wanted to buy, while mum and I went to JD sports to get them some sportswear.\n\n\"George, your spending a lot of money, you need to be more careful. It doesn't grow on tree's you know.\" She said.\n\n\"Let's go somewhere I want to show you something,\" I said as we entered WHSmith. \"What I will show you mum is going to be our little secret for the time being.\" When we reached the section were the top 50 fiction novels were I stopped. Scanning the books I spotted my book, it was sitting at 23, Picking a copy of it, I turned a few pages which I wrote before the novel started. Showing it to mum.\n\nTO MY FAMILY WHICH I LOVE VERY MUCH.\n\nWITHOUT THEM I WOULD BE NOTHING.\n\nBY GM\n\nMum raised her hand, putting it over her mouth, tears started running down her cheeks. She began walking towards the cash till with the novel in hand when I said. \"What are you doing mum.\"\n\n\"I'm going to buy my first Novel, my son's book!\" She said loud. Getting the attention of all the other shoppers in the store.\n\nWhen we got back home, Terry wanted to show me the games that they bought. Mum was heating up an apple pie she baked, Preparing some custard to have with it. Dad was fast asleep in his recliner chair with the newspaper on his chest. Terry was showing me the moves on Tekken 6, we started a fight when Tina and Vicky walked in catching both of us sitting on the edge of the sofa tapping like crazy on the controller.\n\n\"They never grow up do they, Vicky. \"Tina said.\n\nLooking at us, while smiling Vicky said. \"I think they look cute.\"\n\nMum also made some tea with the apple pie. Vicky stayed a while then she had to go as her parents were visiting her in the evening. Tina showed her out, having a little chat before she came back in.\n\nWhen Tina came back, she sat next to me. \"She likes you.\"\n\n\"Who likes who,\" I said.\n\n\"Vicky fancy's you, you big loaf!\" she shouted.\n\nThat's all mum needed, she was off as well, telling me that she seems a very nice person. She noticed as well when I was around Vicky I acted differently. Tina laughing a little too loud, waking up dad. Dad all groggy he looks around the room, seen me sitting there with a red face said to mum. \"Helen it must be too hot in here, George has gone red as a beetroot.\" We all started laughing hysterically. Dad just sat there with a confused look on his face.\n\nReaching into my pocket, I pulled out a Debit Card and gave it to Tina saying. \"I have opened an account for you and the boys.\"\n\nTina couldn't stop hugging and kissing me when mum showed her all the clothes we got for the boys. \"You must have spent over \u00a31000 on them. You have to stop spending money on us all the time.\" When Tina wasn't looking, I looked at mum winking at her.\n\nBy 10 pm I started to make my way home.\n\n*****\n\nFor the next couple of weeks, I was preoccupied with getting the gym ready for the health and safety audit by Haringey Council. Jacky would go twice a week to see a therapist that Father Petrou recommended for her. His office was a couple of blocks from the gym when she finished she would come to the gym to see me. \n\nI got Mario enrolled at Haringey College to get him ready for his GCSE's, he will be taking in three months. Hopefully, when he passes, he will get into University. After college coming straight to the gym helping out, spending most of his time helping other youths. On his spare time, he would train with me. Mr Brown would be at the gym when Mario was there showing him all the time what to do to improve his skills.\n\nMario was just finishing off tidying the gym equipment, I was checking the emergency doors and windows to make sure everything was locked. Making our way home in the car, we spotted Mario's mum entering the Tesco Express. Pulling into the parking area, I said. \"Go to see if your mum needs some help, Mario.\" He went inside to find his mum while I turned the car around.\n\nSitting behind the wheel waiting for him to return, playing with the different buttons on the steering wheel, trying to figure out what they do. That's when I noticed the same youth's which were harassing customers last time I came here. Pressing the button to open the window so I can hear what was going on. Who ever went into the shop or left they would say some comment or stand in front of them. Getting ready to get out of the car to say something. That is when I saw Mario's mum coming out with him behind carrying some bags.\n\n\"Hey, mummies boy chase after mum like a little dog!\" A tall youth wearing a baseball cap said. \n\nMario carried on walking behind his mum not even turning back. His mum got in the car, he then handed the bags to her to put on the seat then closed the door. As he came around the car to get in. The Baseball cap started walking towards the car with his peers following, cursing and swearing trying to provoke Mario.\n\n\"Leave him alone Johnny.\" A young lady said.\n\nBaseball Cap turns towards her hitting her in the face with the back of his hand knocking her on the tarmac. He lifts his hand to swing at her again when Mario shouts. \"Hey, Johnny Cap why don't you try knocking me down.\" Then Mario started walking towards him.\n\nOpening the car door ready to jump out, but waited I wanted to see how Mario will deal with the situation.\n\n\"Go and help him they might hurt him.\" Mario's mum said.\n\n\"He's going to be alright,\" I replied\n\nJohnny Cap made fists with his hands and started throwing punches. Mario blocks whatever he swings at him by blocking them with his arm. He ducks a punch, at the same time bringing his fist into johnny's gut knocking him over. With Johnny Cap on the tarmac trying to catch his breath, Mario helps the young lady up, walking her towards the car. \n\nHolding the side of her face, she says to Mario. \"I am ok you can let me go now.\" When he released her, she just ran off into the night. \n\nWe dropped off his mum, he carried mum's bags to the house for her. He delayed coming back a few minutes, probably having a chat with her. When he returned the rest of the way, we were both quiet. Entering the house, he said. \"I shouldn't have hit him.\"\n\n\"Hey, Mario whatever you did was in self-defence. You weren't going to wait for him to hurt you then hit back.\"\n\nHe was turning out to be an incredible young man, always there when you needed him. Every day in the morning we would get ready for our morning run. To my surprise a week after the incident with the youth outside Tesco I was on my 10-kilometre when my Fitbit bleeped on 4-kilometres for Mario to turn back, he carried on with me doing his first 10-kilometre run. When we finished, I asked. \"How did that feel?\"\n\nThe last couple of kilometres I wanted to give up, but I forced myself. On the final 500 metres, the pavement felt it was flowing under my trainers.\" He said as he was trying to catch his breath back.\n\n\"If your tyred and want to skip the rest of the exercise there is no problem,\" I said.\n\n\"From now on we finish our morning ritual together.\" Was his reply.\n\nIt was a cloudy Wednesday morning, I had just dropped off Mario at the college, making my way to the gym I noticed Father Petrou at the entrance waiting for me. Getting out of the car I made a quick sprint to get inside as it started raining hard. \"Good morning Father, what a day. What brings you to these parts of the woods.\" I said.\n\n\"Good morning George, I have a small favour to ask of you?\" \n\n\"Tell me, Father.\"\n\n\"You had a small encounter with some teenagers outside Tesco a few days ago?\"\n\nI corrected him by telling him what happened. \"It wasn't me who had the encounter, it was Mario who was not at Fort at all.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not saying that Mario did anything, It's just those youths came to see me early this morning, asking me to ask you if they could join the gym?\"\n\n\"Father Petrou you know my doors are open to anyone.\" On saying that he pulled out his mobile to call someone. When he finished, he smiled as he put it back in his pocket.\n\nA few minutes later a group of teenagers strolled into the gym. All wet like they had just been dipped in a barrel of water, then pulled out. \"Ok everyone you're making my floor wet. Changing rooms are over there. Boys on the left and girls on the right, you will find some dry towels, get dry.\" Directing them with my hand.\n\nLooking back at Father Petrou I said. \"I see you have found a way to do God's work faster with your mobile.\"\n\nPunching me lightly on the shoulder he said. \"Did you notice the girl with the black eye. That is Angela, she came with her mother to talk to me, telling me what happened that evening.\"\n\nSince the incident outside Tesco Mario has been finding some excuse to stop at that particular store to buy something we need. He didn't say anything, but I had an idea who he wanted to see again.\n\nIt was 2 pm when Mario came from college with a backpack on his shoulder and a Tesco bag in hand. \"Find what you was looking for at Tesco,\" I said while looking at Angela who was behind him doing some stretching in front of the large mirror.\n\n\"I got the items we needed.\" Lifting up the bag to show me.\n\n\"That means you didn't find what you was looking for.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Staring at me with a confused look on his face.\n\nLooking at him I nodded my head for him to look behind him. Turning around he froze where he was standing. His backpack slowly sliding off his shoulder to the ground. On seen him through the reflection in the mirror she raised a hand to greet him. He slowly started to walk towards her. \"Hey buddy you want to leave the Tesco bag with me,\" I said. Handing me the bag he made his way to Angela. \n\nSitting in my office finishing a conversation with Jacky about the private detective's progress on finding Gary. It had been a month since our discovery, it seemed he had disappeared from the face of the earth. Looking at a map of Britain with all the places the private detective highlighted that Gary used his debit card to withdraw money. I was in deep thought.\n\nThe door knocked bringing me back to reality. \"Come in,\" I said.\n\nThe door opened, standing in front of me was Mario's father. \"Do you have five minutes Mr Michaelides.\"\n\nSeen him suddenly like that shocked me. I just sat there staring at him, at first I didn't recognise him. He was all cleaned up and seemed sober.\n\n\"I understand if your too busy sir.\" Turning to go making his way out.\n\n\"No, wait!\" I shouted. Causing my voice to echo in the gym, making everyone stop what they were doing to look.\n\n\"What do you want here, leave me alone, get out of my life!\" It was Mario shouting from across the gym marching towards his dad, with Angela running after him trying to grab his arm.\n\nRushing in front of Mario I blocked his path, bringing him to a halt. Angela at the same time pulling him back. \"Leave this to me, Mario.\" Turning to Angela, I said. \"can you take him to the changing rooms to calm down please.\" she nodded her head to say yes.\n\nRunning outside, catching up with Harry outside St. Mary's Church I grabbed his arm. He stopped without any struggle. \"I'm sorry for coming to the gym like that, tell Mario I will not bother him again.\" He said.\n\n\"Let's go inside.\" Pointing to the church entrance. We both entered doing the sign of the cross on ourselves as we entered. It surprised me to see so many people in the church at that time. Looking around I found a stall away from others so we could have some privacy. We both sat down staring in front of us. \"You've really changed your life around from the last time we met,\" I said.\n\n\"I came to say thank you for what you have done for my son. Also wanted to see him, to apologise for what I put him through all these years. Like I said earlier tell him I will not bother him again.\"\n\nHe was getting ready to get up when I said. Sit down with me for a minute. \"Father Petrou tells me you're finding difficulty in searching for a job. I need someone to open the gym in the morning, then close up in the evening. Also, the gym needs some minor work done, like a fresh coat of paint. The pay is not bad either.\"\n\nHe quickly turned his head to look at me. \"What about Mario.\"\n\n\"Leave that with me. Just be there at 9 am tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhen I returned to the gym, I went straight to my office. It didn't take long to hear the knock on the door I was waiting for. \"Come in Mario.\"\n\n\"Do you have five minutes George.\"\n\n\"I am all ears.\"\n\n\"I was wrong at what I said to my dad.\"\n\n\"You was angry.\"\n\n\"Did you see him, he was all cleaned up, freshly shaven, new clothes, a changed man,\" Mario said with a smile.\n\n\"He is in desperate need of employment, I told him we need someone to open the gym in the morning, also to close it in the evening. Since his job is decorating, he will be doing some DIY to the place.\" I said. Waiting to see what Mario's reaction would be.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something then closed it. Looked at me then walked out of my office, to what he was doing earlier. \"Now that was easier than I thought.\"\n\nIn three months of opening the gym, everything was falling into place. In a month Harry made the place look new. Mr Brown and I were running the gym. Mario was trying to help as much as he could, but he had his studying.\n\n\"George you need to hire some more people.\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"I need to make a phone call,\" I said rushing to my office, closing the door behind me. A few minutes later charging out of my office I shouted out. \"Mr Brown look after the place I need to go somewhere for a couple of hours!\"\n\nIt took me forty-five minutes to drive to Hamstead Heath, on West Heath Road they were doing some road works, stuck in the traffic for another twenty minutes. Once I turned into Templewood Avenue the road was clear, withing minutes I was in Templewood Gardens parked outside the house.\n\nOn approaching the house, I noticed there were no stairs mostly ramps. I rang the bell twice then waited. When the door opened, I recognised her straight away. \"Hello, Mrs Brankovic. Sorry for coming on such short notice.\"\n\n\"Hello, George come in. Before we go into the library let me warn you, he might use some ugly word against you.\" Putting her hand on my shoulder, she also said. \"Thank you for coming to see him.\"\n\nWhen I walked into the room there, he was behind a big oak desk typing on a laptop. \"Hey, Radovan!\" I called out.\n\nHe quickly looked up at me with a shocked look on his face he shouted. \"What the fuck are you doing here. I know you've come to confirm what you did to me. Let me show you.\" He quickly spun to his left then rolled forward past the desk suddenly turned again to face me, Removing the blanket cover his legs.\n\nStanding there frozen for a moment, not knowing what to say. I noticed someone standing to my left, when I turned to look, it was Radovan's wife. She had her hand over her mouth while tears were running down her cheeks. Turning back towards him I said. \"I am truly sorry for the pain I caused you and your family. If I could turn the clock back when my coach went to throw the towel in the ring, I would have let him do it.\"\n\nHe quickly turned his wheelchair around, just sat there looking out the large Victorian window at the garden. I walked up to his side just stood there looking outside. \"I need your help,\" I said in a low tone.\n\nStill looking ahead he said. \"What help can I be, I am half a man.\"\n\n\"I don't see half a man.\" Then looking behind me at his wife I shouted to her. \"Do you see half a man Malina!\"\n\nWiping the tears from her eye's she said. \"No.\"\n\n\"Look I'm not going to bullshit you, I've opened a gym to help the youth in the community, to get them off the street. I need staff that will assist these kids in life, that is where you come in. One more thing I don't get paid for this and you won't either, but you will be an inspiration to them, someone they will look up to.\"\n\nHe stayed quiet for a few minutes before he answered. \"I will think about it.\"\n\nI walked back to his desk grabbed a post-it note block, and pen sitting on his desk then wrote the address of the gym. \"I've written you the address here, we open at 9 am. Think about it, you will be a great mentor for a lot of these kids.\"\n\nMalina showed me to the front door. Before I left, she grabbed my arm. She said. \"Thank you for trying to get him involved in this project. This is what he needs to bring up his moral.\"\n\n*****\n\nNext day was Friday, forgetting to turn on my alarm, I woke up late. It was past 9 am. The flat was empty Mario must have taken the bus to college. Making myself, coffee had a few sips to wake me up then I jumped into the shower. Quickly got dressed then left for the gym. On locking my front door, I heard a voice behind me.\n\n\"Hi, stranger.\" It was Vicky.\n\n\"Hi Vicky, long time no see, what are you up to,\" I said.\n\n\"Got the day off, going to do some shopping, I need to get out of the house.\"\n\n\"I haven't had breakfast yet fancy joining me?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sure why not.\"\n\nI drove to a cafe in Palmers Green which I had never been too. We both ordered a full English Breakfast. Since the day Vicky helped me clean the flat, I haven't had the chance to spend some time with her. We stayed there for quite a while talking in general. That is when I realised we had a lot in common. \n\nIt was nearly 1 pm when I asked the waitress to bring me the bill. In her place, a gentleman came in his 50's wearing a chef's uniform. He said. \"Hello my name is John, I hope you enjoyed the breakfast.\" He said.\n\n\"It was very nice, thank you for asking. I just requested the bill from the young lady.\" I said.\n\n\"There is no charge for anything. What you are trying to do for our community is the least we can do for you.\" You have a beautiful day and come back again.\" Shock my hand. \"I need to go now to prepare for lunch time.\" Walking back to the kitchen.\n\nReturning to my car Vicky said. \"very impressive getting highly respected from the community.\"\n\n\"Just trying to help,\" I said\n\nI drove her to Wood Green station, as she wanted to get the Picadilly line to central London. Before she got out of the car, we made plans to meet up on Sunday evening for a meal.\n\nThe gym was very busy when I got there, Mario was showing some youngsters how to use the speed bag, while Mr Brown was with two other youths who were sparring in the ring. I went straight to my office closed the door dropping on the task chair. A few minutes later the door knocked.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nMr Brown entered the office came up to my desk putting his hands on the desk then leant forward. \"I guess you know who came in today.\" He said.\n\n\"Fuck I thought he wouldn't turn up, believe me, he wasn't too happy when he saw me yesterday. I suppose he left when he didn't see me here.\"\n\n\"No, actually he's with a group of kid's, that joined today, explaining to them how to use the equipment safely. You did the right thing, George, I think our team is 100% now.\"\n\nLetting Radovan finish with what he was doing I then went to have a quick word with him. \"Hey, thanks for coming down today.\"\n\n\"I didn't have much choice Milana literally pulled me out of bed. But I am glad I came. Speaking to those kids gave me a purpose in life. If it's ok with you from next week, I come from Monday to Friday.\"\n\n\"Like I said yesterday, you are an inspiration for these kids,\" I called Mario over introduced him to Radovan, chatted with them a while, then told Mario to show Radovan around the gym.\n\nIt was Saturday evening, Mario had gone out on a date with Angela, my parents and I had gone around my sisters for a meal. We had our dinner, the kids went upstairs to play on their Playstation, Tina sent mum and dad to the living room to relax while we cleaned up. Putting away some plates in the cupboard next to the fridge I notice a picture held onto the refrigerator door with a magnet. It was Gary with the boys, taken in front of a semi-detached house.",
        "\"Hey sis where was this picture taken with Gary and the boys.\" \n\n\"That is St. Christophers Park in Ellistown Village, Gary's mum lived there, we took that picture just before she passed away.\"\n\n\"The boys must really miss their dad?\" I said.\n\nTurning her back to me she said. \"What could I do George, I tried my best to keep our marriage together.\" She then got a tissue to wipe her eyes.\n\nGoing next to her I put my arm around her. \"Hey don't worry everything is going to be ok sis.\" I rubbed her back. \"Go sit with mum and dad I'll make the tea.\" While waiting for the water to boil I had another look at the picture on the fridge, looking closer to see the number on the house, memorising it.\n\nAfter dropping off my parent's, it was after midnight when I got home. Mario was in the living room watching a movie on Netflix.\n\n\"Hey, how did your date go,\" I said.\n\n\"Pretty good we're going for dinner tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"That's good I'm going out for dinner with Vicky maybe we could book a table for four.\" \n\n\"Sure,\" He replied.\n\nGoing into the kitchen, my laptop was on the dining table. Firing it up I went straight to google maps putting 37 Christopher Park, Ellistown then pressed enter. The map data came up with a small picture of the same house I saw earlier on tina's fridge. Zooming out to see were Ellistown was in the UK, I felt goosebumps all over my body. It was situated not too far from the two cities Gary was making his ATM withdraws, Birmingham and Leicester. My first thought was to call our private detective or the police, but I scrapped that idea. \n\nLooking over at Mario I said. \"How long till the movie ends.\"\n\n\"It's nearly finished if the volume is too loud I will turn it down,\" He replied.\n\n\"When the movie ends fancy going for a little drive.\"\n\n\"Sure where we going.\"\n\n\"Leicester.\"\n\n\"Why would you want to go to Leicester at 2 in the morning.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you on the way.\"\n\nHe switched off the TV, then went to change from his tracksuit into some casual clothes, I put the kettle on to make us some coffee to take with us in a thermal flask. At that time in the morning, we will need a lot of caffeine to keep us awake. When we were both ready, I said. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe drive to Leicester took about 2 hours, I didn't say a word till I parked the car in Mcdonald's car park in Coalville. It was only 4 in the morning, it was so quiet you could hear the crackling noise the exhaust make's when it's hot.\n\nTurning my head to the left for a few seconds then to the right, just to get rid of the tension from the two-hour drive. \"Poor us each a cup of coffee Mario,\" I said. He opened the Thermos slowly not to spill any on the car seats, pouring a cup for each of us then putting them in the cup holders.\n\n\"You going to tell me why we just drove one-hundred miles in the middle of the night to park in Mcdonald's car park in Leicester.\" He said.\n\nTaking the cup of coffee out of the cup holder, then rolling it in my palm feeling the hot plastic I took a sip then said. \"When Mcdonald's opens at five we'll have breakfast then we'll visit someone who lives down here.\"\n\nWith a confused look, he said. \"Who.\"\n\n\"Gary.\"\n\n\"Fuck.\" \n\nI guess that was the only reply he could think of.\n\nWhen Mcdonalds opened, we went inside ordered breakfast to eat there. There weren't many customers as it was Sunday morning. If it were any other day, people would be coming in for early breakfast before they go to work. I just sat there moving the food around with my fork. After sitting in Mcdonalds for two hours, I said to Mario. \"Let's get this over and done with.\"\n\nIn fifteen minutes we were parked outside the house. \"Don't you think we should have called the police,\" Mario said.\n\n\"Fuck the police.\" Quickly opening the car door making my way to the path leading to the front door. On reaching the door, I rang the doorbell. When there was no response, I went over to the window putting my face to the glass to look inside. That's when I saw a picture of Gary and a woman holding a baby. Going back to the door I started pounding on it hard.\n\n\"Stop banging on the door, or I'll call the police.\" looking behind me, standing on their doorstep was the people who lived opposite. Looking down on the ground was a small stone statue maybe three feet tall. Picking it up then turning it sideways I charged at the front door using it as a battering ram. All it took was one hit, the door flew open at the same time knocking me over.\n\nGetting up I tried to run into the house before I reached the entrance I felt a hand grab my shoulder to pull me, but what actually stopped me was the sickening odour coming from inside. It was like the smell of rotten meat but ten times worst.\n\n\"What is that stench,\" Mario said.\n\nBefore I could answer, there was the sound of screeching brakes then car doors opening and closing. Two police officers forced me to the ground putting my hands behind my back handcuffing me, at the same time telling me my Miranda rights.\n\nSitting in a police car while Mario was giving a statement to the police officers. Other police officers secured the crime scene. More police cars arrived with an ambulance behind them. No one would say anything to me, even Mario wasn't allowed near me. My eyes glued on the entrance of the house to see who will come out. Then a couple of paramedics went in with a stretcher a few minutes later they came out pushing the gurney with a black body bag. Once loading it into the ambulance, returning to the house to collect another body bag. It was after 10 am when the police drove me to Coalville Police Station. \n\nSitting in a room with no windows, just a table in the middle with three chairs. Me sitting on one still handcuffed but this time the cuffs were in front not behind my back. Looking around the room, wondering what has happened, if one of the body's in the black bags was Gary.\n\nAll of a sudden the door opened, a man in a suit and a police office came into the room. The suit sat on one of the chairs opposite me. The police officer walked up to me taking off the handcuffs then went to stand by the door. \n\nRubbing the red marks left by the cuffs on my wrists I said to suit. \"What is going on, who's body's did you bring out of the house.\"\n\n\"Mr Michaelides my name is Detective White. I want to ask you a few questions, do you know Gary Smith and Luara Green?\"\n\nTilting my head down then gripping my head I said. \"Gary Smith was my brother-in-law the other name I don't know. Were they the body's you found in the house.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLooking up I asked. \"What happened to Gary? Was there a child with them?\n\n\"They both overdosed on drugs, probably fentanyl a synthetic drug that is ten times stronger than heroin. An autopsy will be done to confirm this. We found evidence a child was living there, but nobody was found.\" \n\n\"What about this Laura Green, doesn't she have a family you can contact? Maybe the child is with them.\"\n\n\"Mr Michaelides, we have your number, if we have any information we will contact you. The young Man you was with called your family. They are all in the waiting room, we need to take your fingerprints, then you can go.\"\n\nBy 2 pm I was released, escorted by two police officers into the waiting room where my family was waiting. My parents hugged me holding me tight, releasing them I looking around to see my sister. She was sitting in the corner staring into space. Mario was sitting next to her, Sitting on the other side taking her hand I said. \"I am so sorry Tina.\" Dad drove me back to the house to pick up the Range Rover. Then we started our journey back to London.\n\n*****\n\nMonday morning was quiet at the gym, Mario had skipped college today as we got in very late last night. He was trying to show Angela how to use some equipment when we heard a loud crash. Everyone turned to the direction of the sound. Running towards Mario and Angela was Johnny the youth Mario had trouble with a few days back. As he got closer, reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a knife. From nowhere Mario's dad jumped in front of Johnny trying to push him away, but the impact knocked them both over. Johnny quickly got up seen blood on his hands he ran out of the gym. Harry was lying on his side motionless with a pool of blood growing around him.\n\nMario dropped to his knees shouting. \"Dad, dad.\" Taking him in his arms shaking him. \n\nI quickly ran to the other side checking his pause, then trying to do CPR on him. Looking up I said to Angela to call an ambulance and for someone to bring the First Aid box. The ambulance arrived in ten minutes. All the time since the attack I was doing CPR on him. When the paramedics took over, they also tried electro shock but with no success. A few minutes later they looked up at me shaking their head from left to right. On seen this Mario let out a big scream. \"nooo nooo!\"\n\nWhen Johnny ran into him, the knife went into one of his heart arteries causing Harry to bleed a lot, causing his death. Johnny was picked up by the police two days later. He was arrested for manslaughter. I closed the gym for the rest of the week. Mario went to stay at home to be close to his mum.\n\nIt has been three days since Harry died, sitting here in my living room not answering my phone or the door bell. Thinking if I should stay or go back to Wales. Picking up my iPhone then taking the Range Rover keys out of my pocket I put them together on the kitchen counter. Putting my clothes in a suitcase, I made my way to my car. \n\nIt was late when I got to Porthmadog, on driving up to Mrs Watson property I notice all the lights were out. \"she must be asleep.\" I grabbed my belongings from the car going straight to the cottage. Had a shower then straight to bed. I was so tired I was fast asleep within minutes.\n\nWaking up to the sound of knocking on the door, looking at my watch it was 7 am. Quickly getting dressed, I opened the front door. \"Good morning Mrs Watson.\"\n\nStanding there with her hands crossed across her chest she said. \"Good morning George, did you miss me that much that you came back.\"\n\nAfter making us a cup of tea, we both sat in the living room. I started from the day I left Wales in detail all the events that happened up to the day that Harry got stabbed. \n\nMrs Watson listened to everything I said to her when I finished she learnt over took my hand. She said. \"George by the sound of it a lot of people depend on you. You have everything back home. By coming to Wales, you are just running away from your responsibilities. Stay until the end of the week then go back to your loved once.\n\nThe next couple of days I did some DIY jobs around Mrs Watson's property. They were minor things, but it helped me to keep my mind away from other things. In the evening I would have a meal with Mrs Watson, then enjoy her company with a bottle of beer on her porch, just sitting there in the quiet of the night just looking up at the stars. \"Are you ready to go home, George,\" She said.\n\n\"Tomorrow afternoon Mrs Watson,\" I said.\n\nI got up early on Sunday morning, looking out the window, Heavy clouds had gathered over Porthmadog as far as the eye could see. Putting my running gear on I stepped outside to prepare myself for my run. Finishing off my warm up I looked ahead seen the lighthouse at the end of some cliffs, the distance was twelve kilometres through rough terrain.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I started the run going through all the obstacles avoiding rocks and puddles. It didn't take long when the heavens opened up with a flood of rain, making it much harder to run. Hurdling over rocks and leaping over streams of water created by the rain. Getting closer to my destination the pain in my legs was unbearable, caused from the rough terrain. On reaching the lighthouse, I just dropped onto my knees, stretching my arms out I shouted. \"What have I done to deserve all this.\" Suddenly there was a big flash of light followed some seconds later by the sound of thunder vibrating the core of my spine. I stayed like that for a few minutes feeling the drops of rain on my face and body as it cooled me down. Slowly getting up I started to make my way back to the cottage, this time taking it easy.\n\nWhen I finished, it was straight into the shower. Letting the hot water run over my body for a while to warm me up. Quickly getting dressed then started to make my way to Mrs Watson's house.\n\nEntering the house from the back through the kitchen I didn't notice the car parked in front of the house. Not seen her in the kitchen I carried on walking towards the living room at the same time shouting. \"I think it's time to go home Mrs Watson.\" On entering the living room, I stopped. Sitting on the single couch was Mrs Watson, on the double was my mum and Jacky.\n\n\"Mum, Jacky why are you here.\"\n\n\"We found him, George, we found your son,\" Jacky said.\n\n\"How.\"\n\n\"When the money stopped going into Gary's account from my late husband after he passed away. That is when they dumped the child with Laura's mum. Been scared for what her daughter had done, knowing the child was not hers, she started taking care of it. When the police discovered where she lived. Two officers went to tell her the bad news about her daughter, that is when she broke down telling them everything.\"\n\n\"Where is my son now.\"\n\n\"He's been with social services in Manchester for three days. You can pick him up tomorrow.\"\n\nThey got up walked up to me embracing me in a hug, I looked up at the ceiling whispering. \"Thank you, God.\"\n\nAs we released each other, mum Beckoned me with her finger. Moving back closer she suddenly swung her hand towards my face, slapping me as hard as she could. \"That is for trying to break my heart a second time.\" Rubbing my cheek to subside the pain I looked at Jacky.\n\n\"Don't look at me for sympathy, I agree with her.\"\n\nTurning to Mrs Watson, I said. \"Say something.\"\n\n\"Helen it was about time you gave that boy a slap,\" Then she started to laugh, triggering the other two to start laughing.\n\nJacky and mum made plans to stay at a hotel, but Mrs Watson wouldn't have that. \"You're staying here she insisted.\" Once we got that over, all three of them went into the kitchen to prepare something for us to eat. Not letting me do anything, I sat at the kitchen table with a long neck Budweiser, watching them exchanging ideas in recipes.\n\nWith our meal, Mrs Watson opened a bottle of red wine. The ladies had a glass each, as mum never drunk alcohol she got a bit tipsy. We stayed up till late discussing what we will need to take with us tomorrow. Jacky made the first move. \"We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow, I will retire to my bed.\" The rest of us made our way to our rooms to get a bit of sleep. \n\nJacky told me to drive her car as we were going with one car. The drive to Manchester took under three hours, but it was the longest drive for me. The sat nav said those magic word when we reached the social service offices. \"You have reached your destination.\"\n\nThere was a lot of paperwork to fill up, mum and Jacky sat in the waiting room waiting. When I finished, I joined them. I sat down for a couple of minutes, then getting all fidgety I got up I started pacing up and down the room.\n\n\"Mr Michaelides.\" Turning around at the entrance of the waiting room was a lady in a black suit. In her left hand holding a small suitcase and the other hand a little boy. All three of us walked towards them. When I was a metre from them, I kneeled in front of the kid. \n\nThe lady in the suit said. \"This is Charlie.\" \n\nJust staring at him for a few seconds, I turned to my mother-in-law. I said. \"All his facial features are Sarah's.\" Feeling the tears run down my cheeks.\n\nLooking at me he said. \"Is Sarah mummy? Why you cry?\" Leaning forward he wiped the tear with his finger.\n\n\"Because I'm happy,\" I replied.\n\nEpilogue\n\nIt's been two years since I got reunited with my son Charlie. It was difficult the first few months, but with the help of my family, Vicky and mother-in-law, it was much easier. During the day Charlie was spoilt by his grandparents, and in the evening Vicky helped me. We taught each other how to look after a three-year-old.\n\nMy mother-in-law sold the house, getting a good price for it. She got a small two bedroom house in Enfield Town to be close to us. Mum said to her one day. \"You don't need a two bedroom.\" Her reply was. \"Yes, I do it's for my grandson when he sleeps over.\"\n\nOnce the gym was running smoothly, Mr Brown retired. He occasionally comes in to make sure everything is in order.\n\nMy parents retired. They help Tina and me with the kids. Picking up the boys from school when they finish. Mum also takes care of Charlie a couple of days a week. Tina got a job for a law firm as a secretary. She met Joy there. They've been dating for about six months. Also, the boys seem to get along with him.\n\nMario is living at home know. He want's to be close to his mum, ever since his dad died Androula hasn't been the same. Getting himself a scholarship and a place to study English Literature at Hatfield University. His goal is to be an English teacher. All his spare time he spends in the gym training. He has become very close to Radovan. Radovan is training him, pushing him that extra bit. He believes that Mario has the heart of a boxer.\n\nMrs Watson spends Christmas and Easter with my family. They make a great team with mum and my mother-in-law.\n\nSitting here with my son a few feet away playing with his Lego bricks. Vicky lying on my chest feeding me grapes as we watch a movie on Netflix. When the closing credits of the film come up, Vicky stands up to make her way back to her flat. Leaning down she gave me a peck on the lips. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" Vicky said.\n\nCharlie turned around rolling his eyes he said. \"Why don't you just stay, you're going to come back and sleep with my daddy's when I go to bed.\"\n\nBoth of us shocked just stood there with our mouths open.\n\nThe End."
