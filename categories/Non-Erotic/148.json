He was about to try and help then shook his head, no all he would do was get in the way. A moment later Twitty came flying by on her way to the command deck. Slowing, she suddenly fell gasping just past Ambrose.\n\nSkylos appeared with a third mask as he hurriedly tried to get the mask on the struggling to breathe Twitty. Clawing at the air Twitty knocked Skylos off his feet. Rushing to Skylos, Ambrose grabbed the mask then pulling Twitty up put it over her face.\n\nGasping in a huge lungful of air she smiled up weakly at Ambrose. \"I'm am proud to be your mate, sire!\"\n\nStill struggling to get up Ambrose held her there a moment. \"Rest a moment you need to get your strength before you go at it again.\"\n\n\"Sire! We have to keep the engine going or we are dead in space. Ugh! Then help me sire.\" Twitty said as they both walked to Skylos who was just getting off the deck.\n\n\"I'm going to the engine room. I need you to monitor the shapes I put in with luck we can get enough power to the one working to restart the other.\" Skylos told Twitty as she nodded heading for the command deck.\n\nAmbrose sat after they went in opposite directions. [Cousin?] Ambrose heard. [Cousin? Can you here me?]\n\nShocked a moment Ambrose thought, [I am here cousin. Skylos is trying to keep the ship going. We've lost most of our power. He and Queen Twitty are attempting to repair it right now.]\n\n[We will not leave 'til we know you are able to land. Just tell me, and we'll be there in less than a specton.] Typree thought back.\n\n[No!] Ambrose almost shouted in his thoughts. [I don't want to endanger your ships along with ours. Stand by I'm sure Skylos will have us going soon.]\n\nJust then he heard Skylos cursing as there was a small explosion. Rushing to the engine room Ambrose saw that Skylos was laying on the deck gasping for breath his mask across the room. Grabbing it Ambrose struggled to get it on Skylos.\n\nTaking a huge breath Skylos eyes went large as he started to gasp again. Shit! Ambrose thought as he saw the crack all the way across the mask. Taking a huge breath he ripped his off securing it over Skylos's face. \"Sire\n\nNO!\" Skylos yelled then jumped up rushing to a storage cabinet. Searching through the contents he reappeared with another mask.\n\nAmbrose nodded as he donned the one Skylos handed him. Donning it quickly Ambrose took a huge lungful of air. Standing up Ambrose nodded to Skylos as they both started to pull several golden pieces from the container.\n\n\"Alright Queen Twitty we are starting to place the pieces.\" Skylos stated. \"Slowly sire 'til we have a good match.\"\n\nFor the next eight spectons all that could be heard was Twitty going no, no, not even close. Then suddenly, \"Stop! That one it seems to have the optimum shape.\"\n\nSkylos nodded as Ambrose slowly placed the piece within the chamber. Quickly closing it Skylos pressed several button as the lights came half way back on.\n\n\"I have the first engine stabilizing now. I'm still getting no response from the second.\" Twitty called back.\n\n\"Good though we are still dead in space if we can't restart the second. We'd burn up long before we crashed.\" Skylos told Twitty and Ambrose.\n\n\"I've started to go through what we have looking for a comparable shape. So far not much luck size or shape...\" Ambrose stopped as he felt a rather large round shape deeper in the container. Yanking it out\n\nSkylos's eyes went large as he opened the largest chamber.\n\n\"Careful sire if this works it might bring everything halfway back up.\" Skylos said as Ambrose very slowly began to place the rather large piece. \"A little more sire.\" Skylos had a strange looking pair of glasses out as he started to direct Ambrose to slowly shift the piece 'til he was sure it was as close to perfect as he could see.\n\nBreathing a sigh of relief both Ambrose and Skylos smiled. \"You think this will work?\" Ambrose asked.\n\n\"This is the largest energy chamber. If we can get this one going then we have a damn good chance. Alright Queen Twitty I am going to bring the largest chamber online slowly. When it is at fifty percent, try to re-ignite the second engine.\" Skylos was telling Twitty.\n\n\"Alright got my eyes on the power output now.\" Twitty replied as Skylos nodded then close the chamber.\n\nNodding to Ambrose Skylos pushed several buttons then grasp a lever as he started to slide it upwards. \"Here we go!\" Skylos said as he started to push the power higher.\n\n\"Looking good so far, chamber holding power almost to twenty percent. Now at twenty five steadily rising, thirty still climbing, thirty five air circulation has started.\" Nodding to Ambrose Skylos lifted his mask taking a deep breath.\n\nAmbrose took his off also taking a deep breath then nodding back to Skylos. \"How are the stabilizers?\" Skylos asked.\n\n\"Power at forty percent, I have minimal stabilizers. Still attempting to right our path. Forty five percent!\" Twitty shouted excited.\n\n\"Sire try to find another like the shape of the last I'm going to command to help her re-ignite the engine. I just hope it doesn't take that long to get it going again.\" Skylos said as he moved past Ambrose toward command.\n\nAmbrose shook his head as he started to go through the container. Hope we can find a few more he thought. Not really wanting to die out here in space.\n\nStill searching through the container Ambrose felt the ship lurch as Skylos and Twitty again attempted to restart the engine.\n\nThen Ambrose was hearing cursing coming from the command deck. Then Skylos came flying back to where Ambrose was.\n\nPanting a bit Skylos looked at the five or six pieces that Ambrose had found. Holding up one of them Skylos smiled as he opened another chamber gingerly place the piece inside. \"THAT should really help!\" Skylos said as he ran for the command deck.\n\nAgain the ship lurched then there was a roar as the second engine came up. Breathing a sigh of relief Ambrose was about to leave when Skylos appeared again. \"We have power at seventy five percent sire.\" Looking at what Ambrose was holding Skylos's eyes got large as he took four more from him opening another four panels.\n\nFive spectons later Twitty called back. \"We're at ninety nine percent, power has almost completely stabilized. I'm heading for earth.\"\n\nSkylos nodded as he thanked Ambrose then ran for the command deck again. Thankfully they had control as they entered the atmosphere then landed. As he expected, they were met by all his Knights and Paladins. Plus the fact that Glenna was scowling at him wasn't making things easier either.\n\n\"Mate!\" She shouted as they ran to him checking out every bit of him.\n\nSmirking Glenna finally looked at Ambrose. \"Mate if you were so anxious to die then you should have stayed here.\"\n\nAmbrose could only sigh as Twitty was soon in Glenna's ear telling her all that had transpired. Turning Glenna told all the rest of Ambrose's Knights and his Paladins. Roth face twisted into a mask of anger as he stared at Ambrose.\n\n\"Really sire! If you continue to ignore us protecting you, then I and the others may have to retire from your detail.\" Roth told Ambrose whose face suddenly showed great shock.\n\n\"I am sorry Roth; this takes precedence over even me. If we don't get these people moved then there will be no realm.\" Ambrose told all of them.\n\nRoth was nodding then stated, \"That is all well and true sire. Remember though, without you not many of these people would go either. So as you see it is a double edge sword. Therefore I might advise that you take both of your mates to uh... uh hum smooth things over. I have learned the hard way Sire, an angry mate can make for many angry, tense moments in your life with them.\"\n\nAmbrose was nodding as he listened to Roth advise him. Sighing he was new to this the idea of having three mates, it was foreign to him, let alone having one. \"I will endeavor to remember what you have said old friend.\" Looking over at a scowling Glenna he leaned over whispering to Roth. \"Any advise for this situation?\"\n\nRoth's eyes went large as he also peeked a look at an apparently upset Glenna. \"Hmmm, you might apologize. Yes, I know but believe me sire, an apology to one's mate can go VERY far towards repairing the situation.\"\n\nAmbrose thought a moment then nodded his agreement. Sighing Ambrose started to move past as Roth wished him luck. Glenna growled slightly as Ambrose approached then bowed his head to her. For several tense spectons they all heard the low murmur of Ambrose. Then just as suddenly Glenna smiled throwing her arms and paws around Ambrose kissing his face.\n\nPulling back from him Glenna stated, \"I will remember all of this, let us hope you do also!\"\n\nAmbrose nodded as he moved toward Skylos and Twitty, Glenna following close behind. Skylos was cursing at himself as he was moving at an accelerated speed. Back and forth between the two engines muttering about various things. Finally ten spectons later with all of them watching him he sighed then nodded.\n\n\"So,\" Ambrose said startling Skylos. \"Will we be able to go soon?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we need to wait a bit before we go again. I also need to check the other ships engines before we even think of setting out again. Afraid it will be two or three totons before the repair systems will have the ship ready sire.\" Skylos informed Ambrose.\n\nSighing Ambrose nodded. \"I was afraid that we were pushing far harder than the ships could take. Alright take your time get them as ready as you can.\" Turning toward Roth and the other knights, the Paladins and both his mates he stated. \"I think it's about time that Cit-Chac-Coh paid a visit to the opposing armies.\"\n\nBoth his mates started to protest as Ambrose held up his paws. Still Glenna continued, \"Mate! We don't think that is a good move. They could over power you!\"\n\nAmbrose smirked at all of them, \"You seem to have forgotten about the skill all of you posses, plus the power that I wield. No I think that they will listen as the youth that I let go said.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" Roth said a moment later rubbing his chin. \"Might I suggest that when we do this that we all go in fully armed? I also suggest that we hold a standard fight configuration. Everyone in partners covering all that they can reach.\"\n\nAmbrose was nodding it was a sound strategy, \"We might also not go all the way in. Having to kill several thousand might make things far more difficult at the end. The city has to fall THAT is a fact of history.\"\n\nRoth and several of the others were smiling bigger. Not having to fight through as many if necessary was a hell of a lot better!\n\n\"So,\" Glenna said as she drew her sword. \"When do we leave?\"\n\nAmbrose considered a moment then spoke, \"I was thinking about right now. As all know there is no better time than the present.\"\n\nAll of them nodded as they all started to load all of their weapons. Ambrose sighed hoping that this didn't turn into a blood bath. Though he had been itching for a fight as he was sure his mates, knights, and paladins were he hoped this worked.\n\nAs they moved out of the city toward the long line of warriors Ambrose could see that the Tikal warriors were seriously out numbered. There had to be hundreds of thousands of opposing warriors against what Ambrose could see were only a few thousand of the Tikal warriors. Ambrose could see that they were all proud to die for their city and for him.\n\nStopping Ambrose talked to the Tikal King explaining what he was going to do. Though the King wasn't happy about what Ambrose's group was going to do, who was he to argue with the gods? Ambrose's group moved past drawing closer to the enemy lines. A few moments later there was a great shouting as the ranks parted to allow the human looking party in.\n\nAgain stopping Ambrose spoke to the obvious leader of the warriors there. The man was shaking, bowed to the ground as Ambrose requested that the man send for the kings of the two cities. \"I know that Calakmul and Caracol are both here.\" Ambrose said shocking the man.\n\nVery slowly the man nodded as he started to yell orders. Moving a little further forward all of Ambrose's party stood inside a tent like structure to await the kings. Yuknoom Ch'een II was the first to arrive with a huge amount of soldiers. Nodding to Ambrose he sat on one side of the huge structure.\n\nA mere specton later Yajaw Te' K'inich II appeared at the opening eyeing the king of Calakmul. Then his gaze settled on Ambrose as he fell to the floor. \"Forgive me Lord Cit-Chac-Coh! The messenger did not say that I was summoned by a god!\"\n\nYuknoom Ch'een II scoffed as he stared at Yajaw Te' K'inich II, \"a god I see no...\" he started then was quickly quieted by the tip of Roth's sword at his throat. The thing is no one had actually see Roth move. Then he saw that Ambrose was in his feline form.\n\n\"I suggest,\" Roth said a low growl in his throat. \"That you rethink your next words. I have no problem opening your throat as wide as I can for your insults!\" The king nodded as he looked at the sword at his throat.\n\nAmbrose sighed as he put a hand on Roth effectively stopping him from killing the king. Shaking his head he thought it's never easy.\n\nYuknoom Ch'een II swallowed hard as Roth eased the pressure off his sword at the king's throat. \"Forgive me Lord Cit-Chac-Coh! Your guise hides you so well we did not know. Are you here to stop us from taking this city? We were told that it was the time to attack.\"\n\n\"No, I am not here to stop you. I am only here to make sure you don't attack for another four of your days. After that time I must return then you can have the city. Until that time I would find it displeasing to have you even enter the city. I trust I can depend on you not attacking 'til then?\" Ambrose said smiling showing all of his teeth.\n\nBoth kings were rapidly nodding their heads, \"it will be as you say Lord Cit-Chac-Coh! We will not attack 'til then.\" Yajaw Te' K'inich II said as he went prostrate before Ambrose.\n\nLike wise Yuknoom Ch'een II was beside him also prostrate, \"you will have no problem with my warriors either Lord!\"\n\n\"Good! I'd hate to have you take the city with half as many of your warriors.\" Ambrose said a small smile on his face.\n\nBoth men looked at each other with a grimace. \"We will not forget Lord!\" Both men climbed to their feet standing before Ambrose hesitant to leave.\n\n\"You both may go.\" Ambrose said a soft growl issuing from his throat. Both Men bowed then scrambled out as they started to shout orders to all those there.\n\n\"Well,\" Ambrose told the rest of them. \"That went far better than I hoped for.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Twitty said as she and Glenna took up positions beside him. \"You do have a commanding presence mate. That plus being as handsome as you are.\"\n\nAmbrose just grunted at her comment, he thought he was far less handsome than she thought. Moving toward the fringe of the camp, Ambrose was surprised when an older soldier stood in his way.\n\n\"I for one do not believe the stories I have heard. Stand fast that I may know the truth!\" The older soldier said.\n\nAmbrose held his paw out to hold the others back. Smiling, he slowly drew his sword. A bit of practice would be good he thought!\n\nTen spectons later he was still smiling. The soldier was good, though not as good as Roth, still very good. Finally Roth sighed shaking his head, \"Really sire, we haven't the time for this! Just end it!\"\n\nThe soldier's eyes got large as Ambrose nodded then increased his speed, then twice as much. Pressing he soon had the soldier backing up only able to parry all of Ambrose's thrusts. Finally feigning high the going low Ambrose twisted the sword from the soldier's hands.\n\nFalling to the ground the man bowed his head. \"I concede defeat, you must be Cit-Chac-Coh! Only a god could have defeated me. My life is yours Lord.\"\n\n\"Arise warrior!\" Ambrose said. \"your time is not over yet. Though I do suggest you get better, One never knows when the gods might want another sparring session.\" With that Ambrose and the others moved off leaving the stunned man staring after them.\n\nThe man stood bowing his head again, thankful that he had the skill he had. Plus he thought he was glad that his actions had not angered the god Cit-Chac-Coh!\n\nRoth was shaking his head as they finally left the enemy camp. \"You were playing with him the whole time weren't you Sire?\"\n\nAmbrose nodded as he turned to Roth, \"Any practice I get helps Roth. Perhaps one day I can move more like you, and then I might not need the power as much.\"\n\nRoth smiled as he also nodded, \"that would be a grand day indeed as you still move slow sire. Then again you are a new swordsman.\" Ambrose narrowed his eyes then started to laugh he really was after all."
