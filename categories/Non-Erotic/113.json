        "This story is part of an ongoing series. The chronological order of my stories is now listed in WifeWatchman's biography.\n\nFeedback and constructive criticism is very much appreciated, and I encourage feedback for ideas.\n\nThis story contains graphic scenes, language and actions that might be extremely offensive to some people. These scenes, words and actions are used only for the literary purposes of this story. The author does not condone murder, racial language, violence, rape or violence against women, and any depictions of any of these in this story should not be construed as acceptance of the above.\n\nPart 16 - The Crime Scene\n\n4:00am, Saturday, February 11th. We were at the townhouse of the now-deceased Michael Burke.\n\n\"The neighbors are either irritated or enormously curious, sir.\" said Sergeant Rudistan. \"But no one in this building nor the ones in the area heard a shot. Not even any reports of a slamming door or car backfire.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised.\" I said. \"Detective Davis! Welcome to your first case. Tell me about this crime scene!\" Detective Jerome Davis had been called in by me, and had arrived quickly. I wanted to see how he'd react, and so far, so good: he had some nerves, of course, but he was also excited about getting this crack at a case, and he showed confidence, as well.\n\n\"Good grief.\" said Davis, looking closely at the entry wound. Then he went around to the exit wound, then looked around on the floor, and then the far wall, where there was a small hole. He then went and looked at the hole in the wall more closely, and the floor below it.\n\n\"Sir, there are two exit holes, side by side, you can see them if you look.\" said Jerome. \"There's no blood on the floor on the left side of the body, and there should be some if he was shot right there. And that hole on the wall looks like it was scraped or punched out... too much dust on the floor beneath it.\"\n\n\"And that means?\" I asked the young Detective.\n\n\"Sir, I don't think he was shot where he's sitting now.\" said Davis.\n\n\"Captain Ross,\" I said, \"that is excellent work by Detective Davis.\" Cindy nodded and gave Jerome a little smile. \"Anything else, Davis?\"\n\n\"Not without touching stuff, sir.\" said Jerome. \"Did I miss anything?\"\n\n\"Not really.\" I said. \"I'm noticing two things: First, if Michael had shot himself and was holding the gun loosely enough that it came out of his hand, then the backfire should've pushed the gun away from the chair. If he was death-gripping it enough to keep holding it, he should still be holding it. The gun right were it is doesn't quite fit either category.\"\n\n\"Also,\" I went on, \"maybe the first shot was from a small-caliber gun, maybe a .22 Magnum auto-pistol with silencer attached, and the second one by the .357 magnum. If that had been reversed, the second bullet would've followed the first's path, since it's smaller and would've bounced off the edges of the wound channel. As it is, the second bullet dug out fresh material and slightly altered its path. But that is damn good seeing that second wound, Davis.\"\n\n\"It's really that fake hole in the wall that got me, sir.\" said Davis. \"Why fake that? except to complete the picture they wanted us to see, maybe...\"\n\nAt that moment, Martha the M.E. arrived. \"Body is still warm.\" She said. \"Wound is... what the heck?\" She began noticing the exit wounds.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Oh my God.\" Todd said quietly as he looked at his father's face. Michael was now in a body bag on a gurney, and I'd allowed my nephew to look when he arrived. It was now 4:40am.\n\nTodd turned his head and put his hand over his eyes. \"First Jeanine, and now my dad.\" he said. \"Who is doing this, Uncle Don?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I said, \"but I don't think your dad's killers are the same as Jeanine's killers. Maybe connected to the same group, though.\"\n\nJust then, Jack Muscone and Martin Nash arrived. \"We just heard about it.\" Muscone said. \"What happened? Wasn't he being guarded?\"\n\n\"He wasn't shot here.\" I said. \"You can check the Crime Lab photos and video, and you'll see what Detective Davis saw.\" Muscone looked at digital photographs as I explained what had happened.\n\n\"So... where was he killed? When? And why?\" Nash asked.\n\n\"Why is easy: to keep him from talking to the FBI.\" I said. \"When? Recently, as in earlier this morning. Where? No... frickin'... idea.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" Cindy said, \"Myron just called. All cameras in the area blanked out earlier, as did those in River Valley subdivision. So maybe they had some kind of camera-jamming device, and took Michael to the golf course there.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" I said to myself. Then to Cindy I said \"That's very possible.\"\n\n\"What about the black velvet, sir?\" asked Cindy. I looked at the shawl, which had no blood on it, and was now in an evidence bag.\n\n\"It's a dodge.\" I said. \"But it was a stupid thing to do... this shows that someone with knowledge of the black velvet cases did this, either to get in my face, get my attention, or mislead me. Well, they have my attention.\"\n\n\"Why do you think that, sir?\" asked Cindy.\n\n\"Detective Davis, why do I think that?\"\n\n\"Because there was no blood on the shawl?\" offered Davis. \"It was put on him after they put him on the chair. That's all I can see.\"\n\n\"I don't know if it's beginner's luck,\" I said, \"but you are batting one thousand today, Davis. Here, hold this.\" I handed him the red crowbar. Davis looked stunned. Still he examined the red crowbar, tapped it in his hands.\n\n\"Feels good, sir.\" Davis said.\n\n\"You may get one just like it if you keep this up.\" I replied. I saw Cindy go over and fist-bump Jermaine.\n\n\"This is... awful.\" said Detective Nash. \"The Director is going to tan my hide over this.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not.\" said the Deputy Director of the FBI as he came into the room. \"But I do want to know what happened, and how they got to him.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I said, \"let me and my people wrap this scene up, and then we'll talk about it in my office, or over breakfast, whichever you prefer.\"\n\n\"You're getting to be like Tanya Perlman.\" Cindy said. \"Eating after looking at a crime scene like this.\" Jack Muscone laughed about as heartily as I'd ever heard him laugh. The DepDirector looked as if the joke had gone over his head.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWe went to the Country Breakfast Diner, arriving just before it opened. Jack Colby let us in, anyway. While waiting in the private back room for the food to get out, I told the FBI Agents what was going on.\"\n\n\"Captain Ross and I got an alert that the Psychology Building alarm had gone off. Since that is where my wife's office is, we went down there and searched the place. Once again, it was probably perps looking for Ned's drugs... but not finding them, as they no longer exist. Fortunately, there was no damage; I think we got there pretty early.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" I continued, \"we can now say that was a distraction. While we were busy, someone managed to get Michael Burke to leave his home without telling anyone, and they took off with him, using some device to kill all our cameras.\"\n\nCindy had been well-taught to never mention our own bug-killer devices, so she said nothing as I continued: \"So they shot him, twice, with different guns, then took his body and one of the guns back to his apartment.\"\n\n\"And nobody saw anything.\" said the Deputy Director.\n\n\"It's possible that all the streetlights were taken out, as well as the cameras.\" Cindy said.\n\n\"That's a good thought.\" I said.\n\n\"Do I get to hold the red crowbar?\" Cindy asked, perhaps jokingly.\n\n\"Of course not.\" I replied witheringly. \"That's why I gave you the green one. Jerome surprised me at how good he was. I know you're that good.\" Cindy blushed, but smiled happily at the compliment.\n\n\"What bothers me,\" said the DepDirector, \"is that this man was in danger, and he knew it. We gave him one of those 'life-alert' type buttons he could push, like the one you have in your belt, Don. Why didn't he press it?\"\n\n\"Maybe he did.\" Jack Muscone said.\n\n\"Those things cut through just about any dampening field, as the Commander well knows.\" said the DepDirector. \"We also had surveillance on the townhouse. So what does that tell, you, Don?\"\n\n\"It tells me you are thinking he snuck out willingly.\" I said. \"And you want me to agree with that hypothesis. And right now, I don't have anything to suggest disagreement. By the way, your guys watching the back of the townhouses... it's almost impossible to really watch. It'd be easy enough to sneak in or out... and even to carry a body into the place.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\" said the DepDirector.\n\n\"What about that velvet shawl?\" asked Muscone. \"We've been monitoring those murder cases, and are looking to see if any similar ones occurred outside your State. You don't think this is related to them?\"\n\n\"Only in that I'm investigating those cases, and the shawl was left just for my benefit.\" I said. \"I don't believe the same person nor group is behind the Black Velvet serial killings and also the Burke killings.\"\n\nThe DepDirector was sitting there, lost in thought. Cindy's eyebrows arched up as she watched him; now I knew how it felt to watch someone else go into a reverie. Finally, he came out of it and looked over at me.\n\n\"Sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Commander, let's you and I speak outside while these guys eat.\" said the DepDirector. We went straight out the back door, which was normally only an emergency exit.\n\nOnce outside, the DepDirector said \"One other thing just occurred to me. Maybe whoever came to pick up Burke told him that he could go avenge his son Jack's death, maybe by attacking your wife.\"\n\nI nodded. \"It's a thought, sir.\" I said. \"But I think he'd be skeptical if it was someone pretending to be the FBI and then saying that.\"\n\n\"My point exactly.\" said the DepDirector. \"Your wife was distracted along with you, since it was her office that was broken into and the alarm set off. Then they go and get Burke.\"\n\n\"I can raise a lot of objections to this, sir.\" I said. \"But since we're out here alone, let me ask you to consider that if someone came to his door, flashed an FBI badge and said they were taking him and Todd to safety because of a possible threat, and maybe that threat is from a former CIA Deputy Director... he might go with them, and not press the panic button.\"\n\n\"And that means?\"\n\n\"You have a mole, a traitor, within your FBI ranks, Mr. Director.\" I said.\n\nPart 17 - Maximum Coverage\n\nAlthough I did not want to do it, I felt the need to give a Press Conference. I thought I would get questions about Michael Burke. But then I realized that I should not be surprised that the Press was only interested in sex and scandal.\n\n\"Commander, are teachers and students having sex at Walnut Prep?\" yelled Priya Ajmani in the Press Room.\n\n\"I have no idea.\" I said. \"And I'm not investigating that, though others are.\"\n\nJohn Hardwood then bulled his way in: \"But the autopsy report shows Ms. Holmes and Rob Dortmund had sex. So aren't you lying when you answered Priya's question that way.\"\n\n\"Listen, jerk, if you accuse me of lying again, I'll have you thrown out of my Police Station.\" I said angrily. \"Or maybe I'll arrest you.\" That shocked the room into near-silence.\n\n\"But just so we're clear, here.\" I said, raising my voice to make sure all could hear, \"it is my belief, based upon the autopsy of this case as well as other Black Velvet cases we've found, that Rob Dortmund and Lenora Holmes were kidnapped and forced to have sex. So you cannot reasonably extrapolate from the forced sex that any other teachers or students are having sex at Walnut Prep nor anywhere else... and it would be dishonest journalism to make that extrapolation and say it on the air. In fact, it might be libel. I know you in the Media don't care if what you report is the truth or not, and one day you'll be made to pay in Court for your lies. But you can't say I haven't told you on this matter.\"\n\nAfter a moment of hatred-filled silence, Priya finally stepped up to ask: \"So you're saying that students and teachers are not having sex at Walnut Prep?\"\n\n\"You're trying to put words into my mouth that I neither said or implied.\" I replied. \"And I'm getting a bit tired of KSTD's dishonest journalism and attempt to ask trick questions here. Okay, someone besides KSTD want to ask an honest question?\" The room remained quiet... as if they didn't know what an 'honest question' was.\n\nFinally Bettina Wurtzburg spoke up: \"So, Commander, you believe these black velvet cases are a serial killer at work?\"\n\n\"Yes, Bettina.\" I said. \"We're just beginning to uncover past murders with similar patterns. As we develop the cases we'll know more.\"\n\n\"Commander, Tim Sioban, KSB News in the City.\" shouted Tim. I nodded at him. \"A number of these black velvet cases have been found to be around the City. Do you think the Black Velvet Killer is from the City, or in it now?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" I said. \"I would caution residents of the City and its suburbs to be careful, though. Now that this is coming out in the news, this serial killer may strike again, just to get more publicity for himself.\"\n\n\"You're sure it's a man?\" sneered John Hardwood. \"Your last serial killer was the Black Widow, a woman, who killed one of your cops.\" I heard muffled gasps from the room. Hardwood had stepped over the line, even by the media's standards (such as they are).\n\n\"I'd say from the semen in Lenora Holmes's vagina that this serial killer is a man.\" I replied, not rising to Hardwood's bait. \"Yes, Bettina?\"\n\nBettina asked \"Commander, a black velvet shawl was found wrapped around Michael Burke's body. Is he considered one of the serial killer cases?\"\n\n\"It's way too early to draw such conclusions.\" I said. \"But I will say that his death does not fit the serial killer's patterns.\"\n\n\"What are those patterns?\" asked Meredith Peller.\n\n\"Obviously I cannot and will not talk about details like that, especially at this early stage.\" I said. \"Only that people need to be aware of their surroundings.\"\n\n\"Commander,\" said Priya, \"were Jeanine Burke and Michael Burke killed by the same person or persons?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Priya.\" I said. \"If I did, that would mean I knew who they were, and I'd be going after them now instead of standing here talking to you.\"\n\n\"The FBI was supposed to be protecting Michael Burke.\" said John Hardwood. \"And they obviously failed at their job. Can you elaborate on that?\"\n\n\"I don't accept the premises of your question, and you'll have to ask them about anything to do with their role regarding Mr. Burke.\" I replied.\n\n\"Sir, is Michael Burke's son Todd a potential target of these killers?\" asked Meredith Peller. \"After all, wasn't there an assassination attempt upon him last year?\"\n\n\"There was an attempt last year, but we believe that was Pastor Raymond Westboro's work.\" I replied. \"We have advised Mr. Todd Burke to take precautions, and he is doing so, but we do not believe there is a specific threat against Todd Burke nor his family.\"\n\n\"Does that family include you, Commander?\" snarled John Hardwood. \"Are you a possible target?\"\n\n\"As much as you hope that is true, Mr. Hardwood,\" I said, \"I tend to doubt it. But if you want to be hired as my personal bodyguard and take a bullet for me, we can arrange that.\"\n\nThat offended Hardwood and the Media snowflakes, and pretty much concluded the press conference.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Those Media people are absolutely dis-gust-ing.\" said Chief Moynahan as we sat in his office, along with Della Harlow.\n\n\"But useful.\" I said. \"Walnut Prep now has some counter to the Media's attempts to generate a scandal.\"\n\n\"Might not make a difference.\" said Della. \"It is very unlikely that any proof of sexual relations between students and teachers will come up, unless someone snitches, and so far every person that has been questioned has immediately taken the Fifth. Parents are also strongly objecting to us talking to their minor children without their permission, which they aren't giving.\"\n\n\"But the problem,\" Della continued, \"is that people aren't waiting for the proof. Over one third of Walnut Prep's students have been taken out of the school and are enrolling at other schools now, and I'd expect a lot more to follow. The Walnut Prep people can't sustain themselves at those loss rates.\"\n\n\"True.\" I said. \"It's likely this will kill them. They'll have to close their doors, maybe start again elsewhere under a new name.\"\n\n\"Okayyyyy,\" said the Chief. \"So, this serial killer... this won't be solved today, will it, Mr. Crowbarrrr?\"\n\n\"No sir.\" I said. \"I have the bad feeling that we're just getting started on this one...\"\n\nPart 18 - A Matter of Family\n\nOn Sunday, February 12th, Todd and Barry Oliver went down to State Women's Prison, where Todd told Eleanor Burke that Michael Burke was dead. Teresa kept the kids at The Cabin, along with Cindy and Molly and her boys. Laura and my mom kept Carole and Jim at the Mountain Nest, along with Buddy and Bowser. It had been generally decided to minimize contact between little Jack Burke and Bowser... too much mutual dislike, there.\n\nAs for me, I was flying west in an FBI-provided jet, similar to the ones of superlative comfort that my wife had provided us in the past when such transportation was needed. With me was FBI Special Agent in Charge Clark Webster, head of the Missing Persons Bureau in our region.\n\n\"We'll have a couple of Agents from the L.A. Missing Persons Bureau join us when we get there.\" said Clark. \"And you said you have a couple of friends in the LAPD?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I said. \"Both used to work with me in the TCPD. As it's their jurisdiction, they'll take the lead in getting the kid back, then the FBI can cover it when we bring him home.\"\n\n\"And we got the warrant from the Federal Judge, as well.\" said Webster.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWe were met at the airport by Lieutenant Claire Michaels of the LAPD's Major Crimes Division. Our MCD encompasses all non-Vice crimes; theirs is for the really big stuff. Claire came up and gave me a very warm hug, which I returned.\n\n\"You're looking great!\" I said.\n\n\"So are you, Commander.\" Claire said, then added with a grin: \"And rocking Captain Ross's world in the Police Boxing Matches, I heard.\" I could not help but smile at that.\n\n\"Ah yes, bucket list item crossed off.\" I said. \"So how is LA?\"\n\n\"Very exciting.\" Claire said. \"It's Sunday, but some of my people will be in the office, and they want to meet you.\"\n\n\"Uh oh.\" I said. \"You didn't tell them all the bad stories, did you?\" Claire laughed.\n\n\"Maybe a few.\" she said.\n\nI introduced Clark Webster, who then said he was going to the FBI offices to check in with their people. Claire and I went to LAPD's headquarters.\n\nOnce admitted to the controlled areas, Claire brought me in to an open area with a lot of desks. Our MCD, but much bigger.\n\n\"This is Lieutenant Tal Shiarr, our I.T. and Data expert.\" Claire said. I shook hands with a bald Asian man, very tall for an Asian at that.\n\n\"And this is Lieutenant Provino, who's the boss of bosses around here.\" said Claire. Provino was short, stocky, had graying hair, and his way of talking reminded me of Chief Moynahan.\n\n\"Ah, so at last we meet the famous Iron Crow-barrrr.\" said Provino. \"Oh yes, we heard about that Moriarty type fellow you took down... solved about six of our outstanding cases out here.\"\n\n\"Glad I could help.\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, and you know this ball of fire.\" said Claire. I barely had enough time to brace for impact when Lorena Rose practically jumped into my arms.\n\n\"Commander! Its so good to see you!\" Lorena said as she hugged me. I hugged her back.\n\n\"You too, Lorena.\" I said. \"And what, Detective Sergeant now?\"\n\n\"And up for Lieutenant soon.\" said Claire. \"In Vice, though.\"",
        "\"And this is our Captain, Mary Raytheon.\" said Claire. A tallish, prim woman was coming up to us. She was attractive but rather severe looking, and wore rather thick glasses. Her legs weren't bad, though. (Not that I was looking, of course ;o) ).\n\n\"Ah, so nice to meet you, Commander.\" said Captain Raytheon. \"Lieutenant Michaels has kept us apprised of everything you've done in your State.\"\n\n\"Only the good things, I hope.\" I said as I shook her hand.\n\n\"Of course.\" she said. \"So Lieutenant Michaels, you're going on this raid after dark?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" said Claire.\n\n\"And Commander Troy is working as part of the FBI on this?\" asked the Captain.\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" said the Captain. \"Keep me in the loop on everything.\" She then went back to her office.\n\n\"So, Commannderrr,\" said Lt. Provino, \"where does your rank fit amongst ours?\"\n\n\"My Police Force is much smaller than yours.\" I said. \"I'm second-in-command, after the Chief. Operations Officer, if you will. Our Deputy Chief is like the XO.\"\n\n\"We have a 'Commander' rank, too.\" said Lt. Tal Shiarr. \"It's up there, but it's not quite as high as our Deputy Chiefs and the Chief.\n\nI saw the whiteboards on the wall of their office space. \"To the extent you can tell me, what are you guys working on?\"\n\n\"White supremacy group, at the moment.\" said Claire.\n\n\"Oh?\" I asked, surprised. \"I've been working with the FBI on one of those, too.\" That generated some interest.\n\n\"These guys have been trying to smuggle arms and explosives through the Port of LA.\" said Claire. \"We find a number of the scruffy redneck types, but then we've found a very well-organized business group behind them. Bankers, lawyers, businessmen and -women. And they're starting to run for political offices, like Pastor Westboro was on the Town Council.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" I said. \"This background group have a name?\" Everyone looked uncomfortable for a minute, then Claire spoke up.\n\n\"It's okay, guys.\" she said. \"Commander Troy may know more than we do about some of it. He's been working with the Feds.\"\n\n\"You'll have to exxx-cuse us, Commander, if it seems like we're not trusting you.\" said Provino.\n\n\"I fully understand.\" I said. \"But maybe I can help.\" I walked up to the whiteboards and looked them over, feeling the eyes on me. Finally I pointed to three people, who were nowhere close to each other on the boards. \"Check these three out for connections to each other.\"\n\n\"They're pretty small fish.\" said Lt. Shiarr.\n\n\"That's what they want you to think.\" I said. Shiarr went to his computer. Claire Michaels was already on hers.\n\n\"What are we looking for?\" asked Shiarr.\n\n\"See if they were in the same places at the same times.\" I said. \"Look at pharmacies, doctors offices, clinics, hospitals, and the like. Tap into the FBI's facial recognition software if need be.\"\n\n\"Oh wow, you are connected.\" said Provino. \"Do you know what hoops we have to go through to get access to that? Especially since our last Captain, whose husband is an FBI agent, left us for greeeener pastures?\"\n\n\"Well, marriage is one way to cultivate a relationship with the FBI.\" I said with a grin. \"I went with the expedient of buying one of their agents the double cheeseburgers that he likes a lot.\" Claire Michaels laughed, understanding.\n\n\"Oh my God.\" said Lt. Tal Shiarr, looking at his screen. \"You're right, Commander. Those three have been meeting at parks near a hospital and a clinic.\" He called in Captain Raytheon.\n\n\"Oh my.\" she said, looking at the data. \"Let's get some surveillance on that. And on those three.\"\n\n\"Commander Troy made the connection, ma'am.\" said Provino. Captain Raytheon peered at me.\n\n\"How did you manage that, Commander?\" she asked with some wonder in her voice.\n\n\"Their profiles on your whiteboards.\" I said. \"Those three are diabetic. They could use that as an excuse to meet at medical facilities, exchange information, and such. It was a longshot, but sometimes those work out.\"\n\n\"Sometimes means 'a lot of the time' for the Iron Crowbar.\" said Claire Michaels, who was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. Whatever stories she had been telling her fellow LAPD Officers had just been proven and vindicated, I realized.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAs the sun set over the Pacific Ocean, we prepared for the mission. I was in all black, with armor under and over my black shirt, and of course in the lining of my trenchcoat. I had on the ubiquitous Tilley hat (Lt. Provino had loved that; he had a fisherman's hat himself) and of course the red crowbar. Claire and Lorena Rose were dressed in LA SWAT gear, and Webster and the FBI agents in armor with light jackets over it, which had \"FBI\" on the back in large letters.\n\n\"This is not a good neighborhood we're going into.\" said Claire. \"Lots of Hispanic gang activity. We're going in fast, and we're getting out fast. Shouldn't be a problem, as long as we don't dawdle.\"\n\n\"Roger that.\" I said.\n\nWe pulled up to the three-story tenement building. Claire led the way, me following, then the others. On the second floor, we were about to round the corner when Claire had us stop and crouch.\n\nA young Hispanic man, slender with a small mustache, tattooed, and mean looking, was coming up the hall from the other side. He stopped and knocked on the door, which happened to be the room we were interested in.\n\nA woman opened the door and as I peered over Claire to see, I recognized her: she was Vivian Schultz Towson, who'd taken Greg Towson's child out of my jurisdiction!\n\nThe young man went inside with her. When the door shut, Claire raced up. She had a device that could be fed under a door crack to see what was going on inside. The camera (which was recording) showed the man give the woman a roll of money, then he turned to a little boy at the other end of the room, who was cowering on the floor. \"I'm gonna get some fresh ass now, little boy.\" the mean looking man said.\n\nThat was enough for me. I had Claire move back, then I jimmied open the door with the crowbar. As it splintered, I slammed against the door and it gave way. \n\nTime slowed down.\n\nThe woman was beginning to scream and I saw the young man turn toward me. I heard the *click!* of a switchblade knife locking into place. This might cause some people to pause, but I was already in unavoidable motion, and I was swinging my crowbar at his hand. It connected with his hand and wrist. The switchblade fell to the floor.\n\nI was all over the guy in a flash. He knew some moves, though. He expected me to try to take him down as any cop would, and his moves would've delivered powerful punishment. But I had trained to defeat Cindy Ross in the Police Boxing Matches, and I had no interest in taking him down. I was just trying to beat the living shit out of him with the crowbar... and I was succeeding. I got in several good blows to the sides, the hips, and one to the face.\n\n*THWACK!* \n\nWhen I did take him down, I brought the crowbar down as hard as I could onto his back, as I had Sergei Molotov (the first time). I knew he'd feel that one and his back would spasm in an hour or so. Then I put my knee on his neck and jaw, pressing down with all my weight, as an LAPD Officer affixed cuffs to his hands behind his wrist.\n\nMeanwhile, Claire had taken down Vivian Towson, who had been going by the name 'Vivian Leigh'... her first and middle names. Lorena went up to little Mike Towson, now eight years old. \"Hey Mikey. I'm Lorena, with the Police, we're here to help you.\"\n\n\"Get this piece of garbage out of here.\" I said, about the man.\n\n\"Do you know who just whipped your ass, amigo?\" Vivian shouted at him. \"The Iron Crowbar! That's the Iron Crowbar, Commander Donald Troy from my home town! Tell your fellow gangbangers who he is!\" Claire was trying to shut her up, but Vivian just kept screaming my name as she was dragged out.\n\n\"Iron Crowbar, eh?\" the man says. \"You'll be hearing from us again.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do hope so. Bring... it... on.\" I said menacingly, waving my crowbar at him, being sure to show no fear to his face. I think he was surprised at my bravado... nobody ever 'fronted the gangbangers like that.\n\n\"Hi, Mike.\" I said, going up to the boy, who was looking fearful. \"I'm with the same Police Department as your dad and your uncle.\" The boy's eyes widened and brightened.\n\n\"You're the Iron Crowbar?\" he asked, astonishing me.\n\n\"Yes, one and the same.\" I said, exhibiting the red crowbar. \n\n\"What did you do to my mommy?\" the boy asked.\n\n\"Your mommy did some bad things, Mike.\" I said. \"She was not supposed to take you away from your dad.\"\n\n\"Mommy said my daddy hates me.\" said the boy. \"She said he never wanted to see me again.\"\n\n\"That's one of the bad things she did... she lied to you.\" I said. \"Your dad is a good guy, and he loves you, and he wants to see you again. So we're going to take you back home again, okay?\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWe were boarding the FBI jet at John Wayne Airport. I hugged Claire Michaels goodbye. \"Lorena is going with you.\" Claire said. \"To help with Mike, and with legal issues on that end. Come back to see us. My boss was very impressed with you.\"\n\n\"I'll come see you, for sure.\" I said. \"And it seems your White Supremacy groups and mine may be similar. Maybe we can wipe both of them out at the same time.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAs we neared County Airport, I came up to Mikey, who was sitting by Lorena, and sat down in the empty seat next to him.\n\n\"Hey Mikey,\" I said, \"we're going to take you to see your dad. He's a Fireman now, and your uncle is a policeman like me. You'll be staying with him now, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay, Mr. Iron Crowbar.\" Mikey said.\n\n\"Your dad hasn't seen you in a long time, so you be patient with him while y'all get to know each other, okay?\" I said. Mikey nodded.\n\n\"My wife is a doctor,\" I said, \"and she has a friend who is a very good doctor. His name is Dr. Yates. He's going to check you out to make sure you're okay, and he's going to talk to you, so you talk with him and give him the best answers you can, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay.\" said Mikey.\n\nIt was 11:30am, Monday, February 13th, when we landed at County Airport. I called the Duty Desk and told them to have Cindy come pick me and Mikey up at the airport, and to have Patrolman Louie Towson meet us at his brother's Fire Station. Fire Chief Quinlin was also contacted.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Hey, Louie, what are you doing here?\" Greg Towson asked.\n\n\"They called me and told me to come here.\" said Louie Towson.\n\nThe Superintendent came up. \"The Chief just called. He'll be here in a minute. You guys just hold tight.\n\nA moment later, two vehicles came up: the Fire Chief's car, and the Police Commander's Police SUV. Fire Chief Quinlin came up to the open garage door. \"Hey Towson!\" he called out. \"Somebody's here to see you!\"\n\nAs Greg Towson came up, he saw his eight-year-old son come out from behind the group of adults.\n\n\"Mikey?... Mikey?!?!\" he gushed. The boy ran into his arms as he went to his knees, and they hugged for a long moment. Word passed through the Fire Station what was going on. Firemen began applauding. Some began filming with their iPhones, which Cindy had been doing from Minute 1. Then Louie Towson came up and gave his nephew a hug.\n\n\"How... how did... who found you?\" Greg Towson asked.\n\n\"That would be the Iron Crowbar's doing.\" said Fire Chief Quinlin... saying it a bit more loudly than he needed to. \"He found your boy, and then he went and got him. Took him away from some rough customers, from what I hear.\"\n\nI'd stayed back, but now felt Cindy pushing me forward as Towson came up to me.\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you.\" he said, tears streaming down his face. He gave me a big bear hug, and I hugged him back.\n\n\"Thank me by raising him right.\" I said. Then Louie Towson came up to me, and his handshake turned into a hug as he almost broke down. Lorena Rose was openly crying, and Cindy was losing the battle, as well.\n\n\"Okay, guys,\" said Quinlin to the Towson brothers, \"we're going to take Mike to the hospital for a checkup. Dr. Yates will meet us there. You can ride with me, Ms. Rose.\"\n\nAs they got into the Fire Chief's car, and Louie Towson into his Police cruiser, Mikey suddenly ran over to me and hugged my legs. \"Thank you for bringing me home, Mr. Iron Crowbar.\"\n\n\"My pleasure, Mikey.\" I said. \"Remember to be patient with your dad.\" Mike ran back to the car and got in.\n\nAs I was about to get into the Police SUV, I heard a roar of applause from the Fire Station. The Firemen were all clapping, and shouting \"Thank you, Iron Crowbar!\" at me. I waved at them in recognition.\n\nAs I drove, Cindy was in the shotgun seat. Tears were running down her cheeks. \"Don... I've always been proud as hell to be your partner, and your cousin... but never more proud than today.\"\n\nNow I had to work to keep from being emotional. \"Just doing my job, to the extent I'm able.\" I said. \"I was able to right a wrong, and help my people. It's what I was put here to do.\"\n\nThat was one agenda item down, I thought to myself. Now I've got a serial killer to catch, a White Supremacy group to take down with terminal prejudice, a Black Militant group to likewise take down... oh, and one more small item... a mistake I made, that needs correcting.\n\nAs we drove, a country song came on the radio. It somehow was appropriate for this moment:\n\n\"Every word of every song that he sang was for you,<br> In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon, what could you do?\n\nBlack velvet and that little boy's smile,<br> Black velvet with that slow southern style,<br> A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees,<br> Black velvet, if you please...\"<br> ------ Alannah Myles, \"Black Velvet\"\n\nFinis... for now...
