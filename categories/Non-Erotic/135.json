Last thing he remembered he was in the damnable bio-bed. Trying to move his arms and legs provided him with a moment of panic as neither would move! 'Ah crap,' he thought, 'what had happened now?' \n\nMita Shiloh was a little worried about the readings that she understood. Apparently Derrick wasn't in that good of shape. His whole nervous system was reacting violently to whatever he'd been exposed to. \"Can this med station drain excess energy from the body?\" She asked of Tempro. \"According to what I am seeing his entire system is going into shut down.\" \n\nA shocked Tempro appeared seeing that what she had stated was in fact true. \"I am initiating energy drain procedure now. Thank you Mrs. Shiloh,\" Tempro said hanging his head. \"I'm afraid that had you not discovered this he might have ceased. Are you a Doctor of biological entities?\" \n\nMita shook her head no as she watched the critical readings start to decrease. \"No, Tempro is it?\" When Tempro nodded she continued. \"I was new to nursing when I met Gunter. I had volunteered when the Republic wars started. I had treated a great many when a Doctor I was working with suggested I should further my knowledge. I started studying for the next four years.\" \n\n\"So you posses half the knowledge then,\" Tempro asked. \n\n\"Perhaps, though I haven't seen machines that can take as detailed readings as these.\" Something gained her attention that she studied a few moments. Looking up with a questioning look she pointed to the readings. \"Tempro, according to these readings his body processes are at thirty five to forty percent. Have you seen this before?\" \n\n\"Yes Mrs. Shiloh I have. They are almost the same as the Empress's are. I have seen his fluctuate many times though I've have never had a chance to scan him this long.\" An almost shocked Tempro told her. \n\n\"So, for all intents and purposes he is an engineered human as she is.\" Mita stated. \n\n\"It appears so, though his readings are in flux as I said. It is almost as if he is a normal human that was enhanced. Though it has only been the last year that those enhancements have seemed to start to take effect.\" Tempro told Mita. \n\nQuiet a moment Mita was in deep thought then nodded, \"What changed in the last year besides he became emperor?\" \n\n\"He built a brain enhancer that I was told could have killed him. It may be possible that the stimulus to several areas of his brain may have activated the enhancements permanently.\" A perplexed Tempro replied. \n\nLooking over the readings Mita was nodding her head looking over everything that she could understand. \"It appears that you are correct though as to exactly what enhancements remains to be seen.\" With a sigh Mita nodded to Tempro. It appears the extra energy is almost gone, though I am afraid that there might be residual energy left. We have to make sure we get it all.\" \n\nTempro also nodded then dropped his voice. \"Mrs. Shiloh, I have been going over all the readings from Shelly.\" Tempro said hesitating. \n\nMita turned toward Tempro seeing the hesitation, started to fear what Tempro was going to say. \"Have you found a possible way to help her?\" \n\nTempro dropped his head, \"No, not yet, though I think I have discovered what is happening to her. After we discovered what we did about the emp... the commander. I think I have a better idea, also a possible way to help her. I am afraid though I am going to have to wait for him to wake up.\" \n\nSighing Mita nodded, \"I just hope that we can use him to help her I...\" \n\n\"You know it's kind of rude to talk about someone when they are in the same room,\" came a raspy male voice behind them. \n\n\"Sir!\" Tempro said as he started to adjust the machines. \n\n\"So I am an enhanced human? Damn! So Shelby really is a perfect match for me.\" A steadily growing stronger Derrick said. \n\n\"Yes sir, it would appear so. Though at the moment I can't actually tell you how long you have been like this.\" Tempro replied. \n\n\"Obviously it's been a long time. At least since I was a child, I have no memory of a procedure like that as an adult.\" Derrick told both there. \n\n\"Yes sir, though I am detecting that you have at least three sets of nanomites within you. The oldest set seems to have over ridden the other two sets. Both the other two sets seem to be continuing to maintain the enhancements.\" Tempro informed Derrick. \n\nWith a sigh Derrick nodded, \"It appears that my family owes me an explanation when we get back. I want to get back to our time as soon as we can.\" \n\nAgain Tempro shook his head, \"I'm afraid we can't right now.\" When Derrick gave Tempro a questioning look Mita jumped in. \n\n\"It's Shelly isn't it?\" A now even more worried Mita said. \n\nTempro and Derrick turned toward Mita as her tears started. \"I'm afraid so Mrs. Shiloh. We have to solve this before we can travel forward. From all I have seen this would start her on another episode like before. I am afraid that even the Second lieutenant wouldn't be able to bring her out of it.\" \n\n\"So you think there is a way to help delay what is happening to her?\" Derrick asked. \n\n\"I believe so sire, though I am afraid that it's going to take a bit of time. I going to need to scan you more... sir\" Tempro told them both. \n\n\"Alright let's get started the sooner the better,\" Derrick replied. __________________________________________________________ \n\nShelby was pacing as she was watching Rayburn and Kimison go through a mountain of information. Suddenly Kimison started to shout as both Rayburn and Shelby ran to see. \"YES! I'm picking up energy readings that can only be Tempro.\" \n\nRayburn was staring at the events that were unfolding then noticed the slight trans-warp energy. \"By god! He really could do it! Question is why haven't they come back. They were the last ones.\" \n\n\"Run a scan to see if you are detecting any damage from Tempro. They might not be able to return just yet.\" Shelby told both of them. \n\nNodding, their hands were suddenly flying over the consoles. Watching she saw that they were being as through as they could. Though she'd only learned the time theory a day ago she was quickly catching on to what they were searching for. \n\n\"According to this it was almost four or so years ago. It appears that the last of the disjointed time events are finally where they should be. It appears that they fixed everything,\" looking at Rayburn he saw that the man was frowning. \"Are you detecting anything?\" \n\nNodding Rayburn had a grimace on his face, \"I am detecting energy from a damaged ship. The only problem is it was from Shelby!\" \n\nShelby's hands were suddenly to her mouth as a worried look came over her face. \"I hope she's alright, we can't afford to lose her, not now!\" Then they thought they heard her whispering, \"Please be alright my sister.\" \n\n__________________________________________________________ \n\nLucie Hartwell was confounded; she and the empress had gone over so many things to no avail. Sighing she shook her head she wasn't about to go to her brother, he'd probably spank her again. Though she loved and had missed him dearly she didn't think she could risk the humiliation again. \n\nSitting or rather hiding in her room she was at the end of her rope with what to do. Sighing she arose to go to her brother. The empress was far too busy to help her right now. She'd just reached the door when her head snapped to the side as she concentrated. \n\n\"Hello? I can hear you, can you me?\" A slow look of worry started to dominate her features as she tried to concentrate harder. Not noticing she had walked out the door starting down the corridor. \"I can hear you please tell me you can hear me!\" It was at that moment that Joseph Hartwell came around the corner spying his sister wandering aimlessly. Then he noticed the distant look on her face and the tears. \n\n\"Lucie? Are you alright?\" Johnathon asked then was shocked when she walked right past him! Reaching out he grabbed Lucie's shoulders spinning her around. \"Lucie talk to me!\" \n\nHe could hear her mumbling but still wasn't able to get through. \"Oh please,\" Lucie was saying a flood of tears falling from her eyes. Suddenly she turned her head again, \"Yes! I hear you! I'll try to get you as soon as possible!\" With that she broke from her brother at a run for the control room, Johnathon right behind her. \n\n\"Get all information that you can,\" Lucie heard the Empress say. \n\n\"EMPRESS!\" Lucie was shouting as she ran into the room. \"I need Sherry again! I heard another one! He is so weak though I am afraid I might not make it in time.\" \n\n\"Go now!\" Shelby immediately shouted watching as Lucie vanished to Sherry. \n\nA startled Johnathon could only stare at the spot where his sister had been standing. No matter how many times he saw it, he wasn't sure he'd ever get used to someone using the IMT. \n\nSomeone cleared their throat breaking Johnathon out of his thoughts. \"You aren't allowed to be here Admiral.\" Shelby told him with a slight frown, and then her features softened when she saw the look of concern on his face. \"I know you're concerned Admiral, she'll be fine believe me. The bond she started with Sherry will ensure Sherry keeps her safe.\" \n\nSighing Johnathon nodded still staring at the spot. \"I'm sorry Empress; I have so little to do since I was removed from command. I feel as if I'll go crazy.\" \n\nShelby thought a moment then called Celeste. \"Yes Empress?\" \n\n\"Have you detected any of the two people I gave you the parameters for?\" Shelby asked of Celeste. \n\n\"No Empress,\" Celeste said her head dropping. \"I have nothing to report. I am sorry that I have failed you Empress, I will...\" \n\nShelby cut Celeste off by raising her hand, \"I am not surprised Celeste. These men are experts at hiding as they have been doing it for quite some time. I suggest that you work with Admiral Hartwell here though I am only allowing him access to the sensors. Nothing else Admiral I'd hate for Derrick to find you in a holding cell when he returned.\" \n\nHartwell's eyes lit up, \"Yes Empress thank you! At least now I won't die of boredom!\" An excited Hartwell said. \n\nShelby's eyes narrowed as she stared at Hartwell. \"I mean it Admiral; I will not hesitate to throw you in a cell. I also suggest you don't push me on this either. Derrick already informed me of how sneaky you can be.\" Shelby stared harder at Hartwell as he now had an innocent look on his face. Yeah she thought she'd better keep a good eye on him. \n\n__________________________________________________________ \n\nGreeson was sitting on the mats deep in meditation. He'd not seen Dempsy for a few days now, Greeson was almost afraid that the man was through with him. So intent was Greeson that he almost missed when Dempsy entered the room. \n\nLaying back completely on the mat Greeson felt the swift blow barely miss him. Springing up Greeson smiled at Dempsy. \"It is good to see you again master.\" \n\n\"You were careless! I should have killed you! If I catch you that detached again I will kill you on the spot. Always be aware of where you are and what is around you. Now start!\" Dempsy said with a scowl on his face. \n\nGlancing toward the door Dempsy was hoping the favor he'd finally got to ask the Empress for would happen. Hardly paying attention Dempsy felt Greeson get almost all the way through his defenses. Damn it! This was distracting him to the point Greeson might even get through his defenses. \n\nSighing Dempsy knew that without the extra element Greeson would never get faster or better. True the man was very good now; Dempsy felt that he was finally ready to learn the techniques of the master, well at least start to. \n\nA movement by the door had Dempsy nodding, finally! Even as he watched Mara Collie walked into the training area. Stopping a moment Dempsy nodded to her then turned back to Greeson who was smiling like a fool. \n\n\"I guess I'm going to kill you today now that you appear to be a complete fool!\" Dempsy said as he swiftly attacked Greeson. Greeson snapped out of his euphoria countering all of Dempsy's attacks. Suddenly he felt rather than saw that Dempsy had increased his speed even more, though the shocking thing was he was actually keeping up with him! \n\nDempsy was nodding it was about time they trained at a respectable speed! Greeson was starting to sweat he'd never gone this fast before, though it was almost as if he could feel where the blows were going to be long before they actually got there. Then to his dismay Dempsy increased more to the point Greeson couldn't follow the blows with his eyes. Suddenly Greeson was flying through the air towards the wall at an accelerated speed. \n\nBouncing off the wall Greeson saw to his horror that he was heading straight for Mara! Shifting his weight he was suddenly tumbling on the mat away from Mara! Dempsy was trying to hide his smile; Greeson had finally learned to shift his weight though if he could keep doing it remained to be seen. \n\nGreeson rolled to a stop then sprang up beside Mara, \"Are you alright? I was afraid I would collide with you! God I'm so sorry Mara.\" \n\nMara was in shock, what in the world was he talking about? They were moving so fast she hadn't been able to see their hands at all! Her voice shaking she told him, \"I'm fi... fine David.\" Leaning close she whispered, \"I couldn't see either of your nor his hands when you were training my god you two are so fast!\" \n\nGreeson's eyes went wide they were moving fast? It seemed regular speed to him! Greeson felt a presence behind him, \"as you can see she is fine. Get your ass back to the center maggot! We have much more to accomplish.\" \n\nAs Greeson moved back to the center of the mat Dempsy bowed to Mara, \"Again thank you young lady. He has made an important breakthrough with you here. I just hope he can continue it.\" Bowing again Dempsy went back to Greeson starting just as fast as he had been before. \n\nMara sat back trembling a bit as she watched them continue though she couldn't tell what they were doing. Thinking a moment she thought she needed to see the Empress soon. She and David had made a promise to each other if they survived. A wide smile dominated her features as she thought she was going to collect on that promise whether or not he remembered. \n\n_______________________________________________________ \n\nDerrick groaned again as he was still laying on the bio-bed. Although it wasn't active now, he'd still feel a hell of a lot better if he was as far away from it as he could get. So far Tempro hadn't come up with much accept that the nanomites had been in his system since he was a child. \n\n\"Have you determined if they are encoded like the other ones?\" Derrick asked of Tempro. \n\n\"Yes Sire, it appears they are as old as you suspected though they are far more advanced than almost all I have ever seen.\" Tempro replied a bit perplexed. \"The coding on these particular nanomites is far more complex than all but those Mary made in her second batch.\" \n\n\"Is the encoding the same as hers?\" I asked thinking about it a moment. \n\n\"No sire, it is close though there are far too many differing variables in it. It does seem to be machine created though there is enough to tell it was also written with human help. Confirming now, running through all data that I have.\" Tempro explained.  \n\n\"Let me know if you find a match as soon as possible. If we know who wrote it then we might have a chance to find the counter.\" Derrick replied. \n\n\"Sire? May I ask?\" Tempro said then hesitated. \n\n\"Yes please, I won't get mad Tempro.\" Derrick told Tempro. \n\n\"I find it distressing not showing you the respect that you deserve. Must we keep up this fa\u00e7ade?\" A slightly shaken Tempro asked. \n\n\"I'm sorry Tempro as soon as I can I'll end it, for now I just want to focus on the problem at hand. I hope that we can end this soon ok?\" Derrick replied. \n\n\"I'll try sire, it just puts much stress on my personality. I hope we can end this also.\" A sighing Tempro said. \n\n\"I just hope that you can find something to help her. I for one don't want to relive the last four or so years.\" Derrick told Tempro. \n\n\"I am working toward that end sire. I know what kept your nanomites form activating, I know how it kept them dormant. I also have a good idea how they were activated. All I need now is the encoded program that dictated just how and when it allowed them to activate. As I said it is as complicated as mother's were.\" A now perplexed Tempro said. \n\nDerrick was nodding Tempro and Shelby were the smartest A.I.'s of all of them after Mary. Sighing he'd give almost anything to have Mary's med files. Unfortunately they were over four years in the future. \n\n\"I'm going for a walk Tempro. I need to get out of here a bit. What is Shelby's progress?\" Derrick asked. \n\n\"She is progressing quite well sire. I predict she should be ready to emerge in three days. Though I am afraid that her IMT systems will be at least a week after that.\" Tempro informed Derrick. \n\nSighing Derrick nodded three days without Shelby, it might as well be an eternity! \n\n\"Alright let me know if there is any change in anything.\" Derrick said as he walked out of the med bay. \n\nMaking his way to the far side of the quarter's area, Derrick stopped at an almost hidden door. Opening a panel beside it, Derrick entered a complex code then entered. \n\nImmediately two men were aiming weapons at Derrick then seeing it was him relaxed. \"Glad to see that you didn't forget about us Commander. Sorry sir it's still too early to start calling you sire or lord or well whatever.\" Norman said as he sat. \n\nNodding his head Jimison agreed, \"You'll always be the Commander to me sir. Any chance we can get out of here any time soon? I'm starting to climb the freakin walls.\" \n\n\"I told you to meditate Randall, it helps me.\" Norman told the now pacing man. \n\nRandall whirled a glaring look on his face as he stared at Daniel Norman. \"Easy for you! I wasn't privileged like you were rich boy!\" \n\n\"I told you we weren't rich just well off.\" A now upset Norman replied. \n\n\"Yeah right! You never...\" Jimison started. \n\nSighing Derrick shook his head these two were almost as bad as Kimison and Rayburn! Hmmmmm that might be a good idea. \"That's enough the two of you!\" Derrick suddenly yelled. When both mean looked at Derrick then continued Derrick looked up then two electrodes came out of the wall. \"I said stop last chance!\" \n\nBoth men looked at Derrick as if he were an annoyance, nodding Derrick watched as both men convulsed as the charge hit them then they dropped to the deck. Both were looking up at Derrick with a more than shocked look on their faces. \n\n\"Sir?\" Norman asked. \"Was that necessary?\" \n\n\"Like I told Kimison and Rayburn I need you working together not against each other.\" Derrick told them. \n\n\"Wait you did this to them also? We aren't that bad are we?\" Jimison asked. \n\nDerrick thought a moment then replied, \"Let's put it this way the next setting will leave you on the deck for almost an hour. Don't make me have to use it. Now, I want you to listen to Norman learn to meditate. I am afraid we are stuck here a few more days at least.\" Derrick was about to go when he turned to the two men. \"I'm serious; learn the both of you or the next few days are going to be very unpleasant.\" \n\nBoth men struggled to stand then saluted with a yes sir! Then watched as Derrick left. Derrick hadn't gone too far when a small body collided with him. \n\nThrowing her hand to her mouth as she got off the floor she apologized. \"I'm sorry mister nice man. Daddy was so glad that you were alright.\" ",
        "\"Why were you running Shelly?\" Derrick asked. \n\n\"Mommy wanted me to lay down. I have been laying down a lot lately. The beds in that machine medicine room are real hard they hurt! Don't you think so Mister nice man?\" \n\nDerrick couldn't help but smile as he had to admit the med bay beds were like a slab of rock. Trying his best not to laugh Derrick nodded his head yes. \n\n\"I'll have to talk to Tempro about making them softer.\" Derrick told Shelly. \n\n\"Tempro?\" Shelly said making a scrunched up and confused face. \"Who's that?\" Derrick thought a moment then described Tempro. \"OH! The see through man! Why didn't you say so!\" Leaning close Shelly whispered, \"you mean he is a builder too?! Wow is he special!\" Shelly said with a giggle that also got Derrick to laughing also. \n\nSomeone cleared their throat behind them as they both turned to see her father Gunther standing there. \"There you are!\" \n\nShelly's eyes got large as she whispered to Derrick, \"uh oh I think I'm in trouble!\" \n\n\"I'm sorry if she was bothering you Commander, Shelly I've been looking everywhere for you!\" Gunter said. \n\n\"She's been no bother what so ever, Lieutenant as a matter of fact we were talking about the see through man weren't we Shelly?\" Derrick asked. \n\n\"See pa, pa? I was a good girl just like you told me!\" Shelly told her father. \n\nSighing Gunther nodded with a smile. \"Alright but we need to get you back to your mother. She's been worried about you.\" \n\nLowering her head she almost whispered, \"Sorry pa, pa. Mom ma wants me to lay down I'm not even tired! Do I have to? Can't I draw some?\" Came Shelly's plea. \n\n\"We'll see when we get back to your mother. First though we need to get there without you running off again. Promise me you'll go with me?\" Gunther asked. \n\n\"I will pa, pa I promise.\" Shelly said as she moved away from Derrick. Suddenly she ran back and hugged a startled Derrick. \"Thank you for talking to me Mister nice man!\" \n\nDerrick couldn't help putting his arms around the small girl. \"It was my pleasure Shelly.\" \n\nSuddenly Shelly stood back from Derrick looking at then almost through him. \"I thought earlier that your temporal signature was out of phase with this time.\" Looking around Shelly continued, \"Yes the configuration of this ship. I can see it is a stream lined time access machine.\" Gunther was staring at both Shelly and Derrick. \n\nShelly's eyes got wide then she started to mumble as her eyes started to roll back in her head. \"Sir! She's having a major episode!\" A moment later all three of them appeared in the med bay. Derrick placed her on the bio bed. \n\nShelly's eyes flickered open. \"Pa, pa help me! Pa,pa my head hurts so bad!\" Then Shelly screamed as her eyes went wider as she started to spout relative time theory. \n\n\"We have to render her unconscious though even that might not be enough!\" Tempro said. \n\nAs Shelly went under Derrick told Tempro, \"With this episode we have the chance going forward. Go Tempro I want us as close to the palace as you can get!\" \n\n\"Yes sire I am going now!\" Tempro said forgetting about Gunther being in the room. \n\n\"Sire?\" Gunther asked. \"What in the hell is he talking about? Where are we going when you said forward?\" \n\nSighing Derrick sat Gunther down as a blue wave was emitted outside the ship. Gunther watched as they moved into it then there was a slight feeling of falling forward. A minute later they emerged near a planet with a three mile long ship in orbit around it. \n\nGunther's mouth was hanging open then dropped further when a woman with slightly greying hair appeared bowing to the Commander. \"Sire it is good you have returned, though why you aren't with the others?\" \n\n\"I need your medical records to help this little girl she...\" Derrick started. \n\nMary looked at the girl as her eyes went wide. Several electrodes came out touching certain spots on Shelly's head and neck. Immediately they heard a low whine as all of the electrodes administered a low shock at the same time. Shelly's body convulsed then was still. \n\n\"There I think she'll be alright for a bit. This is astounding; I never thought to see the second generation.\" Turning toward Derrick she nodded. \"In a way sire, you might say she is like your little sister.\" \n\n\"So,\" they heard from the doorway. \"You know.\" They both turned to see Mita with a look of concern on her face."
