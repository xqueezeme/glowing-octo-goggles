        "Gebriele Winder sat in a quiet booth towards the back of Sacker\u2019s, a local Bar and Grill just outside her home town of Plainview Arkansas, near Nimrod Lake. It was the 23rd of August the time was 8:30, she knew the ritual, this was the sixth year in a row she had sat in this booth and waited, waited for the clock to strike 8:39 so she could tell him all about the year and maybe say goodbye. \n\nGlancing slowly around the interior of the local watering hole, Jacob Billing known locally as the \u2018Bear\u2019 plied his ministrations to the top of the white oak bar, he was the owner, bartender and bouncer of the establishment. She looked past where he was standing, her eyes drawn to the methodical movement of color in the windows behind where he stood. For as long as Gebriele could remember the Budweiser sign blaring it\u2019s neon red greeting had competed for attention with the Blue and gold Coors sign in the front two windows. She always felt the two signs made the front of the place look like a weird Christmas display year round. Her eyes returned to \u2018Bear,\u2019 who at a glance, seemed to be haphazardly running the rag in his hand over the flat surface, but upon closer inspection, one could pick up his careful, loving, almost tender care in everything he did for his establishment. Gebriele chuckled a bit, her father had told her once it was as if the bar was his wife and he went about to ensure her happiness in all he did.\n\nShe noticed the young kids in the first booth up by the bar as they got up to leave. Probably a summer romance, she took them both for no more than High School freshman or sophomores. That left the guy in the booth two up and across from her as the only other person in the place, a stranger that wasn\u2019t at all unusual for this time of year. It was a very slow night, for which she was glad, sighing heavily; she sipped on her beer the first legal one \u2018Bear\u2019 had ever served her. \n\nGebriele was going into her senior year of high school when her life changed. She was just a youngster starting to grow into her womanhood back then; she had gone from being a shy skinny kid with long straight black shoulder length hair and dark brown eyes, to the way her body had developed, now at 24, her body was sleek and well defined, she had worked hours at toning it. She was 5\u20197\u201d 128 lbs and although not model material, she would turn heads in any crowd. The raven black hair that flowed aimlessly to the middle of her back and dark brooding eyes were the only hints of her Cherokee Indian heritage something she was and always had been extremely proud of. \n\nAs she sat in quiet contemplation the memories came cascading back without provocation, hanging all about her like humidity on a hot summer day, she gave in, letting herself drift back to that night six years ago. \n\n\u201cGrebs wait up,\u201d she heard her best friend Kersen Tennery, yell over to her.\n\n\u201cWell hurry up slow poke,\u201d she laughingly replied. \n\nKersen, he had been her best friend and buddy since his family had moved into the farm across the road from her family when they were both six. \u2018Grebs\u2019 was his very own private nickname for her and she would only allow him to call her that. Kersen was a likeable guy though a tad bit skinny, he was actually well muscled at 5\u201911\u201d 175lbs, light brown hair and sparkling hazel eyes. \n\nHe and Gebriele had done everything together, growing up, fishing, hunting, cooking, cleaning house, playing baseball, basketball and tennis, as well as playing card games. They had joined 4-H, learned to ride horses and care for livestock together, and with their parents who were also good friends, had hiked, camped, canoed, and learned about nature with each other. During the summer both kids looked forward to the family camp outs at Nimrod lake. Only 5 or 6 miles from their houses, the lake offered the friends time to explore and discover a completely new universe in the paradise setting. \n\nThat special year had been a turning point in their relationship; they were both preparing to enter their sophomore year of H.S. in the fall. By June, they realized they had fallen in love with the other. Both of them understood that, what they now felt towards each other was much deeper and richer than it had ever been before. Their parents were supportive of the relationship once they discovered their kids had become \u2018an item.\u2019 Not one of the parents understood exactly how deep the bond between their children had become. \n\nKersen was the first guy to hold Gebriele\u2019s hand, the first to hold her and whisper lover\u2019s secrets in her ear, given her the first kiss as well as her first French kiss. In early August of that same year, they shared themselves with one another for the very first time and became lovers, happening as it did out in the Tennery\u2019s field, under their favorite tree. Kersen true to form had held her after that first time reassuring her of his love, after which he asked her in all truthfulness if this meant he could take her to homecoming in Oct. and prom in the spring. Then before she could answer he asked if this meant they were going steady. When she said yes to all three, all the boy could do was grin ear to ear. She thought it was so cute.\n\nBy the evening of the August 23 the young lover\u2019s had been together four times. They had made some time to be together that day and for some reason it had seemed very special, almost as if they had become one that afternoon. Since the two families were enjoying the last weeklong campout by the lake of the summer, they asked their parents if they could go up to Sacker\u2019s for a root beer. \n\nHer dad said \u201cOK.\u201d \n\nAs they walked towards the small bridge that separated the campsites from the Bar and Grill area, Kersen stopped and kissed Gebriele, there was raw passion in that kiss mixed with unbelievable tenderness. \n\nWhen they broke, Gebriele asked, \u201cNot that I mind, but what was that for?\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since we made love today, I can\u2019t believe how close to you I feel, how special it was today. I mean every time has been wonderful, but today was so beautiful so\u2026. I wanted to just crawl inside your skin and be part of you.\u201d Kersen\u2019s smile lit up her whole world.\n\nShe brushed the hair out of his eyes, \u201cI know it was that way for me too today,\u201d she kissed him again, just to watch his eyes sparkle.\n\nJust as they crossed a bridge about a quarter mile from the bar, Kersen kissed her again then they exchanged \u2018I Love You\u2019s\u2019 and he said, \u201cI have to pee, you go on ahead, I\u2019ll catch up in a moment.\u201d \n\nShe walked aimlessly along the river path towards the Bar, the low hanging branches brushing against her head and face; she waved to Betsy, Mr. Bear\u2019s niece as she sat on the back steps of the Tavern.\n\nGebriele suddenly screamed as pair of rough hands grabbed her. \u201cLookee what I got Tommy. After we knock over the store we have something to play with tonight,\u201d a sickly voice resounded in her ear. \n\nAnother voice said, \u201cLook on the steps another one.\u201d\n\nGebriele bit the hand over her mouth and screamed, \u201cBecky, run get help, hurry.\u201d \n\nAt the same time her captor yelled, \u201cYou little bitch,\u201d she watched a hand move towards her face, and remembers hearing Kersen\u2019s voice, he was screaming something then all was black.\n\nGebriele woke up in the hospital about an hour later; her Mom and Dad were with her, comforting her she had asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Kersen?\u201d\n\nHer Mom got a funny look on her face and looked up at her Dad, who swallowed very hard.\n\nFear gripped Gebriele\u2019s mind she started shaking her head side to side and asked again in a tear filled voice, \u201cWhere is my Kersen? Daddy where is he?\u201d\n\nHer father took her in his arms and held her, \u201cBaby he was shot and killed by the men that attacked you tonight. He was protecting his friend, the girl he loved\u2026. I\u2019m so sorry honey.\u201d \n\nGebriele tried to understand, she tried to speak, but her mouth wouldn\u2019t work except to cry as she held her Daddy and her Mommy as they put their arms around her to comfort her in her time of loss. Sometime later that night Kersen\u2019s Mom and Dad came in and all Gebriele could do was hold them and cry some more. At that moment, no one realized how devastating the loss would be.\n\nGebriele was shaking as she brought herself back to the present, she glanced around no one was looking at her, she was weeping quietly. Looking at her watch, she noted she still had five minutes; she sighed and let her mind wander back. She remembered that over the next month she slowly pieced together the circumstances of the next few minutes after she was rendered unconscious. \n\nBecky told her, \u201cYou yelled, then the guy holding you punched you in the head and you fell to the ground. One of the guys started coming towards me when Kersen charged them with a boat oar he picked up from a rowboat someone tied up near the path.\u201d \n\nHe yelled, \u201cGet away from them,\u201d \n\n\u201cThen smacked the guy charging me in the head with the oar, giving me the time I needed to get inside and get my uncle.\u201d\n\nMr. Bear told her, \u201che responded to his niece\u2019s screams by grabbing a shotgun, then he sent two of his customers whom he knew had rifles in their cars to get them, and circle either side of the Bar. Watching through the back window, he saw Kersen charge the remaining two men, smacking the first man the one who they later learned had hit you, with the shank of the oar on his knee, then twirled around hitting the last guy in the ribs with the edge of the paddle. His attacks were startling and brutal, as both of those men moved as rapidly as they could down the path away from the two of you. Kersen glanced quickly around, finding no more danger, he dropped the paddle, then started to bend down towards you. He suddenly stopped and seemed to stiffen, then stood up, and took a step towards the Bar.\u201d \n\nMr. Bear continued a catch in his voice clearly evident, \u201cI looked down in horror, and saw the first guy who Kersen had saved Becky from, he was now standing, his right hand covering a bloody wound on the side of his head that he had received a moment earlier. His left arm outstretched pointing towards Kersen, the man was holding a gun. Kersen took a step towards him, I think to get between you and the gunman, the man screamed something, and then fired twice; both bullets struck him in the stomach. I moved to grab the doorknob and glanced at the clock it was 8:39, then I flung the back door open. The guy that had shot Kersen looked up the steps at me then started to swing his gun towards me. I unloaded both barrels into his head and chest he didn\u2019t have a chance. As I started to move out to get to Kersen who was now on his knees and one arm holding himself up, his other arm around his stomach, suddenly two bullets slammed into the doorframe beside me. It seemed the other two goons were shooting at me, I moved back into the bar. The Ol\u2019 boys I had sent out to get their guns, opened fire with their hunting rifles while I reloaded the shotgun. \n\nThere was a long silence, as a lone \u2018I give up,\u2019 echoed into the night, and one of the two remaining rowdies came into the light with his hands on his head. We quickly found out that one of the fellows with the rifles had found his mark; two of them were now dead. No one moved for a second, and then the night lit up with the sounds of sirens, it seems Becky had called the Sheriff. One of my buddies took control of the man who had surrendered.\n\nBecky and I got to you two a moment later; Kersen had just said something to you, I bent over pulling him up on his knees, leaned him into my chest so Becky could get some of the towels she had brought onto the wounds to stop the blood flow. He looked up and asked me to tell you \u2018Goodbye\u2019 and that he both loved you and knew you loved him. Your parents had heard the ruckus at your campsite came running up to us just as the sheriff arrived. He lasted until 8:51, but he got to say I love you and his Goodbyes to his parents, they were holding him when he died. Your parents got to you by then they were cradling you as life left him. He was holding your hand when he died honey,\u201d \u2018Bear\u201d concluded his story.\n\nGebriele opened her eyes as she whispered, \u201cKersen, I wish you would have held on so I could have said goodbye.\u201d \n\nIt was 8:39, she felt a twinge of regret, but for some reason she was more comforted this year than before, \u201coh well\u201d she thought, \u201cTime heals all wounds.\u201d She sat and told him all about the year the goings on in her house and his parents house, including the wonderful news that his parents had been approved to adopt the twins they had been foster parents to for the last 3 years. Also wonder of wonders his Mom had allowed her to go into Kersen\u2019s old room, box up everything, repaint, and redecorate it since the twins were girls. Running out of things to say she just sat and thought about her bestest friend and how much she missed him. Then it was over at least for another year, she could go on with her life.\n\nBecky waited until Gebriele sighed and started to lift her head, then slid into the bench across the booth from Gebriele, who looked up with tear-stained cheeks, and smiled, at her friend.\n\nBecky said, \u201cHi!\u201d\n\n\u201cHi yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou Ok now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYea, for another year.\u201d\n\n\u201cGebriele, I\u2019ve been here with you for 6 years, you\u2019ve never told me why you can\u2019t move on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked myself that exact same thing for six years Becky. I was the only one who didn\u2019t get to say Goodbye, to see him go, I\u2019ll not see him again to say it until I cross over, at the end of my life. I know it\u2019s stupid but I wanted, no needed to say goodbye. Trust me Becky, it\u2019s getting easier to live life afterwards, but, I am healing.\u201d\n\nGebriele smiled at her friend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow for breakfast,\u201d Becky remarked, \u201cgotta get home to my Hubby,\u201d getting up to leave she went out the back door to where her truck was parked and left.\n\nGebriele, sighed and allowed her head to fall into her hands, elbows on the table, tears flowing easily as she felt him with her once again. \n\nSitting with her head in her hands, she didn\u2019t see the two drunken college boys come into get a couple of 12-paks or that they noticed her. Bear was outside making sure the remaining six college rowdies all stayed in the truck; while Carla the regular night shift girl was watching the cash drawer and filling orders. The two Romeo\u2019s staggered over and sat down with Gebriele one sliding in across from her, the other one next to her moving his arm around her shoulders, he pulled her close to him. \n\nStartled, she gave out a cry, \u201cWhat the Hell do you want, get your arm off of me, get out of here and leave me alone.\u201d She was absolutely flabbergasted at the man\u2019s gall.\n\nThe man across the table slurred out, \u201cah com-on hunny, you don\u2019t need to cry over him, we\u2019ll make everything all better, now quite playin\u2019 hard to git.\u201d He winked at the guy who was still holding her.\n\n\u201cFirst, get off of me.\u201d Poking the guy in the ribs, he moved his arm as she pushed him out of the booth and onto the floor. \n\n\u201cSecond, that is the worst southern drawl, and pick up line I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird, get out of here and leave me alone.\u201d\n\nBoth men got real quiet, then the guy who was sitting across from her snapped his hand and slapped her hard on her cheek. The unexpected move had Gebriele back on her heals so to speak, and she moved into the corner of the booth her arms close to her body, her hands up near her face guarding.\n\nThe man who had been deposited on the floor, crawled back up from the floor putting his knee on the booth seat, \u201cso you like it rough bitch, well I like it rough too!\u201d he spit the words out like they were physical barbs, then lunged at Gebriele.\n\nShe screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nThe man stopped inches from Gebriele\u2019s face, then staring at her in obvious pain, mouth hanging open, no words coming from the evil smelling canyon that now dominated his face, he seemed to be frozen in place. He slowly slid backwards to the end of the booth.\n\nThe man let out a low groan of pain mixed with terror whispering, \u201cMy Balls, Oh my god, he\u2019s got me by the balls.\u201d He lowered his head to the bench and just shook.\n\nGebriele looked up to see a tall man of average build; he had a gentle look in his eyes she noticed as he met her gaze briefly, he smiled then nodded back at her. He looked at the rapidly sobering man sitting across from her; the tall man\u2019s voice was firm but had a distinct edge to it, \u201cOk boys, this lady has made it very clear she doesn\u2019t want your attention, furthermore she has asked you, not once, but twice to leave her alone. So, I\u2019ll leave the gruesome details to your imagination if you decide to challenge, now get lost.\u201d\n\nThe stranger released his grasp, then slammed his fist back between his buddy\u2019s legs, the man lurched forward and slid down under the table, as a low almost inaudible groan tumbled from his lips. The guy across the table from Gebriele jumped up to grab the stranger, was met with a hard, well placed left jab that landed on the bridge of his nose, splattering blood over both of the antagonist, as the drunk student fell limply back onto the bench.\n\nThe stranger looked at Gebriele, \u201cSorry about the mess ma\u2019am, it would probably be best if you got another seat after I escort our two guests out to their car.\u201d\n\nAll Gebriele could do was nod her head in agreement.\n\nThe man gathered the two goons then drug and pushed them to the bar where they picked up the two 12 \u2013 packs of beer, then manhandled them to their awaiting truck. The boys took off out of the parking lot only to be immediately pulled over by not one, but three sheriff\u2019s cars; it seemed Carla made a phone call to alert them.\n\nWhen the man came back inside, Carla handed him a wet rag to clean himself off, he handed the cloth back when he was finished, nodding to the woman in thanks. He found that he had a friend sitting at his booth.\n\n\u201cGebriele,\u201d she introduced herself, as she shook his hand.\n\nThe man mumbled something the sounded like \u2018Kenny,\u2019 as he stared at her with big doe eyes. \n\nGebriele smiled, the man\u2019s gentleness disarmed her, she found him easy to talk to, and was amazed at how quickly he drew her in, as she ended up telling him all about Kersen. He seemed amazed at the depth of commitment the two had for each other.\n\nWhen he said, \u201cI am truly sorry for the loss all the people involved incurred,\u201d she didn\u2019t know why, but she felt he really meant it. As the bar closed down, Gebriele asked where his car was parked. He pointed to a late nineties model Mustang, she turned and asked Kenny if he would mind giving her a ride home, her raw emotions coupled with the beer she had, were too much to risk the drive.\n\nAs they drove along, she pointed out the house where Kersen had lived; Kenny studied the place with genuine interest, surprisingly he pulled into her parent\u2019s driveway before she told him where it was. He had walked her to her door, when she politely asked. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d\n\nStanding off to the right side of the porch, with a sad far away look in his eyes, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed?\u201d\n\nGebriele stood by the front door a bit dumbfounded by his answer, then noticed a tear running down his cheek. \u201cYou Ok?\u201d She asked softly.\n\nHe nodded, then sighed, \u201cWell do you like the way I would have looked? I guess this is about what I should have been like at our age now?\u201d\n\nShe stared at the man in front of her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked confusion apparent in her voice.\n\nThe man looked at her, emotion readily apparent on his face as he gushed, \u201cI have missed you so much Grebs, and I didn\u2019t mean to leave you that night, especially without saying goodbye. I don\u2019t know what you did, but they sent me back for just a few brief spans of time and that allotment is growing short, Oh my Grebs,\u201d the man both sighed and let out a soft sob, as he continued, \u201c The Lord knows, I love you so much.\u201d\n\nAn impossible hope sprang up in Gebriele as she saw the man in front of her for who he was. Moving quickly towards him she grabbed him and fell into his embrace, then pulled him down to her, and her lips touched his, both of them were lost in the moment. When they broke, she looked into his eyes, \u201cKersen, it\u2019s really you\u2026. You\u2019re here holding me, how\u2026. how is that possible?\u201d",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s so we can say a proper goodbye to each other, I didn\u2019t get to leave anything else for you so\u2026\u201d He grinned, the way Gebriele had always loved, the little boy caught look.\n\nThe night air, which had been hot and stifling, was suddenly cool and refreshing as she looked up at him. It suddenly occurred to her she had something very special to show to him, \u201cKersen I need to go get something, if I run inside to get it, will you still be here when I get back.\u201d\n\nHe thought and acted as if he were listening to something, then nodded yes and said, \u201cHurry.\u201d\n\nGebriele, flew into the house, opened her parents bedroom door without knocking, her Mom and Dad who were both reading looked up at their wild-eyed daughter, \u201cNo time to explain call Mom and Dad Tennery, tell them they have to get over here in the next 2-3 minutes, there is a miracle standing on our front porch, hurry.\u201d\n\nAs she left the room her father grabbed the telephone, something in her voice told him don\u2019t ask, after calling them he and his wife scrambled out of their bed, threw on their robes then headed downstairs, they saw their daughter fly out the front door in front of them. \u2018Now why did she get him up they wondered.\u2019\n\nKersen was stunned when Gebriele returned, the screen door slamming shut behind her, she was holding a child, a boy by the looks of him around 5 or 6, Kersen noticed Grebs was shaking as she moved across the old banister front porch towards him, \u2018it still needs painting,\u2019 flickered across his mind. \n\nGebriele sat down on the porch the sleepy child hugged his mother, \u201cYou did leave me something Kersen, you left me our son, growing in my womb, and this beautiful little boy is Kersen Winder Tennery, your son my love\u2026. Our son.\u201d\n\nKersen was speechless, but then no more than Grebs parents who had emerged from the house and were now standing on their porch, staring at a young man on their front porch that had been murdered 6 years ago that very night. Kersen looked at both of them, \u201cCould I have a hug, I need to say goodbye, and I don\u2019t have very long.\u201d\n\nBoth of the Winder\u2019s moved slowly past their daughter and grandson to face him, Mrs. Winder grabbed Kersen followed in short order by her husband. After a few moments in the embrace Mrs. Winder remarked, \u201cNow my boy, go meet your son, he asks about you a lot.\u201d\n\nKersen nodded and knelt down in front of Gebriele and reached out a trembling hand to touch his son, the child looked up at the man in front of him,\u201d Are you my real Daddy?\u201d\n\nKersen replied, \u201cYes son, I am your Daddy.\u201d\n\nKersen put out his arms allowing his son to come to him, for their first embrace. \n\nHis son held him smiling, \u201cI prayed to God for a long time to send you back and help Mommy not to be sad anymore, so she can be happy like me. I know a bad man hurt you, and God has to have you in heaven so you won\u2019t hurt. I love you Daddy and I will take care of Mommy for you.\u201d\n\nKersen thought he sounded so grown up, he was very proud of his son.\n\n\u201cMy son, my precious child, I love you too and I love your Mommy so very much. Thank you for taking care of her because I can\u2019t. But don\u2019t worry I will watch over both of you even when you can\u2019t see me or hear me. Now let me tell you a secret only we can know, Promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d the child replied, making an exaggerated X over his little chest.\n\nKersen smiled and returned the gesture, \u201cI Promise you, when it\u2019s time for Mommy to go be with God, a long time from now, I will come to her and take her to heaven, Ok.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk Daddy,\u201d came his proud answer.\n\n\u201cNow I need you to go to Grandma and Grandpa, because I need to give your Mommy and my\u2026. Wife enough loving to last until the end of her life.\u201d\n\nKissing each other, father and son separated with, \u2018 I love you, and goodbye\u2019 exchanged for the last time this side of eternity.\n\nGrabbing his love, while still sitting on the porch, they both held on to each other allowing the moment to fill them to the brim, feeling two more sets of arms enfold him; he looked up into the shocked faces. \u201cMomma, Daddy,\u201d he said as his parents were also allowed to partake of the miracle of a child\u2019s faith.\n\nFor a few brief moments of time, three families said the things to each other that are necessary for healing, then at Kersen\u2019s insistence, final goodbyes spoken, hugs and kisses exchanged, Gebriele took Kersen\u2019s hand and walked with him towards the road knowing it would be their last walk for a while. \n\nKissing her fiercely, Kersen took his love in his arms, \u201cGrebs, I want you to get out and experience life, all it has to give. Find the things you want to do, go to the places you want to see. Find love, accept it in return, give of yourself as much as you can, but remember when it\u2019s all over I\u2019m coming to get you and for a long time we will share each other with just God, because I\u2019m waiting for you.\u201d\n\nThey kissed one last time then looking deeply into each other\u2019s eyes, said goodbye. Gebriele hugged him and closed her eyes. After she felt, his arms go limp from around her, she stepped back away from him, a few moments later, she slowly opened her eyes, looking around, and he was gone. Sighing, she heard the door on the mailbox creak, going over she looked inside to find six envelops, one addressed to each of the six people in the two families. No one would ever reveal to the other\u2019s what he had written to them, no one ever asked.\n\nGebriele grabbed the letters, as she turned towards the house she heard his voice on the wind near her ear, \u201cGoodbye, I love you Grebs.\u201d \n\nA single tear fell down her cheek, \u201cI love you too my Kersen, thank you\u2026. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nShe heard him sigh, and then the sounds of the night came rushing back into her mind. She stood and cried for a few minutes, only there was no sadness, only joy, it filled her so completely, she had to let it out and tears seemed so appropriate. \n\nLooking eastward, she saw the first light of the dawn of a brand new day break the horizon. Her heart was light, as were her footsteps, she turned and walked towards the house, ready to face a future that was suddenly bright with promise.\n\nEpilog:\n\nTwo weeks after her 83rd birthday Gebriele lay in her hospital bed, her body failing, waiting patiently for her best friend to come and escort her to her new home. Her oldest child Kersen, now 65, was in the room, talking and reading stories to his mom as she rested. He looked up as the door to the room opened to find his father standing there, looking much as he remembered him from all those years before.\n\nKersen stood, his dad said, \u201cHi, sorry you can\u2019t hug me, I don\u2019t have a physical body for this trip. \u201c\n\n\u201cI understand Dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for watching out for your mom for me, I love you for it all the more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYer welcome Dad, Uh, I want to know something, are you\u2026I mean, will you.\u201d the embarrassment shown on his face. \n\n\u201cSon we will both come back for you and your lovely bride, but right now your mom and I have a date, so tell her goodbye.\u201d\n\nMother and son said their peace to each other, returning to his seat near the window he watched as his father moved over by the bed. Kersen looked at Gebriele, he had a huge smile on his face, \u201cYou Ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes love, I\u2019ve waited patiently for you, for such a long time.\u201d\n\nTaking his best friend by her hand, Kersen gently pulled Gebriele up from the bed towards himself. Their son watched in awe as a spirit of his mother stood from within her body she looked to be 20 years old. The two Lovers embraced, said goodbye to their child, then they slipped out the door as the cardiac monitors blared their trumpet call \u2018another person freed to eternity.\u2019 Kersen sat in the chair in the corner of the room as the hospital staff made a valiant effort to save the old woman, the doctor finally said, it\u2019s too late. \n\nKersen distinctly heard, \u201cGrebs wait up,\u201d followed by, \u201cwell hurry up slow poke,\u201d and the laughter of little children as they run through the meadows on hot summer days fading away in the distance.\n\nKersen smiled gathered his things to go sign the appropriate paperwork, make the phone calls to his three half siblings, then get home and try to explain this to his wife.
