        "Chapter 1\n\nLying here in bed, just staring at the ceiling, the glow of the morning sun making the room an amber light. I can also feel the fresh breeze on my face, as the window is open now due to the warm nights. Spring is here. Soon it will be summer again. It will be my first summer in Lemsford Village. My place of residence for the last seven months, trying to forget my past, to get away from my nightmares.\n\nOutside a dog is barking, I recognise the bark straight away, it's Billy. He is a German Shepherd. When he goes out, he can be very active as he loves the outdoors.\n\n\"Billy inside now, do you want to wake up Steve?\" \n\nThat's Patsy shouting at him, my landlady and boss. She is the proprietor of Lemsford Inn. She is in her late fifties, born in Lemsford, lived here all her life.\n\n*****\n\nLet me tell you how I ended up in this small village in Hertfordshire. It was back in November. I was riding through Lemsford on a cold, drizzly evening. I had no idea where I was going. I stopped at Lemsford Inn to have something to drink, to warm myself up before I hit the road again. \n\nEntering the Inn, I approached the bar, with gently chattering teeth I said to the bar lady, \"Any chance of tea or coffee?\" With chilled fingers shaking from the cold, I pulled out of my pocket some loose change.\n\nAn old gentleman who was standing next to me started to laugh loud, \"son you won't get any tea or coffee here after 10 pm, it's mostly alcohol until closing time.\"\n\n\"Could I sit by your fireplace for a while to warm up, please?\" I asked the lady.\n\nShe Looked at the old man with the frown, she said. \"Go sit down to warm yourself up, lad.\"\n\nTaking off my leather jacket, I put it on the floor to my side, not to get the material on the couch wet. With the log fire in front of me, I stretched out towards it as much as I could to warm up. Feeling the heat from the fireplace, made me drowsy, sitting back to get comfortable I started feeling my eyes heavy while staring at the flames, suddenly everything went black.\n\nI woke up to something moist running itself over my forehead, then my nose. Opening my eyes, inches from my face was a German Shephard staring at me. I just sat there frozen, not knowing what to do. Looking beyond the dog I saw the fireplace, that's when I realised that I had fallen asleep on the couch. Looking down slowly, not to make any sudden movements. There was a blanket covering my body.\n\n\"Billy get your ass here now?\" It was the lady from the bar.\n\nBilly quickly jumped off me and started running to disappear behind the bar. Lifting my head up, moving it to the left then right to relieve the stiffness. Looking out of the window, I noticed it was daytime. I must have slept through the night on the couch. Slowly getting up, I stretched myself before making my way to the bar. Standing there for a few moments before I called out. \"Hello, is there anyone here? Hello.\" Billy was back, standing at the entrance of the bar staring at me again.\n\nAppearing from behind him, it was the bar lady, holding a mobile phone to her ear, speaking to someone. \"What do you mean you quit, it's Friday, the beginning of the weekend, I need you here!\" She listened to what the other person had to say, then all of a sudden she threw the mobile on the counter, the smartphone sliding to the left while it's battery came sliding towards me. As she watched the item, her eyes stopped on me. I looked to see where Billy was, but all I saw was his tail wiggling, as it disappeared around the corner. Then I looked back at her.\n\n\"Hi, my name is Steve,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm Patsy, have you ever worked as a waiter?\"\n\n\"I am a fast learner,\" I said looking at her with a confused look on my face.\n\nThat is how Patsy and I formally met. That weekend was the weekend to hell and back. Learning to be a waiter, while serving customers at the same time. When it was a little quiet, Patsy would take over while I was in the pot wash cleaning dishes. The only thing we didn't do was cook, at least she had a chef to do that.\n\nSaturday night when we had closed the Inn, it was just Patsy and me to clean up, Billy was sleeping by the fireplace. When we finished, she got a bottle of Jack Daniel's and two shot glasses, filling them both up with the liquid. Patsy took one of the glasses of whisky tossing it back.\n\nSeen my glass just sitting there untouched she said.\"The other one is for you Steve.\"\n\n\"If it's ok with you I'll get myself an orange juice?\" Once I got her approval, I poured myself the beverage. I took a sip of my drink then said. \"Thank you very much for the food and letting me sleep for two nights here. If you let me sleep tonight, then I'll be on my way in the morning?\"\n\nReaching into her back pocket, she pulled out some money, started counting notes in front of me. \"That is your salary for the two days you helped out. You can stay for the night, but I want to offer you a job if you are interested? There is a one bedroom flat above the Inn for you to stay. It needs a good clean and a coat of paint. I open at ten in the morning till midnight. I don't expect you to work that many hours. From midday till midnight will be ok, Sunday will be our day of rest like the good Lord says. I'll pay you \u00a31200 per calendar month including a place to stay plus meals.\" She just stood there looking at me for a moment.\n\nOpening and closing my mouth a couple of times to say something. Eventually, I spoke. \"Thank God it's Sunday tomorrow, I'll need the day to clean up the place.\"\n\nGrabbing the other shot glass, she tossed that one back as well. Then she put her hand out to shake on our deal.\n\nNext day I spent most of the morning cleaning up the flat, I didn't see Patsy all day, probably the one day she had off, she wanted to stay as far away from the Inn as possible. Finishing off, I went outside to see where to park my motorbike. On the rear of the Inn was a small extension, inside was some old furniture, must have been from the Inn. There was enough space to park the Yamaha, rolling the bike inside, I stood it on its's kickstand, taking the leather bag with all my belongings I went back to the flat.\n\n*****\n\nBack to present day. I turned to look at the clock on the side cabinet. It's just gone past 7 am. Climbing out of bed, I had a good stretch, then started to get ready for the day. For thirty minutes I did my morning exercise which consists of some pull-ups, push-ups then stretching. Had a quick shower and by 8 am I was downstairs, preparing everything before we open.\n\nIt was 9 am when Patsy rushed in with two bags in either hand, putting them on the counter as quickly as possible. \"Had to go to the Sunday Market to get some vegetables we need for today. It's Sunday you didn't have to come to work today. The only reason I'm opening is that bloody Herts Auto Show.\"\n\n\"What miss out on all the action!\" I replied.\n\nThe day was very busy. A lot of customers from the surrounding towns and London. All morning people were dropping in to have breakfast before they went to the Show.\n\nIt was just after 2 pm when the orders started slowing down. I was getting some cleaned glasses from the dishwasher, taking them to the bar when I heard Patsy raising her voice. Quickly putting the tray down I went to the bar. Patsy was arguing with three young men behind the bar.\n\n\"Look, young man, you ordered the food five minutes ago, it will be ready soon!\" Patsy shouted.\n\n\"Don't talk to me like that you farmer, a bunch of peasants the lot of you!\" He shouted back.\n\nSeen Patsy's face, I knew he hit a nerve, putting my hand on her shoulder, I said. \"Leave it with me, Patsy.\" Grabbing the coffee jug, I turned to them quickly. It surprised them. They thought I was going to do something else with the jug. Instead, I said. \"Hey bro take a seat I'll have the food with you in a few minutes. Until it's ready, have some freshly brewed coffee on the house.\" The cockney accent also confused them.\n\nWhen they finished their meal, they came to pay, instead of calling someone to bring the bill. They insisted on paying for the coffee's as well, plus leaving a good tip. What surprised Patsy was they each apologised to her for the way they acted.\n\nIt was late afternoon when the customers stopped coming, I said to Patsy. \"Would it be ok if I take an hour off to go to the Auto Show?\"\n\n\"Get out of here, and by the way, thank you for today and for dealing with the problem earlier.\"\n\nThe ride to the Herts Auto Show was only a couple of miles away, but I decided to open up my Yamaha once I got on the A1. Seen the road was clear, I twisted the throttle all the way. That is when I felt the vibration from the 650cc engine under my seat go right through my body. Something I haven't felt since arriving in this part of the country.\n\nWhen I arrived at the Auto Show, I cruised the bike along at a low speed. The rumbling sound the exhaust was making turned a few heads, as I went by onlookers wow or commented about the Yamaha. I parked on the grass by some American muscle cars. I didn't get the chance to get off the motorbike when a crowd of people gathered around me. Asking me questions about the motorcycle what year model it was? Who rebuilt it? etc. When most of the people left, there was still a few people taking photos of it. I let them do their thing while I had a walk around the show.\n\nThe vehicles in the exhibition were all classics, mostly from the forties onwards. You had cars from all corners of the world. The quality of the restoration done on most of them was excellent. As cars were something I grew up around, I knew what I was looking for on a restored vehicle. When I look at the bodywork, I can see if there are any ripples in the paintwork. The difference from a genuine part and a replica, from light fittings to engine parts. For two hours I walked around, admiring all the cars, talking to their owners, learning what parts they used to get the best performance out of their cars. \n\nOn the way back to my motorcycle, from a distance, I saw someone leaning on the bike. Getting closer I recognised who it was. I hadn't seen him since I came to Lemsford. It was my younger brother. \n\n\"Hey little brother, how comes your such a long way from home?\" I said.\n\n\"Steve so this is where you've been hiding?\"\n\n\"Could have come to the Auto Show from far.\"\n\nHe stands back, looks at the bike then turns back to me. \"No, if you came to the show from far the bike would be dirty, your somewhere near here.\"\n\nI approached him with open arms, embracing him while I lifted him off the ground. I said. \"It is so good to see you, Chris.\"\n\nThere was a mobile cafe nearby, we went and grabbed a coffee each, argued like we always did who was going to pay. Once we got that over and done with, we sat down at a table to talk. \n\n\"How are mum and Jane?\" I said.\n\n\"They are doing good. Mum is still at the same job. Jane, she's moved to another company, living the high life now.\"\n\n\"What happened after I left that night?\"\n\n\"Nothing much, mum won't let Jane forget the way she acted that night. Jane is asking me all the time if I have contact with you so that she can apologise to you.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"She is sorry Steve, what she said were words of anger. What I want to know how the fuck did you get that bike looking like that?\"\n\n\"I learnt a lot in prison little brother.\"\n\nWe chatted until the mobile cafe were getting ready to close. Then we walked back to my bike. I gave Chris my new mobile number, telling him not to give it to anyone. We embraced each other saying our goodbyes then went our separate ways.\n\nChapter 2\n\nWhen I left the Auto show, I went straight back to the Inn. Locking the Yamaha back in the garage, I headed for the main door of the Inn. Once I was inside, I started making my way upstairs, that is when I heard the crashing sound of breaking glass.\n\nTurning towards the corridor leading to the bar I shouted. \"Is that you Billy?\" When you called Billy, he would rush towards you. But this time there was no Billy. I slowly started making my way to the entrance of the bar, with my hand on the wall ready to switch the lights on, surprising any intruders. Reaching the switch, I pushed all four buttons down at the same time, illuminating the area from darkness to daylight. Squinting my eyes from the light, I quickly scanned the area for any intruders, seeing there wasn't anyone I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nSeen some tables with glasses on them, I took a tray from the bar to collect them. Hearing someone mumbling the words of a popular song I quickly turned. \"This used to be my playground; This used to be my childhood dream; This used to be the place I ran to.\" In a corner table was Patsy, with a full bottle of Jack Daniel's in her hand. When I got closer, on the floor was a broken bottle. She emptied one bottle and was getting ready to start on her second. As she lifted the bottle to take a sip, I reached and took it from her hand.\n\nWith a frowned look she said. \"Why did you do that? Because you don't drink, it doesn't mean others can't. Why don't you drink Steve? What's your story?\"\n\nShaking my head, I said. \"I'll make us some coffee, we can both do with some,\" I went to the bar, turning on the coffee machine. As I prepared the cups to pour the coffee, Patsy stumbled to the bar sitting on one of the stalls. Pointing her finger at a bottle of Jack Daniel's. \n\n\"Give me a shot of that?\" She said.\n\n\"What is it with you and whisky?\" I shouted.\n\n\"I was pretty when I met Paul. I was twenty-two, he was twenty-five. We had been together for a year. We loved each other so much. He was in the army, that is when the Gulf War started. We made a pledge when he returns we would get married. Operation Granby, they called it, forty-seven British troop died, Paul was one of them.\" Tears were running down her cheeks. \n\nGetting up, she made her way to one of the large leather couches. Taking my coffee, I followed her, just to make sure she was ok. She lied on her side, just staring into space as she carried on with her story. \"After that, it was one tragedy to the next. Five years later, mum died of cancer. That day I lost both of my parents, dad was not the same after mums death, he would just sit in front of the TV, staring at it. Within six months I lost him as well. The doctor said it was a heart attack. I called it a broken heart.\" Curling up she closed her eyes.\n\nGetting a blanket, I covered her then leant over kissed her on the cheek, whispering in her ear. \"Good night boss.\"\n\nI woke up to Billy's barking, looking at the clock it was nearly twelve. \"Shit I should have been up an hour ago.\" Jumping out of bed, I ran into the shower. It was almost twelve-thirty when I went downstairs.\n\n\"Sorry Patsy, I overslept.\" \n\nShe was standing by one of the tables; it was set up for breakfast. \"Sit down before it gets cold.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we open up, you're going to lose business?\"\n\n\"Didn't you read the sign I put on the door yesterday?\"\n\nOpening the main door, I looked on the outer side of it. There written on an A4 sheet of white paper, it said. \"Closed all day Monday.\" Turning to Patsy, I said. \"But the customers.\"\n\nStanding there with her hands crossed she shouted. \"It's getting cold!\"\n\nI can't remember the last time that I had breakfast like that. It was so good that I cleaned the plate by gathering the remainder of the beans with a piece of toast. \"Now that was a five-star breakfast, can you tell me why we have a chef?\" I said while sipping my coffee.\n\nSitting opposite me, she looked at me and smiled. I could see she wanted to say something. \"Steve I want to apologise for last night, the way I made a fool of myself.\" Gathering the plates from the table, she continued to speak. \"When I went to the supermarket this morning to get some things we need, I bumped into some locals. They told me they saw you yesterday at the show, a couple of them are interested in buying your bike?\"\n\n\"It's not for sale!\" I said with my voice raised.\n\n\"Hey, they just told me to ask you, no need to shoot the messenger.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Patsy I don't know what came over me. You asked me why I don't drink? What my story is?\" Getting up, I went to the kitchen, grabbed the filter coffee jug plus two cups. \"Let's sit on the couch.\" Getting up she followed, I let her sit down first then I sat next to her. Billy jumped on the couch between us, putting his head on Patsy's legs.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I started to speak. \"I grew up in North London. I went to public school. I was an average student like my brother and sister. Yes, I have two siblings, my sister Jane is one year older than me, and my brother Chris is two years younger. Mum was a housewife. Dad was a car mechanic for a well-established company.\"\n\n\"Sorry to interrupt you, Steve, you said your mum was a housewife, and your dad was a mechanic?\"\n\n\"When I was sixteen my father was diagnosed with cancer. His weight was 95 kilos, a year later, one month before he died his weight was 70 kilos. He couldn't eat or sleep. His main worry was, what will happen to his family.\" Turning away so Patsy wouldn't see me I wiped my eyes. \n\nTurning back to face her I took a sip from my coffee then continued. \"After dad's death, life wasn't the same. The house insurance covered the mortgage if anything happened to dad or mum, but no income was coming in. Mum had to get a job. She was lucky to find a job as a receptionist in a dental care clinic. With mum working nine to five, my sister at university in Brighton and my brother went on to pass his O-Levels and was excepted in college to do his A-Levels.\"\n\nTaking my hand and squeezing it she said. \"What about you Steve what did you do?\"\n\n\"I was the black sheep of the family. I started mixing with bad company, some guy called Cody and his sister Sarah. He was a couple of years older than me; his sister was the same age as me. Together we began to shoplift to sell the items to get money. When I turned eighteen, I got my driving license, Cody, his sister and I went out to celebrate, he borrowed his dad's car that night. We stopped at an Off License to buy a bottle of Vodka. It was late we were just driving around, sharing the vodka between us. That is when I spotted someone I knew from school. It was Dave we were best friends in school. We went our separate ways after I started hanging around with Cody. I insisted on giving him a lift home. I should have said ok when he declined.\" I got up walked up to the window. Putting my hands in my pockets, I looked out the window at the same time feeling a shiver go down my spine.\n\n\"What happened when he got in the car?\"\n\n\"I killed my best friend, Patsy.\"\n\n\"What did you do? What happened?\"\n\n\"He got in the car we drove around, stopped to buy some more Vodka, I asked Cody to let me drive, he let me drive for a while, Dave insisted on going home. We stopped at Mcdonalds to buy some takeaway. I was so wasted I can't even remember what I had to eat. The next thing I remember was Cody pulling me out of the car before it caught on fire. Dave didn't have a chance. It was all my fault.\" I felt the tears running down my cheek.\n\nI turned to look at Patsy. She just sat there staring at me without saying anything.\n\n\"I was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and manslaughter. My solicitor said I was lucky when the judge gave me seven years in prison. I was out in five for good behaviour. I was in my late teens when I was jailed, released in my early manhood.\"\n\n\"What did you do after you came out?\"\n\n\"I went back home, with some skills I obtained in jail, I got a job where my father worked as an apprentice. Mum was the same with me, but my siblings were different, they avoided me, never asked me to go out with them, they were embarrassed when I was around there friends. I worked for a year, using most of my salary to fix my father's old motorbike. It took me six months, working on it in the evenings and weekends to restore it.\" ",
        "\"Something happened, that is why you left?\"\n\n\"Something happened all right. I just finished restoring my dad's Yamaha XJ 650 Maxim. I rushed back into the house to tell everyone to come and see the motorbike, on reaching the kitchen I overheard Jane ask mum, how long I will be staying, that she is embarrassed to invite her friends around, and what was I doing in the garage every night? I slowly went upstairs, put my clothes in a bag. Grabbing my leather jacket, with the bag in hand, I went downstairs straight to the kitchen. As soon as Jane saw me, she stopped talking, Chris decided to look at his shoes, and poor mum opened her mouth, but nothing came out. I asked them to walk with me to the garage, on opening the garage door I pointed both my hands toward the Yamaha while looking at my sister. \"That is what I was doing in the garage sis.\" Strapping the bag on the bike then climbing onto the saddle I pressed the start button. The engine came to life with a roar. Slowly rolling the bike next to mum I reached over kissing her on the cheek. \"Sorry for everything mum.\" Put it in gear I rode off. That happened the day I met you, Patsy.\"\n\nShe just sat there rubbing Billy's ear, just looking at me. She opened her mouth to say something, then closed it.\n\nThat's when I spoke. \"Don't worry you don't have to say anything. I'll pack my bags and leave. I understand if you don't want me around, who wants a killer working for them.\"\n\nQuickly getting up she started shaking her head from left to right saying. \"No, no, no! You got me wrong I wasn't thinking that.\"\n\n\"Patsy you don't have to feel sorry for me.\"\n\n\"Feel sorry for you, I don't feel sorry for you. What happened to you was the worst thing that could happen to someone. You lost your father at the age where you was vulnerable emotionally. You made mistakes and paid for your mistakes. Now is the time to start over, to stop feeling sorry for yourself.\"\n\n\"What do I do know?\" \n\n\"You can start by helping me clean up all these dishes. \" pointing to the table we had breakfast. \"Then we can do some deep cleaning since were closed today.\"\n\nFilling the tray with all the plates on the table, I turned to Patsy I said. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Can we hurry I would like to finish before it get's dark. I want people to see me when you take me for a ride on your beast.\"\n\nWhen I turned to look at her, she was grinning from ear to ear.\n\nChapter 3\n\nLife was good in Lemsford Village after Patsy, and I got everything off our chest. If she had any ideas to improve the Inn, she would come to me first for my opinion as well. She would try to teach me everything there is to know about running an Inn. On quiet days she trained me to cook, A different dish every time. Billy and I would take long walks along River Ley like I mentioned before that dog loved the outdoors, It also gave Patsy some breathing space from both of us.\n\nThe locals in the village started to accept me in the community. After the incident, we had back in May on the day of the show, with the three guys. When the locals heard me talk to them in cockney, they decided to give me a nickname. Guess what that was, Cockney. It was four old gentlemen who gave me the nickname they came daily to the Inn. Patsy would always say. \"Those four old timers pay your salary between them every month, look after them.\"\n\nLate one afternoon after the rush hour we had during lunch time. I was wiping down the tables. Getting nearer to the table with our four regulars, I could hear them whispering to each other. When I got near their table, they stopped talking.\n\n\"What are you four up to now? Thought of a new nickname for me?\"\n\nBob the one that always spoke for the group said. \"Ryan's going to have a visitor. She's coming to stay with him in a couple of weeks. He wanted to ask if you could have a look at a car? He hasn't started it for some years. It won't even turnover.\n\nThe others are always talking and joking with me, Ryan he's the grumpiest of the group. I guess you always get a grumpy one in the gang. \"You want me to have a look at it for you Ryan?\" I said to him.\n\n\"It's Mr Tate to you young man,\" He replied.\n\n\"Sorry Mr Tate, how is Sunday Morning for you, I can have a look at it then. If I need anything, I can drop in Halfords to buy parts before they close, so that I can complete it the same day.\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"I'll get Patsy to give me your address.\" I carried on cleaning the other tables near them. The other three were moaning at him for the way he spoke to me when I was trying to help.\n\nSunday I was up early, decided to do some household chores before I headed to Mr Tates house. It was almost 10 am when I left the apartment. He lived on Brocket Road, a part of the village I hadn't visited yet. At the end of Lemsford Village Road, I was waiting for for the road to clear to turn left, that's when I spotted some people going to the St John's Church. Parking the bike, I went inside. The church was almost full, finding a place near the back I sat down. The priest was speaking to his congregation. I sat there for a while saying my prayers, for my family, Dave who lost his life, prayed for his family, finished with a prayer for peace in the world.\n\nIt was 11 am when I arrived at Mr Tates house, or should I call it a mansion. I don't have much knowledge about property prices, but I can assure you this one was over the million mark. It was Victorian built with soft Coddington Gold bricks. The entrance reminded me of the entry of the church I just visited. Ringing the door bell, I stood back.\n\nI waited for a couple of minutes, seeing no one answered, I started to make my way back to my bike. Suddenly a voice came from behind. \"You was supposed to come in the morning. It's almost midday now. But what do you younger generation know about keeping schedules?\" He was standing there at the entrance with his hands crossed.\n\n\"Sorry Mr Tate, I would have come earlier, but on the way here I saw St John's Church was open. I stopped since I haven't been to church for a long time. Sorry again for keeping you waiting, we can arrange another time to do the car,\" Picking up my helmet from the seat I was about to slide it over my head.\n\n\"You're here now, come inside you might as well look at the God damn thing.\"\n\nThe inside of the house was beautiful. It was like walking into another era. All the furnishings were like new, not a single item was out of place. \"You have a lovely house, Mr Tate,\" I said to him as we made our way through to the kitchen leading into the garage.\n\n\"Don't touch anything!\" he replied in not such a pleasant voice.\n\nEntering the garage, I was like a child released in a candy store. In front of me was one of the best cars made by British Leyland. \"It's a 1972 MG Midget Mk III, where have you been hiding this baby?\"\n\n\"My niece is coming to stay with me for the summer. She just passed her driving test a couple of months ago. I want to surprise her, if you can get it going she will have something to get around. But it's been sitting here for nearly ten years.\"\n\n\"I can look at it. Where do you keep your tools so that I can get started?\" He opened a cabinet, inside was every tool you can think of, even had a battery starter, which I would need later on. \n\nHe went back inside appearing a few minutes later with a mechanics overall for me. \"Put this on. When you finish take it off, I don't want you getting everything dirty when you leave.\" Then disappeared back in the kitchen.\n\n\"What is it with him, such a grumpy old man,\" I thought. I was working on the engine for nearly two hours. All the filters and spark plugs needed changing, but a good clean would be enough for now. I found some carburettor and petrol pump seals in a draw, something that had to get change if we were going to get this car started.\n\nI was under the car, screwing back the sump oil drain plug. I was startled by a loud thump causing me to bump my head on the sump. \"Fuck!\" I shouted.\n\n\"There is no need for that kind of language. I told Bob this was all a bad idea.\" Turning I saw Mr Tate's feet; he was making his way back to the kitchen.\n\n\"You know what I don't need this hustle. Two hours I've been working on this car, and you didn't even ask me if I would like a cup of tea or coffee. I'll put everything back together. You can get a mechanic to have a look at it!\" Saying every word loud so he can hear me. \n\nRefilling it with the engine oil, just In case, the mechanic decided to start it without checking. Cleaning all the tools before putting them back in the cupboard. Taking off the disposable gloves, I threw them in a plastic bag with some oily rags I used. With my voice raised, I said. \"I'm going to go now when I get the overall washed and ironed I'll bring it back!\"\n\nHe appeared with two mugs of coffee at the entrance of the garage. \"I want to apologise for the way I acted.\" He said\n\nTaking one of the coffee mugs from him, I took a sip. Do you want to do the honours of starting the MG?\" I said\n\nLooking at me then the car, he walked up to the side and just stared at the engine. \"It's been years since this car has seen daylight. Ever since...!\"\n\n\"Ever since what Mr Tate.\" I connected the battery starter to the mains then to the car battery. \"Eventually you will need a new battery, as this one will not hold a charge. Do you have an empty can, so that I can get some petrol out of the bike?\"\n\n\"There is a green metal container in the back, where the other vehicle is. There should be some petrol in it.\"\n\nGoing to the back, I was looking around for the container. Finding it, I grabbed it, making my way back to the MG I noticed a rip on the cover of the other vehicle. The rip on the canvas exposed part of the wing, showing a distinctive sign only one car brand has. Walking back to the MG, I opened the petrol cap emptying the container into the petrol tank while staring at the covered car.\n\n\"Shall I try to start her up?\" He said. Snapping out of my dream, I turned to see Mr Tate sitting in the driver's seat. With his hand on the key, ready for my go ahead to turn it.\n\n\"Let her rip,\" I said\n\nThe engine turned a few times, but nothing happened. \n\n\"With the key turned showing the ignition lights, pump the acceleration pedal a few times then try again,\" I said\n\nHe tried a couple of times without any success. \"I told you it died when my son.....!\" He said banging his hands on the steering wheel.\n\n\"let me have a go.\" Getting ready to get out of the car I said. \"No, stay there, just pump the accelerator a couple of times when I turn the key.\"\n\nVroom, Vroom, Vroom. The engine came to life. Revving the motor a few times, he then turned the ignition off. When he got out of the car, he put his hand on my shoulder, he said. \"Thank you for getting it started.\"\n\n\"Mr Tate we got the engine going, but that doesn't mean that you can drive it. It still needs a lot of work. The brakes have seized up. You're looking at four new tyres, and god knows what else we'll need for the engine for it to pass the MOT. You are looking at over two thousand pounds. I will make a list of what you need, I can get the items, or you can order them yourself if you don't trust me. Regards labour, I'll leave that to you how much you give me when I finish. Also, you said the car is for your niece who will arrive in two weeks. I will need two Sundays to do the job.\" After I had explained everything to him, I could see his expression, he was thinking about it.\n\nPutting one finger up in the air, he said. \"Can you excuse me for one minute.\" Then he just walked back into the house. He came back a few moments later. It seemed he was talking to someone on his mobile. \"I don't care how you make it happen. I want that garage door fixed before next weekend!\" Cutting off the line before the other person could say anything.\n\n\"Sorry about that Steve, but that door has been like that for some time. I paid for the repair, but with problems I had, never chased it up.\" Putting his hand in his pocket, he pulled out a folded piece of paper handing it over to me. \"I've written you a cheque for two thousand pounds if you need more let me know.\" Putting out his hand to give me a firm handshake. \"We have two weekends until my niece comes. Do we have a deal?\"\n\n\"It's a deal, Mr Tate.\"\n\nI stayed a while longer, explaining to him what work I will be doing on the car and why. \"It was for the smooth running of the car, for it to pass the MOT but mostly for it to be safe on the road,\" I explained to him.\n\nHe walked with me outside, before leaving, I said. \"In the back of the garage, you've got a car covered.\" Before I could say anything else, he put his hand up to stop me.\n\nHe said. \"Your work is on the MG, whatever is under that cover is out of bounds. Your job is to get the MG road worthy.\" Then turned, heading back to the house.\n\nI just stood there staring as he closed the door behind him, wondering what I said wrong.\n\nChapter 4\n\nWhen I got up on Monday morning, all the commotion about restoring a car brought back memories of my time in prison. Standing by the window looking outside, I could see the countryside as far as the eye could see, something I couldn't do when I was inside. In prison it was wall to wall concrete, my cell had a small window which was barred. To look outside you had to put a chair to stand on to be able to see anything.\n\nPrison life for me wasn't too bad. It was a learning curve in my life. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a holiday camp. Who wants to be locked up in a cell all night, and during the day to monitored on everything you did. Most of the inmates were ok. They just wanted to do their time and get out. You also had the once that wanted to control the prison. Most of the inmates had to pay these groups or gangs. They called it protection money. I was lucky no one ever asked me for protection money. I believe this is due to my cell mate Barry.\n\nBarry was inside for life. He wasn't going to see the prison walls from the outside in this lifetime. Rumours have it he's killed some men, some Underworld related figures from the 80's. He was in his late 50's, a big man, not overweight but fit, would get up every morning to exercise, I guess that is where I picked up the habit. In here he was respected by not only the inmates but also the officers including the warden.\n\nWhen I first met Barry, he didn't introduce himself to me. He said a handful of words which I will always cherish. \"You do your time and get out of here lad. You have a lifetime ahead of you.\"\n\nI started working in the prison workshop where Barry was in charge. I believe he pulled a few strings, for me to be there. Like I said earlier, a lot of rumours about Barry when he was on the outside. For me, Barry was my learning curve in life. He taught me to respect everyone in life. Right or wrong each person does something for a reason. Doing my time, I was out of line on many occasions. He was always there to guide me down the right road.\n\nThe knowledge I have about motor vehicles today is from Barry. In the workshop we had Maggie, that is what we called her. It was a Rover P 3500S, the car the police used in the late 70's early 80's in the UK. It was a two-tone armour plated vehicle with a V8 engine. In her era as Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher spent a lot of her time in the back seat of one of these Rovers.\n\nTogether we stripped Maggie to the chassis. Explaining to me how every part of the car worked. Taking things apart then putting them back together. He would then make me take the whole engine apart, for weeks I would struggle to put it back together. When I got frustrated and gave up, he would say. \"Do you have something better to do, maybe a prior engagement with some hot blondie?\" Once I learnt about the mechanics of a car, we then started on the car body. I thought he had superhero vision. He would see ripples on the car panels that looked perfect at first for me. On closer inspection, I started seeing them as well. I learnt to bolt body panels back on the chassis like they had never been removed. For weeks I would rub down a bonnet and respray it. Rub it down again then respray it. I would do this until I had the perfect finish. Then I would spend a whole day until it was perfectly aligned when I bolted back to the car. \n\nThe day I was going to be released I said to Barry. \"I will never forget you. I came to prison a teenager, and I am leaving a man. You have been a father figure to me.\" Embracing him, not letting him go.\n\nWhen I released him from the bear hug, I gave him. Wiping his eyes, with the back of his hand he said. \"What are you doing? Are you trying to destroy my reputation? Get out of here and forget about me, just remember what I taught you.\" Giving me a light punch on the shoulder before I left. Walking down the corridor, he shouted. \"Enjoy life to the full son!\"\n\nEvery month I send him a pack of two-hundred Dunhill International cigarettes with a note attached to the package. \"Send my regards to my girlfriend, Maggie.\"\n\nReturning to present day I jumped into the shower. After having breakfast, I went online to see what parts I could find for the MG. I found most of the parts on Ebay, avoiding any pattern parts, preferring to buy second-hand parts which were in good condition or new parts. I wanted to use the funds I had to prepare the car to be roadworthy, whatever money was left over I could use on the bodywork.\n\nBy midday, I was downstairs helping Patsy set up the buffet for lunch. At 2 pm my four favourite customers strolled in, sitting at their favourite table I went over to take their orders. Mr Tate today seemed very talkative, at some stage Bob said to him. \"My god man let someone else speak.\"\n\nThey stayed for a couple of hours playing bridge, Bob winning again like always. As they were leaving, I called Mr Tate over to have a quick word with him. \"Mr Tate I have ordered some part's which are arriving in a couple of days. I gave your forwarding address if that's ok?\"\n\n\"Yes, that will be ok.\" He replied.\n\n\"Also I wanted to ask you, will it be ok to come in the morning to do some work on the car, until midday when I start here?\"\n\nPutting his hand on my shoulder, he said. \"Son I was going to ask you the same thing if you wanted to come during the week, but I didn't want to pressure you with too much work.\"\n\nNext day I was around Mr Tate's house, knocking on the door at 9 am. Started work on the car straight away, dismantling the parts I was going to refurbish. Good thing I brought some WD40 with me as I had a little difficulty unscrewing some of the bolts.\n\nWith a cup of coffee in his hand, Mr Tate approached me. \"Everything ok Steve? You seem to be struggling a bit there?\"\n\n\"It's ok these bolts just need a bit of elbow grease.\"\n\nWhen I finished what I was doing, he handed me the coffee. We talked a while about me and how I ended up in Lemsford. I was thinking; he'll find out sooner or later, I might as well tell him about myself. He listened to me nodding his head up and down every so often. Once I got everything off my chest, I just sat there looking at him, waiting for his reaction.\n\n\"Thank you, Steve for been honest with me. Not a lot of people would mention about doing time, especially to someone they hardly know.\" He started to rub his chin, then put his hand in his pocket. Revealing a mini remote control, he pressed it in the middle. The garage door started to open. \"At last the doors been fixed.\" He said.\n\nWith the carburettor in my hand, I started walking to the entrance, inspect the part closer to the light. Wondering at the same time if Mr Tate wants me to leave. If that is the reason, he opened the garage door. Feeling his presence behind me, I turned to face him.\n\n\"Steve this remote is for you.\" Showing me how it worked. \"Finish off what you are doing, I'll make a quick omelette for us.\" \n\nI worked until 11 am, then joined Mr Tate for breakfast. Went home had a quick shower, I was downstairs by midday, getting the buffet ready for lunch, then dinner, finishing just before midnight with my last order of drinks. I went like this for two weeks like clockwork, only getting eight hours every day for myself and that was to sleep during the night.",
        "It was Saturday night, Patsi and I were busy all day until closing time. Finishing off cleaning the last couple of tables while Patsi was wiping down the bar I said. \"Tomorrow I've got some finishing touches to do on the car. Monday morning I have it booked for it's MOT.\"\n\n\"I heard you did a good job on Ryan's car?\" Patsy said.\n\n\"Just helped to get the car running for his niece to use when she visits him. Tell me, Patsy, what is the story with Mr Tate.\n\n\"He hasn't told you? Two weeks you are going to his house, and he hasn't told you about his family?\"\n\n\"Tell me what?\"\n\n\"It was a few years back; his son just finished university. He decided to travel around Asia for a year before following in his father's footsteps. Ryan didn't tell you he was one of the top lawyers in London.\"\n\n\"No, we haven't spoken about his personal life.\"\n\n\"A few months before he was going to come back, he was travelling to Hong Kong. It was late when his plane landed, getting a taxi to some friends house in the early hours of the morning wasn't a good idea. The Taxi driver drove him to Chungking Mansions. A Ghetto part of Hong Kong. He left his last breath that morning. Some kids found his body a few day's later. Hong Kong police said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\n\"Oh my God that must have been devastating for him. How do you recover from something like that?\"\n\nPouring herself a JD, she tossed it back. \"He never did, after his son's death, he just walked out from the law firm he was a partner. His wife then left him, for some guy living in London. Rumours are she was having an affair before their son went travelling. That is why he decided to travel, to get away from the arguments they had.\"\n\n\"That was ten years ago, the car I am working on is his son's right?\"\n\n\"That was his son's garage, Steve. They would spend hours together in there. They were very close. Don't you see Steve he sees you like the son he lost so many years ago, that is why he want's you around all the time.\"\n\nSunday morning I was up early. Got to Mr Tate's house by 8 am. Opening the garage door, trying to make as less noise as I could I rolled the MG into the driveway. Giving the car a hose down to eliminate any dust on it. Wiping any water from the body before getting the Autoglym polish out. By 10 am the car was finished, ready for it's MOT.\n\nGoing back to the house to find Mr Tate, to show him the car. Finding him in the kitchen holding a spatula. \"Steve just in time for breakfast.\" He said.\n\n\"The car is ready if you want to have a look at it?\"\n\n\"I think the car can wait, Steve. Let's enjoy our breakfast.\"\n\nWe sat opposite each other chatting and joking as we enjoyed our Breakfast. \"Steve you look a little fidgety.\" He said. \n\n\"Oh, I'm ok.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the car. I'm sure you did a good job.\" By our second coffee, he had told me what Patsy said the night before about his son, leaving out the part about his wife. He stated that they just separated but stayed in touch with each other.\n\nWhen we eventually went outside to see the car, I reached out with the car keys to hand them over to him. He carried on walking towards the MG. Walking around it twice inspecting it. On the third round, he was doing a closer inspection of the car.\n\n\"Is everything ok? I'm still waiting for some body parts I want to change. Mostly cosmetic, engine side it's running ok.\"\n\nTaking the key from me, he put it in the ignition, turning it. The engine fired up on the first turn, without needing to step on the accelerator. From under the hood, all you could hear was a sweet purr like the sound a cat makes. As we both walked together one more time around the car inspecting it. Watching the stream of steam the exhaust was releasing.\n\n\"Steve, it's not ok it's perfect.\"\n\n\"I just hope your niece like's it?\"\n\n\"Only one question I have, how much do I owe you for your labour?\"\n\n\"Sir you are joking with me, it was a pleasure working on this classic.\"\n\n\"No, you spent a lot of time and effort on this car.\"\n\n\"Mr Tate, letting me work on the car was enough. Your company during these two weeks was more than I can ask from you. The first couple of days we wanted to kill each other, but we got over that.\" Both of us laughing at the last comment. \"I want to thank you for trusting me with your car. Now I know how much it means to you.\"\n\n\"Steve from now on call me Ryan. Let me show you something.\" Walking in front of me, we went to the back of the garage, where the covered car was. He went to one side, telling me. \"Can you go on the other side and untie the cover from the bottom of the car.\" As instructed, I then held the canvas up. Together we walked towards the front of the car dropping the cover on the ground, raising a big cloud of dust. When the dust settled down, sitting in front of me was what I suspected. From bumper to bumper, the car was a beauty. It was an Aston Martin.\n\n\"This is an Aston Martin V8 Vantage. If I am correct, it is a late 70's, model.\" I said as I inspected the vehicle closer. \"Everything is like new on it.\"\n\n\"I think you will find something wrong with it, or which is not working properly?\" Looking at me while smiling. \"It's been covered up for almost ten years. I need someone to bring back to life.\"\n\n\"This car could cost a lot on spare parts?\"\n\n\"Don't think about the cost, will you take on the project?\"\n\nPutting out my hand I said. \"you're going to have me in your way for longer than two weeks on this project.\" \n\nStretching out his hand, he took my hand in a firm handshake. \"It will be a pleasure to have you around.\"\n\nWe spent the rest of the day enjoying each others company. I cooked one of the dishes that Patsy showed me. He enjoyed a bottle of red wine with it, while I enjoyed my pint of OJ. He showed me some photo albums of his family, mostly his son and wife. His son looked like his mother who was a stunning woman. I saw all this was bringing back memories for him, making him sad, so I changed the subject. Closing the Photo album, I asked what time his niece will be coming? So I could have the car back from it's MOT.\n\nAt around 11 pm we said good night to each other. I made my way back home to get some sleep. I wanted to get up early to take the car for its MOT test. \n\nChapter 5\n\nWalking towards the garage, listening to the birds, whistling with them. Pressing the remote for the garage door to open, with the door raising the first thing that I saw was a pair of ladies high heels, then came two beautiful long legs, looking up standing in front of the MG was one of the most dazzling women I had ever seen in my life. On seen me, she crossed her hands over her chest and stared at me with frowned eyebrows.\n\nShe Scanned me from head to toe a couple of times before she spoke. \"You must be uncles help, which maintains the property? I want you to bring the car out of the garage. I need to go into town?\" Stepping to one side of the car for me to go bye.\n\nSeen me dressed like this, wearing a tacky T-shirt and ripped up jeans, I guess I didn't look very impressive. Without saying anything, I Walked passed her opening the cupboard to acquire a handful of tools to take with me, just in case I need to make any final adjustments to the car.\n\n\"Great you don't even understand English!\" She shouted with an angry expression on her face.\n\nGetting into the car, I started the engine revving it a few times. Hitting the button for the window to go down, I shouted out so she can hear me. \"I take the car to wash up boss!\" Trying as much as I can to sound like someone from abroad, who speaks little English. Putting the car in first gear, I released the clutch while stepping on the accelerator. The wheels gave out a loud screech as I approached the end of the driveway. Just before turning, I looked at the rear mirror. Beauty was standing there with her hands open. She said something which I couldn't hear. But by the movement of her lips, I am sure it was. \"What the fuck!\"\n\nThe garage I took the car for the test was in Welwyn Garden City. It was a family friend of the Tates. Stepping out of the car I approached the garage entrance. Standing there wiping his hands with a piece of cloth was a middle-aged gentleman. \"Hi, my name is Steve, I have booked a car for a MOT test,\" I said while smiling at him.\n\n\"I recognise that car it belongs to Ryan Tate. Just wait here a minute.\" Turning his back to me, he pulled out of his pocket a mobile, making his way to the back of the garage, while he put the phone to his ear.\n\nWaiting for him to come back, I heard a voice shout out. \"WOW!\" Looking towards where the sound was coming from, a couple of young men were walking towards me. Ignoring me, they started to inspect the car closely. One of them said. \"I remember this car. Our boss wanted to buy it from this old boy a couple of years ago. The old fart didn't want to sell it; it was too sentimental to him he said.\"\n\n\"Hey, you two get back to work!\" It was the garage owner walking back out of the garage towards me. He said. \"Sorry about earlier son. By the way, my name is Tom. Ryan is a good friend of mine. Seen his son's car all of a sudden like that, it was a shock. I had to confirm it with Ryan. I Just spoke to a lady she seemed very pissed off about you driving off with the car. Then when I talked to Ryan, he was ok with it.\"\n\n\"Like I said earlier I've brought the car for its MOT test.\"\n\n\"It's going to be about an hour. We have a waiting room if you like to wait here, there is a vending machine with hot or cold beverages.\" Showing me to the waiting room, I got myself some coffee from the vending machine.\n\nForty-five minutes later Tom came back. \"Is the car ok? did you find any problems with it?\"\n\n\"No everything was fine. It passed the MOT with flying colours.\"\n\nTightening my fist, I punched the air shouting. \"Yes!\"\n\n\"Who refurbished this car?\" He asked.\n\n\"Mr Tate wanted to get the car roadworthy for his niece to drive when she visits him. I told him I'd have a look at it and fix anything that needs doing.\"\n\n\"Son I have been doing this job for the last thirty years, I have seen jobs done by specialist restorers, which are similar standards to what you've done to this car.\"\n\nGiving me his business card, he then put his hand out for a handshake. \"That is my card Steve if you are interested in a job to give me a call.\"\n\nDriving back to Ryans place I was thinking of his niece. I will surely get a mouthful from her when I get back. Parking the car in the driveway, thinking she will want to go for a spin. Making my way to the house from the garage, knocking on the door I waited. A few moments later the door opened, Ryans niece appeared in front me. With the same look, she had when I saw her earlier she started off again. \"Who do you think you are driving off like a lunatic and not coming back for two hours?\" Standing behind her was Ryan raising his eyebrows at the same time nodding his head up a little.\n\n\"Hey Steve let me introduce you to My niece, Lisa,\"\n\n\"Hi,\" I smiled at her, putting my hand out to give her the car keys.\n\nMaking a groaning sound, she grabbed the keys out of my hand, walking fast towards the car. Next, we heard the wheels screech as she drove off.\n\n\"I think she doesn't like me, Ryan?\"\n\n\"Now, what makes you think that?\" \n\nWe both burst out in laughter.\n\nFor the next three day, I didn't have the chance to go around Ryans to start on the Aston Martin. Patsy and I were busy with some new menus we were putting together, adding new dishes while removing some old once which were not selling. \n\nNext time Ryan came to the inn I told him. \"I will be starting on the Aston Martin as soon as my work has finished here.\"\n\n\"Take your time Steve no big rush.\"\n\n\"How is the Princess, is she enjoying her holiday?\"\n\n\"She sends her love. She told me, there is a knocking sound coming from the back of the car.\"\n\n\"I won't be able to go around for a few days. Tell Princess if she has five minute's to bring the car here, I'll be able to look at it straight away.\"\n\nBob jumped in the middle of the conversation. \"Knocking sound my ass from one person, and the other person is too busy to go around to look at it. In other words playing hard to get.\" That is when the others started laughing.\n\n\"Come on guys where talking about Ryan's niece here?\" \n\nSunday I had Billy with me, as Patsy had to go to London to visit some friends. Putting Billy's harness on, we were about to go for a walk when I heard a car stop outside. Looking out of the window to see who it was, I saw Lisa climbing out of the MG. Saying to Billy. \"Sit.\" I went outside closing the door behind me.\n\n\"Hi,\" I said.\n\n\"Hi, I've been waiting for you to come and have a look at the car all week!\" She shouted as she banged her hand on the roof of the car.\n\n\"Hey chill out, I told your uncle I was busy this week, that's why I haven't been able to come around.\" Making my way to the back of the car I said to her. \"Start the engine so I can have a listen to it.\" Kneeling down to get a closer inspection, I saw the exhaust was knocking on the car chassis. It was a matter of bending the rubber holder a little to make the clearance the exhaust needed.\n\nWhile lying on the ground, trying to bend the metal hook enough for the clearance, I hear that well-mannered voice again. \"Are you going to be a long time.\" Turning my head towards the direction where she was standing, I could see her legs as she was tapping one foot on the ground.\n\nQuickly getting up from under the car, I was face to face with her, not more than one foot apart. \"What is your fucking problem? From day one when I met you, you have been a right bitch are you always like this? Jesus Christ!\" I shouted at her.\n\nSurprised she took a step back, she was about to say something, but instead, turned around slugging her shoulder forward, she started to cry as she began to walk towards the entrance of the Inn. Turning the handle to open the door I shouted. \"Lisa don't open the door!\"\n\nBilly just leapt out from inside, knocking Lisa on the ground. He didn't hit her hard. She was mostly shocked when she saw him in front of her. Quickly grabbing the harness, I pulled Billy away from her as he tried to lick her. \"I am so sorry about that Lisa,\" I said while pulling the harness, with Billy stretching towards her with his tongue dangling in front of her.\n\nLisa started to flap both her hands in front of her, trying to push Billy away. Suddenly she began laughing out loud. \"I guess I deserved that,\" she said as she got up, wiping her dress from any dirt.\n\nI noticed that she grazed her leg a little when she fell over, looking up at her she saw me looking at her leg. \"I wasn't looking at your ...!\n\nBefore I could finish my sentence, she spoke. \"I know what you was looking at, do you have any antiseptic inside, to clean it up?\"\n\nMaking our way inside, Billy ran in front of us to his favourite rug near the fireplace. Lisa sat on one of the high stools at the bar while I got a sterile moist wipe to give her. \"Don't worry you can clean it I won't bite you.\" With a shaking hand, I started cleaning the wound, avoiding too much pressure that would cause her pain. \"Ouch!\" she screamed.\n\n\"Are you ok.\"\n\nSitting there staring into my eyes while smiling she said. \"Just playing with you silly.\" That's when we both started to laugh.\n\nFinishing off by sticking a band-aid on it, covering the wound. \"All done, your leg will be like new in a couple of days, you can go to your date now.\"\n\n\"What date? I don't have a date.\"\n\n\"Earlier when you was in a hurry, I thought you needed to go somewhere.\"\n\n\"No, I was just a pain in the neck.\" Putting her head down she started to run circles on the band-aid I put on her leg.\n\nGrabbing her from the hand, I pulled her to her feet while I called out to Billy. \"Come on Billy let's go for that walk we had planned until we got disturbed.\" Lisa slapped me on the arm while squinting her eyes.\n\nWe walked along the path of River Ley. As I haven't had the chance to socialise much with people my group age, mainly female I couldn't think of a subject to start a conversation. That is one lesson they don't teach you in prison, what to say when you are with the opposite gender.\n\n\"Do you visit your uncle every summer?\" Wow, fifteen minutes of walking and that is the best I can come up with in a conversation, I thought.\n\n\"Did it take you all that time to get that conversation together?\" She replied.\n\n\"This was all a bad idea. I think you have better things to do on a Sunday morning than hanging around with me,\" I said\n\nStepping in front of me, facing me, she takes both of my hands in hers, she said. \"I am enjoying our walk.\" Doing a quick scan of the area, she points to a barge converted into a cafe. \"Let's get something to drink?\"\n\nThey were making fresh crepes, so we ordered one each with ham and cheese in them. Also ordered one for Billy with his favourite filling, Nutella. Sitting on a picnic table bench, we enjoyed our crepes, Billy finishing his before we finished ours. Seeing him sit there with those puppy eyes, I had to go and get him another one.\n\nWe spent the whole day by River Ley, just walking along the river path chatting. It was late afternoon when we got back. It was the first time I had seen Billy walking next to me. After he had the two Nutella Crepes, he became quite hyperactive, running up and down the river path chasing the ducks, by the time we got home he went straight to the fireplace, falling asleep instantly.\n\nI gave Lisa a tour of the Inn, when we finished, we made some coffee, sitting at the bar with our beverages. I asked her the same question from earlier. \"Do you visit your uncle every summer?\"\n\nIt took her a while to answer back. \"I haven't visited my uncle since I was a little girl. Before my cousin got killed in Hong Kong, I would come to visit every summer, but after the tragedy and aunty leaving uncle, he just drifted away. He closed himself up from the family. A few days ago he came to visit us. It was like he was born again, joking, laughing, it was the uncle I knew ten years ago.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath before she continued. \"When I was at University I met Trevor in my second year. We started dating, rented a flat together. I was in heaven, doing well in my lessons, found my true love, even begun to make plans to get married.\" That's when I looked into her eyes. They were moist ready to flood her cheeks with tears. Wiping her eyes, she carried on. \"One month before we finished university he wanted to break it off, he moved out to stay with friends for a week, before graduation.\" She put her hands over her face, rushing to the bathroom.\n\nOn returning, I went up to her rubbing her shoulder, I said. \"Trevor is one dumb ass to let someone like you go.\" She put her head on my chest, stayed there like she was trying to hear my heart beat. Confused I stood there with my arms open wondering if I should hug her not knowing her reaction. Eventually, I did hug her until the main door opened and Patsy walked in calling out. \"Billy.\"\n\nReleasing each other, we just stood opposite each other looking towards the entrance. Patsy strolled inside looked at me than Lisa, she said. \"Is everything ok, your eyes seem to be red Lisa?\"\n\n\"I am ok Patsy, I was just leaving.\" She quickly turned, making her way out to her car. Rushing behind her, catching up to her as she got into the car.\n\nTaking her hand, I leant to her ear, I wanted to kiss her on the cheek, but instead, I said. \"I will come around your uncle's tomorrow morning. We can speak then.\"\n\n\"Lean closer I want to tell you something.\" Bending closer to her, she whispered in my ear. \"Thank you very much for today. I enjoyed it very much.\" Then taking me by surprise, she kissed me on the cheek.\n\nWhen I was clear of the car, she put it in gear, driving away as I watched the red rear lights disappear into the night.",
        "Chapter 6\n\nMonday I was up at the crack of dawn, once I was ready I made my way downstairs to the inn, making myself a cup of coffee. A few minutes later, Patsy walked in carrying a couple of bags, surprised to see me, she said. \"You're up early today, and that smell is that cologne I smell on you?\"\n\nTo change the subject, I went over to take the bags from her. \"Let me help you put the shopping away Patsy.\"\n\nPulling them back as she held them tight, she said. \"Don't change the subject with me, young man. I saw what was going on last night.\"\n\n\"Nothing happened last night!\"\n\n\"Yes exactly, if I delayed a few more minutes something would have happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, I just fixed her car for her.\"\n\n\"You repaired her car alright, by the way, what did you two do to Billy? I could not wake him up for the love of god last night, so I just left him here last night.\"\n\n\"We took him for a walk at River Ley.\" Taking my backpack, I threw it over my shoulder as I made my way out. \"I'll be back at midday to start my shift.\"\n\n\"Steve!\"\n\n\"Yes, boss.\"\n\n\"Just be careful, don't get too attached to this young lady, she will be gone after the summer. Ryan is different from the rest of his family. He has been through a lot. He was a ruthless lawyer before his son died. But the Tate family hasn't changed, they are hard as stone towards outsiders, especially if you don't have a degree under your belt.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your advice, Patsy. I will be vigilant.\"\n\nWhen I got to Ryans, I went straight to the garage to start on the Vantage. Lifting the hood, I stood back rubbing my chin while trying to figure out where to start. Feeling someone's presence behind me, I turned to see who it was.\n\n\"Good morning Steve, it's not the same as the MG is it?\" It was Ryan.\n\nTaking off my jacket I threw it on the work bench, I then started to roll up my sleeve's. \"No sir this is no MG, but with your permission, I will give it my best.\" Getting a spanner, I started to unbolt the terminals on the battery.\n\nWalking over to the car, Ryan leant towards the engine bay to see what I was doing. \"That is what I like to hear from you. I better make myself useful and brew some coffee.\"\n\n\"No need to, the coffee is ready.\" It was Lisa's voice.\n\nTurning we saw, Lisa coming towards us with a tray, on it three mugs. After a quick break to have our coffee, I went back to work on the car, Ryan and Lisa disappeared back into the house. A few minutes later Lisa appeared, wearing a mechanics overall with her long blonde hair tied up. Went over to the tool box, took a spanner while looking at the engine.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" She said.\n\n\"Ryan, what was our budget for this project? I think it's going to double by the looks of it.\"\n\nSquinting her eyes, she lightly pushed my shoulder.\n\nI worked on the Aston Martin every day, Lisa next to me from the moment I was at Ryan's house till the time I left. Even when Ryan came to the Inn with his friends, Lisa would come with him, sitting at the bar till they left. All the time I would tell her. \"Go around Hertfordshire. There is a lot of history to learn about the area.\" When she wasn't with me, she would read or help her uncle around the house. \n\nOn Sundays, we would always do something together. She would insist that we go with my bike, but I refused to take the bike out. Saying the bike has some mechanical problem, to carry two passengers. The real reason was, I was scared to ride the bike with a passenger, especially Lisa. I already lost someone close to me in an accident which was my fault. I wanted so much to tell her the reason, but I was scared I would lose her if she knew about my past.\n\nIt was on a warm Sunday afternoon in late August, Lisa and I decided not to go anywhere far this weekend. Making some sandwiches, we decided to have a picnic at River Ley. We enjoyed the day together, having a picnic which we both enjoyed very much, ending up eating more than we should have. \n\nBy late afternoon we were lying on our backs, surrounded by grass, watching the clouds moving above us. Gliding the palm of my hand over the grass, I touched Lisa's fingers with the tip of my fingers. Stopping at that point, I took her hand in mine and held it, just lying there watching the line of smoke from a plane evaporating slowly.\n\n\"The summer is nearly over it will be time to go.\" She said bringing me back to earth.\n\n\"What are your plans?\" I said.\n\n\"Go back home, start work at my father's firm in October. He is a well-established architect in London. I will eventually take over the company.\" She said it with great enthusiasm.\n\nRemembering what Patsy told me a few weeks ago. I said, \"Will I ever see you again?\" While turning my head slightly away from her, so she wouldn't see my eyes moist up.\n\n\"You can always get a job in London when you finish my uncle's car. With the skills and knowledge you have on cars, they would have to be fools not to employee you.\" She said as she jumped on top of me, putting her head down on my chest. \"Your heart is beating fast.\" \n\nWhen she lifted her head back up, I reached taking her in my arms, kissing her passionately on the lips, staying like that for a while. When I eventually let her go, she looked at me for a second before she spoke. \"WOW, you should have warned me first.\"\n\n\"Sorry I should have.......!\" Not letting me finish my sentence she attacked my lips with hers, this time with more passion. \n\nIt was almost dark when we got back to the Inn, both of us famished, I quickly fried up something for us to eat. When we finished our meal, we made our way to the couch with our coffees. Carrying on where we left in River Ley. Showing each other how we felt about one another. Around midnight we decided to take our party upstairs, that is when we got to the next level. That is when we became one. I had found the woman I wanted to share my love with for the rest of my life. But I had to find a way to tell her about my past.\n\nThe weeks that followed were a dream come true. My love for Lisa grew stronger each day, but at the same time, my nightmare was my past. Every day I would wake up with one thought in my mind. When I eventually tell her about my past, what her reaction would be. There was not one day we wouldn't spend together. She would help me with restoring the Vantage. When at the Inn she would be at the bar waiting for me till closing time. Some nights she would stay with me, others she would go to her uncle's house.\n\nAs time was getting nearer for her to go back home, I worried more on telling her about myself. All the fear and frustration started to show in my mood. I was miserable around the people that showed me love and trust. I began to get depressed. I needed to do something soon before Lisa went for good.\n\nOne morning, as I was making my way out of the Inn, to go around Ryans to do some work on the Vantage, Patsy called me back.\n\n\"Steve can you come here please.\"\n\n\"Yes, boss.\"\n\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you? You have become one miserable bum, even the customers are complaining about you. Look I don't want to see your face around here for a couple of days. When you come back, I want to see the Steve I met back in November!\"\n\n\"But I have to work on the car. Also, you need me here. I need to tell Lisa I will be away for a few days.\"\n\n\"Steve just go, get the fuck out of here, I'll explain to Lisa!\" She shouted, almost pushing me out of the inn.\n\nPacking a few things I got on my bike. Within a few minutes, I was on the A1, trying my best not to go over the speed limit. I rode to my mothers, parking the bike outside the house, I just sat there watching the building. Pulling my smartphone out of my pocket I dialled my brother's mobile number, he answered on the third ring.\n\n\"Hey, little brother how are you?\"\n\n\"Hey, Steve where are you, is everything ok?\" When he said my name, I could hear the commotion in the background. I could hear mums voice, that is when my eyes started to tear up. \"Hey, Steve just a minute.\" He put me on hold for a while then spoke. \"We're giving mum a surprise Birthday Party on 28th September. Please try to make it. It will be here at the house.\"\n\n\"I'll try my best Chris.\"\n\n\"Steve we all miss you.\"\n\nI was quiet for a while before I answered. \"Chris I love all three of you. Tell mum I am ok and I promise you will all see me soon.\" I ended the call putting the mobile back in my pocket.\n\nStarting the Yamaha, I kicked it in first gear. I shoot off leaving a proportion of the back tyre on the tarmac. My destination was a two-hour ride to Birmingham. Stopping at a caf\u00e9 in Enfield Town, one I use to go to before I went to prison. Entering the restaurant, I sat at a table near the window.\n\nA young lady approached me to take my order. \"What would you like to order sir?\"\n\n\"Could you make me a ham and cheese omelette with a portion of chips, please.\"\n\nThey offered me some tea or coffee, as they were busy and it would be about fifteen minutes before the meal was ready. When the food did eventually come, I was just about to start eating when a group of men walked into the restaurant. As they walked by, one of them looked at me then shouted out. \"Hey, guys look who's out of jail!\" Another one quickly turned screaming. \"My cousin is dead because of you bastard!\" Quickly getting up I went up to the counter, giving the cashier a twenty-pound note.\n\nThat is when I saw the proprietor of the establishment Peter which I'd known for years. \"Peter I am sorry for any trouble I have caused.\" \n\nRushing out of the restaurant, I got on my bike, pressing the start button the Yahama's engine roared. I just wanted to get away from this area, as far away as possible. Turning the bike around to go the other direction, I heard someone shouting.\n\n\"Steve wait a minute there is something you need to know!\" \n\nI just twisted the throttle all the way, making the bike swirl from left to right before it straightened up.\n\nOnce I got on the M25, then the M6 I had the throttle twisted all the way. The bike was rumbling on the motorway, killing any silence. Getting near the end of my journey, a couple of miles before coming off the M6 onto the A38, I notice in my side mirrors flashing blue lights coming behind me fast. That is when that magic word came into my mind when you get caught doing something wrong. \"Busted.\" Bringing my speed down to 40 mph. I looked to my right. The police car came next to me, with the police officer in the passenger seat directing me to pull over.\n\nSitting on the bike while I took off my helmet, putting it on top of the bike's petrol tank, the two officers started walking towards me all proud of themselves. The one who was driving had a pair of leather gloves on, opening and closing his fist like he was trying to get the leather to soften up around his fingers.\n\n\"You seem to be in a big hurry, Road Runner. You thought you were going to get away from us, didn't you?\" Leather gloves said.\n\n\"No officer as soon as I saw the lights I slowed down.\" The other officer just stood there. He was not more than 21 years old, probably still learning the ropes.\n\n\"Do you think I'm stupid, I've been on the force long enough to know how you bikers think. If there were an exit, you would have tried to do a runner. I want your driving license now biker?\"\n\nRetrieving my license from my wallet, I handed it over to him.\n\nGiving my license a quick scan on the front and back, he said. \"You seem a long way from home Stevieeee, what is your business in Birmingham?\"\n\n\"Here to see a friend.\" I calmly said.\n\n\"It's almost two in the morning, a little late to visit friends. Now, where would your friend be staying?\"\n\nLeather Gloves was starting to irritate me. I was tired, hungry and wanted to put my head down to get a bit of shut-eye. I think it was time for me to serve the ball. \"I am going to see a friend in HM Prison Birmingham. His name is Barry.\" On mentioning Barry's name, Leather Gloves head snapped up. I am sure I heard a crackling sound when he made the sudden movement.\n\nWith fear in his face he asked. \"You mean Barry the life timer?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the one. Barry's a good friend of mine,\" I said while tapping my fingers on my helmet.\n\nWithin a half-hour, I was snuggled in bed at The Royal Angus Hotel. I got an escort to the hotel by my new friend Leather Gloves, also got a complimentary room for the night with breakfast. I don't know if he paid for it or if the Night Manager was a friend. Whatever way it didn't cost me a penny.\n\nThe following day, after breakfast I made my way to HM Prison, I saw a few faces that I recognised at the main office entrance, they explained to me that you had to book a visit at least one week before visiting. But since it was Barry I wanted to see, they will try their best to arrange it for today.\n\nFrom ten in the morning, I was in the waiting room sitting and waiting for almost four hours. Just after two, A guard came to escort me to the prisoners visiting room. On entering the visitor's area, Barry was standing next to one of the tables. Approaching him, I opened my arms out to embrace him in a hug.\n\nLifting his hand up to stop me he said. \"Take a seat, Steve. Did I not tell you to forget about me?\"\n\nI explained to him everything, Lemsford, Patsy, Ryan and Lisa, for one hour he sat there, listening to every word I said to him. When I finished, I looked at him waiting for an answer.\n\n\"Tell her everything, Steve.\"\n\n\"I'm scared she will reject me.\"\n\n\"If she rejects you, let it be. As long as you are honest, that is what counts. Be truthful with her that way she will respect you more for been frank with her.\" Getting up he started to walk with the guard towards the prison cells, Halfway he stopped, and turned around, he said. \"Take care of Billy; he is very fond of you.\"\n\n\"But I didn't tell you about Billy!\" I shouted.\n\nGiving me a quick wink he turned and carried on walking, disappearing past the iron door separating the good and the bad supposedly.\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe ride back to Lemsford took three hours, due to an accident on the M25, it was 8 pm when I got back to the village. Before going home, I rode straight to Ryans house to see Lisa so I can speak to her. As it was late, I knocked on the front door instead of going around the back.\n\nWhen the door opened, I was surprised to see Ryan. I was expected to see Lisa. \"Good evening Ryan, I've come to see Lisa if that's ok, I would like to speak to her?\"\n\n\"She's gone home I thought you two spoke?\"\n\n\"No, she didn't tell me anything. Did she say when she'll be back?\"\n\n\"She'll be back by Friday she said.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ryan, I'll see you tomorrow morning. Good night.\"\n\nI walked to my bike at the same time I pulled out my mobile, dialling Lisa's number. It went straight to voicemail. I didn't think much of it. I'll try again in five minutes when I get to the Inn. As soon as I stopped the bike, I called again, going to voicemail. This time I left a message. \"Hi Lisa, it's Steve can you call me.\"\n\nWalking into the Inn, for a Wednesday evening, it was very busy. Grabbing a tray from the bar, I went straight to work, collecting empty glasses from the tables. It was busy until 11:30 pm, our last customer left just after midnight.\n\n\"WOW that was one busy evening, when I saw you walk through that door, I was relieved. I have not had anything to eat since midday, what about you, have you eaten?\n\n\"I am famished.\" \n\nGoing in the kitchen, I got some ready cooked food from the fridge, wrapping it up in cling film, putting it in the microwave, within ten minutes I had a table set up for two. \"Come on Patsy let's tuck in.\"\n\n\"I do not know what I will do without you, Steve.\"\n\nWhen we finished, I quickly cleaned everything up. I made myself a cup of coffee while Patsy poured herself a double Jack Daniels, we just sat there enjoying our drinks as we relaxed.\n\n\"Did you go to see Lisa yet?\" \n\n\"She had to go home for a couple of days. She had some business to deal with.\" I didn't want to tell her I tried to call her but she wouldn't reply.\n\nFinishing off my coffee, I said good night to Patsy, making my way upstairs. Preparing myself to go to bed I checked my mobile for any missed calls or messages. Seen no response from her, I wrote her a text. \"Can you call me as soon as possible please Lisa?\"\n\nIn the morning when I got up, the first thing I did was check my mobile for any messages, nothing. It was only 8 am it could be she may still be asleep. By 9 am I was in the garage, working on the Vantage. When Ryan noticed my presence, he appeared with two cups of coffee.\n\n\"Steve some parts you ordered for the car came yesterday.\" Pointing his hand to some boxes piled in the corner.\n\nKneeling down with a Stanley Knife I opened each box, inspecting the part, making sure they were the correct model numbers. Once I had confirmed this, I said to Ryan. \"With these parts, the car should be ready by the end of next week.\"\n\n\"That's good Steve. I want to ask you something son, but don't misunderstand me. Did you and Lisa have an argument?\"\n\n\"No sir, I had to go somewhere for a day, when I came back yesterday she wasn't here. I've been calling her, but it's been going to voicemail. She doesn't even respond to my messages.\"\n\n\"Give her some time. She has a lot of things on her mind. When she's ready, she'll call. I'll let you work on the car I have some calls to make.\" \n\nLooking at him walk back into the house, I just knew something was wrong. Lisa wouldn't just get up and leave without saying anything.\n\nI worked on the car without a break, giving it my full attention. Each part on this car had to be precise to the millimetre when putting it together. The V8 engine on this car was no way near the Rover I worked on in prison. Everything was near enough double the size. By 3 pm before I left Ryan came to see me carrying an overnight bag. \n\nWith a series look on his face, he said. \"I have to go away for the weekend Steve. I will be back on Monday. You have keys to the house if you want to stay some nights be my guest.\" He came over embraced me in a hug, he said. \"I'll see you on Monday.\"\n\nFinishing what I was doing, I locked up the house and went to my other duties. Work at the Inn was quiet that evening. We closed at 11 pm, preparing everything for the next day by 11:30 pm. I explained to Patsy what was going on with Lisa, all she could do was shake her head. She went to say something to me, that is when I put my hand up to stop her.\n\n\"I know what you're going to say to me, that you warned me about getting mixed up with Lisa, that I wasn't in her league. Well, I always seem to learn the hard way by not listening to people's advice. Taking a bottle of Absolute Vodka from the bar, I poured half a glass of Vodka. As I was about to drink the spirit, Patsy spoke.\n\n\"Steve you will not gain anything going down that path. Believe me, I know. Wait a few day's when Ryan gets back, maybe he will have some answers for you.\"\n\nLooking at the glass of Vodka then at Patsy I said. \"What if the answers he has is negative?\"\n\n\"Then we'll figure things out together. You have me, Ryan and your family backing you up, yes your family Steve. You may have had your ups and downs with them, but at the end of the day, family is family.\"\n\n\"I spoke to my brother a couple of days ago. It's my mums birthday at the end of September. They're going to arrange a surprise birthday party for her. He wants me to go.\" Feeling my tears run down my cheek I went to turn so Patsy wouldn't see me like that. She just walked up to me, with the back of her thumbs she wiped the tear away.\n\n\"I don't know what to buy her, what kind of things she likes?\"\n\nPutting her palms on my cheeks, she gave my head a light shake, she said. \"The best gift you can give her is to be there.\"\n\nEmbracing her in a tight hug, I said to her. \"Thank you for listening and been such a good friend,\" When I released her she looked at me, squinting her eyes she said.",
        "\"What day is the party?\"\n\n\"Her birthday is 29th September, but the party is 28th September.\"\n\nLeaning over the counter, she took her diary, opening it to the calendar year. Running her finger till it was over September she released a sigh of relief. \"Thank God.\" She said.\n\n\"What,\" I said all confused.\n\n\"The party is on Sunday if it were Friday or Saturday I wouldn't have been able to give you the day off. Can't have you partying on the busiest days of the week when I need you here.\" \n\nWe both started laughing.\n\nChecking that everything was locked up, I gave Patsy another hug, thanking her for standing by me before I turned to go upstairs.\n\nThe following three days were very busy for me. Starting at 8 am until 3 pm I managed to get most of the work done on the Vantage. Friday and Saturday were extremely busy at the Inn. Patsy hired a young girl that week to help on the weekends. By the end of Saturday night, all three of us were totally shattered. Every night before I went to bed, I would send Lisa a message. Waking up in the morning, checking my mobile for a reply from her, Still no answer.\n\nSunday morning I was woken up by a loud knocking on the door. Looking out of the window, a man wearing a cap was walking back to a Hermes delivery van. Rushing downstairs only in my boxers, I opened the front door, shouting out. \"Excuse me, sir.\" To my surprise when the driver turned around it was a lady. Feeling my face go red from embarrassment I Pointing a finger in the air, I said. \"Could you give me a second.\" Making myself more presentable, I went back downstairs.\n\n\"Mr Steve Rhodes.\" The lady said while giggling.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have a package for you, can you sign here, please?\" Handing me a mini touch screen tablet to sign on. Never could figure out these things, your signature never looks like it should on them. \"Thank you very much, sir, have a nice day.\"\n\nCarrying the box inside I put it down gently, I started opening it enthusiastically even though I knew what was inside. This engine part will increase the BHP and economy of the Aston Martin by five percent. It was an Isometric Exhaust Manifold specially designed for sports cars. The cost of this item came from my pocket, appreciation to Ryan for letting me work on the Vantage.\n\nWhen I got to the garage, I started work on the car straight away, first installing the manifold which was the hardest part. It took me till lunchtime to get it in place. Having a quick lunch, I then started to check all the other components around the engine, putting back any plastics I had to remove. Spending another couple of hours inspecting the mechanical parts on the car. Bleeding the brakes, checking the suspension, finishing off in the engine bay, checking the tension of the belts.\n\nThe moment of truth had arrived, climbing into the driver's seat, I held the steering wheel with one hand and the other the key in the ignition, it was time to start her up. Turning the key halfway the dashboard came to life, half a dozen red lamps lit up while some of the gauges needles sprung up. Turning the key full the engine started to turn over, but not starting, I released it after some seconds. I tried again, pumping the accelerator a few times, being careful not to flood the engine, nothing, you could hear a pin drop from the silence. Leaning my head on the steering wheel, I tried again. \"Come on baby talk to me!\" I shouted, Vroom Vroom, my head popped up like a Jack in a box, I shouted. \"Yes!\" You could hear each piston work when it's idling went to normal. Climbing out of the car, I walked to the front, checking the engine for any water or oil leaks. Once the engine started to heat up to it's working temperature, there was a smell of burning. It was dust burning, It had gathered around the engine, while it was just sitting in the garage.\n\nLetting the car idle for a half-hour, every few minutes checking for leaks or if the engine idle was rising or falling suddenly, not wanting to rev the motor before doing some other checks on it. When I was sure everything was ok, I turned the engine off. All you could hear now was the exhaust crackling from the heat, putting my head in the engine bay, I listened carefully for any hissing sounds from the radiator.\n\nEverything was good, locking everything up I went home. Having a quick shower, I climbed into bed, checking my mobile, probably the one-hundredth time today. Still no message from Lisa. Putting the mobile on the side cabinet, I closed my eyes to get some sleep.\n\nChapter 8\n\nIt was Monday morning, Ryan should be back today, maybe he could shed some light why Lisa will not reply to my calls or messages. All the running around the last couple of months had started to show on me. I was exhausted physically and mentally. \n\nIt was the first morning I hadn't checked my mobile for any messages from Lisa. If she hadn't sent a message all week, I don't think she would send one know. Downstairs Patsy was showing the new girl the drinks behind the bar. That brought back memories when I first started working here.\n\n\"Hey, Patsy will you need me today? I wanted to have Ryan's car ready for its MOT by Wednesday.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a quiet week this week, take a few days off, I have Barbara with me this week, she can help me. But Friday and Saturday I will need you.\"\n\n\"Ok, Patsy.\" grabbing my backpack I headed out.\n\nMy plan for today was to give the car a compound, putting the buffering adaptor on the drill I started from the back working towards the front, using the finest compound. Just to remove a thin layer of the paint to give it that showroom look. It was 5 pm when I'd finished with the buffering. I made myself a sandwich then went back to polish the car.\n\nI was shaking the bottle of polish to mix it up when Ryan pulled up. Getting out of the car, with his night bag in hand he started walking towards me. He said, \"Hello Steve. Can you come into the house?\"\n\nI felt a knot in my stomach. I knew there was something wrong. I went straight to the coffee machine filling it up with water. Standing next to it, waiting for the coffee to brew not once looking at Ryan, scared of what he might say. When the coffee was ready, I poured us a cup each. Sitting there, neither of us saying anything, I could feel the beating of my heart. \"How long are you going to keep me in suspense?\" I asked while staring at him.\n\nLooking straight ahead not turning to face me, that is when I knew what he had to say was not going to be good. \"Steve, she won't be coming back, she will be starting work at her father's company on Monday.\"\n\nBanging the mug on the table, a majority of coffee spilt over my hand, not moving a muscle when the hot liquid scorched my hand. \"Lisa could have called me or at least sent a message to tell me!\" I shouted.\n\nPutting his hand on my shoulder, he said. \"Son forget about her and move on with your life.\"\n\n\"Forget her and move on you say. Since that day of the accident, I have been trying to move on.\" Feeling a tear run down my cheek, I looked at Ryan and continued. Maybe your right I should move on, thank you for everything Ryan, you have been like a father to me.\" Walking out of the house while putting on my jacket, jumping on my bike, within minutes I was on the A1 heading north.\n\nFeeling the wind on my face, as the Yamaha glided past the cars on the A1. On the road for almost an hour, I checked the next sign coming up. Peterborough 5 miles. The following service station I pulled up parking near the entrance of the fast food restaurants. Having a quick meal at the Burger King, I then went to the Holiday Inn to see if they had any rooms available. Booking a room on B/B for two nights. Paying in advance, I told the receptionist, I didn't want to be disturbed.\n\nAfter having a shower, I climbed into bed. Lying there, flicking through the TV channels I came across one of my all time favourite movies. \"Shane\" I would watch it with my father and brother whenever it was on TV. Bringing back memories as I watched it, occasionally wiping the tears from my eyes. Near the end of the movie, I Watched Joey calling out to Shane to come back in the closing scene, while I drifted off to sleep.\n\n\"Go home Steve, Lisa is worried about you.\" My father said as he walked away.\n\n\"Come back dad, come back.\" He went further away as I called.\n\n\"Go home son!\" He shouted from a distance.\n\nSuddenly I woke up, looking around the room, it took me a few seconds to realise where I was. Looking at my watch it was 6 am. Quickly getting dressed, I made my way to the reception.\n\n\"Room 216 I would like to check-out, please.\"\n\nPressing some buttons on the keyboard, the young lady looked up at me and said. \"Sir you are due to check-out tomorrow, there will not be any refund if you leave today.\" She said these words With a worried look on her face, waiting to see what my reaction would be.\n\nLooking at her name tag, I said. \"I tell you what Tina if you could get one of the waiters to bring me a Takeaway coffee, we are even?\"\n\nWith a sigh of relief, she said. \"Straight away Mr Rhodes.\" \n\nThe ride back to Lemsford seemed longer than I thought. Once I got to the Inn, I noticed Patsy hadn't opened yet. Running upstairs to my flat, I got ready, putting on my best clothes. Looking into the mirror my first impression was. \"I need to get myself some new clothes.\"\n\nGoing down the stairs I could hear Patsy's voice, she was shouting at Billy again. \"Get your ass down here!\"\n\n\"What's he done now?\" I said as I reached the bottom of the stairs, finding Patsy standing there with both her hands holding her hips. When I was near enough to reach me, she swung her right hand, smacking me on the cheek, rattling my teeth to the core.\n\n\"What the hell was that for?\"\n\nGrabbing me in a tight embrace, she screamed in my ear. \"Don't you ever leave like that again, we were worried sick!\"\n\n\"I was upset. I needed to clear my mind.\"\n\n\"Ryan told me what happened. Next time you have a problem, come and talk to me before running off like that.\"\n\n\"I am sorry Patsy. If she doesn't come to Lemsford, I have to go to her. I need to see Ryan if we go together, she'll talk to me.\"\n\nLifting her hand to my face, with her palm she stroked my cheek while she smiled at me. \"I see it in your eye's. You love her.\"\n\nWhen I got to Ryans house, I went straight to the garage banging on the door. On opening it, Ryan stood there staring at me. \n\n\"That was immature, the way you acted yesterday Steve. We were worried, something happened to you.\"\n\n\"I know, and I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Come in we need to talk.\" \n\nMy adrenaline was too high. I couldn't sit down. I was pacing up and down in the kitchen. \"I have to talk to Lisa Ryan. I have to tell her. If she doesn't answer my calls or texts, I have to go and find her to explain to her. She has to know everything, what I did, the time I spent in prison. I can't lose her Ryan. I love her.\" Standing there looking out of the window holding the kitchen counter tight while those last words replayed in my mind. \"I love her.\"\n\n\"If she doesn't accept you?\" \n\nIt was her voice. I didn't believe what I heard for a moment. Quickly turning around, there she was standing next to Ryan. Looking at me with an expression made of stone.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me? I had to find out from my father. I sent my mother a picture of us taken while standing next to your bike. My dad has friends in the police, so it didn't take him long to do a check on the number plate on your bike. I go home to tell everyone about you, what a wonderful person you are. The only problem my father beat me to it, telling me for the summer I've been running around Hertfordshire with a criminal!\"\n\n\"That's enough Lisa. I think we know how my brother can exaggerate sometimes,\" Ryan said.\n\nLowering my head with my shoulders sagged, I said. \"I'm not a criminal, what happened was an accident, but people will see me as a criminal for the rest of my life. Your father is right. You don't need someone like me in your life.\" Not been able to look at either of them, I started to walk away.\n\n\"Don't you walk away from me Steve Rhodes!\" she shouted as she rushed towards me grabbing my arm, turning me towards her. With her face inches away from mine, she continued. \"I don't think you're a criminal. It was all a shock to me. If I knew, I could have defended you when my father said all those things about you.\" As she drew nearer; our lips joined as we kissed, embracing each other.\n\n\"cough, cough.\" Ryan interrupted.\n\nReleasing each other, we looked at Ryan, while Lisa spoke. \"Hey, uncle how about I prepare some Breakfast for us.\" Together we made breakfast. Ryan wanted to help us with it, but Lisa wouldn't let him. Finishing our meal, we sat there enjoying our coffee, with my hand under the table holding Lisa's hand.\n\nRyan, interrupting us by coughing again, he said. \"If you two lovebirds have finished, maybe you can update me on the car, Steve.\"\n\nReleasing each other's hand, I got up gesturing Lisa to follow me. \"Let's have a look. I said.\n\nAll three of us walked into the garage, Lisa and Ryan stood in front of the car, I walked towards it. \"As you can see, I gave the paintwork a compound to give it that showroom look. It still needs a polish, to protect the paint.\"\n\n\"We can see the shine on the paintwork, what about the engine, how are you doing in getting it to start?\"\n\nThat question didn't need answering, leaning inside the car I turned the key, the car briefly chortled, then began to purr. They both stood there staring. Letting it run for a minute for the engine to warm up, I then took the driver's seat, Lisa walked over standing next to me. Ryan still standing there frozen. Lightly stepping on the accelerator, the engine roared, making the front of the car slightly twist from left to right from the torque, at the same time bringing Ryan back to earth from his daze.\n\nWith a smile on his face, he said. \"That is a sound I have not heard for years.\"\n\nKilling the engine by switching the ignition off, I saw the disappointment on his face. I still have some finishing touches to do. But so far what do you think?\" I said waiting in anticipation for his answer.\n\n\"I am a speechless son.\" As he walked up to the car, I climbed out of the seat for him to sit in the car. Reaching to turn the key, the first thing he did was turn it half way, once the lights lit up in front of him, he took a deep breath. \"Memories I remember these lights like it was yesterday.\" Turning the key all the way the engine came to life once again. Revving the engine a couple of times he said. \"Are we going to go for a drive or what?\"\n\nChapter 9\n\nIn the morning, I was going to take the vantage for it's MOT. The evening before, Ryan and I took the car for a drive, to make sure everything was ok. I stayed longer, to polish the chrome parts on the car. Getting the Autosol Chrome Polish, I started work on the front, while Lisa worked on the back of the car, that way we could finish quicker.\n\nFinishing just before midnight, we locked everything up and started making our way back to my place. From the day Lisa came back, she has been staying with me at my apartment. \n\nEntering the Inn the last few customers were getting ready to leave. Barbara was collecting the glasses from the tables, Lisa took an empty tray to help her. That gave Patsy a chance to talk with me as she didn't have the opportunity too since Lisa came back.\n\n\"Is everything ok now?\"\n\nI just nodded my head up and down to say yes. \n\nGetting four glasses, she filled them up with orange juice, calling out to Lisa and Barbara. \"Girls come over, to have a drink.\" All four of us stood there in a circle with a glass of orange juice in our hands we clinked glasses. \"Cheers.\" \n\nLooking at Patsy, I said. \"Wait a minute, shouldn't you be drinking JD.\" With a smile, she brought her glass up to her lips, winking before she started to drink her orange juice.\n\nNext day we arrived very early at Ryans house, walking into the kitchen, we found him in the kitchen preparing breakfast.\n\n\"Uncle you should have waited, I would have prepared all that,\" Lisa said.\n\n\"Don't worry honey. I was up at the crack of dawn today.\" \n\nAfter breakfast, Lisa and I cleaned up, while her uncle went upstairs. When he returned, I saw on his face that something was wrong. He walked into the garage, ranged around the car, lightly kicking the tyres, like he was inspecting them.\n\n\"Is everything ok Ryan?\" I said.\n\n\"Steve I wanted to tell you something. You've done a great job on the car. It looks and sounds like when my son first bought it. You've spent hours to bring it to this condition, and I know how much you want to take it for it's MOT. But please understand me this car was a bond between my son and me.\" Before he could say anything else, I stopped him. \n\n\"Ryan I understand, I was waiting for you to say to me, you will be taking it for its test. Tell you the truth I am relieved. I was scared of driving it.\"\n\nOn his way to Welwyn Garden City, Lisa and I tagged along with him. Lisa insisted that I needed a new wardrobe. Dropping us off at The Howard Centre, as he slowly drove off, Lisa took my arm in hers tight as we both watched the car. \"Thank you for making my uncle smile again,\" she said as she put her head on my shoulder.\n\nFor two hours it was from one shop to another. By midday, we were walking down the high street with a handful of bags in either hand. Walking past Caff\u00e8 Nero, a group of suits were sitting outside enjoying their beverages, while throwing comments at every female who walked by. Suddenly one of them called out loud so the others could hear. \"Wow look at those set of wheels!\" That got everyone's attention, including us.\n\nIt was Ryan just cruising along with an expression on his face like he didn't have a care in the world. Suddenly one of the suits shouted at us. \"Sorry, you two, can you move out of the way, your blocking my view.\" That is when Lisa's uncle noticed us. Parking the car, he casually climbed out of the driver's seat, went to the back, opening the boot, we both strolled up to the car, throwing the bags in the back. After Ryan had handed me the key, he opened the passenger door for Lisa to climb in the back seat. Sitting on the passenger side while I walked to the driver's side. I didn't see them, but Lisa told me after I drove off, the suits just sat there with open mouths staring.\n\nDriving back to Lemsford, I didn't feel too comfortable. I guess a car with this kind of power needs some getting used too. Parking the car in the garage, I switched off the engine while I took a deep breath. Ryan noticed this, he said. \"You'll get used to it.\"\n\nBack in the house, Lisa was preparing lunch while Ryan and I were going through the paperwork of the car. \"The emissions was excellent, while the BHP was higher than it should be. It was due to the manifold you changed. I can't remember us ordering a new manifold for the car?\" He said.\n\n\"I found it online, it was cheap, so I bought it, if you want me to take it off I'll remove it in the morning?\"\n\n\"I don't want you to remove it, Steve. Just tell me how much it was so I could give you the money, and don't say it was cheap because I know that is an expensive part.\"\n\n\"Consider it a gift from me,\" I replied.\n\nAfter lunch, all three of us went to the cemetery were Ryans son was buried. Lisa and I cleaned the flower bed from any weeds growing, while Ryan cleaned the tombstone. After finishing, we went and sat in the car, leaving Ryan to be alone with his son for a while. On the way back to the house, we were all quiet in the car for a while.\n\nRyan broke the silence by saying. \"I think Jame's would have liked you.\"\n\n\"What did you say, uncle?\" Lisa asked him.\n\n\"James and Steve have so much in common. They could have been friends if he didn't .....\" \n\nIt was the first time that I had stayed at Ryan's house. We sat till very late, Ryan spoke to us about his family. How he met his wife, when they got married it was the greatest day of his life. When James was born, it was like a miracle come true for both of them. ",
        "Lisa asked him. \"Hasn't there been anyone else in your life since Aunty left?\"\n\nThe answer he gave her was. \"I guess I haven't stopped loving your Aunt even though she betrayed me.\" He sat there for a while in silence. Suddenly he got up, saying. \"Good Night.\" Then made his way upstairs, we just sat there looking at each other, not knowing what to say.\n\nWe stayed up that night till the early hours of the morning, just lying there in bed talking. It seemed we weren't the only once awake. We could hear the TV in the room next door. We could hear Ryan's voice. \"Look at the camera James, that's it, son, get closer Joanna.\" He was watching home made videos. By the sound of it, he was looking at the same scenes over and over.\n\nRyan got up early on Friday morning to go and play golf with Bob. Lisa explained, once a month they book rooms at Hanbury Manor Hotel for a couple of days, using the golf course and spa facilities of the hotel.\n\nBy midday, on Friday I was at the Inn helping Patsy get ready for the weekend. Barbara was there as well, trying to help as much as she could. The weekend was busy, with an even flow of work. By midnight on Saturday, we were sitting at the bar Lisa, Patsy, Barbara and me with our beverages. \"Cheers,\" Patsy said, lifting her glass in the air, the rest of us following. \"I've got a great team here. I want to thank you as well, Lisa, for helping out.\"\n\nAs soon as we went to bed that night, Within minutes Lisa was fast asleep. I couldn't say the same for myself, lying there staring at the ceiling I couldn't get it out of my mind that I will be seeing my family in a few hours. It has nearly been a year since I saw my mum and sister. Running different scenarios in the back of my mind, how they will react when they see me.\n\nOn Sunday morning, I was up before Lisa, even though she went to sleep before me. I went downstairs to prepare some breakfast for us before she got up. Standing over the cooker in one hand a fork turning the sausages, in the other a cup of coffee, suddenly I felt someone behind me embrace me in a hug, it was Lisa.\n\n\"Mmmm that smells good. I could get used to this, waking up to find breakfast ready.\" Squeezing me in a tighter embrace, while nibbling at my ear.\n\n\"If you don't stop we'll end up doing something else and having cold sausages and eggs,\" I said while leaning back to kiss her.\n\nCut a long story short. We ended up reheating our breakfast in the microwave. Not knowing how many days we would be gone, we prepared our overnight bags to take with us. By midday, we were ready to go. Everything ready in the car, I dialled Ryan's mobile number to see if he was at home, so we could go to see him before we set off. There was no answer, three times that I tried it went straight to voicemail.\n\n\"He's probably on the golf course, that is why he can't answer his mobile,\" Lisa said.\n\nBoth of us sitting in the MG ready to go, as I was ready to start the engine, I heard a familiar sound behind us, it was the Aston Martin's engine. Getting out of the car I approached Ryan embracing him when I reached him.\n\n\"I was trying to call you Ryan, we wanted to say goodbye before we left.\"\n\n\"I was with Bob playing golf. I need to ask a favour from you, Lisa?\"\n\n\"Anything for you uncle?\"\n\n\"I will need the MG for a couple of days.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, I said to him. \"Ryan you know I don't like taking the bike on long journeys with a passenger on it.\" Shaking my head from left to right, I started making my way to get the Yamaha.\n\n\"Who said you're going with the Yamaha.\" Turning towards him, he threw the car keys in the air towards me, as I caught them. \"That is your set of keys for the Vantage.\" Opening the palm of my hand, sitting there was a newly cut key to the Aston Martin with the genuine leather key ring.\n\n\"But.\"\n\n\"Get out of here before I decide to come with.\"\n\nGrabbing our bags from the MG, we threw them in the back seat of the Vantage. Lisa embraced her uncle in a hug, kissing him on the cheek. With a firm handshake, he said to me. \"You look after my niece.\"\n\nGetting into the Aston Martin, I adjusted my seat to how I drive. Starting the engine, I put it in gear, releasing the clutch I could hear the gravel as the tyres began to turn. As the car moved, Lisa waved goodbye to her uncle as she shouted. \"I love you, Uncle!\"\n\nAs we came out of the village, onto the A1 towards Hatfield, I looked up at the sky. It was blue, taking a glimpse at the temperature gauge for outside it showed 25oC. It was a lovely day so far, let's hope it stay's like this.\n\nChapter 10\n\nTurning on the radio, I tuned it to my favourite station, one of my all time favourites was playing by The Doors, pushing the volume up, I said to Lisa.\n\n\"Is that ok Angel?\"\n\n\"Perfect only one problem, where is the storm?\"\n\nJust after The University of Hertfordshire towards the M25, I was cruising at around 40mph on the dual carriageway. Suddenly next to me appeared a BMW M5, the driver started cruising next to me. Slowly stepping on the accelerator, I went to 60mph, changing the gear to fifth when I had some distance. Checking the side view mirror, I saw the BMW coming up next to me fast, as he passed me, I Threw the Vantage into fourth gear, I then floored the accelerator. The needle to the revs gauge reaching near the red mark as the engine roared like a lion. The Aston Martin went from 60 to 100mph in seconds, as I watched the BMW in my rear view mirror disappear behind me. Just before the M25, I slowed back down to 50mph as the Bimmer flew past me.\n\n\"Know that you have that out of your system can we drive safely for the rest of the journey?\" Lisa said.\n\n\"Did you see that he didn't have a chance?\" Contented with my achievement.\n\nLooking over, Lisa was sitting there with her arms crossed across her chest, she said. \"Boys will be boys.\"\n\nThe rest of the journey I drove at a steady speed, both of us enjoying the trip into London. The surprise party for mum was at 4 pm. It was early to go to the party, as I didn't want to spoil the surprise. I drove to Alexandra Palace. We sat at one of the picnic tables enjoying our beverage. Without a single cloud in the sky, you could see London as far as the eye can see.\n\n\"You haven't said a single word since we got into London. Like now, you're sitting there staring out into space.\" Lisa said as she stroked my hand.\n\nLooking into her eyes, I spoke. \"I'm scared they might reject me.\"\n\nLooking at her watch, she said. \"Hey everything will be ok, you'll see, come on let's go it's almost four.\" Taking the cup from me, she put it on the table. Holding my hand, we walked back to the car. Getting in the car, I started the short journey to my mum's house, stopping at a local florist to get some flowers.\n\nParking the car across the street from the house, we both started walking towards the entrance. Standing there, staring at the front door, holding Lisa by the hand tight, trying to compose myself, what to say when the door opens. Reaching out to press the doorbell struggling while holding the flowers in the same hand, I jumped back when the door suddenly opened. A lady rushes out of the house, running down the path. A second woman appears from inside which I recognise straight away. \n\nShe shouts to the one running. \"Don't forget the.....!\" She noticed me standing there. It was my sister Jane. She just stood there staring at me, not knowing how to react.\n\n\"Hi, Jane.\"\n\nShe ran at me, embracing me while squeezing me tight in her arms. \"I am so sorry for what I said that night, please forgive me, Steve. Putting her head on my shoulder, she started crying.\n\nStroking the back of her head while I held her tight, whispering in her ear. \"Hey, everything is ok now.\" Wiping the tears from her eyes with my thumb. \"We can't have mum seen you like this on her birthday.\" \n\nSmiling at me she took my hand, pulling me into the house, dragging me through a crowded living room into the kitchen, Lisa following behind. Reaching her destination, she shouted. \"Mum!\"\n\nMum had her back to us. Hearing Jane's voice, she turned quickly to face us. I was standing not more than a meter from her, face to face. Opening her arms, she looked up at the ceiling as she said. \"Thank you, Lord, for answering my prayers.\" Stepping forward, she embraced me as she cried tears of happiness.\n\nThe next few hours we celebrated mums birthday, the family came to wish her a happy birthday, everyone was delighted to see me back. My brother and sister were interrogating Lisa to see if she was good enough for me. Mum loved her straight away, thanking Lisa for standing by me. Everything was perfect until an unexpected visitor came to the party. It was Peter, the owner of the caf\u00e9 I was in the evening before I visited Barry.\n\n\"We need to talk in private Steve.\" Leading him outside to the garden, sliding close the patio door behind him.\n\nSeen the series look on his face, I was sure it was something to do with that evening in his caf\u00e9. \"Peter I am sorry about what happened at your restaurant that night. I promise I won't come again.\"\n\n\"Steve I couldn't care less what those bums said that night, as far as I know, you were ok. You did whatever any reasonable person would have done, just walked away. It's regards something else I need to talk to you about.\" What Peter said to me next shocked me so much, I was shaking from anger. Picking up one of the garden chairs I smashed it against the wall, as it disintegrated in my hand. Opening the patio door, Chris appeared. \"What's happened Steve is everything ok? \n\n\"I need to go, Chris.\"\n\n\"What's happened, Steve, don't you run away again?\"\n\n\"I have to go and find him now!\" I shouted as I pushed Chris out of the way, rushing out of the house towards the car. Getting into the driver's seat, I held the steering wheel so tight my knuckles went white. Looking ahead of me, standing in front of the car was Lisa.\n\nWith her hands on the bonnet, she shouted. \"What's going on Steve?\" Looking to my right, Jane and Chris just stood there waiting to see what will happen next.\n\n\"This is my problem Lisa, not yours or anyone else's! So can you move out of the way!\" I shouted. Starting the engine, I revved it a couple of times, hoping it would make her move out of the way.\n\nShaking her head from left to right, she replied. \"No Steve, your problems are my problems as well.\" Pointing over to Chris and Jane, she also said. \"They have a saying to this as well.\" \n\nNot to delay anymore I shouted. \"Get in the car!\" As Chris and Jane climbed into the back seat, Lisa got on the passenger side. I put my foot down on the accelerator, rushing to get to my destination as soon as possible. It didn't take Chris long to see where I was heading. Once I parked the car outside the house, he confirmed it to the others.\n\n\"Jesus Christ this is Cody's house, this isn't going to end well,\" Chris said.\n\n\"Is that the guy......!\"\n\nBefore Lisa could finish her sentence, I finished it for her. \"Yes, that's the guy I was in the accident with a few years back.\" Climbing out of the car, I started walking towards the house. The others following me like pilot fish following a shark. I wanted to tell them to wait in the car, but that would have triggered another argument with Lisa.\n\nWithout any delay, I started ringing the bell, leaving my finger on it longer than you normally would. \"Ok I'm coming, I heard you.\" It was a male voice. It sounded like Cody. When the door opened, it wasn't Cody. It was his father.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here, you've got some balls showing your face on my doorstep.\" Was his reaction as soon as he saw me.\n\nHe stepped forward, expected me to back up, but I did the opposite, coming to the point why I was there. \"I want to speak to Cody?\"\n\n\"Cody doesn't live here anymore. What do you want with my son? Did you just get out of jail, what you're looking to buy some drugs?\"\n\nClutching his shirt with one hand, I pulled my arm back, ready to slam my fist into him. That is when I felt someone pull my arm back. Standing there was Sarah, Cody's sister. It seemed life hadn't been too good to her. She was half the weight of the person I knew six years ago. She had dark shadows under her eyes. Seen her like that, I released her father at once. \n\n\"Go inside dad. I've got this\" Without saying anything her father just walked back into the house.\n\nOnce her father was out of view, I looked at her for a while before I spoke. \"Sarah I need an honest answer from you. The night of the accident what happened after we left Mcdonald's?\n\n\"You know what happened Steve. We got into that terrible accident, where that boy lost his life.\"\n\nPutting my hands on her shoulder's I gave her a little shake, scared to put any pressure as she looked so brittle. \"Who was driving, when the accident happened Sarah?\"\n\n\"You were driving, can't you remember?\"\n\nShaking her a little harder, at the same time squeezing her arms harder, I repeated myself with the tone of my voice higher. \"Who was driving the car, Sarah?\"\n\nShe looked at me, her eyes then focused on the others behind me. Shaking her slightly, she turned her vision back to me staring at me straight in the eyes. Looking at her, I waited for the answer I wanted to hear.\n\nTurning her head to look away she answered. \"Cody was driving the car that night. He was the one that crashed the car, killing that boy. You were too wasted to walk not alone drive.\"\n\n\"Why say I was driving? Sending me to prison for so many years, locking me up? Why Sarah? Why? I said as I released her from my grip.\n\nI am sorry Steve, he threatened me. He said if I said anything he would hurt me bad, make my life a misery. Forget about him Steve he's a bad man, an evil man.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He race's with other drivers for money now.\"\n\nWhere?\n\n\"Please forget about him and carry on with your life.\"\n\nWhere can I find him, Sarah? I shouted.\n\n\"On Sunday they race at Lieutenant Ellis Way, near Cheshunt in Broxbourne.\"\n\n\"That's the road after the big roundabout for the M25, near Broxbourne FC!\" Chris shouted from behind. Lisa and Jane turn to him, giving him a dirty look.\n\n\"What did I do?\" Chris said.\n\n\"It's not what you did. It's what you said stupid.\" Jane said.\n\nDriving to Broxbourne, all four of us were silent. You could sense the tension in the car. Focused on the drive, calmed me down a bit, I was still angry with Cody, but at the end of the day, he did save my life by pulling me out of the burning vehicle. Lisa just stared out of the windshield, probably thinking what I will do next. Chris and Jane must have been thinking the same as Lisa as they were quiet as well.\n\nIt was starting to get dark when we reached our destination. Driving down Lieutenant Ellis Way, I could see in the distance a brightly lit area. The lights were coming from Broxbourne FC's car park. Slowly driving into the car park, it felt like entering a car racing movie scene. With the parking full of cars modified with aftermarket body kits. \n\nGathered next to a small structure, which seemed like the football grounds changing rooms, I noticed a group of young men standing around two vehicles. Letting the Vantage roll slowly towards the crowd, trying not to rev the engine too much, not to attract anyone's attention.\n\nChris is leaning forward, between the front seats, thinking he would get a closer look at what the group of men were doing. He said. \"Why are they all gathered there for?\"\n\nJane is sitting on my side of the car, leaning towards the driver's window, she was so close I could feel her breathing on my neck. With no hesitation, she answers Chris's question. \n\n\"They are Boy Racers dribbling around a car!\" \n\nWith my window open, my sister saying it loud enough, it got everyone's attention. There goes the element of surprise. \"I knew I should have come alone,\" I said\n\nAs the group of Boy Racers started to approach the vantage with looks of daggers, I just froze thinking what's going to happen next. That is when I saw him standing next to a muscle car. It was a Ford Mustang GT With a 5.0L, V8 engine, the knowledge I had about this car was, with the right modifications you could get over 500 BHP from this beast. Sarah was right her brother was into illegal racing big time.\n\nClimbing out of the car with a crowbar in my hand, I started walking towards the crowd at the same time shouting.\n\n\"Cody!\"\n\nEveryone stopped, turning towards Cody, waiting for his reaction. For a moment I started to believe it was a statue of him. For almost a minute he did not twitch a muscle.\n\n\"Cody, we need to talk about the night of the accident?\"\n\nHis worshippers looked at me. Once I finished everyone turned their heads to look at him, waiting for him to give me an answer.\n\n\"We don't talk here we race.\" It wasn't the answer I was waiting to hear. To others, it was the right answer, as the crowd erupted in cheers.\n\n\"Let's do it!\" I shouted without thinking.\n\nGetting into the car, I didn't even turn to look at Lisa. She opened the door, stepped out followed by Chris and Jane. Before closing the door, she said.\n\n\"If you go ahead with this, you are the same as him.\" I turned to say something, but she stopped me by speaking first. \"Goodbye Steve, don't come looking for me, after this.\" Closing the door, she walked away.\n\nHow did I get myself in this situation, the day started so perfectly, and now I am sitting on Lieutenant Ellis Way, preparing myself to race with someone I considered my best friend six years ago. With both hands on the steering wheel, I looked ahead, next to my car was Cody in the Mustang, every few seconds he would rev the engine, feeling the rumble every time he stepped on the accelerator.\n\nThe crowd standing on either side of the road were eager to see the race start. It was a two-mile stretch of road either way to the roundabout and back. From the crowd, a blonde appeared in a short black dress, wearing high heels. Standing with her legs slightly apart she lifted both her hands up, on dropping them, that is when the race starts.\n\nLooking at the blonde, smiling at me, turning to Cody he was holding tight on the steering. His neck stretched out eager to put his foot down on the accelerator. Looking at my rear view mirror, Lisa and my siblings were walking away. \"Goodbye, Steve.\" Those two words kept on replaying in my mind. Looking back at Cody, he was a man possessed, ready to explode. \"No way I was the same as this guy.\" Turning back to the rear view mirror, all three of them were disappearing into the dark. With my hand on the gear stick, I pushed it all the way to the right and up. Releasing the clutch, I slowly reversed till the car was next to Lisa. When I stopped, she stopped as well. Looking at each other for a moment before I spoke.\n\n\"Let's go home.\" She didn't smile, but I saw how happy she was through her eyes.\n\nAll three of them got into the car and buckled up. My sister leant forward, kissing me on the cheek. \"I'm proud of you little brother,\" she said.\n\nIt didn't take long, another car took my spot, getting ready to race against Cody. Watching the same scene, I was looking at ten minutes ago, from further away, from a different angle. The blonde with her arms up in the air, preparing to start the race. My eyes wandered to the back of Cody's car, stopping on the tarmac behind the Mustang. When Blondie dropped her arms, the two vehicles shot off as the crowd cheered on.\n\n\"Something is wrong!\" I screamed as I put my foot down on the pedal, flying past the spectators, covering them with a cloud of white smoke from my rear wheels spinning. \"When Cody started the race I noticed a trail of liquid on the tarmac. It came from under his car. If it is brake fluid he won't be going around the roundabout, he will be going over it!\" I informed the others as I drove the Vantage hard, making it leap forward every time I changed gear. I could see both cars in the distance, as they raced to see who will get to the roundabout first. ",
        "I was gaining distance on the two cars, but they were almost at their turning point where they would need to brake hard to go around the roundabout. I could see the roundabout in the distance in front of them. Suddenly the Mustang swerved to the left, out of view. Getting closer I braked hard, stopping the Aston Martin with screeching tyres twenty metres away from the Mustang, which at this point crashed into the embankment. The other car flew passed me on its way back to the victory line.\n\nTurning to Lisa, I shouted. \"Call 999 emergency services!\"\n\nLeaping out of the car, I ran to the Mustang, opening the driver's door to get attacked by a cloud of smoke. It was so thick I could barely see Cody, leaning unconsciously on the steering wheel. Covering my mouth, at the same time trying to find the seat belt release mechanism. My eyes were burning, at the same time, I could feel my lungs filling up with smoke. Click, on releasing it, Cody's body dropped into my arms. Getting a good grip on him, I started to drag him out of the car, getting a good distance from it before I collapsed on my back with Cody on top of me. Pushing him of my body, I tried to breathe with no success as everything went black.\n\n\"Open your eyes. Steve open your eyes.\" Taking a deep breath, I released it as I opened my eyes to see Lisa in front of me. I drifted back into darkness as her voice slowly became distant.\n\nEpilogue\n\nBeep beep beep.\n\nIt was the sound of a heart monitor in a hospital. Opening my eyes, the first thing I saw was a nurse standing over me. \"Hi, sleepyhead.\" She said.\n\nTrying to speak, I felt a sharp pain in my throat. In a whisper, you could barely hear I said. \"Lisa.\"\n\n\"That must be the pretty young lady, who has been by your side since they brought you in. Let me call her, she was speaking with the doctor.\"\n\nA few moments later, Lisa rushed into the room, grasping my head she started kissing me all over the face. Within half hour my room was full of friends and relatives making a commotion over me, until the doctor intervened, letting only Lisa and my mum stay until visiting ours were over.\n\nLike I suspected, the brakes on Cody's car were tampered with, causing him not to be able to slow down. He survived the accident. I guess we were even, on saving each other's life. I stayed in the hospital for two days. The night before my release, I visited Cody in his room. Walking into the room, I found him sitting up in bed with the TV remote in his hand. Seen me approach him, he pressed the power button on the remote to switch off the TV. I just stood there beside his bed, waiting to see his reaction.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he spoke. \"I was driving that night. I am to blame for the accident. Please forgive me for lying to the police.\" Putting my hand on his shoulder, I nodded my head up and down, while I smiled at him, Turning away I left the room, never to see Cody again.\n\nHe did time in prison, not for careless driving, but for what the police found in the boot of the Mustang. How much time he got, I have no idea. All I know, he is doing his sentence in HM Prison Birmingham.\n\nI visited Barry one last time, as Lisa wanted to meet my mentor. Holding my fiancee by the hand, we approached him. When we got near, I tried to embrace him again, but he stopped me. Gesturing us to sit down he said.\n\n\"What did I tell you about visiting me.\"\n\n\"My fiancee wanted to meet you.\"\n\nLisa did most of the talking, asking him about my time in prison. We talked about our plans for the future. We stayed for an hour until one of the guards said to him.\n\n\"Five more minutes Barry.\"\n\nWith a series look on his face, he said. \"What do you want me to do with this guy called Cody?\" After saying these words, he just sat there staring at me, waiting for an answer.\n\nI looked at Lisa then looked at Barry, smiling I gave him my answer. \"Teach him to be good, to respect. Show him the good path, like you showed me.\"\n\n\"I will introduce him to Maggie in the morning.\" He replied with a smile.\n\nGetting ready to leave, I put my hand out to give him a handshake. He surprised us both by opening his arms to embrace us both in a tight hug. On releasing us, he disappeared with the guard to his cell.\n\nWe have been together for almost two years. Not married yet, but we have bought a two bedroom flat in Welwyn Garden City. Lisa has opened a small architects office in the centre of town, which is doing well. With some money I saved, working for Patsy, I opened a small garage, specialising in custom work on classic cars. During the weekends I still help Patsy out at the Inn for a few hours.\n\nSunday we spend with Lisa's parents or my mum's place with Chris and Jane. This Sunday we are celebrating our two year anniversary around Ryans. Enjoying a lovely roast beef, which was prepared by his ex-wife Joanna. \n\nThe weekend we went to my mother's birthday party, Ryan wasn't golfing with his friends, he invited his ex-wife to Hanbury Manor for the weekend. They started seen each other, taking it easy. It's been six month's now that Joanna moved back home.\n\nWith the bonnet up, I was explaining to Ryan about a part of the Aston Martin. Joanna entered the garage with a tray of cups, while Lisa followed her, trying to keep up with her.\n\n\"Honey take it easy, you can't run around like that in your condition!\" I said.\n\nRyan lifts his head out of the engine bay hitting it on the bonnet. Hard enough to get our attention. \"I've got the perfect name if it's a boy.\" He said.\n\nAll three of us waiting in anticipation to hear the name.\n\n\"Vantage. If It's a Boy, you should call him Vantage.\" \n\nLisa looked at Ryan with frowned eyes. \"I am not calling my baby after a car name.\"\n\nAll four of us started laughing, while we enjoyed our coffee. Discussing the different names, we could give our baby which was due in a few weeks. "
