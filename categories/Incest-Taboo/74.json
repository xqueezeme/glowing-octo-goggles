Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental.\n\n*****\n\nThe past six weeks had been quite the adventure since that night in Paris. We headed home after the assignment had ended and spent a week in New York. Then we went to Alabama to see Jordan and Kelly and the new baby. We told them we were getting married and we needed their services as the best man and the matron of honor. They were so happy for us and gladly accepted the job.\n\nAfter that we went to Berlin for three weeks before going home again. We went to Florida and told our parents that we were getting married and soon. We wanted to get married in early June before training camp and the preseason started. If we didn't do it before then, we wouldn't be able to until February after the season was over.\n\nAfter that we were back on the road again. This time it was Barcelona. So far this was my favorite place we had gone. It was near the water, the temps were pleasant and her office was just around the corner. There wasn't a whole lot for her to do here but buy a few things and make sure things were running smoothly before we headed home again. I was thankful that Carrie sent her here this time around. It gave us a really good chance to plan the wedding and get everything in order.\n\n\"What do you think about these?\" Jamie cheered as she came into the living room.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\n\"The center pieces I'd like to have on the tables.\"\n\n\"They look nice,\" I offered.\n\n\"Or do you think we should use these?\" She pointed to a picture of another center piece she had looked at earlier in the week.\n\n\"I like those ones,\" I smiled.\n\nShe looked at my look and giggled a little. \"You don't really care do you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I paused. \"I like them but I'm not going to notice them. I'm going to be focused on you.\"\n\n\"Typical guy,\" she sassed.\n\n\"We need to figure out where exactly we are going to get married,\" I said. \"You've given a list of ideas but you haven't really said firmly where you want to do this at.\"\n\n\"I kind of like the beach idea at sunset like Kelly did.\"\n\n\"That was nice and it would be a sentimental thing since that's where we had our first real kiss but...\"\n\n\"But what?\" she asked.\n\n\"Dad said you couldn't hear the vows and you couldn't see us because the sun was blinding them and the waves drowned out their voices.\"\n\n\"True,\" she smiled. \"But it did provide us some cover when we snuck off after the pictures.\"\n\n\"You were such a bad girl,\" I smiled as I thought about it.\n\n\"But you didn't turn me down,\" she sassed.\n\n\"I'd never turn you down,\" I smiled.\n\n\"Well...where do you want to do it then?\" she asked. \"Maybe Paris on the bridge where you asked me. I've seen it done there before. That's sentimental.\"\n\n\"How is everybody going to afford that? How are Jordan and Kelly going to get here with a baby? And Bobby and Mary? Libby is still going to be our flower girl isn't she?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she sighed. \"You're right.\"\n\n\"I like that idea but I just don't think it's feasible to have everyone come all the way over here.\"\n\n\"Do you have an idea?\" she asked.\n\n\"Actually,\" I smiled. \"I just thought of one. What if...what if we ask Steve if we can use the house and have it there? Its big enough, it's not too far and it's out of the way.\"\n\n\"That's a brilliant idea Owen,\" she cheered. \"I didn't even think of that.\"\n\n\"I'm not just a pretty face,\" I smiled.\n\n\"No,\" she teased. \"Maybe sexy, but not pretty.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" I joked. \"Be nice bad girl.\"\n\nShe shrilled as I stepped forward and smacked her butt hard. The thin material of her capri pants did nothing to protect her ass from my hard smack.\n\n\"Ouch Owen,\" she cried. \"That hurt.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said.\n\n\"Kiss it and make it better,\" she sassed in her little girl voice.\n\n\"Bring it here,\" I smiled.\n\nShe turned and backed up to me as I sat on the couch. My hands caught her hips and pulled her a little closer to me. She giggled a little as my fingers felt the soft skin of her tummy. I lifted her shirt up a little and saw the dimples on her back right at her waistline. I wet my lips and kissed her spine right where her pants started on her back.\n\n\"You smacked my butt Owen,\" she sassed. \"Kiss lower.\"\n\n\"I'll get there,\" I teased.\n\nMy fingers curled around her waist and pulled her pants gently off her hips. Her white lacy boy shorts slowly came into view as her pants left her hips and slid down her legs. I could see the slight red mark on her cheek where I had hit her and I did kind of feel bad. My fingers curled around her waist again and hooked the elastic of her panties. I slowly worked them down her hips as I started kissing her back then down to the cheek I had hit.\n\nShe let out a soft moan as her panties slipped down her legs and joined her pants at her ankles. I let my fingers curl around her hips until I touched her pelvis and the smooth skin that led to her cunny. My lips were working her butt, placing wet and gentle kisses on her skin. I kissed the red hand print on her ass a few times as she stood there and let me kiss her.\n\nI worked my hand around her body to her ass. I cupped it firmly and felt the tender flesh in my fingers. I parted her cheek away from her butt and exposed her cunny in the middle. I smiled to myself as her pink lips opened and showed her excitement already. A little white pearl of moisture hung in the middle.\n\nI circled my fingers around her butt until I touched her cunny. My middle finger spread the juice around on the way to her clit. She was already excited as my finger touched her clit and bumped the excited nub. She let out another moan as one of my fingers slipped into her.\n\n\"That's not my butt Owen,\" she cooed.\n\n\"It's not?\" I teased.\n\n\"No,\" she sassed.\n\n\"Oh, should I stop?\"\n\n\"No,\" she whimpered.\n\nMy finger curled deep inside of her cunny and touched her spot on the inside. Her legs twisted just a little in pleasure before I kissed her cheek again. My other hand started to move under her shirt and up her firm but soft tummy. I let my fingers trace her skin as my lips climbed higher up on her butt again until I was at the small of her back. I licked her spine until I reached her shirt.\n\nShe moaned above me as her hips started to turn against my probing fingers now. I felt them turn ever so slightly at first but now she was pressing her cunny harder into my touch now. Her foot carefully slipped from her pants as she pulled it free. She stood wider now and let my fingers tease her better with more space.\n\nI wanted to taste her now. I could feel her juice leaking from her and running on my fingers. I turned her softly at the hips until she faced me. I silently directed her with my hands until she moved where I wanted her. I didn't move from the couch, I made her rest her free foot on the couch at my side while the other stayed on the floor. She opened her legs wide and moved her hips closer to my lips as I leaned in.\n\nI took a long lick and let my tongue linger on her lips as I tasted her. I knew she was turned on and her taste confirmed that. It was sweet but strong like she always was when she was wet like she was. I flicked her clit with the back of my tongue once I finished my long lick. I kept teasing it, flicking it with the back of my tongue then using the tip to press on it.\n\nIt didn't take her long to moan loudly and run her fingers through my hair. She curled them through my hair and pulled me tighter to her cunny as I lapped at her. I used my hands to grip her butt and pull her harder to my face so I could control her undulations.\n\nShe started turning her hips harder as my tongue continued working her clit. One hand had slipped away from her butt and opened her up. It brought her clit out further and really let me tease it. My lips closed around it as she humped her hips against my face now. Her gasps were louder as she started to cum. Just these little whimpers and squeaks left her mouth as my tongue circled her until she pulled away.\n\nShe had this smoldering sexual look of lust on her face as she smiled down at me. Her hands went quickly to my shorts and pulled on them. I lifted from the couch and let her take them all the way to my ankles. I was barely settled on the couch before she was straddling me and resting in my lap.\n\nMy cock found her wetness quickly as she settled her light weight on my cock. I gasped at how quickly and easily I sank into her cunny. Her cheeks rested on my thighs as her cunny squeezed my cock. Her mouth found mine as my hands gripped her butt again and gave it a firm squeeze.\n\nShe started turning her hips against me. My cock was sliding along her wetness and feeling it grip me with perfection. She gasped into my kiss as her hips eagerly turned against me. I started lifting from the couch to press into her further. We were slapping together now as she panted in my face.\n\nShe changed the pace as she whimpered above me. She settled on my cock and started grinding on me. My cock was pressing so deep into her center now. Every twist of her hips let my cock touch her end. She was so slippery and wet right now, white wetness was running from her and coating my sack as she panted above me.\n\nShe looked down at me as she started to rise and fall on me again. My cock would travel the length of her cunny until just the tip remained inside. Then she would drop back down and let me burry myself all the way until I touched her end. I was pulling her hips harder as she dropped in my lap. I loved that feeling of plunging all the way into her and touching her end.\n\nWe changed silently now. She left my lap and moved to the couch next to me. I stood and looked at her as she leaned down and offered her cunny to me from behind. My feet slipped out of my shorts as I stood and turned to get behind her. Her cunny looked perfect right about now. Swollen and wet, the pink little folds looked so good I had to taste them again. I leaned down and gave her a firm lick tasting her desire.\n\nShe growled and gripped the back of the couch as my tongue touched her lips. I tongued her hole for a minute and tasted what she leaked. She looked over her shoulder at me and begged me with her eyes. My tongue felt good but she wanted my cock. I couldn't resist those eyes and the way they looked at me.\n\nI stood again and found her puss with my cock. I slowly opened her up and watched her pink lips part as the head stretched her open and let me sink into her. I let myself sink into her as she squeezed the couch and turned her knuckles white. She let out another long moan as I reached my max and started to pull out.\n\nI plunged into her with a steady pace. I watched her ass ripple with perfection as my hips bumped into it with each stroke. She moaned loudly and started her dirty talk. I loved that side of Jamie. You'd never think she would be the way she was behind closed doors. I was the only one who got to see that side of her though and I loved her because of it.\n\nShe arched her back more and brought her ass higher in the process. I was pressing down into her cunny as I stood on my toes and picked up the pace a little more. Her cries became more urgent as she grew closer to release. Her legs started trembling as her orgasm tore through her body. Her body shook as she started pressing back into me. I had to grab her body and steady her so she wouldn't slip away.\n\nHer one arm fell away from the couch and gripped my forearm as I steadied her. Her nails dug into my skin as she cried out in pleasure. Her cunny squeezed my cock and sent me over the edge now. Her wetness flooded my cock as my cock filled her with my seed.\n\nShe lifted herself from the couch as my arms pulled her to my body. I was still flooding her cunny as her mouth found mine. We placed these hungry and passionate kisses on each other as my cock still emptied into her. My hips still turned into her as the last of my seed left my body.\n\nWe slowed to almost a stop as we both finished. She panted into my face as she smiled her content and loving smile at me. I loved the way those blue eyes looked at me. I loved the way she smiled and softly stoked my face with her hand. I found her neck and kissed her there as my fingers traced her throat. Felt her breath catch as I traced her neck. She chewed her lip the way she did as I looked at her face again.\n\n\"Hmm, fuck Owen,\" she growled.\n\n\"I know,\" I smiled. \"Too bad you have to go back to work now.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" she growled again. \"There wasn't a whole lot going on there today. Maybe I can call off for the rest of the day and spend it in bed with you.\"\n\n\"That would be twice this week,\" I teased.\n\nShe giggled now. \"I have been skipping work a lot haven't I?\"\n\n\"It's up to you baby,\" I teased still. \"I could go for seconds. And thirds.\"\n\n\"Bad boy,\" she sassed in her little girl voice. \"Tomorrow's Friday, then we have the weekend to do whatever. I better go back in.\"\n\nI slipped from her but caught her before she could turn and leave. I found her mouth and kissed her lightly. My tongue found hers as we tangled them slowly together. I tasted her kiss for a minute before I finally let her go.\n\n\"I love you baby,\" I smiled.\n\nShe smiled up at me. Her perfect and content smile that said she loved me without a word. \"Love you too Owen.\"\n\nShe kissed me again before she slipped by me. I watched her go before I put my shorts back on and looked at the center piece she had brought home for my opinion. It looked nice and it would do.\n\n\"Do you really like it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I smiled. \"It's perfect.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to call Carrie and ask her or are you going to call Steve?\"\n\n\"I'll call,\" I replied. \"It was my idea.\"\n\n\"Alright baby,\" she cheered. \"I'll be back by five so we can get some dinner.\"\n\n\"Later baby,\" I smiled.\n\nThe apartment was quiet now that she had left. I sat on the couch for a moment and decided if I wanted to work out again or not. I had hit it pretty hard this morning so I was thinking about not doing another one until tomorrow. My phone started ringing from the bedroom. It was very unusual for me to get a call on my phone when we were overseas.\n\n\"Hey Phil,\" I answered.\n\n\"Owen,\" he cheered. \"I didn't wake you did I?\"\n\n\"No,\" I chuckled. \"I don't think we are on the same side of the pond.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" he questioned. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Barcelona Spain.\"\n\n\"Shit,\" he chuckled. \"I guess we aren't are we?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" I chuckled with him. \"It's that time of year you know? Offseason and traveling with Jamie.\"\n\n\"How's it going over there? Am I missing much?\"\n\n\"If you don't like beautiful women then you ain't missing much,\" I joked.\n\n\"I'll be on the next flight over then,\" he laughed.\n\n\"I'll come pick you up.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he laughed still. \"I've got a lot going on over here. No time for a vacation right at the moment.\"\n\n\"You getting ready for the draft?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You know how it is.\"\n\n\"Not really,\" I joked.\n\n\"It's busy right now,\" he offered.\n\n\"I bet.\"\n\n\"Listen, the reason I called you is I have a little bit of business to discuss with you.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I sighed. \"What do you have?\"\n\n\"New York called me and asked me if you would be interested in being traded.\"\n\n\"Traded?\" I asked taken aback. \"Did they give a reason? I pissed them off with the sideline thing didn't I?\"\n\n\"No,\" he chuckled. \"They forgot all about that as soon as the kick went wide left. They have bigger things to worry about than that.\"\n\n\"Ok?\" I questioned.\n\n\"It's nothing you did Owen. It's all business.\"\n\n\"Ok?\"\n\n\"It's nothing against you Owen, trust me. I've been around long enough to know that. It's just a business thing. They screwed up and they have to make a move to fix their own fuck up.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I sighed.\n\n\"Let me explain so you have a little better understanding of what's happening,\" he sighed. \"What's his face played really well the season before you got there so he held out so he could get the deal he wanted and he did. Last year he played like shit. He got hurt, he didn't produce, so on and so forth. You came in and played very well for a rookie. You started three games, played in a few others and played very well. You may not have won all those game but you kept the games competitive. You scored points, made good plays and showed the team you are ready to be a starter.\"\n\n\"This season you are going to come in there and most likely get the starting spot. I can't see you not getting it. You have a year under your belt. You understand the ins and outs of the pros now and your game is only going to improve. He's on the downslide right now. He's getting older and that one good year was probably his peak. You follow me so far?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" I sighed. \"If I'm that good then why would they want to trade me?\"\n\n\"Business Owen,\" he sighed. \"It's all about the dollars. I see it going like this. You get that starting spot next year and play well. You give the team a winning record and maybe you take them to the playoffs. The following season I come in there and tell them you want more money and a new deal to secure your future. You need X amount of money to be happy and comfortable. You know the drill.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I smiled to myself. More money did sound good to me.\n\n\"The problem with that is pretty simple. They signed him to a four year deal worth a lot more money than I would have paid him given his age and r\u00e9sum\u00e9. With you wanting more money, it's going to cut into the cap space by having two high dollar quarterbacks on the roster. They won't be able to attract talent in other positions without them having money to offer.\"\n\n\"The logical thing seems simple and I know it's what you're thinking. Trade him away to free up some cap space. And they want to do that but who's going to take a guy with that amount of money attached to his name at that stage of his career? I can't think of anybody.\"\n\n\"So you think of the next option. Dump him and focus on you. And that's all fine and dandy but...if they dump him they still have to pay him the guaranteed money he has coming to him and it's still going to count against the cap. They are in a no win situation right now so they have to clear up some cap space to save their asses.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" I sighed as I thought.\n\n\"They don't want to trade you Owen but they have to really. They are going to pick another quarterback in the draft, sign him to a three year deal and wait for the other contract to expire. With the CBA deal they just signed, the new guy can't come in there and ask for the moon. He's bound by the deal for three years. In three years the other contract runs out and he gets dumped that way.\"\n\n\"I guess,\" I sighed. \"It makes sense if you look at it that way.\"\n\n\"They are doing you a favor by asking you this to be honest,\" Phil said. \"They could do the dick move and dump your contract and pay you the two hundred they owe you in guaranteed money and tell you good luck. Then you would have to try and find a team and hope for the best. If they trade you, they will help sell you just like I'm going to help sell you. It sounds complicated and it is but...this is a better deal to take a trade rather than take your chances again.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I sighed long and hard. \"Who is interested in me?\"\n\n\"I can think of four teams off the top of my head. I haven't made any calls since I have to ask you about it first. We put that no trade clause in your contract so you have to clear it before you can be traded.\"\n\n\"How long have you known about this?\" I interrupted him.\n\n\"I found out about it last night around five. I was busy so I told them I would get ahold of you today and give them an answer as quick as I could.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" I sighed. \"So who is interested in me?\"\n\n\"Like I said I haven't made any calls but four teams come to mind since they are looking for a quarterback. Oakland, Tampa, Miami, and Cleveland.\"",
        "\"You can forget about Oakland,\" I hissed.\n\n\"I'll make a note of that,\" he chuckled.\n\n\"What about Tampa?\" I asked. \"That would be cool since it's close to where I grew up.\"\n\n\"You don't want anything to do with Tampa Owen,\" he said quickly. \"It would be a nice story but that's about all it would be is a nice story. If you hated losing in New York, you're going to hate losing in Tampa just as much.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Ownership sucks Owen,\" he said flatly. \"They have a coaching carousel down there. They don't have a line to protect you, they have one decent receiver, no running backs, and I couldn't tell you anyone on defense but the one guy that I work for. Until they actually take winning seriously, I'd stay way far away from them. The only thing you are going to get out of Tampa is being on somebody else's highlight reel.\"\n\n\"Since you put it that way,\" I sighed. \"Where should I go then?\"\n\n\"Miami is the place to go. They had three different quarterbacks start last season so they don't have a clear starter. They have a pretty good line, good receivers, an up and coming back, and the defense plays very well. Hell, with all the change at quarterback they still almost made the playoffs.\"\n\n\"The coaches are good. The system they run fits your style of play. You're not the classic, drop back, pocket passer like New York is trying to make you. They use boot legs and quarterback movement to create angles and passing lanes. It's right up your alley and you will only excel if you get into that type of system.\"\n\n\"The city itself is a great place to be too. You have South Beach, the malls, and lots of fashion for Jamie. The real estate is top notch, the weather is perfect, and the fans are very loyal. Now I'm not saying that you will end up in Miami, it's just something I can think of from the top of my head. You have to give me the green light to send my feelers out there and see what is really out there.\"\n\n\"Is there any way I can stay in New York?\" I asked. \"Jamie has her job up there, I've got a place up there, I've got friends up there. It would be a huge change to move anywhere from there. Jamie and I are finally at a place in our lives where we are really, really happy and I don't want to change a whole lot.\"\n\n\"Look, I know it's hard and it's going to be a big change but I think this could be a very good change. It would get you out of New York and put you on a team that needs just that one last piece of the puzzle to really compete for a championship. New York is nice but let's face it, they are aging and they have a lot of cap issues. They won't get good for at least five more years if they play their cards right and start rebuilding now. You don't want to wait five years to even complete for a title. I hate to play the devil's advocate but...what if the what if happens? The average career for a player is about six years. You don't want to spend the next five playing for nothing. Get on a team that has a chance now.\"\n\nI sighed long and hard now as I thought.\n\n\"Owen, I get this all the time. You're a smart kid but you aren't thinking like the owners think. This is a business. No matter how it looks on TV or on paper, it's not a game. It's a business and they are going to make a business move whether you want them to or not. I get you like it there because you have everything going for you right now, but you have to stop thinking like you are in college and think like a business man.\"\n\n\"He's not getting traded. At least I can't imagine him getting traded. With his lack luster season last year, his off the field comments about the team, his age, and his contract that he would take with him if he were traded, it just doesn't look good. If I was an owner or GM, I wouldn't even consider touching him. You on the other hand, you had a great season given what you had to work with. You've got a great football IQ and played with more poise than your experience shows. You're something a team is looking for. I'd get out while the getting is good. Otherwise they might just say sorry kid, it's just the nature of the business and see you later. Then what do you do?\"\n\nI sighed again. \"I guess go ahead and explore my options. I don't know how I'm going to break it to Jamie. She got her career off to a great start but this is going to put a damper on that. I can't see her staying in New York while I'm somewhere else. We have already fought that battle and are done with it. Plus, I just asked her to marry me.\"\n\n\"You did?\" he cheered. \"Congratulations Owen. I figured that was coming sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I smiled. \"We have been busy planning everything out.\"\n\n\"That's another thing you have to think about then,\" he said. \"You and Jamie are getting hitched, you know what happens next don't you? You guys are going to start a family.\"\n\n\"Yeah, eventually we will,\" I chuckled.\n\n\"So she can't be traveling forever,\" he offered. \"Somebody is going to have to focus on raising a family. With you playing, you can't be there all the time.\"\n\n\"We planned for that already. She was going to step away from traveling once we got married and the season started. She was just going to stay in New York and work from there.\"\n\n\"You get a new deal and it secures your future,\" he said. \"That's one less thing you'd have to worry about in the future.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" I sighed.\n\n\"You're going to be ok Owen,\" Phil said confidently. \"You are going to go someplace with more opportunity and sign a big deal next year and make more money than you ever thought possible. You just have to get through the uncertainness of moving and you will be just fine. You are a great athlete and the sky is the limit for you. Don't be stuck on New York. Take the opportunity and the experience and learn from it.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" I sighed. \"I kind of feel...let down in some way. Like they don't want me or something.\"\n\n\"It's business Owen,\" Phil said again. \"But use that as motivation to improve and play with a chip on your shoulder. Show them they made a mistake by trading you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I smiled now. \"If I do go to Miami I would get to play them twice a year.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" he laughed a little. \"Listen, I have one more thing I'd like to run by you if you don't mind?\"\n\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\n\"I know a guy who has worked with some of the big names in the sport to develop them more for playing in the pros. I'm not saying you are a bad player, I'm just saying he can elevate your game and bring you from good to better to maybe elite if you give him a chance. You have the mental aspect of the game down pretty well. You decipher defenses better than I have ever seen for such a young player. You have intangibles that GMs look for when they try to find a future player. The only thing you need to continue to improve on is your footwork and your mechanics. This guy will find a comfortable set up for you and get you comfortable with it. It will only elevate your game to the next level if you give him a chance.\"\n\n\"Where do I sign up?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll give him a call and see what he has. But...you would have to spend a month or so of your time with him. It wouldn't be go and visit him for a day and then go home to do whatever it is that you do. It's a commitment if you do it. I'm throwing a lot at you but it's an investment that will pay off.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to commit if it means I'll have a better chance at running the show and not watching the show,\" I replied.\n\n\"That's what I like to hear Owen. I'll give him a call here in a few minutes and get you in. Then I'll call New York and let them know you are willing to be traded. Then I'll call around and see what teams are interested in you. It might be tomorrow before I call back but I'll get back with you. I've got a lot of other stuff happening right now.\"\n\n\"Just don't send me to Oakland Phil,\" I joked. \"I don't think Jamie would like that very much.\"\n\n\"I'll make sure you don't end up there,\" he chuckled.\n\n\"So, when's the big day and what should I get you guys?\"\n\n\"The first week in June. Just bring yourself, I don't need anything.\"\n\n\"Is this my official invite?\" he chuckled.\n\n\"It's going to be in the mail here shortly. I have to make a call and get the wedding site squared away before I print out the invitations.\"\n\n\"You're really going to invite me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, yeah. Why wouldn't I? I don't just consider you my agent, I consider you my friend too.\"\n\n\"Well...friend,\" he chuckled. \"I'll look for the invitation and I'll get on the search to find you a new home.\"\n\n\"Thanks phil.\"\n\n\"We will be in touch Owen. If not today then tomorrow.\"\n\nI hung up the phone and sighed to myself. Here we go again, life is pulling us in different directions all over again.\n\n*\n\nJamie and I both got up early the next morning. We were both in the living room laying on the floor doing our own morning routines for workouts. I was doing pushups, sit-ups and some stretching. She was on the floor next to me stretching and doing some yoga to relax herself. I hadn't said anything about the phone call from Phil yet. In my mind I knew my time in New York was all but over but I still had hope that maybe it would work out somehow.\n\nI had just finished a set and I was resting on the floor looking over at Jamie. She smiled at me softly as she pushed herself from the floor and arched her back hard, forming a bridge with her body. The years of dance and cheer still left her body more than flexible. She curled her body around and could almost stick her head between her legs at her feet. She held the pose and smiled at me as I watched her.\n\nI glanced at her face and returned her smile before looking a little higher to her cunny. The tight boy shorts she wore right now clung to her cunny and made a defined outline of her middle. I looked for a minute before she pushed her feet up to the ceiling and started doing a handstand with little effort. She held the pose for a moment before she twirled around and gently returned to the floor on her tummy.\n\nI watched her as she lay there for just a moment. I followed the soft curves of her body down to her ass. The way it stuck off her body was tantalizing at the moment. It was this perfect curve of flesh that pushed away and stuck out so perfectly. Of course she noticed I was looking and arched her back just a little to push it out further. I looked at it for another moment before I rolled to my stomach and got ready for another set of pushups.\n\nShe smiled and tried to copy me now. We went up and down together for about twenty before she started to slow down and I pulled ahead of her. I continued on as she stopped and rested on her tummy again. I did about fifty in that set before I stopped and rolled to my back. I lifted my legs up and held them before starting some butterfly kicks. She quickly rolled over and followed my lead and did them with me.\n\nWe finished then rested again. There was still this playfulness between us as we lay there. She smiled at me with her perfect smile and giggled a little when I blew her a kiss. She rolled on her side as I lay there and watched her. She started lifting her one leg in the air until it was stretched vertical. My eyes darted to the gap between her legs as she did. I couldn't quite see what was between but I let my imagination fill in the blanks.\n\n\"Perv,\" she sassed.\n\n\"I know,\" I chuckled.\n\nShe rolled over to do the other leg now. I still watched as she lifted. Her boy shorts pulled tight against the center and hugged her cheeks just right. I was tempted to roll over and touch her right in between but I resisted for now. I turned over and got ready to do more pushups. I started again as she rolled over and watched me.\n\n\"Show off,\" she teased.\n\n\"You do just fine for a girl,\" I offered.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" she giggled again.\n\n\"Get on my back please.\"\n\n\"You have to get twenty out of this one,\" she ordered.\n\n\"Shouldn't be a problem,\" I smiled.\n\nShe rested her body on my back and gripped my chest as I started. Her weight wasn't hard to lift but it added a little extra strain. I did ten easily then slowed to really stress my body by going slow. I reached nineteen before she tickled my sides and made me drop to the floor. We both lay there laughing as she continued to tickle me.\n\n\"Cheater,\" I chuckled.\n\n\"I know,\" she giggled.\n\nShe pressed her weight on my body again and kissed my neck. Her wet little kiss sent a chill down my spine as she did. I just lay there with a smile on my face as she kissed my neck wetly to tease me.\n\n\"I love you,\" she whispered.\n\nI turned now until I was on my back. She rolled with me until she was face to face with me. Her nails lightly scratched my chest as she lowered herself down until my mouth found hers. It was a tender kiss now. She giggled between kisses as our tongues traced each other's. My hands started running the length of her body until I was at her hips. I felt the little points on her sides before my hands cupped her ass and gave it a firm squeeze.\n\nI slipped my fingers inside her panties and cupped her ass skin to skin. She let out a growl as my fingers traced her lips. I felt her wetness as I teased the soft flesh between her legs. She giggled into my kiss before she pulled away and looked at me with her smile.\n\n\"I'm wet,\" she said seductively.\n\n\"You don't say,\" I teased.\n\n\"Umm hmm,\" she growled.\n\n\"Take your panties off and I will see what I can do about that,\" I smiled.\n\n\"You take them off,\" she sassed.\n\nWe both rolled now as she shrilled with laughter. She was on her back with me between her legs. I sat on my heels and gripped her panties and started to pull them from her body. She yielded and lifted her ass off the floor to let me take them. I rolled them from her legs and tossed them aside before looking at her cunny. It was already wet as the pink folds parted slightly. I looked back at her face as I started to slide my shorts off my hips. She chewed her bottom lip as I tossed them to the floor next to her panties.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said standing.\n\nShe reached for my hands and let me pull her from the floor. I picked her up once she was standing and held her. She wrapped her arms and legs around my body. She climbed higher into my grip as I pointed my cock to her cunny. My head opened her pink folds and as she slowly let her body drop. I slipped in so easily now as she held my body and let me fill her.\n\nI adjusted my grip so my arms were under her legs and holding her up. It opened her up more and let me sink just a little deeper into her cunny. She trusted me completely and let me hold her. Her hands cupped my face and pulled me into her kiss. She had a little more passion behind her kiss now. Her tongue dug deeper into my mouth as my hips turned and pressed into her. Little whimpers slipped from her mouth as my cock touched her end with each turn of my hips. I turned us now and started moving us towards the couch.\n\nI leaned with her and gently set her on the couch. She pulled her legs to her chest and opened herself up more for me. I leaned my body down so I could saw into her quicker. I slipped in and out of her quickly as she whimpered below me. I smiled down at her as she closed her eyes and let the pleasure run through her body. I loved that look on her face. The way her nose wrinkled and her mouth hung open as I pressed so deep into her cunny.\n\nHer hips started to turn against my cock now with more urgency. I drove into her faster until she was just about to start before I pulled out. I quickly slipped my fingers into her cunny and curled them around to touch her spot. She panted loudly as she started to cum hard. Her wetness flooded my hand as I curled my fingers in her cunny. I could feel it leaking from her as I slowed just a little and let her thrash around on the couch.\n\nWhite wetness leaked from her as I slipped my fingers from her. I smiled at her as she lay there panting hard trying to recover. She gave her seductive smile at me before she turned from the couch. She was on her knees next to me leaning on the couch. Her ass was pushed out and waiting for me to take her from behind.\n\nI quickly moved behind her and opened her up. My cock found her quickly and slipped back into her. Her cunny gripped me tightly but was soaking wet at the same time. I changed my stance and stood on my feet but leaned over her body. She gasped at how far I was pushed into her now. She arched her back harder and brought it higher off the couch.\n\nI pushed into her hard and fast. My hips banged into her ass and made it ripple with perfection. There was a chorus of whimpers and moans as we both started fucking each other now. I dropped off my feet as I felt myself closing in on release. I leaned down her body and kissed her neck. I loved the feel of her skin against mine.\n\nI placed these wet kissed on her neck as she growled her sexual growl. My hips pressed myself deep into her as I felt myself start to release. She wasn't far behind and started flooding me as I flooded her. We both gasped one last time before I rested against her back and held her. I could feel her smiling as I lay there for a moment and basked in the afterglow of release.\n\nShe turned her head and looked back at me. This perfect and content smile on her face as she looked at me. I kissed her softly before I pulled free and stood now. She climbed to her feet and took me into her arms.\n\n\"I love you Owen. How could I ask for more?\"\n\n\"I know I couldn't,\" I smiled.\n\nShe smiled at me again and kissed me once more before she slipped away.\n\n\"Can you get breakfast started so I can get ready?\"\n\n\"Sure baby,\" I said.\n\nI started cooking as she got ready. By the time she was dressed I had everything ready for her and waiting. She joined me at the table and started digging in.\n\n\"Phil called me yesterday,\" I sighed.\n\n\"Yeah, and?\"\n\nI sighed hard. \"I'm probably going to be traded.\"\n\n\"Traded? To where?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet. He is looking into it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Business,\" I sighed. \"That's what he says anyway. He says the team needs to free up some cap room so I'm on the list.\"\n\n\"But you don't make that much money,\" she said quickly. \"How is trading you going to help?\"\n\n\"Phil seems to think I'm going to be the starter this season. Next year he will ask for more money since I would deserve that if I do well. There wouldn't be enough cap space to fund two high dollar quarterbacks so there choices are to trade me now or trade the other guy. He seems to think that nobody will want him so I'm the one who has to go.\"\n\n\"That seems kind of shitty,\" she hissed.\n\n\"I know,\" I sighed. \"It just sucks. We have everything going for us and now this. Why can't life just be simple for us? Why does it always want to test us?\"\n\n\"To see how strong we really are,\" she said quoting me.\n\nI sighed again. \"Maybe I should just stick it out in New York so you don't have to be without me. So what if I don't make a million dollars?\"\n\n\"Because you deserve it if you are worth it,\" she smiled softly.\n\n\"I said my life was with you. We have a life in New York. I don't want to change that.\"\n\n\"And I said I would quit if you got the job,\" she said quickly. \"Maybe it's time I hold up my end of the deal.\"\n\n\"But you are already stepping down from traveling as it is. I don't want you to give it up all together.\"\n\n\"I'm not staying in New York without you Owen. If I have to quit then I have to quit. Us, me and you, is the most important thing in my life right now. The money, the job, where we live, it doesn't mean anything to me without you with me.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I sighed.\n\n\"Do you know anything other than they want to trade you? Do they know where you are going?\"\n\n\"Nothing yet. He should be calling today to let me know.\"\n\n\"Let's see what happens from there Owen. Then we can worry about it then. I'm not staying in New York without you. So if you go then we go.\"\n\n\"I just hate that you have to make that choice. You enjoy what you do and I enjoy going with you.\"",
        "\"I've always wanted to open my own store. Maybe this is my chance.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I sighed again.\n\n\"Don't worry about it baby,\" she smiled. \"We have each other. That's all the more I need to know.\"\n\n\"I'm glad one of us is positive in all of this,\" I offered.\n\n\"Let me know what happens when you get the call. I have to get going or I will be late.\"\n\n\"Alright baby. Have a great day today.\"\n\n\"I have you to come home to tonight. Every day is a great day when I have that.\"\n\nI smiled at her as she rounded the table and gave me a soft kiss. I sat there as she left the apartment and headed off to work.\n\n*\n\nIt was just about time to go. Me and the guys stood in the room making last minute adjustments to our tuxes before we headed out.\n\n\"I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart that all you guys could be here today,\" I said. \"It means the world to me to have you guys here.\"\n\n\"We wouldn't miss this for nothing Owen,\" Jordan said quickly. \"Besides, I have to pay you back for that embarrassing best man's speech you gave at my wedding.\"\n\nI smiled and shook my head a little as I chuckled. \"Thank you all for being so understanding. I know it's not exactly normal but...\"\n\n\"Owen,\" Shane interrupted now. \"You're happy. That's all that matters.\"\n\n\"Yeah dude,\" Jordan added. \"We have your back and we don't think it's strange. If you're happy then we are happy for you.\"\n\n\"Thanks guys,\" I smiled.\n\n\"Hey Owen,\" my dad said. \"They are ready to go.\"\n\nWe left the room and walked to the front of the crowd to wait for bridesmaids to walk and join us.\n\n\"Is this good daddy?\" Libby called as she threw another handful of flowers onto the ground.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Bobby chuckled along with everyone else that was here for the big day. \"You're doing great honey.\"\n\nShe continued down the path and tossed a few more handfuls out before she reached Bobby. He wrapped her up in a hug as she stood in front of him and looked at the crowd. The violinist started playing as the crowd fell silent and stood to look back.\n\n\"You ready?\" Jordan whispered.\n\n\"I'm standing here still ain't I?\" I chuckled.\n\n\"Not too late to run,\" he joked.\n\n\"If you can do this I certainly can,\" I chuckled.\n\nJamie caught my eye as she came around the corner. She looked stunning and perfect as she slowly walked up the aisle towards me. The white dress hugged her curves on her upper body then flared out at her waist. She had designed it herself and I didn't expect anything less from her as she continued her slow walk towards me. She wore that big smile of hers as her eyes met mine.\n\nTime stood still as she reached me and took my hands in hers. I smiled at her as she tried to keep it together now. She looked absolutely perfect. True to herself, she wore just the slightest amount of makeup. Just some eye shadow and some soft lipstick but that was all she needed.\n\n\"You look so beautiful Jamie,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she smiled her big smile.\n\n\"We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two lives into one. Owen and Jamie have chosen to share their lives together in the vows of marriage. Marriage is a commitment built on trust, sacrifice, love, honor, faith, happiness, and the will to fight for each other. I've gotten to know Owen and Jamie over the past couple of weeks and have listened to their journey together as two separate lives. Hearing their story of struggle and triumph leaves me with little doubt that their love and faith in each other will bring them a lifetime of happiness and joy together.\"\n\nEverything faded away as I focused on Jamie again. He could be telling me my pants were on fire and I wouldn't have heard a word of it. Jamie was the only thing I could focus on right now. It was the most beautiful I had ever seen her in all my years of knowing her. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She smiled shyly at me as I focused on her eyes.\n\nHe continued on talking about being married and how it was a lifelong sacrifice. I was still focused on Jamie as he spoke. She didn't hear a word of anything he said either. It was just the two of us standing here right now. It was just like it had always been, the two of us and nothing else really meaning anything.\n\n\"Owen and Jamie have chosen to write their own vows,\" he said. \"If anyone has any objections, speak now or forever hold your peace.\"\n\nNobody said a word. Nothing but the birds singing and some background noise filled the backyard for a moment before he continued again.\n\n\"Owen,\" he smiled. \"When you are ready you can start.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I smiled. \"I didn't think she was serious when she said we were going to write our own vows.\"\n\nThere was some laughter as I stood there. Jamie smiled as I pulled my notecard from my pocket and looked at it.\n\n\"I really didn't write anything,\" I said. I turned the card around and showed that I wasn't bluffing. My note card was blank. \"I have thought about it for weeks now and wrote a few things down here and there but nothing really felt right. I'm going to speak from the heart.\"\n\nI tossed the card down and took Jamie's hands into mine as I looked at her face. She still wore her smile and trusted me completely.\n\n\"Wow, you look beautiful by the way, absolutely beautiful.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she smiled shyly.\n\nI cleared my throat then started.\n\n\"We both have heard of love at first sight. It's a phrase and part of a story that's as old as time. Two people see each other for the first time and everything stops, everything changes and they just know. I don't remember the first time I saw you, I was just three weeks old back then. My mom said that the first time I saw you was the first time I smiled. Maybe it was love at first sight.\"\n\n\"I remember us growing up together as kid. I remember all the fun, the adventures, the good times we shared, the mischief we got into, and the small amounts of trouble we often found ourselves in because of the mischief. It's a good thing they only found out about half the stuff we did.\"\n\nThere was some laughter as I smiled at Jamie.\n\n\"But the one thing that stands out the most about all the times we shared together was this feeling I had for you. I couldn't put my finger on it back then, I just knew there was something about you that was different from every other girl I had known. Some people call it a crush or puppy love. Whatever it was it was a feeling I couldn't explain.\"\n\n\"It became clear what I was feeling for you that fateful night in late November though. It was the night that I kissed you for the first time. That one kiss sparked a flame that grew my feelings for you deeper and deeper every day after that night. I didn't realize it at the time but that one kiss was the defining moment in my life. It was the last time I would kiss somebody for the first time. That one single kiss changed my life forever. It was the beginning of us.\"\n\n\"I have been on the rollercoaster ride of my life since that night. We have had some incredible highs and some heartbreaking lows in the time we have shared together. But through it all we have fought for each other. We didn't let the weight of the world stop us from staying together and fighting for each other. It's truly what makes our love the most extraordinary thing in the world.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you question why. Why are you so certain about us and why are you so content with me? I'm not perfect and I'm never going to be perfect. My answer has always been the same, because it's you. To me, you are the perfect woman. On the outside you are the most beautiful person I have ever seen. Your smile lights up a room. Your laugh is infectious and brings a smile to my face every time I hear it. When I take you in my arms I still get butterflies in my stomach and I often ask myself as I'm holding you, how did I get so lucky to have someone like you.\"\n\n\"It's not just the physical beauty that I'm in love with though. It's who you are on the inside that sets you apart from everyone else. You inspire me to be a better man because of your character. I've learned to fight for what I believe in. I've learned that I don't need to hide my feelings, my fears, my concerns, and my weaknesses because I have your strength and courage to pull me through. I've learned a countless number of things from you. But the single most important thing that I've learned is that I can't live my life without you by my side. You could take away my football career, the money, the very shirt off my back and it wouldn't bother me as long as I have you. Without you I wouldn't have a meaning and a purpose in life.\"\n\n\"My vow to you is simple Jamie. I promise to love you each and every day with all my heart. I promise to put my back against the wall and fight for you no matter how much the odds are against us. I promise to remind you how important you are to me in the days of doubt. I promise to give you all of myself and not hold back so you will be the happiest woman in the world until my last breath. I'm going to be there for you and give the strength and the courage you ask for so you can make all your dreams come true. You're my best friend in the world, so I'm standing here today, taking your hand, and never letting go. My life wouldn't be the same without you in it. I love you with all my heart.\"\n\nShe smiled at me still, tears in her eyes as I stopped and waited for her now.\n\n\"You really didn't write anything down?\" she sobbed.\n\n\"I have a good memory,\" I smiled.\n\n\"Apparently, my memory isn't as good as Owen's,\" she smiled as she wiped her face. \"I had to write mine down so I wouldn't forget anything.\"\n\nThere was light laughter as she paused to gather herself before she started.\n\n\"Owen, where do I start? You've been more than just my best friend for my whole life. You've been like my knight in shining armor. You've always been there for me in the darkest moments in my life and have given me the courage and the strength to keep on pushing through.\"\n\n\"I remember the first time you came to my rescue. We were just fourteen and at the winter dance in junior high. My date dumped me, lucky for me I might add, and I felt about this big. You found me, took the time to comfort me and made what I thought was a disaster into the perfect night. You were a perfect gentleman that night and made me feel like I was the most important person in the world.\"\n\n\"Four short years later you were there again. You came to my rescue again and made my horrible night into something I never thought possible. We shared our first kiss that night and my life, too, changed forever that night. Somehow I knew that I had just kissed the man I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. Since then I feel like I've been living a dream. A dream where the perfect man comes along and makes a not so perfect girl feel like she is. Our love has only grown from there. I've loved you all my life, I just didn't fully understand it until that night.\"\n\n\"We struggled through the college years, the distance between us, me taking the job and moving to New York, and yes, the break we took from each other. But in all that time you always remained true to your character and told me to have faith in us, that we would make it. You made a promise to me that you would always be there and you have yet to let me down on that promise. At any time you could have thrown your hands in the air, slammed the door and walked out. You could have stopped trying and given up but you never did. You're stubborn and persistent to say the least but always faithful.\"\n\nWe both laughed a little before she looked back down and continued on. \n\n\"People sometimes ask me, how can you be so sure Jamie? How do you know Owen is the one you are meant to spend the rest of your life with? With everything you two have been through, how can you be so certain? The answer is so simple. It's the way you look at me. You look at me like I'm the only woman in the world. It's the love you show me each and every day.\"\n\n\"Love, it's a simple word with a complex meaning. Love is defined as an intense feeling of deep affection, a deep feeling of romantic or sexual attachment to someone. Our kind of love is more than that. I looked at hundreds of poems and listened to hundreds of love songs to try and find a better definition of our love. But I couldn't find anything even close to what we have. I had to define it myself.\"\n\n\"Your love, to me, is the beat of my heart, the air that I breathe, the untouchable feeling I get when I have you by my side. It's the strength you give me when I'm down. It's the laughter you bring into my life. It's the affection you show me when it's just us. It's the little things you tell me and the little things you do for me that make me smile. It's how you make a long and stressful day melt away when you take me into your arms and tell me that you love me. It's the little boost of encouragement you give me when I need it the most. You're my safe place, a shelter in the storm of life, my warmth on a cold winter's night. You're always strong, always faithful, always telling me to chase my dreams, never letting me doubt myself. I've never claimed to be perfect but you always make me feel I am. You pick up where I leave off and complete me. That's love, our kind of love.\"\n\n\"You've done more than just define love in my eyes. You live it, you do it every single day. You've resorted my belief in love because of the way you love me. I didn't think there was such a thing as true love until you came along and showed me that there is. I don't know what I did to deserve you and your love but I'm thankful for each and every day that I have you.\"\n\n\"This life would probably kill me if I didn't have you by my side. I couldn't live without you by my side so I'm going to do my damnedest to keep these simple promises that I make to you today so I don't have to live without you.\"\n\n\"Owen, I promise to always be there for you. I promise to love you with all my heart, to fight for us, to encourage you to chase all your dreams, to fill your life with happiness and joy, to chase away all your fears, to protect your secrets, and to comfort you in your times of need. I will remind you how much you mean to me, how much I need you, how important you are to me, how important our love is and the life we share together is. You're more than just my best friend, you're my love, my life and my happiness in it. I love you Owen, with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Wow baby,\" I whispered. \"That was perfect.\"\n\nShe smiled that perfect smile as I took her hands back into mine.\n\n\"Can I have the rings please?\"\n\nI turned to Jordan and took the rings from him. We exchanged the standard vows now as we placed the rings on each other.\n\n\"Congratulations, you are now husband and wife. Kiss the bride.\"\n\nI looked at her as she stood there smiling back at me. I will never forget how happy and beautiful she looked in that moment. I leaned closer to her then spoke softly.\n\n\"You look so beautiful baby.\"\n\nShe smiled shyly as she tried to hold back her tears of joy.\n\n\"First kiss of the rest of our lives,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she giggled softly. \"You better make it a good one then.\"\n\nThe photographer capture the moment with a simple eloquence that still brings a smile to my face every time I see the picture. Life changed for us after that first kiss of the rest of our lives. Jamie and I are still together and we couldn't be happier right now. My trade went through and we both moved to Miami. I won the starting job during the preseason and never looked back. Just like Phil predicted, I did very well down there. He worked out a deal the following offseason that was worth way more than I expected.\n\nJamie's career took off as well. Carrie had bought a store down in Miami the same year Jamie started her job at the company. Carrie had planned on opening it up but she never found the time or the right person to be in charge of it. When Jamie handed Carrie her resignation she gave it back to her along with a set of keys. She told Jamie to open the store and run it. Then when she was finished with her own line of fashion she could put it in the store. Jamie took the offer and, just like me, she never looked back.\n\n*****\n\nThank you for reading. I hope you have enjoyed this story. Your comments are always welcome. I've carried this story as far as I can for the time being. Maybe in the future I will revisit this but for now this is the 'and they lived happily ever after' moment."
