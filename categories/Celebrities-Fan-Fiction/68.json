        "Hi Everyone,\n\nI know this has been a terribly long time in coming, and I hope it was worth the wait. Thank you for your patience and for reading. :) \n\nMore action is coming, I promise. :)\n\npsyche b.\n\n\n\n28. That's Different\n\nKelly lay on her side and held the crumpled up sheet against the outside of her throbbing thigh. It had begun in a curious, playful tenderness and progressed to an unhurried intimacy that left them both tied up together in arms and legs. One clawed hand rested on her hip, the bite of those talons just enough to remind her of how fragile she was. It made the moment perfect.\n\nHe came back into the room with the black bag of medical supplies, a small towel and a bowl. He sat down on the edge of the bed. \"This is your fault.\"\n\nHis statement lacked accusatory conviction. \n\n\"I didn't know the ice was going to fall off the roof at that moment.\" A shrug with one shoulder. \"I only jumped a little.\"\n\n\"At the wrong fucking time.\" He poured peroxide into the bowl and wet the cloth in it. \"Lemme see.\"\n\nKelly took her hand away and he carefully moved her makeshift dressing. \"Don't tell me, tell the ice.\" She lifted her head. \"Is it as deep as it seemed to start with?\"\n\n\"Eh. It's one of the deeper ones you've had.\" He dipped the edge of the towel in the bowl and started to clean the long cuts. One was barely a scratch. Unless she miscalculated her new healing factor, that one would be gone within the hour. Two of the others might last until mid-morning. The one in the middle was deeper and more ragged. It was still oozing blood.\n\nKelly shivered. \"Do you have to do that? I mean, won't it heal on its own?\"\n\nHe looked at her. \"Sure it will. Course on you it'll take awhile so every time you move it'll open up again. Meaning however long it would've taken, it'll take three times longer and that's if it stays clean. 'F it doesn't, then we're talking about even longer. Wanna keep arguing with me?\" A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.\n\nShe smiled a little. \"No.\" \n\n\"You're learning, frail.\" He pressed the cloth over the wounds again. \n\nKelly suppressed a whimper. For a long moment, a comfortable silence grew between them, her body curled close to his. She hadn't been able to dress, he hadn't bothered. Dim light played off the slopes of his muscles. For the moment, the almost perpetual tension in his shoulders had eased. Despite the throbbing ache in her hip and thigh, Kelly's smile got a little wider. \n\n\"What?\" He smirked a little.\n\n\"Just thinking what an amazing man you are.\"\n\nHis hand paused and he looked away. \"I'm a son of a bitch.\"\n\nShe stroked his leg and looked up at him. She stayed silent until he looked at her. \"Not to me. To me, you're the person I trust completely. The one who makes me smile.\" She looked down at her hip. \"The one who takes care of me when I do something stupid.\"\n\nHe gave a grudging little smile. She smiled back and gave a little shrug. \"You're my mate, and I'm entitled to my opinion that you're amazing.\"\n\nA slow grin spread across his face. \"Sentimental shit.\" He leaned down and kissed her, his mouth more commanding than it had been in the last few hours. \"You gonna let me finish this?\"\n\nShe lay down again. \"It's too big to bandage, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Too deep to just bandage. Lucky I got these.\" He held up a box of butterfly-shaped tape strips. \"'Less you want me to wake up the ape so that he can stitch you up.\"\n\nKelly groaned. \"Please, they'd think you did it on purpose. I don't have it in me to try and explain and I really don't have it in me to listen to another lecture at this hour of morning. Though he does have anesthetic.\"\n\nHe shifted a little closer. \"Keepin' the kit stocked is your thing.\"\n\n\"Guess I haven't been too focused lately.\" Kelly squeezed her eyes closed and felt tears well up when Victor started pulling the edges of the wound together and securing them. He kept one hand on her at all times. A soft purr rumbled through his chest. Kelly knew he was trying to comfort her, she clutched a handful of the pillow and did her best to say silent. It didn't work entirely.\n\nFor the most part, he ignored her pained mewling sounds and worked quickly to close the long wound. He stroked her hair, then picked up the bowl, the towel and the sheet and left her alone for a long moment. Kelly took a deep breath and waited for him. He settled behind her. \"When we get to where we're goin', you'll have the chance to get set up again.\"\n\nKelly settled back into his chest. Any time she thought about leaving, a feeling between ache and nervousness settled into her chest. \"Does...that mean you're leaving as soon as we get there?\"\n\nClawed fingers stroked her stomach. \"Nah. I need time to plan.\" He moved a little closer. \"'Sides, I want you all to myself when we're actually alone. Fucking hate having a herd of people around all the damn time.\"\n\nKelly nodded. Her mind was suddenly racing with a thousand worries. It was the worst kind of anxiety. The kind that came with only nameless, formless images that slid through the dark corners of her mind. She didn't realize how tightly she was gripping the pillow until he wrapped his hand around hers. He waited until she relaxed her grip.\n\n\"You haven't asked where we're goin'.\" His voice was soft.\n\n\"I didn't think you'd tell me.\" The words came out too quickly. \n\nHe was silent. \"And?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \n\n\"You don't wanna go, do you?\" He sounded hurt, but not surprised.\n\nShe twined her fingers with his. \"That's not it, I just...\" She took a deep breath. \"It's not something I can explain. I do feel safe here because of all the walls and the gates. It was nice to have Cassie so close by.\" She fell silent again.\n\nHe pulled his hand away from hers and started to massage her breast. \"That all you're gonna miss?\"\n\nShe smiled a little, the possessive intimacy banishing the gathered tension. \"I certainly won't miss the accommodations.\" \n\n\"Thought you could get comfortable just about anywhere.\"\n\n\"But there's this thing you do when you get into bed.\"\n\n\"Thought we been doin' plenty of that thing already.\" She could hear the smirk in his voice.\n\nKelly laughed. \"I don't mean that. I mean when you get into bed somewhere you can really stretch out, you kind of stretch and arch and moan when you're settling in. You don't do that here.\"\n\n\"Think that's the bed or the place?\" He toyed with her nipple.\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe both. I figure either way it doesn't matter much. If you can't even get comfortable in bed how you want to, how can I be really comfortable here?\"\n\nHis arm tightened around her. \"Right at the moment I'd be more comfortable if you'd shut the fuck up and go to sleep. It's three-thirty in the goddamn morning.\"\n\nKelly smiled and settled back into him. Sleep might not come, but relaxation would.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCreed looked down at the frail's profile sculpted in the gray light of false dawn. He knew she wasn't deeply asleep, but at least she was finally nodding off. There was more that she hadn't told him earlier. He knew that as sure as he was laying there, and he had a pretty good idea of what it was. She was going to see the ape in the morning, no reason for him to sit around and stare at walls. She shifted in her sleep. He purred softly and she settled again.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly sat in Hank's office and waited for him to pull his gloves on.\n\n\"Why do you need another DNA sample? Everything is still working.\" Her hip was mostly healed, but the longest scratch was still throbbing dully.\n\nHe smiled and opened the swab. \"The treatment was experimental. I know your healing factor is still working, but I want to be sure that nothing else was affected.\"\n\nKelly opened her mouth and let him swab the inside of her cheek. \"Will you tell me how it turns out?\"\n\nHe glanced at her, then hesitated. She waited.\n\n\"You'd like me to call Victor?\" He said finally.\n\n\"If you want, but you could just call me.\" She smiled a little, took a Post-It note and a pen from his desk and wrote her cell number on it. \"You could have just asked Cassie. She has it.\" She handed it to him.\n\n\"Victor won't mind?\" \n\nShe looked at him with a level gaze. \"Victor would be upset if I kept it a secret. I have no reason to do that.\"\n\nHe looked down at the paper in his hand, then back at her. \"This is not a lecture, but I want you to know that if you need to come back, you can. No questions asked.\"\n\nShe smiled a little. \"Thank you. For everything.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"You held on. You gave me enough time to put the pieces together.\" He smiled a little. So did she. A long moment passed in silence. \"Physically I know you're fine, but as far as I know you haven't talked to anyone about how you're doing emotionally.\"\n\nHer smile froze. \"Of course I have, just not to you.\"\n\n\"Not to Cassie either.\"\n\nHer eyes were fixed on his. \"She's been debriefed already, has she? That's efficient. We haven't even left yet.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. \"Kelly, you should know that students who come here come from all kinds of backgrounds. Cassie has a loving family who had difficulty knowing how to deal with her mutation and thus, couldn't help her manage it. Many of our students come here severely traumatized. You've been through as much if not more than most of them.\"\n\nKelly shook her head. \"So what's your point? You think it would be better if I sat around and cried about it?\"\n\n\"If you bottle up your feelings-\"\n\nShe gave a short, angry laugh. \"Who said I was doing that? Any question Cassie asked me about what happened, I've answered as honestly as I could.\"\n\n\"Narrative doesn't always get to the emotion of the matter.\"\n\n\"You want to know how I feel? Fine.\" Kelly fought to keep a furious tremor out of her voice. \"I hate Stan. He dragged my brother, my mother and I through Hell for no good reason and if it weren't for dumb luck and sheer ineptitude on his part he would have torn us apart. He's worse than Cavallo because Cavallo didn't know any of us. To him it was just business and maybe some kind of sick entertainment. Stan lived in the same house with us. He used us to show off at all his events and then when it suited his purposes he didn't hesitate to get rid of all of us. I hate him, and every day that goes by I hate him more.\" Kelly turned away and dug her fingernails into her palms, trying to get control of her raging emotions. \n\n\"If anyone deserves hatred, it's Stan.\" She wasn't facing him, but she could hear the 'understanding' tone in his voice. That just made her angrier.\n\nShe turned to face him. \"And I suppose now you're going to tell me that it's not right to hate anyone, no matter what. You might as well save your breath.\"\n\n\"Morality doesn't enter into it. Hatred is a parasite. At first you don't feel any different, but as it grows it consumes more and more of your time, your energy, the essence of who you are. Besides, what do you get out of it? Your hatred doesn't affect him. You carry the burden and he goes on with his life as he always has.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"So what am I supposed to do about it? Forget about the fact that I almost died, that my brother almost died-\"\n\n\"Of course not, but you might want to consider being selfish enough to forgive him.\"\n\nShe gave an angry little smirk. \"Like you're so forgiving with Victor.\"\n\n\"That's-\"\n\n\"Different.\" Kelly finished the thought for him.\n\n\"I hate the things he does.\"\n\n\"That makes it better?\"\n\nHe attempted a half-hearted smile. \"I never said it was easy.\"\n\nKelly sighed. \"Then what are you saying? That I'll feel all warm and fuzzy if I do it?\"\n\n\"No. I'm saying that because of your healing factor, you're going to live a very long life. Don't give Stan power over those years. He's taken too much from you already.\" \n\nKelly sat back in her chair. \"You give me too much credit for being evolved.\"\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCreed stood in the middle of the old man's office with his arms crossed. Room was fucking pretentious, even when it was empty. Jimmy was lounging on the sofa, doing his best not to hover. The runt had been unusually quiet, but Creed didn't feel like digging any deeper into that at the moment. He had other things on his mind.\n\nHe turned when he heard the door open. \"Took you long enough.\"\n\n\"It's Sunday. We're a bit more informal around here on the weekends.\"\n\nCreed stared down at him. \"Well good for you.\" He walked over to the window and looked out. \"We gotta talk about the frail.\"\n\n\"Really?\" He moved closer. \n\n\"Don't get all excited, it ain't what you think.\" He didn't turn his head. \"How much more has she got to go before she graduates?\"\n\n\"According to the records I've seen, English Literature and trigonometry. She's been talking about staying?\" The last statement held a practiced nonchalance that set Creed's teeth on edge. \n\nHe suppressed a growl. \"Only to say she don't want to. Course staying here and getting a diploma from here ain't necessarily the same thing, now is it?\" He looked down at the old man, looking for any reaction. Creed was certain he saw curiosity crinkle the corners of the old man's eyes. He didn't give a shit about what was causing it. \"Bottom line is this, the frail is damn smart, and she deserves better than a fucking GED from whatever state we happen to land in. She won't tell you that because that bastard stepfather of hers has been treating her like she's second rate for so long she believes it. One day she'll figure out it's all bullshit, but until she does I gotta keep reminding her.\"\n\nA small smile quirked the corner of the old man's mouth. \"Even if I could do something about that, what makes you think that I'd be inclined to?\"\n\nCreed grinned and sat down in front of the wide desk. \"'Cause right now she don't trust you completely, but she's mostly convinced that you're not dangerous to her. I figure you wanna keep it that way and if she gets the idea that you only made the offer to separate her from me, then she'll probably start to think of you as a duplicitous asshole. I'd bet the payment from my next three jobs that you don't want that.\"\n\n\"And you would be only too happy to tell her.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"She's been kept in the dark too damn long. I'll be damned if I'm gonna contribute to that.\"\n\nCool eyes appraised him for a long moment. Creed didn't move. \"What makes you think that what you want is even possible?\"\n\n\"'Cause I'm not an idiot. I know what kind of technology you've got here, and I know her. That's all I need.\"\n\n\"If it were possible, it would be more difficult for her instructors to manage. A bit of compensation wouldn't be out of the way.\"\n\nCreed rolled his eyes. \"I ain't gonna owe you shit. What do you want?\"\n\n\"You have certain talents that, if they were trained in the right direction, could be-\"\n\nJimmy sat up a little straighter. Creed growled. \"No. I ain't gonna live my life with the threat of you hangin' over my head.\" \n\nA flicker of anger through the old man's eyes and the barest hint of it in the air. \"That's the first time I've ever been referred to as a threat.\"\n\nCreed shrugged. \"First time for everything.\" \n\nThe old man didn't move. \"Perhaps you aren't as willing to sacrifice for this girl as you claim to be.\"\n\nCreed leaned in close. \"You want me to come and work for you? Fine. I'll stay here and act like a good little housebroken cub while the frail gets what she needs. I'll go on all your little missions, wear your ugly ass outfit, the whole nine fucking yards.\" He grinned, his fangs teasing his lower lip. \"Course she'll be finished in a few months. Then she won't need you and I'll still be here, inside your gates with all your precious impressionable students. They'll trust me by then no matter what you say, I'll see to that-\"\n\n\"What exactly do you propose?\"\n\nCreed leaned back in his chair and savored the tang of anger in the air. \"You made her the promise, and I propose you honor it. Seems pretty fucking clear that you're trying to weasel out of it now though.\" He didn't give the old man a chance to respond. \"You still taking in charity cases?\"\n\nA nod. \"I offer a place to deserving young people who are in need.\"\n\nCreed rolled his eyes. \"Well la dee fucking da. Just tell me how many you got.\"\n\n\"Eight.\" \n\n\"Put this together for the frail, you get a year's worth of tuition for all of 'em.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes narrowed, and Creed could see him weighing the value of his services and threats over the value of the cash. Then he rolled over to his desk. \"Tuition, room, board and special activities fees for all eight.\"\n\n\"Done.\" There was no hesitation in Creeds voice.\n\nThe old man wrote a figure on a piece of paper. Creed glanced at it. \"Got a computer I can use and an account I can put this into or do you want it in small, dirty bills?\"\n\n\"An account transfer will suffice.\" He put a small laptop in front of Creed. A few keystrokes later the transaction was complete. The look on his face said he was kicking himself for not asking for more.\n\n\"I had expected more...bargaining.\"\n\nCreed shrugged. \"As long as people got enemies, I got more work than I can handle. Tell me how this is gonna go.\"\n\n\"First, does Kelly have reliable access to a computer, a webcam and the internet?\"\n\nCreed stared at him for a long moment. \"Reliable and secure.\"\n\nThe old man looked at him; a little smile touched his lips. \"I wouldn't have expected anything less. We've started a new program recently. Even though students live here, they still miss classes from time to time. We've started video recording all lectures from certain core classes so that students who are ill can get the entire lecture, and students who were present can review. That's already in place for the trigonometry class. I'll make sure that Kelly can participate via video link. It'll be set up by Wednesday.\"\n\n\"The literature class?\"\n\n\"It's not part of the program, but looking at her previous scores and knowing what she likes to read I don't think she'll have any difficulty with it. She will have to come back here twice for testing. Once for a mid-semester exam and once for a final. The rest can be accomplished at a distance.\"\n\nCreed smirked. \"And you get to keep your hooks in her.\"\n\nA facsimile of a warm smile. \"I wouldn't put it quite like that.\"\n\n\"Course not.\" Creed smiled back. \"She comes back, I come with her.\"\n\nThe smile evaporated. He shook his head. \"This is a school. I have to think of the moral well-being of my students as well as-\"\n\n\"Whatcha think I'm gonna do, fuck her in the foyer? What's so fucking immoral about me being seen in broad daylight with my mate? 'Sides neither one of us is gonna be sleeping here.\"\n\nAnger flickered over the old man's features. \"Then why come with her at all?\" \n\nCreed grinned. \"'Cause you don't want me to. Makes it seem like you got some kinda reason for wanting to get her alone. Since I'm pretty damn sure you don't wanna fuck her, I figure you want to try and 'persuade' her that she wants to stay, no matter what she happens to want.\"\n\n\"You really think I would-\"\n\nHe leaned in. \"I think you would do just about anything that furthered your own agenda.\" He got up. \"She get textbooks?\"\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\n\"You sure about this?\" Jimmy asked. They were walking toward the ape's office.\n\nCreed stopped. \"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"I mean she's a kid. You're carrying her school books for Christ's sake.\"\n\nCreed groaned. \"She ain't been a kid since her mother married Stan. 'Sides, how old was your mother when she married your father?\"\n\n\"Sixteen or seventeen, but that's-\"\n\n\"Different.\" Creed finished. He started walking again. \"My mother was fifteen when she had me and nineteen when my asshole of a father beat her to death. Age don't mean shit.\"\n\n\"I suppose the fact that times are different now don't mean shit either,\" Jimmy said.\n\nCreed stared at the smaller man. \"Times ain't that different.\"",
        "\"Oh come on, even you-\"\n\n\"Even I what? Strong female like her can do damn near anything, but none of it'll make her happy 'less she's got an alpha male who ain't afraid to show her she ain't in charge all the time. Men have always been good at collecting shit and I'm better than most at that. Didn't realize it was all just shit 'til I had her. I don't see what's so different about that.\" \n\nJimmy paused in front of the ape's office door, an eyebrow quirked curiously. \n\n\"What?\" Creed only stopped long enough to shift the books to his other arm. \n\nThe ape stood when the door opened. The frail was resting on her hip with her feet drawn up under her in the chair. She smiled at him.\n\n\"Don't you ever knock?\" The ape almost growled. \n\nCreed grinned. \"Not when my frail is on the other side of the door.\" He looked at her. \"You finished?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She walked over to him, her eyes fixed on the books. \"What're those?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"You're gonna need textbooks for your classes.\"\n\nShe stopped and stared at him. Anger and something akin to pain or betrayal crossed her face. Her scent was a muddle of all of those spiced with confusion. \"I said I didn't want to stay.\"\n\n\"You think I'm gonna leave you here you're fucking nuts. You gonna stand there all day or are you gonna come with me so I can explain?\" \n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly balanced on the edge of the bed Victor wasn't currently occupying and wondered if his penchant for napping was part of his feline nature, or if he simply took the opportunity to sleep when he found it. The reason wasn't all that important to her. It was a chance to be close to him. \n\nA snore rumbled through his chest, his fingers twined loosely in her hair. For a time, that and the feeling of his skin against hers was all there was in the world. Then she thought of the stack of books on the nightstand behind her. She'd almost cried when he told her and now tears welled up again. She appreciated the chance to finish, but more than that she was glad to be able to come back here.\n\nShe couldn't tell him that, not in those words. For all of his explosions of ego and brash posturing, she knew that Victor feared losing her to this place and the people in it. She couldn't see how that would ever happen, not in the way he thought it would. Living under the weight of rules and the scrutiny of so many others, seemed like an anemic existence at best, a maddening struggle at worst. Cassie wasn't quite the same as the rest, but she had become a stranger in the intervening years. Still, something inside her needed a connection to Cassie and the others, even if she didn't fully trust them. She didn't have the words to explain that to Victor, and reassurances of loyalty would only upset him more.\n\nVictor growled in his sleep, his hand tightened in her hair. Kelly arched against him, rubbing her bare skin against his. The low rumble trailed off into a deep moan. His fingers loosened. She smiled. The rest of the world was confusing. This made sense. Kelly closed her eyes. \n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly ran through her mental checklist while she pulled the sheets out of the dryer. Everything was packed. The place was cleaner than when she found it. She folded the pillowcases quickly, then spread the fitted sheet out on the bed upside down and started folding the fitted sides in so that it was a flatter rectangle. Kelly tried not to dwell on the uncertainty of the rest of it. She sharpened the folds of the sheet and started to bring the corners together. Of the places she knew of, Chicago was probably the best possibility. The place was like a comfortable fortress, suitable for hiding out for a weekend or surviving a plague of zombies. Probably. She smirked as she folded the sheet into a careful square.\n\nThe house in Maine was more luxurious and they both felt more comfortable there, but the land was so expansive and there were so many ways in. She doubted the security system was as simple as it looked, but it still didn't seem like the best place. Of course that didn't count all the other places she didn't know about yet. She probably never would know about all of them.\n\nShe spread the flat sheet out and smoothed it. The fact that she had a good idea of where they were going this time didn't cure her nervousness, or the ache that had started in her heart. She brought the corners of the sheet together and tried to focus on the fact that she would be back.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" Victor was standing in the doorway. Curiosity had overtaken annoyance for the moment.\n\nShe glanced down at the bed. \"Finishing up folding the sheets. I couldn't leave them bloody and-\"\n\nHe walked into the room and pointed at the bed. \"That's how you do it?\"\n\nShe shrugged a little. \"Well, yeah. My arms aren't long enough to just fold them the regular way.\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \"Get over there and pick up that end.\" He grabbed the foot of the sheet. She picked up the other end. \"You could've just left it.\"\n\nShe brought the corners together when he did. \"Left them like they were? Whoever saw them would think that-\"\n\n\"Frail, nothing either one of us ever does is gonna change what they think about me.\"\n\n\"Do we have to reinforce it?\" She brought the edges of the sheet toward him and took the edges he was holding.\n\nHis eyebrows drew together. For a moment, Kelly thought she'd angered him. Then he smirked, the tips of his fangs poking at his lower lip. \"Too fuckin' much. This the last thing you got to do or you got some kinda list of useless shit?\"\n\nKelly stacked the folded sheets on the bed. \"This was the last thing. It's almost six-thirty, isn't it?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"So? Conlon'll wait.\"\n\nHer heart started to pound. \"He's here?\"\n\n\"He called me from the gate just before I came in here.\"\n\nKelly took a deep breath and looked around the room. She carefully avoided his eyes. \n\nHe stood behind her and wrapped one heavy arm around her shoulders. \"You gonna bawl?\"\n\nShe smiled a little and rested her head against his bicep. \"Maybe.\"\n\nHe bumped his head against hers. \"C'mon.\"\n\nKelly followed him out into the kitchen. He handed her her coat from the hook by the door. A sharp knock made her jump.\n\nVictor opened to door. \"Can't wait to get rid of me, can you runt?\"\n\n\"You know what they say about fish and relatives.\" Logan grabbed her suitcase.\n\n\"I dunno, when you remember to take a shower you smell half tolerable most of the time.\"\n\nJimmy fixed a flat stare on him, then he looked at Kelly. \"You have everything?\"\n\nShe gave a smile that wavered more than she had hoped for. \"Yes, thank you.\"\n\nHe started out the door. Victor grabbed his own bags with one hand and grasped Kelly's arm with the other, leading her out into the cold evening. The walk down the dark path seemed to take even longer than usual, but once they emerged into the bright moonlight in the driveway, Kelly could see Conlon talking with Professor Xavier. Cassie stood close by. Even from a distance, Kelly could tell that her friend was close to tears.\n\n\"Conlon, get the back open.\" Victor headed toward a dark-colored SUV. Conlon said something to the professor and trotted over to the back of the vehicle. Victor and Logan followed. For a minute Kelly couldn't move. She took a deep breath and walked over to the professor. \n\nHe smiled at her and offered his hand. Kelly took it. \"I can't say that I'm pleased to see you go, but I am very pleased we were able to help you recover.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you.\" She smiled a little and glanced back at the three men standing by the SUV. Conlon and Logan were making uncomfortable small talk. Victor was watching her. She looked back at the professor. \"I know this wasn't exactly on your to-do list.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"No, but opportunities are usually unexpected. Victor told you that you'll be returning here in a few weeks?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"He told me. I appreciate the chance.\"\n\n\"It's my pleasure. I want you to know that my door is always open to you.\"\n\nKelly's smile was forced. She took her hand away. \"Hank said the same thing.\"\n\n\"Kelly you have every right to decide what you want from your life. Just know that this is a place of respite as well as a place of learning. Sometimes we all need to spend a little time with ourselves.\" \n\nThere was nothing but sincerity in his voice, but to Kelly it was too practiced to be fully believable. She nodded. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"That's all I ask.\"\n\nKelly looked at Cassie. The other girl's lip was trembling. That was all it took. The tears that Kelly had been holding back started to stream down her cheeks. She hugged Cassie and held on tight.\n\n\"Sophie and Lucy wanted to come,\" Cassie said. \"They weren't allowed.\"\n\nKelly nodded. She didn't trust her voice.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCreed leaned back against the side of the vehicle and watched the scene unfold in front of him. The old man was talking about opportunities. Creed knew exactly what opportunity that was too, but the frail didn't need to know she'd been a bargaining chip. From her posture, he could tell that the frail was on her guard too. The wind was blowing the wrong way to tell anything from her scent. The fact that she pulled her hand away spoke volumes though. A slight smile touched the corners of his lips.\n\nThe frail moved away from the old man to the blond girl. He knew they were both crying. It might have been touching if the old bastard wasn't using the girl as emotional manipulation. The girl didn't know it and he was pretty sure the frail didn't either. Something else he'd keep from her. Wouldn't work. That kind of shit was most effective when you used a family member, a threat and salted it with some blood and screaming for effect. This whole 'look what you'll be missing' shit wasn't going to do anything except draw this out. \n\nCourse the old man might be counting on that too. It'd make him look like an ass if he pulled the frail away. Plant that little seed of doubt in the frail's mind that he might be exactly the kind of bastard they kept saying he was. He took a deep breath and waited.\n\n\"Gettin' impatient?\" Jimmy asked.\n\nCreed didn't have to look at his brother to hear the smirk in his voice.\n\n\"Nope. Just trying to figure out why your boss would let one of his precious students breathe the same air as me.\"\n\n\"You're sure he had an ulterior motive? She's Kelly's best friend.\"\n\nCreed fixed a flat look on his brother. \"He's breathing, ain't he?\"\n\nThe frail pulled away from the blond and started walking toward him.\n\nCreed smiled a little. He stared at the old man. The old man stared back. Even at a distance he could see the old man's eyes narrow for a flicker of a second. Kelly wiped her eyes and walked faster. She smiled at him, then at Conlon. \n\n\"I thought you were dead,\" she said.\n\nConlon smiled. \"I thought the same thing about you. We're both tougher than we look I guess.\"\n\n\"You two wanna be alone?\" Creed put a little growl into the words. She would know it wasn't as serious as it sounded. Conlon might not, but he didn't give a shit about that. \n\nShe smiled at him. \"No.\" She turned to Jimmy. Her smile changed to something less intimate. \"I'm glad I got the chance to meet you.\" \n\nHe nodded and started to walk away.\n\n\"Runt!\" \n\nJimmy turned. \"What?\"\n\nCreed shrugged. \"You're a fucking self-righteous pain in the ass, but you're less of a pain in the ass than I remember.\"\n\nA smile twitched the corner of Jimmy's mouth. \"You too, brother.\" He turned his back and walked back toward the old man. \n\nCreed looked at the frail. \"C'mon.\" He looked at Conlon. \"You're driving.\" He opened the back door of the SUV and Kelly got in. He followed.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly wouldn't let herself look back as they started down the long driveway. As the gates swung open before them, the ache that had been building in her heart turned into a sharp pain that took her breath away. She looked out the side window and reminded herself that she would be in touch with Cassie and she would even be coming back here. In her mind, she replayed the lectures about the dangers of being with Victor and the shocked stares. She reminded herself of the way he'd been treated like a dangerous animal and then told herself that there was probably plenty more that she didn't know about because of the length of time she'd been in a coma. Staying would have meant losing Victor, and as much as driving away hurt, losing him would have been unbearable. \n\nShe took a deep breath and watched the inky scenery slipping by.\n\n\"You traveled with Stan, right?\" Victor was the first one to speak. Kelly wasn't sure how long it had been, but she knew that her emotions were finally under control.\n\nShe turned toward him. \"Sometimes. Mostly just for local stuff.\"\n\n\"So you didn't fly?\"\n\n\"Fly?\" Kelly gave a short laugh. \"Even if he wasn't too cheap, Stan thought the government kept files on people who flew.\"\n\nVictor looked at her. \"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?\"\n\nKelly shrugged. \"I don't know. I never could figure it out either.\"\n\nVictor shook his head. \"Crazy motherfucker. Anyways, we're flying to Chicago.\"\n\nKelly's heart started to pound again. \"I can't!\"\n\n\"Why the fuck not?\"\n\n\"Because you need ID to even get close to a plane. I don't have that, and even if I had the documents to get one, I'm legally dead.\" She fixed her eyes on the edge of the pocket on the back of Conlon's seat.\n\n\"Thought about getting you a fake, but a good fake takes time. 'Sides, all that don't mean shit unless you're going commercial. I fucking hate flying commercial and I just spent too damn long cooped up with other people.\" \n\nVictor was silent, but Kelly could feel him watching her. She kept her eyes firmly on the pocket. Even in the dim light, she could tell it was poorly designed. Probably something that had been added later for the convenience of passengers. It made her certain that this was a rental. Victor didn't plan for passengers. She tried to put together what he was saying, but nothing made sense. \"Then, how-?\"\n\n\"First thing I learned when I went into business for myself was that you always do a little extra for the customers. Go that extra mile. Means they owe you, and stacked up favors always come in handy.\" His head was tilted toward the window, but his eyes were turned toward her. \"About eight months ago, I took care of a couple little matters for a guy who owns a private jet. Haven't had a good enough reason to call in the favor until now.\"\n\nKelly stroked the side of his hand with her little finger. He turned to look at her. She smiled a little, so did he. \n\nThey rode in silence the rest of the way to a small airport. As soon as they turned down the access road, the feeling of arriving at that other airport flooded Kelly's mind. The desperate fear pumped through her with every rapid beat of her heart. She squeezed her eyes shut against it.\n\nHe gripped her hand tight enough to bring tears to her eyes. It pulled her out of the past and out of her own head. She took a deep breath, then nodded at him. He eased his grip on her hand, but didn't let go."
