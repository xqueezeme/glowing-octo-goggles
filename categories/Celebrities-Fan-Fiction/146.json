        "Hi All,\n\nSorry this took a little longer to come out. Getting back to school/work has thrown my schedule all off. It's thrown my writing schedule off too. There are a couple more chapters of this story and while they will come out, they will probably not come out at the usual pace. \n\nAll I can do is apologize and ask you all to bear with me. This story WILL be finished. I can guarantee that.\n\npsyche b\n\n24. The Corners of Her Mind\n\nKelly shifted against the rough carpet, then snuggled against Victor's side again. His claws traced over her back in slow circles, a rumbling purr vibrating through his chest from time to time. \n\n\"You gonna keep squirming around like that?\" His eyes were still closed.\n\nKelly couldn't repress a little smile. \"Well this floor is hard, and I have to say that this carpet isn't nearly as nice as the ones in the house in Maine.\"\n\n\"Fine. Next time I see the old man, I'll tell him his floors are unfit to fuck on.\" \n\nShe giggled. \"You would.\"\n\n\"Damn right I would.\" He grinned and sat up. \" 'Sides, you were the one who couldn't wait. Get back in bed.\"\n\n\"Me?\" She laughed and got back under the blankets. He got in next to her. \"You were all 'Show me what's mine'.\" She did a poor imitation of his lust-filled growl.\n\nHe pinched her nipple hard enough to make Kelly yelp. \"Just 'cause you ain't even been awake for twenty-four hours yet I'll let that slide.\" He settled behind her. Kelly could hear the little smile in his voice. She couldn't resist a giggle. \"Didn't hear you complaining.\" He pulled the covers over both of them, then pushed on the back of her thigh. \n\nKelly knew what he wanted. She tilted her hips and drew her knee up. \"Not complaining. Now I know I'm really awake. Before I wasn't so sure.\"\n\nHe settled so that his half-hard member was resting against her most intimate places. It sent a pleasant shiver through her. \"You been confused about that?\" He was covering the note of concern in his voice. His hips rocked slowly against her. Kelly laced her fingers with his and moved with him.\n\n\"I don't know if I would say it that way. It's just that I dreamed so much when I was sleeping or comatose or whatever. Some of that seemed real too, but even if I was dreaming about you, you were always just out of reach.\" The memory of the disembodied voices and disjointed images that had been her reality came back again. She arched against Victor, using his warmth to banish the ghosts.\n\n\"Chasin' after me when you should have been resting.\" His large hand massaged her breast.\n\nShe blushed. \"Told you before how tempting you are. Once I was even sure that I was awake and you were holding my hand. I guess I wasn't though.\"\n\n\"You woke up once. Surprised the hell out of everybody.\" He massaged her nipple, drawing the firm bud into a stiff peak.\n\n\"Dr. McCoy said I was in a drug-induced coma.\" She moaned softly. The broad head of his organ spread her lips wider.\n\n\"You were. You shook the drug. It's what got the ape thinkin' you'd respond to his experimental treatment in the first place. Before that, he just figured you were human. Goddamn I forgot how good you smell when you're this wet.\" \n\nHis now rigid shaft made contact with the swollen center of her pleasure. Kelly shifted under him, exposing herself more fully. He growled softly and moved with her, making sure that his body was over hers. His hand moved down to her tummy, his claws biting into the soft flesh there. \n\n\"You want somethin'?\" He purred next to her hear.\n\nKelly was too wrapped up in the feeling of him pressing against his entrance and moving away to answer. Each time he did, she clenched a little tighter, grew just a little needier.\n\n\"Better answer me, frail.\" One claw bit into her skin just above her mound. No matter where she moved, that claw followed.\n\n\"Yes, please.\" She reached down to his hand, desperate to ease the sharp pressure. A low growl made her stop.\n\n\"Nope. You gotta tell me what you want.\" \n\nShe shifted again so that she was on her knees. That claw was on the edge of breaking her skin. \"N-need to feel you inside me. Please.\" The words came out in a needy whimper.\n\nHe pushed forward and her entrance clenched tightly. A soft purr vibrated through his chest and into her back. \"Relax for me, frail.\" \n\n\"Can't.\" There were tears in her eyes. \"Your claw-\"\n\nHe eased some of the pressure, but left it pressed into her flesh. Kelly felt some of the tension in her body ease. \n\nShe whimpered. \"Now, please.\" \n\nHe held the back of her neck, keeping her immobile against the pillow. For a moment, fear tore through Kelly as the feeling of helplessness consumed her. The same helplessness she felt on that cold tile floor. She felt the soft purr again. It was enough to bring her back to the present. \n\nHe pushed forward again. This time though, her tension didn't stop him. Kelly muffled her sharp cry in the pillow when the broad head pushed past her resisting opening. Still, she tilted her hips just slightly, pushing down into his claws but giving him a better angle. He moved slowly, filling her in aching inches. Her soft whimpers mingled and melded with pleasure moans. Finally, he reached the limits of her depths and then kept up a constant pressure there.\n\n\"What are you?\" The growl in his voice spoke of an intensely primal lust. \n\n\"Your mate.\" She moaned.\n\nHe drew his whole length out of her, then filled her again. He growled. \"Louder.\" \n\n\"Your mate.\" Her voice was louder and clearer. Her muscles clenched around him.\n\nOnce more he filled her completely and then pushed those limits. \"Remember this feeling, frail. Your mate over you. Your mate inside you.\" He pressed his claws in just a little deeper. The stinging pain made Kelly's muscles contract around him. For an eternal moment, he was still. Then he started to move inside her in a slow sensual rhythm that made everything else fade into obscurity. It built a fragile crystal of pleasure around her and when that delicate structure collapsed the pleasure would overwhelm her. The longer it grew, the more intense the release. Kelly wasn't sure which she wanted most, so she went willingly on the journey. Her release came only moments before his.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nWhen Kelly began to come back to herself, she realized that Victor had shifted her onto her back. She felt him moving on the bed. She couldn't speak, but she reached for him.\n\nHe caught her hand, then swept his tongue over one of the small claw indentations on her tummy. She could see now that blood was welling up from three of them. His soft lips and rough tongue drew a little moan from Kelly. She stroked the back of his head until he finished his ministrations. He moved back up her body and kissed her deeply, his hand stroking over the softness of her breast and finally drawing her against his body.\n\nIn silence, her fingertips wandered over the contours of his body. He traced the outlines of her delicate bones and the place where the incision had been. It was a slice of safe perfection that needed no words.\n\nThe sound of his cell phone shattered the moment.\n\nHe growled and sat up. \n\n\"Conlon?\" Kelly asked.\n\nHe fished the phone out of the jumble of clothing on the floor and looked at the message. \"Jimmy. He said he'd text when it was safe to get lunch.\"\n\nHe got up and went into the small bathroom. Kelly heard the water running for a few minutes. She pulled the sheet over herself. He came out, still naked, but drying off with one of the white towels.\n\n\"Safe?\" She asked.\n\n\"Jimmy says it's to protect you from too much attention. More likely it's because the old man hasn't decided how much contact I'm allowed to have with his precious students.\" He pulled on a pair of his own jeans.\n\nKelly looked away and pulled the sheet closer around herself. \"We don't have to stay here. I'm fine-\"\n\n\"Bullshit.\" He sat down and wrapped his hand in her hair, forcing her to look at him. \"No matter what you're telling yourself about it, I've seen men die from the kind of beating you took. You been comatose for a week, and the only way to bring you out of it was for the ape to fuck with your genes. You've barely eaten, you haven't slept near as much as you need to and even if you had, do you know how many people are looking for the both of us right now?\"\n\n\"No.\" Her voice was small, frightened. \"But you said-\n\nHe eased his grip. \"To hell with what I said before, this is what I'm sayin' now.\" A little smile flickered at the corner of his mouth. \"'F I'd known you were gonna be such a pain in my ass I'd've left you sleepin'.\"\n\nKelly didn't believe the last part for a minute, but she knew that certain kinds of threats were like endearments to Victor. She turned her head and kissed the inside of his wrist. \n\n\"Stay here. I'll be back in a few minutes.\" He pulled on his shirt and closed the door behind himself.\n\nKelly stared at the closed door for moment, then wandered toward the shower.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nJimmy was coming down the hall when he stepped out into it. Creed followed the smaller mutant in silence.\n\n\"You fucked her.\" Jimmy said finally. The tone of his voice registered shock and jealousy, but was more heavily weighted with the latter.\n\n\"That your business?\"\n\n\"I can smell it on you.\"\n\nCreed rolled his eyes. \"And you felt you had to mention it.\"\n\n\"Figured you'd at least give her twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"Quoting from The Great Charles Xavier's Book of Everything Right and Proper?\"\n\nThe runt growled. \"Can't you stop being an asshole for ten minutes?\"\n\n\"You're the one that brought it up. How am I the asshole here?\"\n\n\"Because you just take what you want, no matter what-\"\n\nThe statement sent Creed over the edge. He grabbed the smaller mutant and slammed him against the wall hard enough to rattle the pictures. The runt popped his claws, but Creed was ready. He pinned the other man's arms easily and held him still despite his struggles. \"Calm your ass down. I don't feel like going back in there covered in your blood.\"\n\nThe runt's low growl spoke more clearly than words. Creed answered with his own.\n\n\"You go right ahead and be pissed off at me, but you're gonna listen. I've never taken anything from that girl that she didn't willingly offer. Not this time, not the first time, never. You might hate that little fact, but it's the truth and you damn well know it.\" He felt some of the angry tension go out of the smaller man's muscles. He glanced at the runt's claws. \"Gonna put those away or do we stand here like this all day?\"\n\nWith a metallic hiss, the blades were gone again. Creed kept his eyes on Jimmy's for another long moment, then he let go. He started down the hall again, then stopped at the top of the staircase they'd come up. He looked down to the end of the hall and another narrower stairway leading off in another direction. \"How the fuck do you find your way around here without a map?\"\n\n\"You get used to it. The next one takes you directly into the kitchen,\" Jimmy said.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly turned off the water in the shower. She squeezed the water out of her hair and wrapped one of the smaller towels around it. She dried off, then wrapped the one remaining bath-sized towel around herself. As she walked toward their bags, she realized that -- healing factor or not -- there was still a familiar ache between her legs. It made her smile. Made her feel closer to normal again.\n\nSomething else had changed too. The feeling of dread that had clung to her for the majority of the day had eased. It wasn't gone, but the thought of protecting herself from whoever might come through the door wasn't the first thing in her mind. It was a close second, but her heart and thoughts weren't trying to outpace each other. She wondered if putting words to it was beginning to banish some of the demons. \n\nShe didn't kid herself. That feeling probably wouldn't last and she wasn't sure if she could bring herself to reveal any more. The one thing she didn't question was whether or not Victor would listen. She had the distinct impression that there were things he wanted to know, that he just couldn't or wouldn't ask quite yet. For now, she pushed it out of her mind. She had more immediate issues to deal with.\n\nKelly hadn't talked to her grandparents since before they left. Before the press conference and the news of her death and Cody's injury became fodder for commentators. \n\nShe didn't need one more thing to worry about. Kelly got dressed and then pulled her phone out of her purse only to find the battery dead. She supposed she shouldn't be surprised. If her things were with Conlon she was fairly certain he wouldn't have gone through them for a cell phone and charger. She got the impression that this morning was too hectic for Victor to have given it much thought either. She found the cord in her purse and plugged in to the outlet nearest the nightstand.\n\nAt least it was an excuse not to call her grandparents. She didn't know what she was going to say to them anyway. Telling them all of what happened wasn't an option. She couldn't bring herself to think about most of it, let alone tell anyone else. Telling them nothing happened wasn't an option either. No matter what she said, they wouldn't be satisfied. That meant they'd keep pushing and prodding. Asking questions. Trying to 'understand'. She couldn't make herself understand, much less someone else.\n\nPanic burst to the surface in a torrent of recriminations, self-blame and uncertainty. The panic didn't make sense either, but knowing that just made it worse. The room started to spin around her. She sat down on the edge of the bed, rested her elbows on her knees and dug her hands into her damp hair. Holding on for dear sanity.\n\nThe sound of the door opening made her cringe. She looked over and saw Victor carrying a tray. Her knees shook, but she got up to help him. \n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCreed didn't know what had set her off, but he was willing to bet that it had something to do with the phone on the nightstand. He handed her a plate with chicken, rice and vegetables. Her hands shook but she started to eat slowly. For a few minutes he watched her.\n\n\"They just wanna know you're alive.\" He said when she'd gotten most of the chicken down.\n\nShe shook her head. \"They'll want to know everything.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"So? Don't mean you gotta tell 'em. They get pushy, you hang up or hand me the phone.\" He took his phone off his belt and found the number. He hit 'send' before she could protest.\n\n\"No!\" She shook her head, her eyes wide.\n\nHe growled. \"Take it.\" He grabbed her hand and put the phone in it. It made his chest ache, but he knew he had to get her out of her own head. He had no fucking idea how to comfort her half the time; the best he could hope for was hooking her up with someone who did.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly hesitantly raised the phone to her ear. She didn't have to wait long before the phone was picked up.\n\n\"Hello.\" The guarded male voice said.\n\n\"Grandpa?\" Her voice trembled.\n\n\"Kelly?\" The shock registered in his voice. She heard him sit heavily. \"We thought...well when we didn't hear from you for so long...where are you?\" \n\nKelly looked at Victor and covered the microphone. \"He wants to know where we are.\" Her voice was soft.\n\nVictor shook his head.\n\n\"I can't tell you that, but I'm safe.\"\n\n\"Your grandmother's going to be so upset. She's at a luncheon at the church.\"\n\nKelly felt some of the tension leaving her shoulders. \"It's alright. I think I need a little time before I talk to her.\"\n\n\"You're safe, are you somewhere you can get medical care?\" She could hear the shock wearing off. \"Someone named Conlon has been calling. He said you were badly hurt.\"\n\n\"The doctor who treated me is close-by.\" Kelly hesitated. \"Did Conlon tell you how I was hurt?\"\n\nThere was a long pause. \"He said that Stan was behind it.\" He didn't need to say anymore. The pain in his voice came through loud and clear. \n\nTears stung her eyes. \"Does Granna know?\"\n\n\"I haven't been able to tell her everything he told me. She knows you were badly hurt and that you had to have surgery.\"\n\nIt was getting easier for Kelly to breathe. \"Did he tell you about the healing factor?\"\n\n\"Yes. We found out your father had mutant genes years ago. I never thought you kids might have them or that there was a way to make them work.\" He was relaxing more.\n\n\"I didn't either. Apparently it's experimental.\"\n\n\"Well thank God your doctor knew to try it.\"\n\nVictor took the nearly empty plate from her. She covered the phone. \"Do we need to go?\" \n\nHe sat behind her, stroking his claws through her hair. \"Take your time.\"\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCreed sat in a chair in the bedroom of the guest house, The Picture of Dorian Gray was open in his lap. He didn't remember owning a copy, but the frail must've found it somewhere. \n\nThey'd left the mansion after she got off the phone with her grandfather. The first day, they'd both slept, only getting up long enough to eat. The second day, Jimmy stopped by, probably to make sure the frail was still breathing. That ain't what he said, but Creed figured that whatever he said was bullshit. He'd expected that the frail would wake up at some point that day, but she didn't. He'd spent most of the day wandering between the fridge in the kitchen, the TV in the living room and the bedroom. \n\nOn the third day, he'd noticed the book laying on top of her suitcase. It was all the excuse he'd needed to move a chair from the living room into the bedroom. She slept. He read and wondered what the fuck was going on with her. He'd seen every inch of her skin and there wasn't a goddamn mark on her. She'd been eating more than he'd ever seen her eat. Not by a whole hell of a lot, but he figured if that lasted she might get back the weight she'd lost in a reasonable amount of time. She said she wasn't in pain. Didn't make a goddamn bit of sense.\n\nCreed knew he'd been sitting there for hours when she whimpered and curled up. He looked over at her. She was buried under the covers, but he could see the edges of the sheet beginning to tremble. He set the book aside and watched. He heard her start to mumble. She curled up into a tight ball and whimpered again. \n\n\"Clay.\" The word came out as a whine followed by more mumbling.\n\nCreed strained to make out the rest. He started repeating the name as if she was trying to remember it. \"ClayClayClayClay...\"\n\nShe turned over, her knees drawn tightly to her chest. He sat down next to her and started to stroke her arm. \"Frail.\"\n\n\"Clay's lisp..\"\n\nHe took her shoulders and shook her a little more vigorously. \"C'mon frail.\"\n\nShe whimpered louder and struggled with him. He grabbed her wrists. \"Frail!\"\n\nHer eyes opened, but the dream had longer claws than he did. She kept struggling, but he held her still. \"C'mon frail. You're awake.\"\n\nHe felt the tension start to drain out of her muscles. Her eyes focused on him. He let go of her wrists and pulled her against him. She held on tight, her hands wrapped in the back of his shirt. Despite the questions that formed on his lips, he knew he had to give her time to catch her breath. He felt her hands relax first. \n\n\"Who's Clay?\" He kept his voice to a soft rumble.\n\n\"Clay?\"\n\nHe rearranged the sheets so that his hands could reach her bare skin. She arched against him. \"You were talkin' in your sleep. You mumbled something about Clay slipped, or something like that.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't remember.\" She was holding on tighter again.\n\nHe knew from her tone that she was lying. He knew where it was coming from too. If you denied the shit long enough, you could just about convince yourself that it didn't stink. Didn't make it go away though. He wrapped his hand in her hair and kept her eyes on his.\n\n\"I don't remember!\" She twisted away from him and retreated to the far edge of the bed.",
        "\"I know you're lying,\" He advanced on her, keeping his anger in check. \n\nThe frail looked at him for a long moment, then looked away again. \"Brings it all back. Talking about it....thinking about it...it's like I'm back in that van listening to them talk to each other like they were four friends on a road trip.\" She hugged her knees. \n\nCreed stayed where he was. He could smell fear and anger rolling off of her. \"When the drug wore off you heard 'em?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"They talked pretty much the whole time. Mostly they were just nasty to each other. I figured as long as they were talking they would be distracted and I could try to figure out how to get away.\" She turned her face away. \"It was a stupid idea anyway.\"\n\n\"Lemme get this straight. You saw me get my head half blown off, you were drugged, you were kidnapped and you managed to shake the drug and be clear-headed enough to get one of their names?\"\n\n\"Three.\" Her voice was small.\n\nHe looked at her curiously. \"Three what?\"\n\n\"Three names. I don't know if they're first names or last names or nicknames or what though.\"\n\n\"Well, next time make sure to ask for ID before they crack your head open.\" His voice dripped with sarcasm.\n\nHer back twitched with a silent laugh. She turned her head and looked at him. \"Well it's not exactly a lead if it was all made up, and I didn't hear or don't remember one of the names.\" She moved closer to him.\n\nHe grasped her wrist and pulled her close. He gave a short laugh and pushed clawed fingers through her hair. \"Frail, when you're up to your ass in alligators, you come out with new boots and a matching handbag.\"\n\nA soft laugh. She relaxed against him a little more. \n\nHe waited until the fear began to fade from her scent. \"So one was Clay and he has a lisp. Is it obvious or do you really have to listen for it?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. It took me a while to recognize it, but the drug was wearing off and I couldn't see who was talking either. It made sorting out the voices tough in the beginning.\"\n\nHer body was moving toward relaxation, so he kept asking. \"Who else?\"\n\n\"King. He was the one I kicked in the very beginning.\"\n\n\"Kicked where?\"\n\n\"The side of his leg right by his knee. I must have hit him pretty hard too; because he spent the whole time I was awake complaining about it and trying to get comfortable. The others picked on him about it and about it being his first real job.\"\n\n\"Anything else about him?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No. Wait, yes. He had a strong New York City accent. They all kind of did, but his was more pronounced.\"\n\nHe felt tension creeping into her neck and shoulders, so he rubbed them carefully. \"And the other one you got a name for?\" \n\n\"Luther. He didn't say much, but he had a deep voice. I'm guessing he was older or something because the others seemed to listen to him.\"\n\n\"The other one say anything that stood out?\" He pulled the blanket up around her shoulders.\n\n\"Not that I can remember.\"\n\n\"Were they white, black, Asian, mutant?\"\n\n\"I only saw them for a few seconds, but I think they were all white and they all looked human. They knew who you were, and that I had been with you for awhile too.\"\n\nHe gave a little snort. \"You been around as long as I have, you develop kind of a reputation.\"\n\nHer lips brushed the front of his chest. \"Do you think they were in the jail where they kept me? I don't remember seeing them, but-\"\n\n\"Don't know for sure, but I don't think so. From what I know about Cavallo he likes to hire specialists.\" His claws played lightly over her back. She moaned softly. He could feel her body relaxing into his, could see her breathing deepen.\n\nHe lay down with her until she was deeply asleep again. That was something he was going to have to address, but right now the fact that she was out gave him some privacy. He grabbed his cell phone from the dresser and went out into the kitchen. The unimaginative yellow room seemed to be built for someone about a foot and a half shorter than he was. The linoleum was cracked; the small table and chairs had at least three coats of paint that he could see. It reminded him of an upscale shed. Still, it was furthest away from the frail.\n\nHe found Conlon's number in the directory and listened to the phone ring until it went to voice mail. He ended the call and tried again. This time it was answered.\n\n\"Conlon.\" \n\n\"Catch you jerking off?\" Creed asked.\n\n\"I was asleep. I tend to do that at three in the morning. Funny little habit of mine.\" The annoyance in the voice came through loud and clear.\n\nCreed growled. \"I'm up, so you're up. You said you knew the sniper who tried to take me out?\"\n\n\"I knew who he was. He came sniffing around Giada a few times. Told her stories to impress her.\" Conlon yawned. \"Why?\"\n\nCreed stared out the window into the darkness. He gave a derisive little snort. \"Decent shot, dumb as shit. You know any of Cavallo's other people?\"\n\n\"Not many.\"\n\n\"Anybody in acquisition and transport?\"\n\n\"No. Why?\"\n\n\"The frail got names of three of the four who took her.\" He heard Conlon sit up.\n\n\"How the hell did she do that?\" \n\nA little smile. \"Fuck if I know. I tell you though; I'd pick that girl's instincts over the training of three-quarters of the guys I've worked with.\" \n\n\"She's got a healing factor now, with a little training-\"\n\nCreed growled. \"Shut the fuck up and don't you dare bring that up again.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that she should-\"\n\n\"I don't give a shit what you meant. You got something to write with?\"\n\nHe heard Conlon fumbling for something. \"Yeah, go.\" Creed relayed the names and details that the frail had given him. \"What about Stan and Cavallo?\"\n\n\"Right now, I want 'em both alive and well and I wanna be able to put my hands on both of them when we get out of here.\"\n\n\"Done. If I manage to find the four?\"\n\nCreed thought for a minute. \"I think they might get accident-prone all of a sudden, and I think that their boss would like to know about it.\"\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nKelly woke up in the dim room and looked over at the digital clock on the bedside table. It was a little after nine. She was curled up on the edge of the queen sized bed. Victor was on his back, sprawled out across the mattress. He'd thrown off the covers at some point, but he was still sound asleep. The morning light was trickling in around ugly floral print curtains. It was just enough to create bright highlights and deep shadows on his naked form. \n\nShe'd dreamed of this so many times, that she wasn't sure if this was a dream too. Her fingers itched to touch him, but if she was dreaming the image would shatter, throwing her out of the warm, safe moment back into pain or darkness or both. She lay still, watching his chest rise and fall with each breath. His scent started to tease her. A mixture of his soap, the tang of sweat and something more primal that she couldn't describe. It brought a smile to her lips and reassured her that she was awake.\n\n\"Like what you see?\" His voice was a soft rumble.\n\nKelly blushed and looked away. \"I thought you were asleep.\" Her tone was equally soft.\n\nThe light caught the hint of one fang as he smiled. He reached over and tugged the blankets down, leaving her naked too.\n\n\"Hey!\" It was an insincere protest at best, and she did nothing to put the blanket back in place.\n\n\"You're the one who's always bitchin' about fairness.\" The softest part of one fingertip traced over her collarbone. \"Guess there's no satisfying some people.\"\n\nWarm pleasure started to suffuse her from the trail of his touch. She smiled. \"But you can see better than I can.\" She reached out to touch him.\n\n\"Uh-uh, frail. You got a good look. I want the same thing.\"\n\nShe lowered her hand and slid a little closer. \"I didn't get to touch though.\"\n\nHe turned onto his side, and propped her head up on one hand. He started to trace a delicate line down between her breasts. \"Yeah, well, I'm new to this whole 'fair' thing.\" \n\nHis finger continued down over her stomach and around her navel. Kelly's stomach trembled, her breathing came faster. His finger went lower; the tip of his claw barely touched her mound on its trip down. She didn't think about it, she just opened her legs.\n\nHe purred. \"So fucking soft.\" His fingertip continued down, his curved claw teasing just inside her slit.\n\nKelly whimpered, her body tense. \"Victor-\"\n\nHis mouth covered hers, the very tip of his claw rested at her entrance. He stayed there, his tongue teasing hers, the razor sharp claw separating and teasing her delicate folds. Either in spite of the nervous fear coursing through her veins or because of it, Kelly could feel an intense arousal rising quickly. She moaned against his mouth, the tension draining from her muscles.\n\n\"Still wanna complain?\" He nipped her lower lip. \n\nKelly moved slowly, opening her legs wider. \"No.\" She captured his lower lip for the briefest moment.\n\n\"Don't move.\" The tip of his claw poked lightly at the swollen center of her pleasure. Sweat broke out on her skin and a tremor started in her knees. \"Gonna trust me from now on?\"\n\nKelly was so close to the edge, his words didn't register at first. Even after they did, forming an answer seemed to be too much. \"Please...\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Please?\"\n\n\"S-So close-\"\n\n\"Aww, I know that.\" His voice was a soft rumble. \"Answer me first. Gonna trust me?\"\n\nKelly's head was spinning. She moaned. \"Yes.\" \n\nHe smirked. \"You sure?\"\n\nHer little whimper held pain and desire. \"Yes, I'm sure. Please...\"\n\nHe kept up delicate pressure and moved down her body, replacing his sharp claw with a soft tongue. The change in sensation was all the push she needed.\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCreed looked down at the deeply sleeping frail. She was mostly on her tummy, the sheets and blankets still pooled at the foot of the bed, her legs spread. His fingertips drifted over her back and thigh. She'd cum three times, twice on his tongue, once on his cock. Didn't matter how, just mattered that she screamed his name. He didn't figure he'd ever get tired of that.\n\nShe turned and snuggled into his chest. He buried his nose in her hair and drew a long breath, taking in her scent. One small hand stroked over his chest. He held it carefully.\n\n\"What time is it?\" The question was a soft mumble.
