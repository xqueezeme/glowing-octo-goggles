        "Chapter Seven: Unintended Consequences \n\nWhen I woke, that comforting presence was gone, and I wondered if I would be at home when I opened my eyes, but then I heard low voices, Tomas and Theron whispering in anger. I couldn't hear what they said, until Theron hissed the word \"fine\", and then I heard him storm off, stomping and muttering under his breath. I waited until I couldn't hear him anymore, preparing to get up, but then I heard Tomas chuckle close behind me. \n\n\"You can open your eyes now, Sierra. He's gone.\" \n\nI sat up, rubbing sleep from my eyes, and smiled at Tomas ruefully. \"Was that about me? I hope that I haven't stirred up any trouble, Tomas.\" \n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid it was about you. And don't worry, I will manage Theron. I admit that I'm relieved that you have so much common sense, Sierra.\" \n\n\"It doesn't take much common sense to realise that I don't want to be a mistress, can't be his wife, and that I would never survive the political shitstorm of trying to be either one. I don't exactly relish the idea of mothering the royal bastard, either.\" \n\n\"I think you'd be surprised, my lady,\" he replied drily, and we both smirked, \"at exactly how many women, even among the nobility, would give their entire family fortune for the opportunity to try. However, I also suspect that it makes it easier to turn down the charming, handsome King of Ferelden when one's heart is...already spoken for. Yes?\" \n\nI looked away, not wanting to meet his eyes, frantically trying to think up convincing ways to deny it. Why did I have to be so damned keen to show off my knowledge of Alistair? He brushed my hair out of my face, and I couldn't help but look at him. He was smiling down at me kindly, and didn't appear to be angry or offended. I felt my face crumple, and finally just nodded. I was entirely aware of how inappropriate my feelings were for a man I'd not even met yet, and how bad an idea it would be for me to even try to begin that relationship. Tomas watched the emotions pass across my face. He leaned forward, his face inches from mine, and whispered. \n\n\"For what's it's worth, you have my blessing.\" While I stared, mouth falling open in shock, Tomas winked at me and then bounded to his feet. \n\n\"Wake up, Sierra! We can't have you sleeping away the whole day.\" He called loud enough that Theron, from somewhere nearby, came crashing back into camp. I glared at Tomas, then tried to plaster a sleepy-confused expression on my face before Theron made it back into camp. \n\n\"Good morning, Theron,\" I called as he came within sight. He scowled, reminding me of nothing so much as a sulky child, but then managed to wipe the expression off his face and come over to sit by me. Tomas crouched in front of us, pointedly ignoring the fact that Theron practically sat with his knee touching mine. I mentally rolled my eyes. \n\n\"I thought that today we should perhaps scout into Lothering and see what is happening there, maybe make sure we haven't missed Alistair and Aedan on the way here. From what Sierra has said, I don't think we should stay in town,\" I shook my head in confirmation, \"but we need some information.\" \n\n\"I should go.\" I cut him off before he could say any more. He opened his mouth to object, but I raised my hand to silence him. \"You two may look slightly different with your fancy new haircuts, but the fact is, you're both supposed to be dead and we can't afford for rumours of either of you to circulate and get back to Loghain. And there are some of his men already in town, harassing the townsfolk and looking for Alistair and Aedan. No one in Ferelden knows me, and I can go there without being recognised. There are enough templars remaining at the Chantry that I shouldn't have to fear for my safety, and it should be days at least before the darkspawn swarm this place. I'll find out what I can, maybe see if I can buy some food, and come back.\" The men looked at each other, both obviously reluctant to go but knowing I was right. \"The only concern is if I disappear again while I'm there. So I propose that I head into town, you guys wait until tonight, and if I don't come back you can try to sneak in tomorrow.\" They both finally nodded. \n\n\"I'll get cleaned up and then put on my fancy new dress. The only other thing, is, well... I'm going to have to act like a noblewoman, until I can get some suitable common clothing at least. I need a name of some minor, unknown noble I can claim to be related to if anyone asks. The daughter of a younger son, something like that. Somewhere to say I'm from. It has to be small enough that no one in Lothering is likely to ever have been there. Theron, do you have any ideas?\" \n\n\"Let me think while you wash up.\" \n\nI headed to the stream, washing my hands and face thoroughly and wetting my hair so I could put it up in an updo. Thank God for hair that stays braided without elastics! It was difficult with such a small mirror and only a comb, but I was finally satisfied that it would stay. I changed my underpants, washing out the dirty pair in the stream with the soap, and tucking them, still damp, into the pack. I hoped neither Tomas nor Theron went looking through that pocket! It was warm enough that I took off my bulky jacket, and slipped the dress on over just my t-shirt. It looked far less rumpled that way, and I was again impressed at the tailor I'd found. Even though the dress was designed for a larger body, the way it hung, meant to cover layered clothing, meant you couldn't tell. Lastly I added the cloak, leaving the hood back for now. \n\nThe looks on both men's faces were priceless when I wandered back into the clearing, forcing myself to stride purposefully, keep good posture, and ever so slightly keep my nose in the air. Clearly neither thought I could pull off looking like a noblewoman, and my anxiety eased slightly as I thought that just maybe I could fool everyone into believing. Tomas handed me two pouches with coin, and glancing inside, I immediately understood. One was virtually empty, holding only a couple of silver coins and half a dozen copper ones. I was grateful to see they were actual Fereldan currency, not my Roman stuff. The other pouch was fuller, and I laughed as Theron looked on in amazement as I tucked it securely down the neck of my dress, into my bra. If anyone tried to rob me, they'd think the small pouch was all I had, and most of the coin would be safe. Tomas smiled in approval as he watched me. I left the sword, though I kept the dagger firmly tied to my thigh, invisible under the dress. \n\nTheron gave me a back-story. He told me about a minor noble, a Lord William of Wentwater, in the far north, whose land was very isolated on the coast several days outside of Amaranthine. He'd married a young commoner from the Free Marches in his later years, after his wife and son died, and then been widowed again when she died in childbirth. He was rarely seen, refusing to come to the Landsmeet and other events, and apparently had two daughters, about my age, neither of whom he let leave the castle. Of course this spurred a lot of rumours that he was bedding his own girls, but Theron suspected the truth was he was senile and kept his daughters close as nursemaids. No one had reported seeing them in years, and he couldn't even remember their names, so we decided I should stick with my own. I could claim to be running away from home, heading to Redcliffe, and that would explain my presence in Lothering. I fixed the details in my mind, and then Tomas escorted me to within a couple of miles of town. \n\nNervous, I headed toward Lothering alone. After a few minutes I came around a bend on the Imperial Highway and stopped, startled. There were no bandits on the road, and I turned onto the ramp leading down into Lothering. In place of the ramshackle refugee camp outside of town that I expected, there was a sea of tents, aligned with military precision, and the area was swarming with soldiers. Some were practicing on hastily roped-off training grounds, some were marching in small units of about a dozen men, hurrying off to do...something. Others were lounging around, polishing and repairing armour, eating, or sitting in small groups just talking. There were women bustling around, carrying things, cooking over small fires, hanging laundry in the sun, and generally doing the day-to-day things that were needed to feed and care for that many men. \n\nDespite the apparent discipline within the camp, a sombre mood hung over the whole area. All the voices seemed to be hushed whispers, with the exception of the leaders calling out orders. The only loud noises were the clang of practice swords on shields, and the tromping of feet. There were guards posted regularly around the edge of the camp, all of them alert and grim. I noted an area, slightly separated from the rest of the camp, which must have been an infirmary, overflowing with men. These men had seen battle, I surmised, and some hadn't survived. The missing troops from Ostagar! \n\nI skirted the edge of the camp, not anxious to get close to whichever nobleman was leading this army. My story wouldn't hold up if anyone knew of Lord William. I tried to blend into a group of refugees, avoiding the soldiers and trudging towards the town proper. I pulled up the hood on my cloak, hiding my fancy hairdo, and made it to the edge of town without being stopped. Lothering was much larger than the game had implied, unsurprisingly. However, the Chantry was visible from the gate where I entered, and I headed in that direction, hoping for information. \n\nThere were soldiers all over the town. Some marched in groups, and I wondered if they were meant as guards. Other walked casually, clearly not on duty, talking and heading in and out of shops. I avoided eye contact, and kept moving towards the building that strongly resembled a church. Instead of a cross there was the eye and starburst thing I remembered from the game, but otherwise it looked like any rural church from home. \n\nI found a templar on guard outside the Chantry, and approached him nervously. I pulled my hood back to show my face, but not enough to show my hair or allow anyone else to get a good look at me. He looked curiously down at my dress, then offered a slight bow of his head. \n\n\"My Lady? How may I assist you?\" \n\nI asked about the soldiers, and he informed me that they were the remnants of the men commanded by Arl Bryland at Ostagar. The name was familiar, though I couldn't place it, and I filed that away for later. The Arl himself wasn't with the men, having left in a hurry for Denerim, leaving an underling in command. He volunteered that the soldiers had orders to keep the peace in Lothering and assist with evacuating the entire town over the next few days. He knew that the men had come from Ostagar, and had heard conflicting rumours about what had happened there. Some said the Grey Wardens had betrayed the King, but others heard that Loghain had run away in fear. Everyone agreed the King and all of the Grey Wardens were dead. There had apparently been a couple of bar-room brawls between some random travelers and a handful of Bryland's men, and I wondered if the would-be assassins in the tavern where I recalled meeting Leliana had been chased off. If they had, I figured I should probably try to find Leliana, because I didn't know where she would end up meeting Alistair and Aedan if not during that fight. \n\nI asked about the evacuation efforts, and he admitted that without Bryland's men, they'd never have been able to manage. As it was, he thought that they just might be able to get everyone out, but everyone was worried it would take too long. He hoped that it didn't come down to combat with the horde while refugees were fleeing for their lives. He seemed frustrated at standing uselessly in front of the Chantry instead of doing something to help. I was completely sympathetic. \n\nI asked where I might get food. He told me that twice a day, the soldiers handed out rations to refugees in the common area, in front of the tavern. I asked if there was any way to buy some, and he suggested I talk to whoever was in charge over by the wagons. He pointed out the merchants in the immediate area, adding that the army had either bought or commandeered all the food they had, but left the rest of the gear for the merchants to sell. \n\nI asked him about Sister Leliana, and he gave me a surprised look. He told me she was likely inside the Chantry somewhere helping out the Revered Mother. I thanked him for all the information, and headed to a nearby merchant. I managed to buy a couple of sturdy packs, a cook pot, some bowls and spoons, and a two extra water skins for a couple of the silver coins in my pouch. The merchant looked far too pleased, and I realised that I'd probably paid far too much for them, but without any idea of how much things were actually worth, I couldn't haggle effectively. I stuffed my prizes into one of the packs and headed into the Chantry. \n\nI immediately heard that voice I knew so well from hours in front of my PC. I looked around, easily locating the source. The slim redhead was near the altar, directing a couple of refugees in placing cots and bedrolls in a small space cleared of benches. She looked exactly like she did in the game, shoulder-length hair with a small, neat braid. Her French (or I supposed, Orlesian) accent was thick, but coming from a bilingual country, I had no difficulty understanding her. I didn't speak the language, but was used to hearing my language spoken in a French accent. Some of the men seemed to be having trouble though, as one moved one way, one another, and they lost control of the cot they were lifting. Leliana darted around them, her robes unable to hide the grace and speed of her movements, and caught the edge of the cot before it crashed to the ground. Settling it gently to the floor, she smiled at both men in thanks and they shuffled off. \n\nI approached her uncertainly, suddenly unable to think of anything to say to her. When she glanced up and saw me, she went unnaturally still, face pale as she studied mine. She glanced about, and I saw fear on her face. Oh God, she thinks I'm one of Marjolaine's hirelings. I slowly raised both hands, keeping them still and visible, hoping I could keep her calm before something ugly happened. \n\n\"Can we talk? Somewhere private? I swear I am not here to hurt you.\" She studied my eyes for a moment, and then nodded, turning to lead me down a back hallway and out into a small garden behind the main building. She stayed standing, her posture stiff, and I guessed she had a dagger palmed in each tense hand. I kept my hands visible, put my back to the wall of the building, and sank down to sit carefully on the grass. I stayed silent, waiting for her to speak first. \n\n\"I...know you. You were in Orlais. When I was young, still living with Lady Cecilie. But...you look the same. Exactly the same. How is this possible?\" \n\nI blinked. She didn't think I was sent by Marjolaine. She...saw me, when I had dreamt of her youth. I hoped that meant she was less likely to kill me on principle. \n\n\"You do like to start with the hard questions, don't you?\" Oh boy. \"Listen, I can't tell you the whole story right now. It wasn't me you saw, not really. It was magic, somehow. I don't exactly understand it, but I wasn't really there.\" I shook my head, unsure of how to explain it. I tried to change the subject. \n\n\"I'm here, now, because of the Blight. I know about your vision, Leliana. The darkness, falling. The rose that bloomed on the dead rosebush. But...somehow I changed how things were supposed to happen. That army isn't supposed to be out there - they weren't supposed to survive. You were supposed to meet the last two remaining Grey Wardens and aid them during a brawl in the tavern - but now that brawl might not happen. I'm afraid that the changes mean you won't end up finding the Wardens, and I know they will need your help if they are to end the Blight. I know it's asking for a big leap of faith, but I'm hoping that you will consent to come with me so I can make sure you find the Wardens you were meant to aid.\" \n\nI rambled to a stop, suddenly aware that I probably wasn't making any sense. I watched the beautiful bard's face, and realised she was much, much better than Duncan at hiding her thoughts. \n\n\"How do you know about my vision? How do you know what I was, or was not, meant to do?\" She still looked so tense. I hope I don't get to find out what the pointy end of a dagger feels like anytime soon. \n\n\"The only answer I can give you right now is magic. There is more to it - isn't there always - but I simply don't have time, right now, to explain it all. I will, I promise, just not right now. Look, there are others with me. I left them outside town, and they are waiting for me. I was supposed to try to buy some food, get some information, and then return to them. I would like to request that you come with me to meet them. If you choose not to stay, after that, you're free to walk away. I give you my word. I will give you my weapon; I'll let you search me, so you know I'm not going to try to harm you. I warn you that my companions are armed, but they will not harm you either. I swear it.\" She studied my face intently for a while, and I raised the skirt of my dress to remove the dagger I had hiding there, tossing it on the ground at her feet while I waited. \n\n\"You are no Fereldan noblewoman.\" \n\n\"You have absolutely no idea how correct you are. I just hope that, for the sake of getting out of town unscathed, I can pretend that I am for a few more minutes.\" Finally, she nodded. Picking up the dagger, she offered it to me hilt first. I tied it back to my leg, and then took her hand and let her pull me up. \n\n\"I shall help you get past the soldiers and back to your friends. I promise nothing more until you explain.\" \n\n\"Fair enough,\" I agreed, sighing in relief. I realised I'd been holding my breath while I waited on her decision. \"Is there any way you could also help me purchase some food? I just want a few days' worth of rations for my companions.\" \n\n\"I know the Sister in charge of helping to distribute the food the army has been providing the refugees. Let's go and see what we can do.\" \n\nLeliana walked with me across the small footbridge to reach the open square. It was full of people, most looking ragged, despondent, and exhausted. In the centre there stood a small knot of soldiers surrounding one elderly Chantry sister. The crowd parted at the sight of Leliana's robes, allowing us through. She motioned for me to stop a few feet from the group, and she slipped between the armed men to reach the other woman. They whispered briefly, and I saw Leliana squeeze her hand, nod, and slip back out. Whether it was the robes or Leliana's skill, I wasn't sure the soldiers had even really recognised her presence. \n\n\"We have to talk to the quartermaster over in the army camp. If we're unlucky, we will have to talk to the lieutenant. I need to know your cover story if I'm to be able to help you. You do have one, I hope?\" \n\nShe murmured this in my ear, and I responded in kind as we walked through town. \n\n\"I'm Lady Sierra of Wentwater. My father is Lord William. I am on the run from home - I've been kept in that castle since I was a little girl, never allowed friends or suitors, and I'm going to go mad if I stay. I have an ...uh, acquaintance, who's gone to Redcliffe to be a guard, and I'm going there to be with him. I'm trying to travel without drawing much attention, because if my father catches me I'll never see the light of day again.\" \n\nLeliana laughed, twining her arm through mine to keep me close to her as we walked. \"And is any of that true?\" \n\n\"Well, there is a Lord William of Wentwater. And he does have daughters who he never lets out, apparently. But the rest? Not so much.\" ",
        "We arrived at the edge of the army camp, and Leliana led me through the maze of tents and people with finesse. We found the quartermaster, who started shouting the moment she opened her mouth and said the word food. Backing away as he muttered curses under his breath, we exchanged a look and turned to head toward the command tent. \n\nEyeing Leliana's Chantry robes, or maybe just eyeing Leliana, one of the guards outside stepped in to see if the lieutenant would see us. We heard a barked \"Come!\", and she dragged me into the large tent as the guard saluted and went back outside. \n\nThe lieutenant was a tall, handsome man with the exception of a large, angry, poorly healing scar across his face from forehead, across the bridge of his nose, and down to his cheek. He seemed uncomfortable with it, one hand straying up to touch the edges that were the most raised and irritated. Leliana immediately exclaimed, bearing down on him like...well, like a priest I suppose, pushing him down to kneel while she inspected the damage. She tsk'd at him for not coming sooner for healing, and pulled out a small vial of red fluid - a health poultice - from a pocket in her robes. She dribbled some of the fluid onto a thin strip of cloth, and proceeded to dab at the length of the cut. He tried to stop her, but she was relentless and I had to admire her no-nonsense attitude. In short order, the laceration was closed, the puckered and reddened skin edges fading as I watched. Soon the scar looked several years old, just a thin white line across his handsome face. \n\n\"Now, are there many others with unhealed wounds like this?\" She demanded. \n\nThe poor lieutenant under scrutiny climbed to his feet, his face red from embarrassment as he shook his head. Leliana stroked his cheek with a smile, and the irritation faded, and suddenly I knew we would get anything she asked for. She's good! \n\nI watched, impressed, as she pled with him to buy rations for me, weaving a much more romantic tale of my flight from my oppressive father and my dashing betrothed than I'd been able to muster. I don't think he heard a word of it, but when he'd determined all she wanted was to pay for some rations, he agreed immediately. He thanked her, of all things, kissed her hand, bowed slightly to me, and asked the guard to take us back to the quartermaster and tell him to sell us the food. \n\nThe guard thanked Leliana profusely for taking care of the lieutenant's injury; apparently he'd insisted everyone else get healed, but wouldn't accept it himself deeming his wound cosmetic and therefore unimportant. It seemed the lieutenant was well liked, and I could see why. Leliana took my two remaining silver coins from the small purse in my cloak pocket, and haggled with the quartermaster for rations to feed us for several days, even once Aedan and company caught up to us. I unfolded the second pack I'd bought, and Leliana carried it as we left the army camp."
