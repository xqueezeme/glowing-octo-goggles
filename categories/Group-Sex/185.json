        "Hello friend! I've had an idea for a while for some stories that are not my usual epic romances, but rather short to medium stand-alone pieces. I'm going to call them Booty Shorts.\n\nThis is a little one-off story that crawled its way out of my head after a sort-of-funny, sort-of-serious conversation I had with another author. It is NOT what you're expecting if you are a regular reader of mine. If you are here for lesbian content only, do not read this. It's certainly the filthiest thing I've ever written and the blame lies entirely on the shoulders of AwkwardMD. If you are mad that you came here expecting my normal fare and got this, blame her.\n\nContent warning for my regular readers: The story contains some rather explicit M/F interaction.\n\nEnjoy... or be appalled that this is coming from me. Reader's choice.\n\n~~ Dunedin, Florida ~~\n\n\"Why was Gwen so pissed at me tonight?\" Alyx asked her wife, as she turned their Chevy Bolt onto their street.\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about it. You know she's always a grump.\" Mellony said as she reached for the garage door opener in the center console.\n\n\"I know, but she was really giving me the cold shoulder.\"\n\nMellony glanced at Alyx, gauging how honest she should be. \"It's probably because you announced you were a Gold Star lesbian.\"\n\n\"What? Why would... That was a joke. I only said it because everyone was talking about wangs when I came back. I just have no frame of reference.\" She said, as she pulled into the garage and hit the button to turn off their car.\n\n\"I know babe. That term can carry a little baggage for some women though.\"\n\nMellony plugged their car into the charger in the garage, then they walked into their little Florida style, pink coral-colored two-bedroom bungalow.\n\n\"Well, hello Mr. Worthington!\" Alyx said in the high-pitched, little girl voice she reserved for their Corgi pup, Douglass P. Worthington, otherwise known as Doug the Dog. Doug was going through the usual ecstatic gyrations reserved for when his mommies returned home on the days they didn't take him to work with them.\n\nThey let Doug precede them through the kitchen to the French doors leading to their small, fenced-in backyard, the short brown and white log of fur scampering before them on his four tiny legs. Doug ran across the yard, searching out his tennis ball, then returned, dropping it at their feet with a single yap. Doggie vernacular for Throw it! The king of the house commands you! Mellony obliged, tossing the ball to the far side of the yard.\n\n\"What baggage?\" Alyx asked. She clearly didn't want to let it go.\n\n\"Okay, don't get upset, because I know you don't mean it this way, but when some women hear someone say 'I'm a Gold Star lesbian' they hear 'I'm trans- or bi-phobic'.\"\n\n\"What?! I'm not--\"\n\n\"I know! I've never taken it that way when you've said it. I told you not to get upset, but that term has a loaded meaning for some women.\"\n\n\"I only meant I've never been with a guy! Not that I hold it against lesbians who have or bi-women or anything like that! You're bi, and I married you! I just meant I don't have a frame of reference!\" Alyx tended to repeat herself when flustered.\n\n\"I know,\" Mellony said patiently, leaning down to pick up the tennis ball Mr. Worthington had dropped at her feet and tossed it again. \"Gwen's bi though, you know that, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that.\"\n\n\"Okay. And she started dating a guy last week.\"\n\nAlyx's eyebrows furrowed. \"I didn't know that.\"\n\n\"You were in the bathroom when she told us. Then when you came back, we were talking about 'wang', as you so eloquently put it, and you said 'I guess I have nothing to add to this conversation, since I'm a Gold Star lesbian.'\"\n\n\"It was a joke!\"\n\n\"Sweetie, it's okay. I know you were joking and I know you didn't mean anything by it.\"\n\n\"Hmmph!\" Alyx said, crossing her arms, her foot tapping in the grass in frustration as Mellony gave the increasingly soggy tennis ball another toss. \"Gwen didn't know I was joking apparently.\"\n\nMellony put her arm around her, giving her a squeeze. Physically, they were two peas in a pod. Middling height Florida girls, with the sun-bronzed skin, sun-bleached blonde hair and slim builds that came from the early morning surfing or swimming they squeezed in every day before opening their store. The main difference between the two was Alyx wore her hair long, usually in a braid, while Mellony kept hers short, swept over and chin length on the right side, with an undercut on the left side.\n\nSince they'd started dating their senior year at Florida State, Mellony had been a patient partner. Alyx often had difficulty reading the social cues that most people picked up easily, but Mellony didn't mind. She knew her wife better than anyone, maybe even including Alyx's parents, as Mellony's acceptance of her quirks had made Alyx open up to her like she never had all through high school. Alyx had a keen intellect and an understatedly dry sense of humor. It's just that if you didn't know that she operated differently than your average person, her jokes could come across as serious, and when she was serious it could seem like she was joking.\n\n\"Gwen, as we've already discussed, is a grumpy Gus. Don't worry about her. Just maybe don't use that term around her again.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Alyx stood with her arms crossed, watching the ritual game of fetch.\n\nThey stood in companionable silence, enjoying the evening air, until Mr. Worthington tired of chasing the ball and finally relieved himself, then they retreated inside to start their bedtime routine. Mellony went to the kitchen to fetch a large glass of water for their bedside table, while Alyx pulled down the quilt on the bed. The quilt was almost never necessary, Florida being Florida, but Alyx was a creature of habit. Having moved to Florida from Minnesota when she was ten, she insisted there be a quilt on the bed out of habit, just as she insisted on neatly folding it down before they retired for the night. She also insisted on neatly making their bed every morning, even when they were in a rush to hit the beach to catch some waves before opening their tourist shop just off Clearwater Beach.\n\nAlyx came out of the bathroom in one of the XXL t-shirts she liked to wear to bed just in time to see Mellony toss the small rawhide chew she'd brought from the kitchen to Doug, who was happily wagging his stump of a tail in his doggie bed. Alyx's face lit up.\n\nWhenever Mellony brought a chew into the bedroom, it was a signal for Alyx that sex was on. A non-dog owner perhaps might find the habit a little odd, but it worked for Alyx and Mellony. It was about the only way they could keep their Corgi from jumping up into the middle of things without having to lock him out of the room, which inevitably led to barking and scratching at the door.\n\nMellony flipped off the light switch, plunging the room into darkness. It took a few moments for Alyx's eyes to adjust to the dim light through the bedroom window. By the time they did, Mellony was naked. Alyx whipped off her t-shirt to follow suit. They approached the bed from opposite sides, shuffling towards each other across the mattress on their knees. Mellony wrapped her arms around Alyx, mashing their breasts together as their tongues danced.\n\nMellony's body jerked a bit as she felt Alyx's hand slide between her legs. It didn't take long for her moisture to start spreading, lubricating Alyx's fingers. Mellony began rocking her hips against her wife's hand. She tried to push Alyx to lay down, but Alyx stayed on her knees, rubbing Mellony's clit, a little faster, a little harder. Mellony smiled into Alyx's mouth as they kissed.\n\n\"Going to be one of those nights, huh?\" she whispered.\n\nThey'd long ago learned each other's signals, habits, tendencies. When Alyx tried to get Mellony off quickly right from the start, it almost always meant that Alyx wanted a specific thing in return.\n\n\"Y'all were the ones talking about wangs. Not my fault,\" Alyx said, distractedly.\n\nIt didn't take Mellony long. The thought of what was coming next heightened her excitement, and she was soon quaking and moaning, gripping Alyx's shoulders tightly. As Mellony approached her orgasm, Alyx sensed it and switched from stroking her clit to plunging two fingers into her, sending her over the edge.\n\n\"Oh, yes baby! Yes! Yes!\" Mellony cried out, holding Alyx's shoulders to keep from collapsing. \"You put the gold in Gold Star.\" She panted and sank back to sit on the bed as she caught her breath.\n\nAlyx giggled, then frowned. \"You said I shouldn't say that anymore.\"\n\n\"I know baby, I'm just teasing. Sorry.\"\n\nAlyx dropped onto her back, waiting. \"I know how you can make it up to me!\"\n\n\"I need a minute. Hang on,\" Mellony said, her voice uneven. She moved to the edge of the bed, taking a long drink from the glass of water, then she slid open the drawer in the side table and rummaged around inside.\n\n\"I want Big Red tonight,\" Alyx said coyly.\n\nMellony looked over her shoulder at her wife as her eyebrows raised in surprise. \"You haven't wanted him in a long time. Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Wangs. Not my fault.\"\n\nMellony giggled as she put their largest dildo into their harness and stepped into it.\n\nAlyx spread her legs as Mellony crawled in between them. She paused halfway to explore Alyx's pussy with her tongue.\n\n\"Wow, baby, you're soaking wet.\"\n\n\"I know. No foreplay, come up here and fuck me.\"\n\nMellony didn't need to be told twice. Raising up on one arm, she gripped the dildo and guided it between Alyx's lips.\n\n\"Ow! Slow, please,\" Alyx said wincing.\n\nMellony grunted assent and, ever so slowly, eased the head of the huge silicone dick into her.\n\n\"O-o-o-o-o-h fuck!\" Alyx moaned when Mellony slid fully inside.\n\nThey were silent for an interminable time after that as Mellony kissed Alyx. One small, soft, wet kiss, at the end of each thrust. Alyx closed her eyes, accepting Mellony's kisses, until a small keening sound started in the back of her throat and she tipped her head back.\n\n\"Say it,\" Mellony said.\n\n\"No,\" Alyx said, defiance in her voice.\n\n\"Say i-i-i-t,\"\n\n\"No,\" Alyx pouted. It was one of their favorite games.\n\nMellony pulled almost all the way out, then held the dildo there motionless.\n\n\"Say it, or I stop,\" Mellony whispered. She started thrusting in and out a bare fraction of an inch, the head of the dildo just spreading the entrance of Alyx's opening.\n\nAlyx pounded the mattress with her fists with the frustration of being unable to resist. She cried out, \"Fuck me Mell! Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!\"\n\nMellony had immediately started thrusting into her in time with her cries, bottoming out on every stroke.\n\n\"Yes! Yes! Fuck me, fuck me, yes! I love you, baby! God, yes!\" Alyx yelled as her body shook and writhed. Her spasms went on and on until Mellony's back started to ache. Finally, Alyx stopped coming and Mellony pulled out of her with an obscene slurping sound.\n\n\"I love it when you say 'I love you' when you come,\" Mellony said.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nMellony laughed as she reached for the buckle on the side of the harness, but Alyx stopped her.\n\n\"Wait!\" Alyx said. She grabbed her arm and pulled her down onto her back. Alyx got up on her hands and knees and scooched down until her head hovered over Mellony's groin. She tucked her long, sun-bleached hair behind her ear then lowered her head and sucked the end of dildo into her mouth.\n\n\"Whoa!\" Mellony said, rising up onto her elbows to watch. In the dim light from the window, Mellony could see Alyx's eyes on her as she gave her what could only be described as a blowjob. \"What's gotten into you? You've never done this before.\"\n\nAlyx took her mouth off the silicone cock and a thick line of spit trailed from her lips to the tip.\n\n\"Wang. Your fault.\" She rose up to her knees, the line of saliva breaking off and trailing down Alyx's body, a glistening line in the moonlight. She moved forward then sank down onto the cock in one motion. \"Oh yes!\" She rode it like she was in an extremely horny derby cup. It took only a moment before she was writhing as she impaled herself on top of Mellony.\n\n\"Yes, baby, yes! So good, Mell! So good!\" She stopped bouncing as her body shook with her second orgasm, then she collapsed over Mellony, who chuckled, gently stroking her back with both hands.\n\nIt was a few minutes until Mellony could coax Alyx to un-impale herself and flip onto her back. Mellony got up and went into the bathroom to de-harness herself and wash their toy in the sink. Hygiene before sleep.\n\nShe was surprised when she returned to the bed to find Alyx still awake. Usually a big orgasm put her right to sleep, and she'd had two. Mellony slid into bed and Alyx cuddled up next to her. Mr. Worthington, having finished his chew, jumped up on the bed, circled exactly three times and laid down at their feet.\n\n\"What got into you tonight?\" Mellony asked, \"'Wang, my fault'?\"\n\nAlyx giggled. \"I know. I was thinking about the conversation everyone was having when I came back and what you said about my Gold Star comment,\" Alyx made finger quotes with the hand that wasn't pinned under Mellony. \"I only said it because I've never seen a guy's... thingy in person before, not because I... wouldn't.\"\n\nMellony felt her eyebrows raise. \"You've thought about sleeping with a guy? You've never told me that before.\"\n\n\"No! I mean, no, not sleep with a guy. Just... sometimes I've been curious what they're like. Wangs, I mean. Not that I'm unsatisfied with our sex life. At all. You're my everything, you know?\"\n\nMellony kissed the top of her head. \"You too, baby.\"\n\n\"But y'all were talking tonight about wangs, and I remembered you told me once about your boyfriend before me in college, um... Craig?\"\n\n\"That's him.\"\n\n\"You said he was a little dumb, but he had a really nice dick.\"\n\n\"He did have a really nice dick,\" Mellony said, the grin in her voice obvious in the darkness.\n\n\"That's what I was thinking about when I asked for Big Red.\"\n\n\"So, you are curious about what sex with a guy is like.\"\n\nAlyx made a frustrated sound. \"No, that's not what I meant. I'm... I'm just... sometimes I've been curious about penises. A little. Not guys. I don't want some hairy, sweaty male hovering over me. I am definitely attracted to women generally, and you specifically. I just... I guess I wish there was a way I could see or maybe touch one sometime. So I'd have a frame of reference the next time you're talking about it with our friends.\"\n\n\"Big Red doesn't count?\"\n\n\"Big Red is fine, believe me. But he's still just a lump of rubber.\" She was silent for a long moment. \"I guess I don't know what I'm trying to say.\"\n\nMellony had long practice helping Alyx reason out her thoughts. \"It sounds like what you're saying is you wish you had the chance to play with a real penis, without there being a man involved in any way.\"\n\n\"Yes! That's what I mean.\"\n\n\"That sounds problematic,\" Mellony said with a laugh.\n\n\"I know. I'm not sure I ever would, even if it were possible. I mean first off, we're married, and you're all I want. Secondly, now that I've said it out loud I'm imagining a severed zombie dick twitching and flopping around, looking for pussy brains to eat.\"\n\n\"Oh gross, how am I supposed to sleep after you put that visual in my head!\" Mellony griped.\n\n\"You'll manage,\" Alyx responded through a huge yawn. \"If you need to sleep late, I'll open the store tomorrow. You can bike in later.\"\n\n\"You'd better. You know how grumpy I get without sleep. I'll scare off all the tourists.\"\n\nThe only answer was a soft snore.\n\nThree weeks later, the girls were getting ready to close their shop, Two Chicks Sun-N-Surf.\n\nNeither of them had found jobs in their areas of study immediately after college, accounting for Alyx, marketing for Mellony, so they'd moved back home to Clearwater, working in the Ron Jon surf shop, and living in the tiny one-room apartment above Mellony's parent's garage and spending all their free time on the beach.\n\nThey soon both realized they didn't want nine-to-five office jobs after anyway, having become addicted to the surfing life. After a few years, Alyx came into a small inheritance from her grandfather. Not an enormous sum, but enough. Alyx had crunched the numbers, made a financial plan, while Mellony had designed a social media and advertising strategy, and they had opened their own tiny surf boutique-slash-tourist trap, two blocks off the best beach on Florida's west coast. Within a year they were able to buy their little two-bedroom house in Dunedin. Every morning was a day in paradise, getting up early to hit the beach for an hour or two, then working together all day, no bosses or irritating coworkers. Just the two of them, and the steady, endless stream of tourists looking for sunscreen, t-shirts and the occasional surfboard.\n\nAlyx was ringing up the last customers' new bathing suits, suntan lotion and tourist tchotchkes, while Mellony swept the floors. It seemed at least five pounds of sand was tracked in by the tourists every day.\n\n\"Good haul today!\" Alyx exclaimed with delight as she locked the door. \"We've gotten rid of almost the entire clearance rack of last season's rashers and two of the really expensive boogie boards. Sold seven of our store t-shirts too!\" Mellony had designed their store logo, a cartoon of two small, fuzzy baby chicks on a surfboard catching a wave. Souvenirs with their logo on it were some of their best sellers.\n\n\"Good, nice to have some extra cash since I'm taking you out tonight.\"\n\n\"What's the occasion?\" Alyx asked.\n\n\"Today's our fifth anniversary.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Alyx exclaimed, suddenly panicked.\n\nMellony laughed. \"I've told you like four times in the last month.\"\n\n\"Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I didn't remember! How could I forget that?!\"\n\n\"Baby, it's fine.\" Mellony said, with a patient smile.\n\nAlyx could recite the UPC code of almost every item in their store from memory, and could predict within a dollar or two what the day's register totals would be without looking, but remembering holidays and anniversaries was completely beyond her abilities. After a few years of frustration with this, Mellony had decided to be amused by it, rather than getting upset.\n\n\"But I didn't get you anything!\" Alyx said, looking like she might cry.\n\n\"It's okay. You always say that since our money is in a joint account, if you got me anything it'd be like I was buying it for myself.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the only logical way to look at it.\" Alex said, matter-of-factly, her entire demeanor changing in an instant from distraught to pragmatic.\n\nMellony grinned at how easily she'd been able to derail Alyx from being upset over having forgotten their anniversary by bringing up one of her own frequent logical pet peeves. \"I didn't get you anything either. Instead I transferred an extra five hundred dollars to our vacation savings fund. So, we're that much closer to our month in Europe during the off-season.\"\n\n\"That's perfect!\" said Alyx happily, \"Something for both of us!\"\n\n\"And, I've planned a nice evening out tonight,\" Mellony said as she retrieved her canvas purse from the back room and slung it over her shoulder.\n\n\"Okay! That's a win-win! I'm sorry I forgot. Although that means we only have, um...\" she furrowed her brow for a few seconds, \"About seven-hundred-thirty-seven dollars left in the joint account after your transfer.\"\n\nMellony laughed, pulling an ATM receipt out of her bag. \"Seven-hundred-thirty-two\" she said, reading off the paper slip.\n\nAlyx narrowed her eyes accusingly. \"You went to Starbucks without me, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I admit nothing. C'mon, I got us a reservation for one of the beach tables at Frenchy's.\"\n\nAlyx apologized three more times for forgetting their anniversary until they were seated at their table at Frenchy's Cafe on Clearwater Beach, a few blocks from their shop. Mellony ordered Alyx one of the house specials, the Frenchy's Rum Runner. Alyx's apologies turned into an amused tone.",
        "\"Are you trying to get me drunk? On a work night?\" she asked as the tall, pink drink was set in front of her. \"Not that I mind, but you aren't joining me,\" she said, nodding at Mellony's Tecate.\n\n\"Someone has to drive.\"\n\n\"Why don't we just leave the car at the shop and Uber home?\"\n\n\"A seafood burrito and a rum runner is nice, but it isn't really a special evening. I told you, I have plans.\"\n\nThey enjoyed their meal, then held hands and watched the fiery yellow disc of the sun turn blood red as it sank into the Gulf of Mexico. Mellony had ordered another rum drink for Alyx, opting for an iced tea instead of a second beer for herself.\n\n\"Now I know you're up to something,\" Alyx said as their second round arrived, although with more curiosity than suspicion.\n\nAlyx had grown used to -- indeed she'd come to rely on -- Mellony making all their social plans. Their relationship had really started clicking once they'd defined their roles. Alyx took care of the numbers side of everything, from their personal finances and bills, to keeping the books for their store, ordering and maintaining inventory, and doing their taxes. Mellony was in charge of all their social activities, from remembering friends and family member's birthdays and buying all their gifts, as well as their grocery shopping and meal planning, and scheduling their social lives. One time, as an experiment, Mellony had told Alyx she was in charge of planning their next social event. After three weeks of eating at home and watching Netflix and HGTV, Mellony had given up and accepted an invitation to a night out with their friends on behalf of herself and Alyx.\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. Do you want dessert?\" Mellony asked.\n\n\"Only if it's in your plans. Otherwise, I'm ready for what's next.\"\n\nWith a smile, Mellony waved at their waiter, then made the universal signing the check motion.\n\n\"We haven't been down here in forever,\" Alyx said, half an hour later as they drove through the slightly seedier area of downtown St. Petersburg. They normally stayed in Clearwater or the small towns to the North, like Dunedin, where they lived, or Tarpon Springs. \"Are you taking me to a Rays game?\" she asked.\n\nMellony laughed at the obvious trepidation in her wife's voice. \"You hate sports. Why would I take you to a baseball game for our anniversary?\"\n\n\"I don't know. What else is there for us to do down here?\"\n\nMellony didn't answer, as she'd spied their destination a half block away. She turned into the small parking lot.\n\n\"Really?\" Alyx said. \"This place? Why don't we go to Jack and Jill's? That's a much nicer adult store. This place looks like a dump.\"\n\nMellony got out, then walked around to open the door for Alyx who had made no move to get out.\n\n\"Just trust me,\" Mellony said, holder her hand out to help Alyx out of the car.\n\nThe corner of Alyx's mouth twitched into a frown as she stepped out and took in the big, squat, grey building with the pink neon sign proclaiming Adult Super-Store! The establishment had clearly been a Walgreen's once upon a time, the only windows high along the wall, providing light into the interior during the day, but no easy way for someone to break in from street level. Fluorescent lighting spilled through the frosted glass of the front door.\n\n\"Trust me,\" Mellony said again, as she hiked the strap of her canvas purse up on her shoulder, then took her wife's hand and pulled her towards the entrance.\n\nAlyx blinked in surprise once they were inside. The store was much nicer than the outside suggested. The shelves were neat and clean, divided into different areas of interest. There were toys, DVDs, even a smoke and vape section. There were a few single men wandering around, and a man and woman couple browsing the bondage gear. Mellony headed towards the toy section, but Alyx stopped her as they passed through the aisle one over from the couple.\n\n\"You're right. This place is nicer than it looks,\" Alyx said as she picked up a leather bondage set, consisting of a pair of purple leather wrist cuffs with chrome D-rings attached to them, and a thick, matching purple leather collar. \"These look a lot more comfortable than our handcuffs.\"\n\n\"I'll buy us anything you want tonight, but if you want those, you're going to make me extra happy.\"\n\nAlyx giggled, then turned them over, looking at the back of the cardboard they were attached to and groaned theatrically.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Mellony said.\n\n\"They use paper price tags, the kind from a pricing gun. How can they possibly keep accurate track of their inventory without barcodes?\"\n\n\"Nerd,\" Mellony snorted, then pulled Alyx towards the wall of sex toys. \"I was thinking you needed one of these.\" She picked up a box from a shelf.\n\n\"Lovense... Lush? What is that?\" Alyx took it from her, puzzling over the picture of the pink tadpole shaped toy on the cover of the box.\n\n\"You put it inside you and you can wear it under your clothes. The tail hangs out.\"\n\n\"Why? So you can pull it out again?\"\n\n\"No. Well, yes, but also because the tail is an antenna. For the remote control.\"\n\n\"Remote control?\" Alyx turned over the box and started reading the back.\n\n\"Yeah. You wear that inside you, maybe to the shop, for example. It has a Bluetooth app for a smart phone, so I could turn it on and off and control the intensity whenever I wanted. Like, when you were at the register, ringing someone up, for example. Or maybe when we're skateboarding on the promenade.\n\n\"Um...\" Alyx was slowly turning red. \"That sounds... naughty.\"\n\nMellony leaned over, nuzzling Alyx's ear with her nose, whispering in her ear. \"Doesn't it, though? I'd like to watch your face as I turn it on and off, while you're talking to some sunburnt Midwestern couple asking about surfboards or board shorts. Watch you try not to react while I turn the intensity up and down.\"\n\n\"I want it!\" Alyx said quickly.\n\nMellony laughed and kissed her. \"Glad I could talk you into it.\"\n\n\"Okay, the cuffs and this thing are for me. What are we getting you?\" Alyx asked.\n\n\"Those things are for me. It's just that you'll be the one wearing them. Your present is something else. C'mon, let's go check out.\" They made their way to the counter where a thin, twenty-something man with a brown mop of curly hair waited to ring them up.\n\n\"Hey Mell, find everything okay?\" the man asked.\n\n\"You know him?\" Alyx asked Mellony, as if the man wasn't standing five feet away from her. One of her social issues was hyper-focus on her wife to the exclusion of others.\n\n\"Alyx, this is Mark. I know him from the surf crowd down at Redington Rocks. Mark, this is my wife Alyx.\"\n\n\"It's nice to meet you, Alyx,\" Mark said as he took Mellony's credit card to swipe it through the register.\n\n\"You too.\" Alyx said, a confused look on her face.\n\nMark handed Mellony her card back and a plastic bag with their purchases.\n\n\"Is it open?\" Mellony asked.\n\n\"Yeah, I saved number four for you, like you asked.\" He handed her a big plastic card with a large, red \"4\" on it, a small brass key dangling from it, much like the bathroom key you'd get from the attendant at an old time-y gas station.\n\n\"Thanks! Okay to take this stuff back there?\" Mellony asked, holding up the bag.\n\n\"Sure, you paid for it, no worries. Have fun.\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" Alyx whispered as Mellony pulled her towards the far side of the store. \"What's in 'the back'?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\"\n\nThere was a short hallway branching off the main room, with dim, red lighting. Four doors lined the right side of the hall, numbered one through four. Mellony went to the end of the hall, unlocked number four, then pulled Alyx inside.\n\nAlyx looked around at the small six-by-eight-foot room as Mellony latched the door behind them. There were two chairs, and the only light came from a video touch screen built into the wall opposite the door.\n\n\"What is this?\" Alyx asked.\n\n\"It's an adult video theater. See, you can pick categories here,\" Mellony touched the video screen and a menu came up. \"Here, lesbian... hey, you can even pick video by actresses! What do you think, Tracy Lindsay or Alexa Tomas?\" she asked, naming two of Alyx's favorite lesbian porn stars.\n\n\"Tracy,\" Alyx answered reflexively. \"But why come here for this? We could just have watched porn on our laptop at home.\"\n\nMellony had moved behind her and started kissing her neck. \"We could have\" --kiss-- \"but then, watching porn isn't\" --kiss-- \"the main reason we're here.\" She started tugging on the hem of Alyx's t-shirt, lifting it up.\n\n\"You want me to get naked?\" Alyx asked unnecessarily. She'd already lifted her arms to let Mellony pull the tie-dyed t-shirt with their store logo over her head. Mellony laid it across the back of one of the chairs. Alyx's bra quickly followed, and Mellony kept kissing her neck, but now her hands had circled around from behind and started caressing Alyx's nipples.\n\n\"So... um, gosh... what is, oh... the main reason we're here?\"\n\nA muffled thump came through the wall, the sound of the door in the next room.\n\n\"That's the reason,\" Mellony said.\n\n\"Wh-what?\" Alyx stuttered as Mellony gave her nipples a pinch.\n\nMellony held her shoulders and turned her ninety degree from the screen where Tracy Lindsay was busy licking the pussy of an equally attractive European looking woman. She pointed to something Alyx hadn't noticed yet. \"That's why we're here.\"\n\nIn the wall there was a rectangular hole, three inches wide and eight inches tall, at about waist height. The edges were smooth and rounded. Alyx could see light through the hole and moving shadows indicating someone was on the other side.\n\n\"Mell!\" she hissed softly, crossing her arms over her breasts, \"What the hell?\"\n\n\"It's a gloryhole. You can't tell me you've never seen one on Pornhub.\"\n\n\"Of course, I have. You can't go on Pornhub and not see one. They always pop up, even when we're browsing the lesbian category. They're inescapable, like... like sand in your wetsuit after a big wipeout. But what are we doing?!\"\n\n\"This is your present. Let's see what we've got.\"\n\nMellony reached over and made a beckoning gesture with her hand at the hole, so whoever was on the other side could see it. They heard rustling coming from the other side, then the person stepped up to the wall and there was suddenly a penis sticking through the hole.\n\n\"Oh my god!\" Alyx exclaimed, then started giggling.\n\n\"Hey, I don't think he'll appreciate you laughing at him.\"\n\n\"What do you expect me to do?! There's a penis, right there!\"\n\n\"You said you wanted to see one without a man being involved. This is about as close as you're going to get to that. Here.\" She took Alyx's hand and guided it toward the penis. Alyx jerked her hand out of Mellony's.\n\n\"Wait! Really?! This is what you had planned? Letting me play with a guy's wang? Right here?\"\n\n\"Don't say that too loudly. Not sure a male ego can take having their penis laughed at and called a wang. See, he's only half hard. And starting to go down.\" Mellony reached out and softly grasped the man's penis. The man flinched at the unexpected contact, then pressed himself harder against the wall. Mellony slowly stroked it and it quickly began to grow visibly longer and harder. \"Here's the ground rules. This is a one-time thing, well, maybe not if we both have fun. But you can only do this when you're with me. So I can watch.\"\n\n\"You're serious!\"\n\n\"Totally serious, babe. You can touch all you want with your hands. If you want to do anything else, I have condoms in my purse. No unprotected hanky-panky.\" She took her hand off the now stiff appendage that was sticking horizontally from the wall. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nAlyx reached for it, then hesitated. \"I've never seen a real-life wang before, much less touched one.\"\n\n\"That's why we're here. And call it a cock when he can hear you. Guys like it when you call it that.\"\n\nAlyx took a breath, then stepped closer, examining the man's penis in the glow from the video screen. She reached out and grasped it like she was holding a broom stick.\n\n\"It feels... soft, and hard at the same time. Like... it's hard, but the skin is so soft.\" She tugged at it.\n\n\"Easy! Here,\" Mellony said, taking Alyx's hand in hers and guiding her. \"Slide your hand over the skin and gently let the friction pull the foreskin back and forth. That's this part right here.\"\n\n\"Is this a big cock? It's nothing like Big Red.\"\n\n\"I'd say it's average, maybe a little less.\" The cock was maybe as long as the width of their palms, but of a nice thickness. A soft sound of indignation came through the hole. Mellony smothered a laugh then said loudly, \"I just meant in length, dude, you're thick as hell!\" She grinned, then winked and exaggeratedly shook her head at Alyx who giggled.\n\n\"I want a closer look.\" Alyx said, squatting down next to the hole, examining it as she slowly ran her hands up and down the shaft. \"It's throbbing, like it has a pulse!\"\n\nMellony laughed. \"Well, it's blood that makes it hard, so yeah it has a pulse. You can stroke it like that, but the underside is where it's most sensitive.\"\n\nAlyx shifted her hand, running it under the shaft, letting the weight of the cock rest on her palm. A groan came from the next room.\n\n\"Sounds like he likes it.\" Mellony said.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" Alyx said as she slid her hand back and forth under the foreskin. \"It feels kinda neat, I--\" She was interrupted by a loud knocking on the wall. \"Why is he--\"\n\n\"It means he's gonna--\" was all Mellony got out before the cock jerked and ropes of white, sticky cum started shooting out, coating Alyx's hand, who squealed, leaning out of the way.\n\n\"Keep stroking him! Stroke him through it.\" Mellony coached her. Alyx gamely grabbed the dick and coaxed out one more jet then a couple dribbles of milky cum.\n\n\"Wow. That was cool,\" she said. When the man withdrew his dick back through the hole, she held out her hand, fingers spread like it was covered with motor oil. \"What do I do now?\"\n\n\"Hang on, I brought some baby wipes.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" They heard from the other side of the wall.\n\n\"You're welcome!\" Alyx called back. \"Your dick is the first one I've ever touched!\"\n\nMellony burst into laughter as she handed her wife a wet-wipe. \"Oh my god, you just made his night! He'll tell that story to his buddies for the rest of his life!\"\n\n\"I can't believe you really planned this.\" Alyx said, using the wipe to clean the goo off her hand. \"That was neat. We're definitely using Big Red again tonight.\" She stood up, reaching for her shirt.\n\n\"Oh, I doubt we're ready to go just yet,\" Mellony said, holding out a hand to stop her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nSounds came from the next room, a door opening, muffled voices, then the door closing.\n\nMellony leaned down and peered through hole. \"Hey fella, how ya doing?\" she called out.\n\n\"Another one?\" Alyx said.\n\n\"I'm betting we could stay here all night if you wanted to. You can play with as many cocks as there are guys who walk in the store. Word will spread fast. You tell me when you're done. Until then, have at it.\" She gestured at the hole where another cock had just emerged. This one was longer, almost the length of Alyx's hand, if a little skinnier than the first one.\n\n\"I can't believe we're doing this,\" Alyx said as she wrapped her fingers around it.\n\nMellony pulled her own shirt over her head, then slid one of the chairs around so she could sit next to Alyx, who was still kneeling on the floor. Mell tugged her denim shorts down her legs, tossing them on top of Alyx's discarded clothing, then slid her hand into the front of her hip hugger panties while she watched Alyx giving the man a hand job.\n\n\"Is this turning you on?\" Alyx asked.\n\n\"Yeah, this is hot. I love watching you discover new things,\" Mellony said as she spread her legs wider so Alyx would have an unobstructed view.\n\nAlyx's gaze fixed on the bulge of her wife's hands through the thin fabric as she rubbed herself, then returned her attention to the matter at hand.\n\n\"This is a nice wang. I think I like this long and thin one better than the short and thick one.\"\n\n\"Cock, not wang, baby.\"\n\n\"Right!\" Alyx said, looking slightly embarrassed. She continued stroking and raised her voice, \"You have a nice cock!\"\n\nA short, muffled moan answered her, then they heard the man say, \"Can I touch you?\" To illustrate the request, the man's fingers wiggled through the hole next to his penis.\n\nAlyx drew back a bit. \"Um, no thank you!\" She turned and whispered to Mellony, \"It's fun playing with this, but I don't want a man touching me.\"\n\n\"That's fine, baby. That's why we're locked in here, safe and sound. You set the boundaries.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" they heard the man say, disappointment obvious in his voice.\n\n\"Shoot, now I feel guilty,\" Alyx said.\n\n\"He'll get over it,\" Mellony said dryly.\n\n\"Maybe he'd be happy if I...\" Alyx leaned forward, her lips parting.\n\n\"Whoa, stop!\" Mellony's sharp tone halted Alyx in mid-motion.\n\n\"Too far?\"\n\n\"No, I said you can do whatever you want. But if you want to do that, condom please.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, sorry. Do you have a condom?\" She called through the hole.\n\n\"No?\" the man answered, sounding almost panicked. Clearly, he was worried he was about to miss out on something due to lack of planning.\n\nMellony laughed, reaching for her bag. \"I told you, I came prepared.\" She dug around and pulled out several different foil packets. \"Let's see... here, this one's unlubricated. You don't want that stuff in your mouth.\"\n\nAlyx took the condom from her and looked at it, her other hand still slowly stroking the man's dick. \"Um...\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nAlyx looked embarrassed. \"I don't know how to...\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry. Of course, you don't.\" Mellony said. She took the foil envelope back as she knelt down next to her. She ripped it open and took out the condom. \"Okay, see this little reservoir here? That's where the cum goes when he ejaculates, so you want to make sure there's no air in it. Pinch the tip like this,\" she demonstrated, \"then you just roll it on.\" She helped Alyx roll it down the shaft.\n\nAlyx sat back and looked at it. \"It doesn't look as nice with that on it,\" she whispered.\n\n\"I know, but safety first,\" Mellony said.\n\n\"Did you ever suck one without a condom?\"\n\n\"Sure, but only with someone I was in a relationship with, and we'd gotten tested first. I did it for Craig sometimes when I was on my period.\"\n\nAlyx stroked it a few more times and the man thrust himself more firmly against the wall. \"I think he's getting impatient,\" she said, then leaned forward and took the tip into her mouth. She bobbed her head once or twice, maybe an inch deep, then pulled back. \"How far down am I supposed to go?\"\n\n\"There's no rules. Everyone does their own thing. I was never a deep throater. But I could go a lot deeper than that,\" she said with a grin.\n\nAlyx glanced over at Mellony with the McKayla Maroney expression she used when her pride was challenged, turned back, muttering, \"This latex doesn't taste very good,\" and then wrapped her mouth around the cock again. This time she slowly pushed forward a little more each stroke, her saliva coating the condom until it glistened. She hooked the fingers of one hand in the bottom of the hole to keep her balance. She managed to swallow more than half of the seven inches before she gagged, and pulled off coughing.\n\n\"Easy baby, you don't want to throw up.\"\n\nAlyx coughed a few more times, then tried again, but didn't force herself to go deeper. \"How am I doing?\" she asked Mellony when she paused for a few deep breaths.\n\n\"Pretty good. It looks like it's harder than it was when he stuck it in here.\" Mellony reached out and gave the cock a few strokes with her hand. \"Oh yeah, nice and hard.\" The man on the other side of the wall was making appreciative noises.",
        "\"How long do they usually take to cum?\" Alyx asked.\n\n\"Depends on the guy. A steady rhythm is usually what does it, in my experience anyway. Also, lots of tongue, right here.\" She ran the tip of her index finger back and forth across the foreskin on the underside and the cock bobbed and jerked. Mellony laughed. \"See? That's the most sensitive part.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" Alyx said. She leaned forward again, and Mellony watched her flatten her tongue and press it hard against the underside of the shaft as she bobbed her head.\n\n\"Yeah, like that,\" Mellony whispered after a minute. \"That'll probably--\" she was interrupted as the man tapped his knuckles hard on the wall, surprising Alyx who pulled off the cock as it started to jerk.\n\n\"Keep it in your mouth!\" Mellony said quickly.\n\n\"Oh!\" Alyx exclaimed. She took it back in her mouth and the man groaned loudly.\n\n\"They like it better if you keep it in your mouth while they're coming,\" Mellony said.\n\n\"Mmph!\" Alyx's eyes grew wide, surprise on her face as she bobbed her head.\n\n\"If he's coming, just hold still. It can get really sensitive.\"\n\nAlyx stopped, and held her head still, blinking hard, a third of the cock in her mouth. Finally, she pulled off. The end of the condom was full of milky liquid. \"Wow, that felt warm. I don't think I'd like that very much without a condom. Look how much there is! Did you swallow it when you did that for Craig?\"\n\n\"Not a fan of the taste. I usually just let it dribble out of my mouth onto his stomach. He seemed to like the view enough not to complain.\"\n\nAlyx watched as the man withdrew his dick back through the hole, giving her a muffled \"Thank you!\"\n\n\"You're welcome! That was my first blowjob!\"\n\nMellony smothered a laugh with her hand.\n\n\"You were good for your first time!\" the man called.\n\n\"That was a lot less messy than it would have been without that condom on. Why don't guys just wear them every time?\" Alyx said.\n\n\"Guys always say it doesn't feel as good. Also, some people like the mess. My freshman roommate in college was a cum freak. She liked it in her mouth, on her face, her back, her hair. Wherever the guy wanted to cum.\" She shuddered. \"Never understood that myself, but different strokes for different folks I guess.\"\n\nAlyx giggled. \"Different strokes! Ha!\"\n\nMellony grinned. \"So, having fun?\"\n\n\"Yeah, this is exactly what I was talking about! Wang without the guy! I can tell I wouldn't be into it if they were in the room with me. Did you see how hairy that last guy's stomach was? Yuck!\" Alyx gave a shudder of her own.\n\n\"Have you had enough?\" Mellony said as they heard someone else come into that room next door. \"Or do you want a little more...\" she gestured to the hole.\n\n\"Let's see what it looks like first.\" Alyx said. \"Is this the signal?\" She put her hand at the hole and crooked her finger in the come here gesture. They saw the man step up to the hole. This cock was about halfway between the first two. Six inches or so, and thick. Alyx took it in both hands and ran her fingers gently along the length. A groan came through the wall, followed by muffled voices talking.\n\n\"What the... Are there two of you?\" Alyx asked. She leaned forward and saw a woman's slim hand stroking the man's balls. She turned her head and grinned at Mellony. \"There's a woman with him!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Must be that couple we saw out there looking at the bondage stuff.\"\n\n\"This is so crazy!\" Alyx said to Mellony, then she called through the hole, \"Do you want me to suck your guy's dick? He'll need a condom!\"\n\n\"You can just jerk him off,\" came the woman's voice. Alyx obliged. After a few minutes, he pulled his dick back into the other room.\n\nAlyx leaned forward to peer through the opening. \"I guess I wasn't--oh my god!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"She's sucking his dick! Look!\"\n\nMellony leaned forward to get a better view. Sure enough, they could see the lower half of the woman's face as she sucked on her partner's cock. She bobbed her head a few times, then slowly pushed forward and took the entire length down her throat, her nose pressing against the man's stomach.\n\n\"Wow! That's amazing! I don't think I could do that!\" Alyx said. The woman took his cock out of her mouth then wrapped her fingers in a circle around the base of it and used her hand to guide him back through the hole, the shaft coated with her spit.\n\nAlyx slid her hand over the end. \"Oh wow, that's hot. It's so slick now!\" She stroked it for a minute then the man pulled back for the woman to suck it a few strokes, then back through the hole for Alyx to play with it. They went back and forth like that, the cock seeming to get harder each time\n\n\"This is the naughtiest thing I've ever done!\" Alyx whispered to Mellony.\n\n\"I'm glad you're enjoying it.\" Mellony said. She got off her chair and knelt behind Alyx.\n\nAlyx felt her denim mini-skirt being pulled up above her hips, then Mellony's fingers started working her lacy thong to the side. Alyx groaned as her wife slide a finger smoothly into her pussy.\n\n\"God, baby, you are so wet.\" Mellony said, as she fingered her.\n\nAlyx didn't respond, not with anything that could be called language. But her moans clearly told everyone on both sides of the wall she was enjoying herself. Suddenly the man knocked on the wall.\n\n\"Come in my mouth!\" They heard the woman say. He pulled out through the hole and the woman leaned close, her face near the opening so they could clearly see her taking his cock in her mouth, as the shaft jerked and pulsed. As his spasms slowed, her cheeks puffed out, then she slowly pulled back, carefully not spilling any.\n\n\"Wan somf?\" the woman said, opening her mouth close to the hole. Her mouth was almost completely full of white goo.\n\n\"Um, no thank you!\" Alyx said.\n\nThe woman closed her lips and ostentatiously swallowed, and then her face was gone from the hole. Alyx turned to Mellony and whispered, \"Actually, I'd almost try a taste like that, but it'd be breaking the rules, right?\"\n\n\"That's right. We're being safe.\"\n\n\"Okay. I don't want to break the rules.\"\n\n\"Good, 'Cause if you did, I'd punish you.\"\n\n\"Would I get a spanking?\" Alyx asked brightly.\n\n\"No, I would not spank you. For two months.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Alyx said, a little crestfallen. \"You mean not-fun punishment.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Can I touch you?\" The woman asked.\n\n\"Oh! I, uh, I don't know.\" She looked at Mellony. \"What do you think? I don't really want to let a guy touch me, but she looks kinda cute. What I could see of her anyway. But... is that cheating on you?\"\n\n\"I think this is a special occasion. As long as we're doing this together, it's okay. No fooling around with anyone else unless it's something like this where we're both involved and agree ahead of time. Clear?\"\n\n\"I don't ever want someone else, Mell. I'm just... God, we're being so naughty... and I love that you're here watching me.\"\n\n\"It's okay then. Here, let me.\" Mellony pulled Alyx to her feet, then reached out and popped the button on the waist of Alyx's mini skirt. She pulled it down her legs, hooking Alyx's thong with her thumbs she did. Alyx blushed as she stepped out of the puddle of fabric and stood naked, except for her ever-present beach sandals.\n\nThe woman's left arm reached through the hole and Alyx stepped closer to the wall. The arm was slim, with a diamond tennis bracelet and an expensive looking wedding ring, incongruous details as her hand ran over Alyx's small breasts, then down her stomach. Mellony shifted to get a better view as the woman ran her fingers through Alyx's lips. Alyx gasped and reached down to grip Mellony's shoulder to steady herself. Mellony gripped her ankle and lifted her foot to rest on Mellony's lap, opening Alyx up to the woman's touches.\n\n\"You are soooo wet,\" the woman said. Alyx gasped louder as the woman slid two fingers inside her. \"Oh, your pussy feels so good!\"\n\n\"Yes, it surely does!\" Alyx said, her voice an octave higher than normal. Mellony giggled.\n\nAlyx's hips started rocking. She leaned forward, her forehead against the wall, causing the woman to have to stretch her arm further through the hole to maintain her contact with Alyx.\n\n\"God this is so hot, baby! Watching her finger you with her wedding ring on!\" Mellony whispered.\n\n\"It's naughty and hot, and oh God, I'm gonna come!\" Alyx cried out, then proceeded to do just that. Mellony wrapped her arm around Alyx's thigh to help her stay upright. The woman stroked her through her orgasm, then her arm withdrew back through the hole while Alyx got her breathing under control.\n\n\"Okay, I'm confused now,\" she said.\n\n\"What's confusing you?\" Mellony asked her.\n\n\"Who has to thank who. Thanks lady!\" she called through the hole, \"and mister you need to thank both of us, but especially thank your wife because she swallowed for you!\"\n\nMuffled laughter came through the hole, along with the sounds of clothing being adjusted then they heard the door in the other room open as the couple left.\n\n\"That was wild!\" Alyx said. \"Should I get dressed?\"\n\nMellony's Apple Watch vibrated. She checked it, flicking through a couple of texts with her fingertips. \"I want to kiss you for a minute first.\" Mellony stood, wrapping her wife in a hug. Their breasts pressed together as they kissed, tongues dancing.\n\n\"I almost want to have sex with you right here, but I think the floor's probably a little gross,\" Alyx said when they came up for air. \"We need to get home soon.\"\n\n\"Just another minute.\"\n\n\"What are we-- oh!\" Alyx said as she heard someone in the next room. \"You're right, they keep coming. So to speak.\"\n\nMellony snorted with laughter. \"This will be our last one for the night.\"\n\n\"You're the boss.\" Alyx knelt down and put her fingers on the bottom edge of the hole. \"Hello? Are you--oh my God!\" She jerked away from hole as the newcomer's cock eased its way into their room. \"Mell! That's as big as Big Red! Bigger!\"\n\nThis dick was like none of the others. It was long, almost as big around as Alyx's wrist, and heavy looking.\n\n\"Jesus!\" Alyx exclaimed as she took it in her hand. \"My fingers barely go around it!\"\n\n\"Enjoy it then.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure how I'll enjoy this. Sorry mister, but there's no way you're getting a blowjob, you're way too big!\" They could hear the man chuckle through the wall.\n\n\"I have something else in mind for this one,\" Mellony said.\n\n\"Oh, I've been so thoughtless, you've let me play with all of them. Do you want to have some fun too?\"\n\n\"Not what I meant,\" Mellony said, digging into the plastic store bag with their purchases. She pulled out the purple leather wrist restraints and tore them off the cardboard display holder. \"Turn around.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me. Turn. Around.\"\n\n\"Um, okay.\" Alyx nervously faced away from Mellony, who buckled the thick leather bands around Alyx's wrists one at a time then pulled her arms back and snapped the clip to fasten the D-rings on each of the cuffs together.\n\n\"How am I supposed to play with that giant wang with my hands behind my back? There is no way that thing is fitting in my mouth.\"\n\n\"You never know until you try,\" Mellony said as she dug in her purse. She pulled out another condom then knelt in front of the hole. She licked her hand, then coated the cock with her spit. Tearing open the foil packet, she rolled the condom over the end of the bulbous head and down the shaft. The man on the other side grunted as she did. Mellony stood and took Alyx by the arm, pulling her closer to the wall.\n\n\"Wait, Mell, that one's lubed. You told me I didn't want that stuff in my mouth.\"\n\n\"That's not what we're doing.\" She spun Alyx around so her back was to the wall.\n\n\"What are you--oh!\"\n\nMellony pushed Alyx back against the hole so that the thick length of the man's cock slid in-between her legs. It was long enough that the tip poked out from between her legs with an inch or two to spare. Mellony knelt in front of her, and placed her hand on the underside of the cock, lifting it so that it pressed against Alyx's pussy. Then she gripped Alyx's hip with her free hand and pulled her slowly back and forth.\n\n\"Fuck, baby, that looks so hot,\" Mellony said as she watched the man's thickness slide back and forth, parting her lips.\n\n\"It feels good!\" Alyx said.\n\n\"Just what you wanted, right? Wang with no man? Just you and me here, while you feel this cock?\"\n\n\"Yes! Just like this!\" Alyx humped herself onto the cock, her hips rocking as her breath quickened. \"I guess I'm not a Gold Star lesbian anymore!\"\n\nMellony smiled and looked up at her wife. \"Oh, you still are. Unless you're ready not to be.\"\n\nAlyx stopped moving, looking down at the only person she'd ever known who always knew exactly what she meant all the time. The only person she'd ever trusted to truly be herself with. \"Okay.\"\n\nMellony pulled her forward a little further as she pressed under the cock with her fingertips, moving it up into the right angle. She felt a small bump, as the head pushed against Alyx's entrance.\n\nMellony looked up with a grin. \"Say it.\"\n\nAlyx actually stomped her foot. \"Really? No!\"\n\n\"Say it baby.\" Mellony pressed up, pushing the head harder against her.\n\nAlyx growled in frustration. \"No!\" Then she gave a small moan as the man pressed himself against her. She tried to push back against the wall, but Mellony held her, preventing her from sinking back onto the cock.\n\n\"Say it or I stop.\"\n\nAlyx huffed out a loud breath, then said \"Fine! Fuck me, Mell! Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!\"\n\nMellony put her hands on Alyx's hips, her thumbs pressed into the sensitive hollow where her wife's thighs met her body and slowly, insistently, pushed her back towards the wall.\n\n\"O-o-o-o-o-O-O-O-O-O-O!\" Alyx's voice raised quickly in pitch and volume.\n\nIf their positions were reversed, Alyx might have described it as if Mellony's eyes and mouth had formed three perfect circles, making up the corners of an isosceles triangle. Since Mellony was the one watching Alyx, however, she simply took delight in the expression on her wife's face as she accepted the largest object to ever penetrate her.\n\n\"O-o-o-o-h my God!\" Alyx cried out.\n\nMellony kept pushing, slowly, but inexorably until Alyx's butt flattened against the wall. The man on the other side groaned loudly.\n\n\"Oh my God! Oh my God, Mell! Oh my God!\"\n\n\"Are you ready?\" Mellony asked.\n\n\"Ready for what? It's already all the way in!\"\n\nMellony didn't answer. She just took a firmer hold on Alyx's hips, then pulled her a forward few inches before thrusting her back hard against the wall.\n\n\"Oh, my fuck!\" Alyx cried out, as Mellony fucked her against the man's cock. \"God! Damn! Fuck! Shit! Fuck!\" Her body shuddered and writhed, her arms straining against the leather cuffs, fingernails scrabbling for purchase on the wall behind her, to try to somehow control the pace. Mellony had no interest in letting Alyx control anything, however, as she continued to thrust her wife's butt back against the hole. Alyx's orgasm raced through her, her body shuddering, and she leaned forward, half-collapsing onto Mellony's shoulder. Mellony took advantage, leaning her shoulder into the crook of Alyx's hips, pinning her tightly against the wall.\n\n\"Okay, dude, your turn! Give it to her!\" she called through the wall. She held Alyx's ass firmly against the hole as the wall started thudding in time to the impact of his hips as he thrust hard into Alyx.\n\n\"Oh my god, more? Baby?! Mell?! Oh, God! I love you Mell! Mell, I love you! Oh my God, I'm--A-a-a-a-a-a-h!\" Alyx lost the capacity to form words after that, only unintelligible, animal noises emerging from her mouth for the next several minutes. Finally, the man on the other side of the wall thrust hard into her, a loud groan announcing his own orgasm. Alyx shuddered and moaned as he finished inside her. After Mellony heard him pull out with an obscene, sucking sound, she gently helped Alyx sink to her knees. She tenderly unclipped the wrist restraints, although she left them on her wrists.\n\n\"That was really, really good,\" Alyx said, panting.\n\n\"I love it when you say 'I love you' when you come.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Should I be worried about you going full hetero now and leaving me for a surfer dude?\" Mellony said with a grin.\n\n\"Oh, heck no, but I definitely want to use Big Red on you when we get home.\"\n\nMellony snickered. \"Like you'll be able to stay awake long enough after that orgasm.\"\n\n\"Then I'll wake you up with him tomorrow.\"\n\n\"That works. C'mon, let's get dressed.\"\n\nAlyx's knees were shaky, so Mellony quickly pulled on her shorts and t-shirt, then helped Alyx get dressed. \"You're keeping those on until we get home,\" she said, indicating the wrist cuffs, \"and wearing this too.\" Mellony retrieved the matching collar from the bag on the floor and turned Alyx around.\n\n\"Everyone out there will see me wearing them!\" Alyx protested, blushing.\n\nHer blush deepened when Mellony replied, \"Baby, if there's anyone out in the store, there's zero chance they didn't hear you wailing like a banshee. What's a little bondage gear compared to that?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" It was clear to Mellony both from Alyx's tone, and the eagerness with which she held her hair out of the way for Mellony to fasten the collar around her neck, that she very much desired the embarrassment that came with wearing the leather out into public just as much as she wanted to pretend that she was reluctant to wear them.\n\nThey walked out of the hallway and into the main store to find it empty. As they started towards the front, Alyx heard a door open behind them. She turned and saw Mark, the curly haired surfer dude who had rung them up for their sex toys coming out of room three, buckling the belt on his jeans.\n\n\"I'll have to unlock the front door for you,\" he said. His grin threatened to split his face in half. \"Hope you ladies had a good evening. That collar looks great on you, by the way.\"\n\nAlyx's face deepened to a shade of red usually reserved for stop lights and fire engines. \"Y-y-yes, thank you,\" she stammered.\n\nMark unlocked the front door and held it open for them, like a gentleman.\n\n\"Thanks Mark! See ya out in the surf sometime,\" Mellony called over her shoulder as they headed to their car. \"I always suspected he had a big dick. His wetsuit is pretty snug,\" she told Alyx as she opened the passenger door for her. \"I'll drive, I think your knees are too shaky.\"\n\nAs Mellony pulled out of the parking lot and headed north, she glanced over at Alyx who was sitting quietly, seemingly lost in thought.\n\n\"You okay? Any regrets?\"\n\n\"No! It was fun. I wasn't ever going to say I was a 'Gold Star lesbian' again anyway, but now I couldn't even pretend to be one and keep a straight face.\"\n\nMellony chuckled.\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"I can't believe you got me a wang for our anniversary. That was a highly inappropriate anniversary gift. You're a naughty wife.\"\n\n\"Oh no, that's where you're wrong. That was completely appropriate!\" Mellony said with a smirk.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The traditional fifth anniversary gift is wood!\" Mellony said triumphantly.\n\nMellony was about the only person on earth with whom Alyx reliably could tell when she was being given a punchline, even when... Alyx stared at the road for a moment, her brows furrowing, then turned back to her wife.\n\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\nThey were halfway home before Mellony could stop laughing at her own joke long enough to explain it.\n\nTHE END\n\nThank you for reading my first installment of Booty Shorts. There might be more someday. There might not. You never know, I'm mysterious and capricious. Leave me a comment and let me know what you thought of it. Votes are lovely, but comments are what inspire more writing.",
        "As I mentioned up top, this story was inspired by a conversation with AwkwardMD. The conversation started when I casually used the term \"Gold Star Lesbian\" to denote a lesbian who has never been with a man. I have always found that term amusing, and have seen it used in many stories. However, I was not aware that some women (bi and trans) find it to be exclusionary and are made uncomfortable by it. Thanks to Awkward, for setting me straight (so to speak.) One of the (several) reasons this story stuck in my head to the point where I felt it needed to be written, was to express in a public way that I am now aware of the baggage that term can carry for others, that I regret using it, and that I will no longer be using it myself. Yes, I have enjoyed the term. However, once I was made aware others found it to be exclusionary, then the only thing that seemed right to me was to own up to using a term that others find offensive. Even though I liked it, the simple fact that dropping a three-word phrase from my vocabulary might make others feel safer or included, well... That's the easiest, most no-effort thing I can do for others, so Imma do it, and encourage others to do the same.\n\nThanks for reading!"
