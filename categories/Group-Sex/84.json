        "This story is part of a continuation of my Road Trip series (see the end of 'Road Trip -- California' for a list of the chapters of that series, in the order to be read). You need not read that series to enjoy this series. Although real places and celebrity names are used for realism, this story is fiction. Please 'read, enjoy, vote, and comment.'\n\nSynopsis of This Story Up to This Point: After a motorcycle road trip laced with grief, love, incest, and sex (read the Road Trip series), Jim, girlfriend country singer Crystal Lee and her sister Ellen, a love interest named Claire, and a nymphomaniac housekeeper Nadia live together. Jim finished his first movie, enjoyed several orgies with his leading lady and rescued her when she got kidnapped in Nicaragua to great media acclaim. Later, the press discovered that Jim fathered a child in Ohio during the road trip, but Crystal and Jim managed the news, revealed the truth, and the story faded away quickly. In the course of the baby story, the pair met Edie, the sexy reporter who deduced Jim's parenthood, and they bring her back to Nashville for further loving romps before they leave on a concert tour. Billy, their bandleader, and Dan, their publicist, joined the group more often. Claire finally revealed her mysterious past, admitting to doing porn films and being a high-end escort even sharing some details. Crystal and Jim get Grammys for their great music. During a concert in London, Jim receives a blackmail note. He hires a private detective to help search for the culprit, and hence meets Margo. The musical and movie entourage moves to Paris for the next concert and movie premieres. Ultimately, Jim and Margo fly back to London, joining the Mile High Club en route, confront some suspects and resolve the blackmail threat to Jim.\n\n<center>Crystal Clear Ch 16\n\nPlayful friends. More concerts. A request from the CIA</center>\n\nBy the time Margo and I finished dinner, we'd made each other horny with a series of stories: Margo sharing some of the cases her private investigation agency had conducted, many about various infidelities she'd investigated and how they turned out; and me sharing some stories from my road trip across America. I think we both had the expectation of making love in her apartment that evening. \n\nMargo kept checking her watch even though we ate dinner on the early side. We left the restaurant, retrieved her car, and motored north on the M1 to Watford. Margo had a townhouse -- an end unit in a cluster with three other units in a larger neighborhood of carbon copy units.\n\nAs we walked to her unit from the parking lot I noticed lights on inside but didn't think anything of it. Margo stopped at the front door, and we shared a long French kiss on her doorstep. As we kissed our hips ground together. She put my hand under her blouse even pulling aside the bra she wore so I could reach her taut breasts. When we were both panting and I had a significant hard-on, Margo said, \"Come, let's get inside. There's more to come. It'll get better, a lot better.\"\n\nI didn't understand her comment; at least, until she opened the door, and we stepped into her living room.\n\nTo my surprise, Caroline Reynolds Huff, the pretty twenty-one year old that had briefly been a suspect in my blackmail, sat pretty as a picture in the middle of Margo's sofa with a couple of books around her. What made her presence most notable involved her lack of clothing. She gave me a coy look; \"Hi, Jim Mellon. I hope you don't mind my being here. Margo thought the two of us could entertain you better than one, and after all we've already had ... an encounter back in Oklahoma a couple of years ago. I'd love another, if you can handle two of us at once.\"\n\nI turned to Margo, whose lecherous smile betrayed her interest in not just me, but also Caroline. Caroline unraveled her long and shapely legs, allowing me a quick glance at her womanhood. She rose and came over to me. My arms automatically went around the attractive young girl as she raised her face to mine for a serious kiss. One of my hands slid down her back to a tight little ass, and the other reached between us to fondle a pert breast. As I squeezed and kneaded the breast I moved my fingers to gently pinch her nipple until it could cut glass because it was so hard. By then, we were on our tenth or so long kiss; I wasn't counting.\n\nNot unexpectedly, another pair of hands joined me as they wrapped around Caroline from her back. Margo's naked body pushed against Caroline's nude form pushing her more tightly into me. She spoke in a low voice, \"Somebody has entirely too many clothes on. Caroline, I think we should do something about that.\"\n\nThe two of them took over undressing me; one worked from my waist down, and the other from my waist up. I quickly became a willing participant. As my briefs got yanked down my legs, my erection swung into view.\n\nCaroline grabbed my shaft and brought her mouth to my crown, lapping and mouthing the mushroom head. Her other hand joined in, counter twisting with the other around my shaft as she tried to suck my insides out. Caroline added some saliva to the mix to smooth things out.\n\nMargo watched her briefly, and then said to Caroline, \"Here, let me show you how to give a really exciting blow job. Do this and any man will worship you the rest of your life.\" Margo knelt next to Caroline on the thick carpeting, and quickly inhaled my cock. She started her twisting, turning, kneading, humming, and swallowing activities that had so turned me on the previous evening. She taught Caroline how to duplicate her moves, insisted that she practice on me until she got it right. \n\nAs Caroline's wonderful blow job continued, Margo stood and turned my upper half to her so she could drag her breasts across my chest and make out with me. Her hands were busy too: one caressing my chest and rubbing my nipples as the other running through my hair.\n\nI allowed one of my hands to caress Caroline's hair, stroking her long brunette locks and running a finger around and in one ear in a sexy gesture. The other hand went to Margo's slit; I used one finger to slowly run through her wetness -- a near-liquid sign of her arousal long before we got to her home. She'd probably been thinking about this threesome since she set it up with Caroline. I'd have to find out later how she did that.\n\nMargo moaned, \"Oh, fuck.\" After a minute of my finger's focus on the clitoris, she said, \"Please, let's take this to my bedroom.\"\n\nCaroline allowed me to pull her to her feet and kiss her. She looked surprised at the affection. \"You don't have to kiss me if you don't want to.\"\n\n\"I want to. You're beautiful, arousing, sexy, I like you more with each minute I know you, and you give great blow jobs, why wouldn't I want to kiss you?\"\n\n\"Because I'm so young? Because you're a star, and I'm a nobody? Because I was just a hole to fill when we met in Oklahoma?\"\n\nI pulled her to me and hugged her naked body to mine. I kissed her again. \"Honey, Oklahoma was about lust. Some people have fun with sex, and I'm one of them, and based on what went on that night I bet you are too.\" Caroline nodded. I continued, \"You don't have to think that all sex is predicated on that model.\"\n\nCaroline said with surprise in her voice, \"You mean you really like me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you're a hottie, and I don't think you're too young or I wouldn't be here with you now -- in this way. And as for you being a nobody, let me assure you that you are a 'somebody' of great importance. My recent fame doesn't change the fact that up until I met Crystal Lee in Tennessee two years ago I might have also called myself a 'nobody.' Just know inside yourself, that you have talents, capabilities, and motivations that can take you far beyond being a 'nobody.' Got it?\"\n\nCaroline studied my face to test my sincerity. I must have passed her test, because I got a smile that lit up the room and a real hard kiss as she pressed my cock between her belly and my groin. She said, \"Thank you. I am so going to enjoy tonight. I've dreamed of this almost every night since that debutantes ball, and I can't tell you how often I've masturbated to a vision of us doing this. I'm probably crazy, but I do care for you ... a lot.\"\n\nWe followed Margo's naked body up a short flight of stairs to a modern master bedroom with large double doors that opened to look down on the living room. Climbing behind Caroline reminded me of Nadia back in Nashville; both had extremely sweet rear ends that made me harden more than I already had. Margo's taste in decorating appealed to me: a mix of the feminine and the masculine woven together in the room. \n\nMargo turned to the two of us, \"I'm not sure how to start this.\"\n\nCaroline said in a low voice, \"I haven't much experience with girls ... I mean I've done some stuff, but you're both so much older and more experienced.\"\n\nI held out my arms to Margo and Caroline, and they both came and let me hug the two of them together. I said to Caroline, \"First, you have to forget any cultural messages you've been taught about being with a woman; in this day and age, only the most unforgiving and unenlightened people would chastise you for enjoying someone of the same sex. Second, why don't you kiss Margo -- really kiss her, as if you mean it. Kiss her as though you've waited all day to do this with her, as though you want to seduce her.\"\n\nI backed away slightly, and the two women embraced each other, their breasts and groins mashing together as their lips first touched in a brief kiss, and then a deeper kiss, and then an open exchange of tongues initiated by Margo, and then their hands came into play.\n\nWhen the two parted, they looked into each other's eyes for acceptance and found it. Both smiled. Margo took Caroline's hand, and led her to the bed. She had Caroline recline and then started on her breasts; flawless breasts that only an early twenties woman could sustain. As Margo worked on one, I worked on the other. Caroline rapidly went into orbit.\n\nWhen Margo saw I had her breasts in hand, so to speak, she slithered down Caroline's body to the 'V' between her legs; Caroline spread wide at Margo's suggestive touch. I watched as Margo repeated some of the actions Crystal and she had shared only the night before: her hands massaged Caroline's thighs and rubbed up into her abdomen, an errant finger would glide down the outside of her slit on one side of her labia or the other, another finger might meander through the tuft of pubic hair carefully manicured on that landscape, another finger might touch her anus for a second or two threatening something even more intimate, and then Margo blew her hot breath directly on her pussy from only an inch away. I could see the glistening female moisture all around Caroline's pussy, now even more generous in proportion to what she'd been like in the living room. \n\nMargo's tongue carefully made contact with Caroline's cunt, first in a full-tongue swipe from anus to mons right up the valley of the slit, including maximum contact with Caroline's clit. Caroline jerked alert, her eyes practically bugging out of her head and a low moan of pleasure and excitement coming from deep inside her.\n\nMargo knew how to please another member of her sex. Tongue, lips, teeth, and mouth all were brought into play, and she licked, sucked, blew, bit, and savored Caroline's sweet juices. Between moves, Margo praised Caroline for tasting so delicious and for being willing to come and play with us.\n\nI watched as Margo added a finger, sliding it into Caroline's warm vagina. Moments later, a second finger got added -- and then a third -- and then a fourth -- and then her whole hand trying to twist and screw itself into Caroline's hole.\n\nCaroline did not idly lie back and passively allow the activities on her body. She jerked and writhed in response to each motion Margo made, sometimes pulling away from too much pleasure, and other times pushed herself down into Margo's face or hand to drive tongue or fingers deeper into her body.\n\nI alternated between watching Margo assault Caroline's cunt, and sucking on both of her breasts. Caroline finally caught my eye, \"Come up near my face -- your cock, I mean. I want to suck on you while Margo does me.\" Seconds later, Caroline inhaled my cock once again, this time allowing me to piston in and out of her mouth, and after she got used to it, even her throat. She used one hand to keep me positioned and to twist around my cock to heighten the pleasure for me.\n\nI continued to reach down and fondled Caroline's breasts, pinching and tweaking her nipples. I got instructional, \"Caroline, let yourself go. Allow yourself to have the orgasm that Margo wants to give you. Relax and enjoy the sensations, let them build, let them sweep over you.\"\n\nI pulled my cock away and lay down beside Caroline. I put part of my body along her upper torso, and started to kiss her, using my fingers and tongue to do her ears, lips, around her eyes, neck, and other erogenous zones. Caroline not only panted, she started to emit low squeaking sounds in sync with Margo's fist thrusts into her body.\n\nCaroline's eyes suddenly got large; \"OH, MY GOD, I'M ... I'M HAVING AN ORGASM!\" I could only imagine what a major earthquake would be like, because Caroline's body became a replica for that experience. Every inch of her body quivered; her skin rippled out of control as spasm after spasm of pleasure washed over her. She let out a long, low wail, \"Oooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhh!\"\n\nCaroline's back arched so dramatically as she pushed her pussy into Margo's hand that her buttocks and lower back were not touching the bed. At my end, Caroline ground her mouth into mine with tongue extended between her moans. We kissed and kissed hard.\n\nAnd then, she suddenly became a limp noodle with no starch, no backbone, no form. She allowed the bed to absorb her body and every limb. Margo backed away with a satisfied look on her face as she licked her fingers ripe with Caroline's juices.\n\nAfter a minute, as the afterglow waned, Caroline's eyes fluttered open, and she looked at Margo and me with such a look of love. \"Oh, that was so wonderful. I've only had a couple of other orgasms in my life. I didn't think I could have one with someone else, particularly a woman ... oh, and I didn't dream about you Jim, I had you here with Margo making love to me -- well, almost. Let me rest, but then I do want you to make love to me -- to fuck me.\"\n\nMargo came up so we surrounded the young girl. We both rained kisses down on her. She became our love object for those minutes.\n\nLater, I watched as Caroline returned the favor, successfully trying to give Margo an orgasm. She gave her half a dozen to both their amazement. \n\nMy turn came, but I was in no rush. I started with Margo, fucking her to an orgasm, and then I switched to Caroline. \n\nCaroline told me as I sank into her tight twat, \"I guess girls don't have clitoral orgasms from intercourse, huh?\"\n\nI just said, \"Let's see.\"\n\nFour-and-a-half minutes later, Caroline screamed out her second orgasm of the night. Margo and I kissed her through it. I had Margo sit on Caroline's face, so Caroline could be having sex with a man and a woman simultaneously; she loved it. Five minutes later, she had another cum, this time emitting girl juice into our union.\n\nMargo suggested that I cum in Caroline so she could experience my 'full treatment.' She nodded enthusiastically that she would like that. I pulled us around to several different positions until I maneuvered her into one where I guessed my cock might be rubbing against her G-spot on my in strokes. Caroline's reactions certainly suggested that was what was going on.\n\n\"Caroline, I'm going to cum inside your luscious body very soon. My cock is going to jet semen deep inside you, and you're going to love it. You will be all drippy with my fluid. You like being fucked by me don't you?\" She nodded rapidly. \"And you'd be willing to be one of my slut girlfriends wouldn't you -- what some of my friends call a 'Mellon Girl'?\" More nodding. \"And, you'd want all the cock I could give you anytime of the day or night after this wouldn't you?\" More nodding and now moaning occurred as she started her build up to her next climax. I continued to talk dirty to Caroline because I could tell she was getting off on it.\n\nBeside Caroline, Margo lay in my line of sight thrusting a large dildo in and out of her cunt. She locked eyes with me whenever she could. She entangled her legs around Caroline's so we were all touching in some intimate way.\n\nCaroline's vagina spasmed, and I could feel the Kegel muscles start to clench, trying to pull me deep inside her. Caroline looked at me with big doe eyes; a signal I'd already learned meant she was about to explode into a colossal orgasm. I warned her I was about to cum, and she went over the top. \n\n\"Ooooooooooh fuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkk!\" Caroline loudly moaned as her climax started and her body arched into mine. \n\nI banged my cock deep within her on those few last thrusts to try to scrape my glans over Caroline's G-spot before I filled her vagina with a gallon of cum. The pleasure washed through my body with a jolt; I think I made some pleasing noises of joy. By my last thrust into Caroline's boiling body, I had overfilled her hole, and as with Margo the night before the cum oozed out of her around my shaft in a couple of large dollops. \n\nI clutched Caroline to my body, and reached over and pulled Margo in as well. Margo had come by her own hand, aided by her pink dildo. The three of us made out with one another, savoring the afterglows.\n\nMargo needed more, and she slid down Caroline's body again and sucked my cum from her cunt in a noisy display of affection for the two of us. Initially, Caroline looked amazed at the lewd act. She'd occasionally pull away and describe in graphic detail what she was doing, how good Caroline tasted, and how much she liked us. At one point, she brought the mix of fluids up to Caroline and pantomimed that she wanted to kiss her -- to share the fluids with her. Caroline opened her mouth, and Margo dribbled the cum, girl juice, and her own saliva into the willing youthful mouth. The two girls then joined in an amazing French kiss, made extra-erotic by the seepage of fluids from between their mouths onto their faces and breasts. Before they were through, Margo pulled me into the kiss as well.\n\nMargo coached Caroline into a classic sixty-nine position with her, teaching her by example how to deliver even more pleasure to a woman. Caroline only had distant knowledge about G-spots before they started, but several orgasms by each of them later, she had become an expert. \n\nWhen I'd recovered, I took turns on either side of their sixty-nine demonstrating close-up views of fucking, and teaching about how to use a tongue and mouth during a fuck to create pleasure for both the 'fucker' and the 'fuckee.' Caroline proved an apt pupil, occasionally screaming or whimpering through her own orgasms. I thought the house might shake off its foundation on every one of them.\n\nAfter one set of afterglows passed, I had a serious discussion with Caroline about her self-image. \"Caroline, earlier today you said you felt you had to leave Oklahoma because you got a reputation as a slut; right?\"\n\nCaroline nodded.\n\nI went on, \"Well, I want you to rethink that moniker. What if the word 'slut' stood for 'sexuality-love-understanding-tolerance' -- would it be so bad?\"\n\n\"No, but it doesn't.\"\n\n\"Ah, but Emerson wrote, 'There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.' So if you think of yourself in a bad way because of something you did, you make it so and those around you will adopt your viewpoint. Did you tell others you felt that way?\"\n\n\"A few. Several of us from that party ended up thinking poorly of ourselves. Maddy was one of them too.\"",
        "\"So, in a way you propagated the term 'slut'and made the night out to be a bad experience. Tell me about that night in a positive way, a way you'd be proud to tell anyone about.\"\n\nCaroline thought for a moment, \"Well, it would have been a great party after our debutante's ball. It would have been fun and everyone would have had a good time and felt good about themselves. I had several orgasms that brought pleasure to me -- many even, and I felt thrilled and excited about all the sex, more so than any sexual experience in my life -- well, except for tonight with you two. Some of the boys I wanted a relationship with were there and we fucked, and what better way to start a relationship than a lovely fuck with them; one boy in specifically took a shine to me, and we dated after that event. He was very nice and didn't push me to have sex with him, although I wanted to make love and so we did. I don't think we would have gone out otherwise. So, I guess you want me to say, all in all it was a fabulous experience.\" She looked at me with questioning eyes.\n\nI said, \"So, you were sexual, loving, understanding, and developed a new level of tolerance for others and for yourself? Can you forgive yourself for feeling poorly about the event, and from now on remember the experience more as you just told me -- in a positive way?\"\n\n\"I guess I could. I'll have to work on it.\"\n\n\"When you can't erase the past, learn from it, and put a positive spin on it for yourself. Don't beat yourself up over it. The past is past; don't let it haunt you. You went to that party for a reason that seemed good at the time and you knew what would happen. Afterwards you decided you didn't like it. Perhaps the Universe presented some new learning experience to you in an unusual way. Roll with it. Change it around so that you relished the experience and you wished it had never ended.\"\n\nCaroline said, \"Part of me did feel that way. I glowed sexually afterwards. I was conflicted.\"\n\nCaroline turned onto her hands and knees so she could kiss me better. Her breasts swayed beneath her body, and I reached up and cupped one of them, teasing her nipple back to an excited state as we kissed. Marge reached across me to Caroline's sodden cunt, and ran two fingers inside the girl; Caroline moaned into our French kiss.\n\nI asked, \"Caroline, how will you end up feeling about tonight: wanton sex with me and Margo, our instructing you on blowjobs, and orgasm after orgasm.\"\n\nShe smiled, \"I'll never forget it. I love every second of this night. I don't want it to ever stop.\" Her remarks came fast and were sincere.\n\nMy endurance did not let me down that night, and the girls constantly rallied to our mutual lust. The first signs of sleep only struck our bodies about four o'clock in the morning. We all slept in the huge wet spot that seemed to pervade every square inch of Margo's large bed. The room smelled wonderful -- like hot sex. Whenever I opened my eyes in the dim light, I feasted on dozing, shapely, warm, and nude female bodies cuddled against me; each would come awake slightly and nuzzle into my neck and kiss me, and I'd kiss back. Often, we'd awaken enough to make love again.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nAfter my day resolving the blackmail case in way that caused no damage and made sure it wouldn't happen again, I spent the night with Margo and Caroline. I got a late start to the next day because Margo and Caroline easily talked me into another long and pleasurable sexual make-out session with them after breakfast. Caroline became more of a student than the night before, and so Margo and I instructed her in the fine art of giving and receiving sexual pleasure, trying to leave no stone unturned. \n\nI made doubly sure that Caroline felt good about herself, about the Oklahoma orgy after rethinking the matter, and our lovemaking session the previous night into the morning. She told me I had broken a curse she had put on herself. I sincerely hoped that was true, and that I would see her again. As she put it with a huge smile, \"I love being a slut, because I stand for sexuality, love, understanding, and tolerance.\"\n\nBy the time I left Margo's home it was after lunch, and I realized I had watched part of a sexual transformation of the young woman. In the twenty-four hours since I met her for the second time, she seemed to have blossomed into a more mature and savvy girl. She also told me I had set a high bar for all her future relationships, and that she'd never thought of satisfaction or love from someone twice her age. She said with a laugh and gleam in her eye, \"I may never be satisfied with anyone my age again. You've taught me that experience counts for everything -- technique, finesse, satisfaction, emotional stability, and love. All my male friends flunk the test on every one of those measures.\"\n\nShe also told me that Margo and she planned to 'get together' more frequently. The two had enjoyed each other on many levels and not only on the sensual or sexual plane. I could see that Margo had plans to mentor the younger woman.\n\nCaroline and Margo made me promise to keep in touch with each of them. I told them I would, and would like them to also take the initiative when they felt they needed a 'Jim Fix.' I told them more about 'Mellon Girls,' and they liked that terminology, and that I'd honored them with membership in that exclusive club.\n\nI took a corporate jet from Luton Airport north of London to the Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport about twenty miles west of the center of Rome. The sun was setting over the Mediterranean just as we were landing, giving me a gorgeous welcome on my first visit to the city. \n\nAfter a limousine ride through the worst traffic I'd seen in years, I met Crystal and the rest of the crew getting settled in the Grand Hotel De La Minerve's Presidential Suite in Rome. Having grown up and worked around Boston for a good part of my life, I had learned a little Italian; I had the rudiments to ask for basic necessities and to express my gratitude for services rendered. \n\nThe next day we played tourist in the morning, and I believe that no one figured out our celebrity status. We spent the next three nights doing the Italia premiere of Pressure Limit -- my movie with Jill Danes, an upscale concert at the Parco della Musica Auditorium, and the premiere of Crystal's movie - The Naked Truth. In the days that followed, we repeated that schedule with a day or two in-between in Madrid, Lisbon, Munich, Vienna, Oslo, and Stockholm. \n\nMy life took a crazy turn when we reached Berlin. We had a few more concerts to give, and our concert was at an arena called O2 World in Berlin. One afternoon we were rehearsing for a sellout crowd of eighteen thousand that evening. A couple of dozen roadies were setting up for the concert. We'd done all the sound level checks of the various microphones and band instruments, so we'd gone to an interior room to go over the concert program, song by song. We had a relaxed rehearsal with a lot of repartee with each other and the band as we got into the late afternoon.\n\nWhile there were many people coming and going in our rehearsal room that we didn't know, two people suddenly stood out to me -- a man and a woman, both in their late thirties and wearing casual clothes. Their motions were stilted and stiff, and they clearly didn't belong; they had another agenda for being in the room. I'd met many people like this when I had been in the Special Forces, particularly on more clandestine missions. The hair on the back of my neck stood up: these two were CIA or I was a monkey's uncle. What the hell were they doing in our rehearsal room?\n\nWe took a break, and I took the initiative with the couple. I walked over to where they had found a seat; \"Hi, I'm Jim Mellon. I hope your coming tonight to hear the real McCoy without all the side talk and laughter of this rehearsal. Tell me your names, and why you're here?\"\n\nThey were caught off guard. I guessed they were used to always having the upper hand in a situation. \"Errr, hello. I'm Gene Prantz, and this is my colleague Nancy Martin.\"\n\nI jumped in, still the aggressor, \"And, you're with?\"\n\nBoth stammered and stuttered. Nancy calmly said, \"Can we go somewhere to talk?\"\n\nI gestured to Crystal, Jill, George, Terry, and the others hanging around, \"I have no secrets. You can be open with this group.\"\n\nThe pair balked; Gene said in a low voice, \"We have something we need your help with; we're with ... the government -- the U.S. government.\" I laughed to myself; I recalled a conference I'd been at as a computer geek; all the name tags people wore had their name and some company's name, except for a couple from the CIA -- the only words on their nametag said 'Government,' clearly a euphemism for Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nAh ha! I had been right. I chalked up a score for the home team. I humored them, \"OK. Let's step into the hallway, unless you have a better place.\" They didn't. I gestured to the others that I'd be right back.\n\nWhen the door to the rehearsal room closed, I looked at them expectantly. \"Well? You're CIA; what's this about?\"\n\nNancy looked surprised that I'd deduced their affiliation, but tried to ignore my labeling. She appeared the more senior of the two; \"I'll get right to the point on a couple of issues. First, this is a matter of national security, so you are hereby notified that this conversation never happened and you are to restrict your retelling of what we are about to discuss. Second, we are well aware of your background and history in the Special Forces, your past efforts supporting our branch of the government, as well as your training and work with computers before you got into the entertainment business. The mission we are asking you to take may draw on skills and experience from those areas of your life.\"\n\nNow, I was the curious one. What could they want a star entertainer to do that they couldn't do themselves?\n\nNancy nodded to Gene, who took over. \"We're trying to take some of the bite out of an issue that plagues every government agency and company in our country today. The issue is hacking -- computer hacking of business and government operations, everything from the United States power grid, gas lines, missile silos, and the like, deep into hidden quarters of the Pentagon, NSA, and even the White House. Usually, the hacks aren't successful, but once in a while whoever it is gets into the computers they attack. I should tell you that we do consider it an attack -- this is Cyber War, an unstated war between nations that goes on around the clock. At least so far, no one's been shot.\"\n\nNancy said, \"Just to remind you, we're in the game too, although as a country we don't admit it. If you recall, in mid-2010, it came out that the U.S. had partnered with Israel to create a computer worm called Stuxnet. It was malware that reported on various industrial processes, in particularly five Iranian organizations widely suspected to be part of a Uranium enrichment infrastructure. The worm was built to slow down their bomb building capabilities. The overall effort was part of an intelligence operation called 'Operation Olympic Games' that started in 2,006 and continues today.\"\n\nGene said, \"We read that you are going to Moscow next week to give a concert and premiere your movie and Crystal Lee's movie. While you're there we want you to receive some highly classified information from a mole we have in the country. A mole we don't dare go near because they are so well placed. We can't take a chance on compromising them.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why not use some of your own people?\" Based on what I'd heard so far, I thought I would have been a long shot and an unknown in pulling off something like what I imagined they wanted me to do.\n\nNancy reluctantly said, \"A couple of reasons. Five of our agents were recently compromised, and we're not sure how much knowledge got out about our 'in country' people, or even the people we use that are routine visitors. Our normal couriers are too well known; we've known that for years and sometimes take advantage of it acting as if we don't. Anyway, to offset our uncertainty about what the Ruskies know, we thought we'd take advantage of you and your high visibility profile -- being a star and such. We believe that you would be above suspicion when it comes to Russian customs and immigration. Your purpose for being in the country is known by everybody in the country, and they wouldn't suspect any ulterior motive. You'd always be under scrutiny, if not by the secret police then by a bevy of fans.\"\n\nGene said, \"Before we go further, are you willing to consider this job? It's a once and done operation.\"\n\nI nodded, \"So long as I don't have to dispatch anybody to do the job, the answer is 'Yes.' Go on.\"\n\nGene pulled out a battered iPod from his pocket with an attached set of well-worn earplugs. He handed it to me. \"This is a normal Apple iPod, loaded with a particular set of music. There is a carbon copy of this little device in Russia right now; the only difference is that device contains about a terabyte of additional memory that by now is hopefully full of computer code and other documents we want to get our hands on. The other iPod has a small nick in the case about here, just so you can tell them apart.\" Gene pointed to the lower panel on the back of the chrome case.\n\nNancy started to speak, but stopped short when a couple of the band members left the rehearsal room, probably to go get something to eat. When they were out of earshot, she continued, \"We're not exactly sure when or where the swap will take place, but while you are in Russia a woman will find you and you'll switch iPods with her. She may be able to just walk up and ask for the exchange, or it may need to be more cloak-and-dagger, maybe an exchange while she asks you for an autograph or something like that. She may speak; she may hand you a note which you should be sure to destroy. She may try to do this in secret or be amazingly open about it. The decisions will be hers, and we have no way now of confirming what she plans to do. Because of this uncertainty, you have to carry the iPod with you at all times while you are in country, and particularly after the exchange. Safeguard that data once you get it.\"\n\nI asked, \"Care to tell me what the data on her iPod will let us do?\"\n\nThe two looked at each other. Nancy answered, \"It'll let us build better firewalls to those hacks, as well as give us a couple of years leap on what their 'hack' plans are. There will also be some names of people involved in the operation that we might be able to convert or co-opt in some way to help us. For all we know, we might find some names of Americans who decided to help them in some way. It's a crazy world these days.\"\n\nI pushed further, \"I thought we were on good terms with the Russians.\"\n\nGene said, \"Oh, we are, but they hedge their bets. The competition today is more economic than military, but it still goes on. For instance, we know they have tried to slow down our drug development programs related to cancer research so their own pharmaceutical companies can get a leg up in international markets.\"\n\nI thought a minute and asked, \"So, how will I know this mystery woman?\"\n\nGene said, \"Her name is Tanya Lebed -- a person nicknamed 'The Swan' because of how her surname translated from Russian into English.\" He handed me a photograph of the woman to look at, but reclaimed it after I had studied it for a minute. I'd been through this before; I tried to cement the image in my memory. Tanya was an attractive, mid-thirties woman who wore glasses and short auburn hair. She had a slightly nerdy look to her.\n\nGene hesitated for a moment before revealing another fly in the ointment. \"There's a small problem. Tanya doesn't speak any English, and according to your records you don't speak Russian.\"\n\nI grimaced.\n\nNancy asked, \"Any idea how we can get around that problem? We have no ideas that wouldn't complicate the mission.\"\n\nI quietly said, \"I have Nadia, a young Russian housekeeper in Tennessee. She's fluid in English, but grew up in Russia. She has family there, but has told me repeatedly how glad she is to be out of that country.\"\n\nNancy said, \"Can you trust her? If you can, bring her over. \" \n\nI thought about it before responding, \"I guess we'll just have to see.\" I felt that Nadia would be intensely loyal to me, but some inner loyalty to her birth country might over ride my asking her to help me. I had faith.\n\n\"Give me the photograph,\" I said to Gene. \"I'll need it to get Nadia on board and position her to help.\" He reluctantly complied.\n\nI asked, \"What if on the way out of the country, some border guard at the airport decided to listen to some songs on my iPod to be sure there's no contraband on it?\"\n\nGene proudly smiled; I could tell he must have been the father of the technology in this operation. \"They'll hear exactly what is on this iPod, about sixteen-gigabytes of mostly country music. It's our guess about your taste in music, but they won't be able to see any of the internal memory storage except for what Apple would normally provide; the rest is hidden. Even if the device is opened, it resembles a regular Apple iPod except for a couple of hidden chips between layers on the circuit boards.\"\n\nI tried to think of other vital questions I should be asking, but none came to mind. \n\nI told the pair, \"I want to share this deal with Crystal Lee. She has to be part of this; otherwise, she may put our collective foot in it when I try to switch iPods; you know like blurting out something like, 'Wait, you mistakenly picked up each other's iPods.'\"\n\nNancy said, \"You do what you have to do to get that iPod back to us safely. We'll contact you after you're in a friendly country again. If we're not mistaken, your next concert on this tour after Moscow is in Dublin before you head home, right? Their Aviva Stadium, I believe. Gene and I already have tickets along with about fifty-thousand of our closest friends.\" She smiled warmly at me.\n\nI nodded. \"If there's some foul up who do I call? Any other bench depth here?\"\n\n\"Call the embassy and ask for the 'Help Desk,' or else you can contact me at this number.\" Nancy handed me a business card. The name on the card said, \"Lina Cornfurth, Interior Decorator.\" There was no address only a stateside telephone number with a Nashville area code and an email address for a company called 'cornfurthdecorating.com.' I put the card in my wallet. I knew the decorating operation would check out to any probing inquiries.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nI called Ellen after our Berlin concert. I caught Ellen, Nadia, and Claire in bed -- the same bed, playing together. I didn't go into any detail; I just explained to Ellen that I needed her to get Nadia to Berlin by the end of the day after next. That way, she'd connect with us and could accompany Crystal and me as part of our entourage. Ellen knew exactly how to set up complex travel arrangements, so I knew we'd see Nadia shortly.\n\nNadia left Nashville the next day about noon, flew to Philadelphia, caught a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt, and another to Berlin. She walked into our hotel room about ten-thirty in the morning. She had a grin from ear to ear, and didn't even look jet lagged.\n\nWe all hugged and kissed, and welcomed her to our movie premiere-and-concert tour. As of yet, she was clueless as to why we'd brought her over. At that point, I explained that we needed someone who spoke Russian when we went to Moscow, and for the present that pacified her. I had to look for an opening when I could examine her loyalties and maybe open up about the situation to her.\n\nA few hours later, the three of us sat naked in our master suite bedroom. Crystal, Nadia, and I had just made love, a favorite pastime of ours. Both women had those freshly fucked glows all over their naked bodies, and for that matter I probably did too. Nadia cuddled against me as I stroked her breasts. I didn't like what I had to do, but I thought the goal worthy.",
        "\"Nadia, I need to know something. If you could help the United States versus Russia, what would you do?\"\n\nShe thought about the question, \"It's hard to say. Give me a situation.\"\n\n\"You could stop people in Russia from slowing down and hurting people in the United States. Maybe for instance, help good drugs get to market faster -- all over the world.\"\n\nNadia spoke without hesitation, \"Then I'd help your country. I know Russia wants to hurt the United States in many ways; I guess because of the life style there. I don't approve.\"\n\nI spoke carefully; I didn't want to misrepresent what the situation was but I didn't want to give away too many details either, at least not at this point. \"What I just described is a situation I have been asked to help with, to stop Russia from hurting worthy efforts in the U.S. I don't speak Russian, and one of the people I have to meet with inside Russia doesn't speak English, so without your help I would be at an impasse.\"\n\n\"Oh, on that basis, I definitely help you. I do anything to help you or Crystal ... or Ellen or Claire, and the others in our circle of friends. I put all of you before everything else.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nWithout equivocation she said, \"Because I know you all love me the way I love you. People that love each other help one another without question.\"\n\nI marveled at how she had so simplified things down to their bare essentials.\n\nI described a simplified situation to Nadia, telling her only that a lovely woman had some information to give to us on her iPod, and so that she still had some country music to listen to we would give her my iPod. I showed her Tanya's photograph and asked her to memorize the face because we would not have the picture after that moment. I also showed the picture to Crystal.\n\nNadia studied Tanya's picture, even commenting on the likely region of the country she came from based on her facial bone structure and lips. When she handed the picture back to me, I put it in an ashtray on a bedside table, lit a match, and set fire to the photo. If Nadia hadn't thought about the secrecy and importance of the mission before, that single act demonstrated to her the criticality of our mission and the level of secrecy. When the flames died out, she knee-walked over to me, her breasts swaying in a most seductive way. She hugged me, almost in reassurance of her support. \n\n\"Thank you, Nadia.\" I gave her a hug back. I turned to my other lover and said, \"Crystal, let's see whether we can give Nadia couple of more orgasms.\"\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nTerry had arranged for a private Boeing 737 to fly our entire entourage, including band equipment from place to place in Europe, and in that case from Berlin to Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. We touched down about eleven in the morning Moscow Standard Time, and taxied to the general aviation terminal where we were met by a customs and immigration team to check us into the country. A few of hours later, we were ensconced at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in downtown Moscow, a few steps from Red Square and near the Bolshoi Theater. Terry had reserved the entire top floor of the five-star hotel.\n\nThe last time I'd been in Russia, it had been the U.S.S.R., and I had not been invited, and if my presence had been detected, I would not have been welcomed. I crashed the party so to speak on a mission that also involved the CIA and the intelligence agencies of several other countries. The Soviet Union was falling apart and those in the know could see the power vacuum that would be left. There was a scramble to keep various known nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorist organizations. Not all the teams were successful, but mine was.\n\nI sent Nadia off to connect with some of her family for the first time in nearly two years since she'd come to the United States. I made sure that Terry got her a fist full of tickets to the movie premieres and the concert. We were making some of her wildest dreams come true by being able to reconnect with her family, and explain to them how she supported two important American celebrities. I promised her that Crystal and I would welcome a visit from any of them while we were in the city. I suggested she bring them to the premiere parties or to the greenroom at the concert.\n\nOur first night, the Russian premiere of Pressure Limit drew a large crowd of tuxedoes and ball gowns. The sleek crowd watched the film with Russian voices dubbed over the film's dialogue. After we were introduced up on stage before the film, Jill Danes and I were able to find a room to join Nadia, Crystal, and George Rinard for conversation until the end of the film when we would return and field a few cinematic questions. Jill and I also anticipated a few questions on her kidnapping and my rescue of her in Nicaragua.\n\nAs I looked out at the audience from up on stage, I scanned the audience for the face of Tanya Lebed, but I saw no 'swans' in the audience. In my pocket, I carried my iPod, ready at a moment's notice for a switch of any kind. I had even practiced palming the device in several ways, to give it away or to receive another surreptitiously. I involved Crystal in my practice too. We talked about how a switch might be made in a ladies room more safely than in public.\n\nOur half hour onstage after the movie went predictably and gave me even more time to study the faces in the audience. The premiere party was in the theater, so everyone moved to the lobby areas for champagne, caviar, and other hors d'oeuvres. Afterwards, two limousines arrived to drive our contingent back to our hotel.\n\nNadia, Crystal, and I got into the first shiny black limousine, a luxury car instead of a stretch vehicle; I sat in front. Terry, George, and Jill got in the second car. The driver secured the doors, and got behind the steering wheel. As we pulled away from the theater, I had a chance to study the driver in the bright lights around the theater. My back stiffened. The driver turned out not to be a man as he appeared, but a woman in disguise.\n\nThe driver was Tanya Lebed.\n\nI wondered, 'How do you start a conversation with someone who doesn't speak your language, nor you theirs. How do you suggest you trade iPods with her?'\n\nI had a simple approach that involved one word, her name. I said aloud, \"Tanya?\"\n\nThe pretty driver turned to me and broadly smiled. \"Da.\" A string of Russian immediately followed that instantly defied my abilities. \n\nNadia, leaned forward from the back seat, and the two started an animated conversation to which Crystal and I were not privileged. I smiled at the many possibilities their conversation could take. \n\nNadia finally turned to me from her kneeling position behind the front seats; \"Tanya is most pleased to meet you and Crystal. She got this special job as your chauffeur for the days you are in Moscow, so you will see her all the time you are here. The company that hired her wants her to stay close by us in case we suddenly decide to go to somewhere. She can also give wonderful tours of the city and countryside if we wish.\"\n\nNow, those words were not at all what I expected. I nodded to Tanya and gave her a smile I hoped she interpreted as my pleasure in what she had arranged. \n\nCrystal asked, \"How is she supposed to stay available for us? Where will she be?\"\n\nNadia and Tanya traded Russian phrases before Nadia says, \"She sleep in this car with her telephone until you need her.\"\n\nCrystal said, \"Nonsense. Tell her we want her to come up to our suite at the hotel. We will find her somewhere comfortable to sleep.\"\n\nTanya looked into her rearview mirror, clearly gaging Crystal's sincerity. A few words followed in Russian. Nadia translated, \"She thank you and is very grateful she doesn't have to sleep in the car. She wondered if she would get any sleep, and she worried about her safety alone in a vehicle in this city late at night.\"\n\nI turned to Nadia; \"Ask Tanya whether she likes country music, and if she has an iPod?\" An exchange of words was made.\n\nTanya turned to me and pulled an iPod from her pocket as we drove slowly through the city streets. She handed it to me. As we drove under a streetlight, I saw the telltale identifying nick on the back of the music player. I pocketed her iPod and handed the one that had been in my pocket all day back to her. She slipped it away, and gave me a subtle smile. At least, this part of the mission had been completed.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nI insisted that the valet at the Ritz handle the limousine, making sure to keep it available for us to use at any time. I tipped him generously in case anyone asked. I allowed Tanya to follow behind us carrying a couple of bags she'd had in the trunk; the proper station for a servant, and I knew we both wanted to keep up pretenses. Anyone watching would think this a routine entourage driven in with their servant, who they kindly invited to stay somewhere in the hotel. My eyes roamed the sidewalk and lobby areas for prying eyes, but I found none.\n\nOnce the door to our suite was shut, Tanya gestured for us to be quiet. She produced a small electronic device and walked throughout the suite, waving the device through the air repeatedly, particularly near lamps, telephones, and wall hangings. I knew the routine because I had done a less sophisticated version of it years earlier; she was sweeping for bugs and hidden cameras.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes and a thorough search, she spoke with Nadia who in turn translated, \"The room is clean.\"\n\nI invited Tanya, Nadia, and the others to sit in a circle and chat. Tanya chatted idly with Nadia who occasionally shared something interesting. I asked about Tanya's regular job and family, but all she would say is she worked with computers and her family had roots in the Ukraine, near Kiev. \n\nCrystal and Jill wandered off together, and returned later modeling some of the sleekest lingerie I'd ever seen. As they sashayed into the room, Crystal narrated about Jill's peignoir, and then Jill repeated the effort about Crystal's teddy with a gauze skirt. Jill's outfit was a nearly transparent black thigh length jacket with a single tie between her gorgeous and very visible breasts; she wore matching thigh high black stockings with about four inches of frilly lace at the top. Over her pussy she wore a small and lacy matching thong with a subtle red heart just over her mons. Crystal's teddy was white lace against a sheer white background that allowed the skin to show through, and she'd put on her pearls to match. The little outfit hugged her torso with two belts of white satin, one just under her breasts that clearly showed through the material, and the other around her waist. The small silk panties she wore did little to hide her cleft.\n\nI could hear Tanya's breath suck in as Jill and Crystal came into the room. She muttered a few things in Russian I doubted needed translation. Her eyes lit up, and she couldn't take her eyes off the three women. Nadia had started to drool; she rose and went to Crystal; they kissed passionately with their tongues visibly searching out the passion in each other.\n\nNadia turned to Tanya with a stream of Russian. I tried to guess the content of the interchange. Nadia went back to kissing Crystal, and then she nudged Crystal to Terry. Crystal settled into Terry's lap, and he immediately started kissing her and feeling her breasts. Jill came to me and duplicated the action. \n\nNadia whispered with Crystal, and then she grabbed Tanya's hand, pulled her up, and led her into our bedroom. I could hear the trio giggling through the open door, but Jill had most of my attention.\n\nJust when my curiosity about Crystal, Nadia, and Tanya reached a peak, the three of them came into the living room of the suite. Tanya wore four-inch spike heels on a pair of gorgeous legs that were visible up past her hip. She wore an 'open shelf' black teddy with white trim. The shelf displayed a pair of unenhanced round breasts with excited nipples centered on glowing maroon areolas. The teddy stretched down into her crotch; however, when she turned around to show us the back, there was none; just a couple of simple straps to help hold the garment to her front.\n\nNadia's teddy, if you could call it that, consisted of a series of leather straps mostly emanating from her pussy in three directions up her front. Separate leather straps crossed horizontally across her front. Nadia's naked breasts hung through openings in the network of straps that wove from between her breasts and attached to a silver studded dog collar. She too wore her spike heels to accent her legs. When she turned, I felt myself harden to at least an eight, because Nadia's sweet and very naked ass showed in its tight taut splendor.\n\nNadia came and kissed me, allowing Jill and me to fondle her breasts. She then went to Terry and Crystal. Tanya stood in the middle of the room uncertain what to do. I could see where she might have been dared to participate in a costume show, but now she wasn't certain what to do with the open displays of sexuality and affection.\n\nI held my arms open to Tanya, indicating that she would be welcome to come to me. She studied me for a moment, and I could only guess the struggle and decisions going on in her head. She walked over to me and stood where I could touch her. \n\nI whispered to Jill, \"Let me attend to this for a moment. I think it'll be worth our time.\" Jill nodded, rose from my lap, and nudged me to Tanya.\n\nI stood and welcomed Tanya into my arms; I did not maul her body as I think she expected. I kissed her tenderly, and we studied each other's faces. Tanya had beautiful blue-green eyes that were about the size of saucers over what had transpired in the past five minutes. I kissed her again, and this time I felt the tip of her tongue trace partway over my lips. I returned the favor, and soon we were French kissing and enjoying each other's flavors. We made out for a few minutes, and I started to run my fingers up each side of her body, tracing the skin on her sides left revealed by the teddy. The passion with which she kissed measurably increased.\n\nI hummed into one of our kisses, and then Tanya whispered to me in Russian. She took my hand and led it to one of her exposed breasts. By my motions and kisses, I tried to let her know I would take good care of her, and that I would make her happy when we made love. There might have been a language barrier, but there was not a communication barrier. We read each other perfectly. The trajectory of the rest of the evening had been clearly established. She smiled at me as I started to gently massage her breast in an erotic way. \n\nAcross the room, Nadia had stripped her revealing leather straps off, and had ingested Terry's cock. Terry leaned to his side on the sofa so he could pull the crotch of Crystal's teddy aside and perform cunnilingus on her. Each of them moaned in sexual satisfaction.\n\nBehind me, Jill shed her peignoir, keeping on the high heels she wore. She seemed to read Tanya's emotions, because after she was naked she came up behind the Russian woman, embraced her from the back, and started to kiss her shoulders and neck. Tanya reached behind her with one arm and used it to touch Jill's nude body and urge her advances. With the other, Tanya reached down to the bulge in my pants. We were on the same wavelength.\n\nI started to kiss Tanya's neck and other exposed skin as my hands joined Jill's in caressing and romancing our new Russian friend. We both whispered to her in soft romantic tones; occasionally she would say something back to us before intimately touching us in some way. Slowly, I untied the small satin straps that helped the sexy teddy cling to her beautiful body. Not only was our friend a computer geek and chauffeur; she also could pass as a fashion model.\n\nWhen the last of Tanya's teddy fell from her body, she started to unbutton my shirt and simultaneously unbuckle the belt to my jeans. I helped the process, aided by Jill who pulled my boots off. When I was nude, I pulled Jill and Tanya to me and kissed the two of them with palpable sexual lust. Tanya dropped to her knees and proved to me that blowjobs can be just as enjoyable in a foreign country as they are at home. She brought me from a 'seven' up to a 'ten' in record time. \n\nJill nudged Tanya and me to the sofa. I sat and lay back, and Tanya mounted me cowgirl style. I could suck and fondle her breasts, and from the looks on her face this is exactly what she wanted. We could also kiss passionately as we made love. Jill came around the back of the sofa, and ended with her pussy just above my face where I could look up and lap at her sweet cunt. \n\nTo my surprise, and with no prompting, Tanya leaned way over me so she too could lap at Jill's pussy. We fucked, felt, and tasted like this for a few minutes before I realized how strenuous it must be for Tanya. I nudged her off, and then had her lie down on the sofa the long way. I had plenty of room to reenter her body with her legs over my own, a modified missionary position. Jill mounted Tanya's face, dropping her tasty cunt right onto her tongue. Tanya pulled Jill's pussy lips to her lips as I started to fuck Tanya again. This seemed to work for all of us.\n\nWith the creative use of my fingers, I brought Tanya to a couple of orgasms. She broke us apart and insisted that I fuck Jill. The two changed placed so I was fucking Jill as Tanya sat on her face with her eyes closed and a look of eternal bliss on her face. Tanya and I could kiss, and I kept pinching and twisting her nipples, watching the surprised looks of pleasure sweep over her as I did.\n\nNadia appeared next to Tanya, and the two girls kissed. After a brief exchange, Nadia said to me, \"Tanya would like you to cum in her pussy. She is on the pill so no worry, but she would really like to experience you to the most. I talked to her earlier too about what a great lover you are.\" Nadia kissed me, and I could taste Crystal on her lips. She went back to the other sofa.\n\nJill had heard Nadia's comments; she nodded to me; \"Bring me off a couple of times, and then you can work your magic on Tanya. Create another 'Mellon Girl,' as though there aren't enough of us already in the world.\" Jill stuck her head back between Tanya's legs, as I made a few extra hard thrusts into the movie star.\n\nAfter I set off Jill's fireworks a couple of times, she pulled away and rearranged us again, this time with Tanya above my prone form. Jill went over to help the other women gang up on Terry.\n\nI whispered sweet nothings to Tanya, and she talked back to me in sweet Russian words. We both knew exactly what the other was communicating. Tanya came again, and then she got impatient for me to cum. I smiled at her, and motioned that now I would bring her to a big orgasm. We started to gyrate and pound into each other. The noise of our bodies slapping together permeated the room and obliterated all other sound. We became the only two people in the universe, and we were intent on delivering maximum pleasure to each other.\n\nI drove a finger partway into Tanya's rosebud. She'd been so close to the edge that was all it took to push her over into a strong climax. A digit from my other hand jammed into her cunt with my cock as my thumb strummed her clit. I had turned Tanya's focused orgasm into a skyrocket that exploded across the night sky in magnificent brilliance. She let loose a stream of Russian, and I had a rough guess what it meant. Her eyes had locked on mine with a mix of love and lust.\n\nThe motion of our bodies together, the feel of Tanya's spasms deep within her, and a quest for my own pleasure, came together in my own orgasm. I pushed up into Tanya's downward grinding cunt as my cock started to fire off bullets of my semen deep inside her breathtaking body. I pulsed and pulsed, longer than usual, signaling to me how much this woman I couldn't talk with had reached my soul.",
        "I fell back as the pleasure passed, and Tanya fell atop me, her breasts crushing into my chest and she kissed me again and again. I responded in kind. We remained coupled for a long time although we could both feel my juices seeping from her vagina around my cock and dripping onto my groin.\n\nI never did go completely soft. We just started to move our bodies again, and as we did I got harder and harder, until we were again in a full-scale fuck. Having come only moments before, I wasn't too sure I'd be of much utility, but that assumption proved false. I brought Tanya to a couple more climaxes, and then we shared another skyrocket, and I filled her even further with more man juice.\n\nThis time in our afterglow, I knew I was done for a while. Jill surprised me by sneaking up behind Tanya and whipping my nearly flaccid cock from her pussy and cleaning me, before she lapped some of my juice from Tanya. Tanya's eyes were big as Jill lapped at her cunt, and she looked at me with the look of a very naughty young girl pleased with herself for what she was doing. She bit her lower lip and smiled at the same time.\n\nI flipped Tanya over on her back and gave her space on the sofa so Jill could operate more effectively. I knelt beside Tanya and stroked her clit between assaults by Jill. I joined Jill in eating some of Tanya's freshly fucked pussy. \n\nJill brought a load of my cum and Tanya's juices up to Tanya's mouth and pantomimed a kiss. Tanya giggled, and shook her head 'No.' Jill made a theatrical display of swallowing the load, and then kissed Tanya. This time, Tanya did French kiss with Jill; I knew she could taste at least some of the residue of our lovemaking.\n\nI joined Tanya in watching the sex show on the other side of the room. Terry's long prong pistoned into Nadia's pussy as she lay back with Crystal's cunt in her face as Crystal and Terry kissed passionately. At that instant, Nadia fired off a 'Big O,' and Terry filled her cunt with his juice. Crystal had a sympathetic reaction and came too. The trio collapsed together in a pile of happy bodies, tongues, and sex juices. \n\nAfter a few minutes, Jill pulled Tanya and me to our feet, and led us into one of the bedrooms. The three of us collapsed into bed, the women on either side of me, and soon we were fast asleep.\n\nBeside me on the bedside table lay the iPod that I had to smuggle into the west in two days time.\n\nTo be continued "
