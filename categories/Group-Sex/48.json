With Crystal's help, Jim became a top country singer. He got tapped to do a movie, enjoys several orgies with his leading lady Jill Danes, and finds a new love interest in a. The film crew moved to Nicaragua to film on location, and Jill was kidnapped. Jim did a bold and risky rescue using his skills he learned as a Green Beret. Shooting finished on Jim's movie. He returned to Nashville with Ellen and Claire for a sex-filled week with Nadia their housekeeper before Crystal returns from Europe where she did a movie. Upon Crystal's arrival, Jim and Crystal do a press conference where a reporter asked Jim about his fathering a child in Ohio. Jim initially ducked the question, but his answer indicated the reporter's accurate assessment. The media went wild at the prospect of a Jim having a hidden baby. A few days later, Jim and Crystal sneak off to join his child's parents in Michigan after they too have fled the paparazzi; as a group, they decide to allow the pretty reporter from the press conference to interview Jim, Crystal, Summer -- the baby's mother, and George -- her husband. \n\n<center>Crystal Clear Ch 10\n\nBabies, horny dads, playful wives, and a loving reporter</center>\n\nEdie, the pretty reporter from the Dayton Daily News, appeared nonplused. \"You ... err, how can I ask this delicately ... you conceived a second child last night?\" She looked between Summer and me about a dozen times in ten seconds.\n\nSummer spoke, \"Yes, exactly.\"\n\n\"How do you know you're pregnant? You can't tell for sure for at least a couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"I can,\" Summer replied. \"I knew it the second he ... the second his seed touched my egg. I'm certain. I'll confirm it in a couple of weeks.\"\n\nEdie wasn't satisfied, \"No, no. Say more. I mean you must feel different today than yesterday, describe that.\"\n\nSummer spoke softly, \"Jim and I connected on many levels last night -- mind, body, and spirit. We resonated on such a deep level I can't begin to describe it; we can almost read each other's thoughts and feelings. Our bodies were so in sync with one another, so in touch, so vibrant together; we peaked together over and over. Lastly, and on that deeper level, Jim and I were in touch with each other's souls. I do believe we are soul mates, the feeling is that strong. In other times and dimensions, spiritual dimensions, we are loving beings; here we are those loving beings having a human experience -- and that's how I know I conceived.\"\n\nEdie turned to George, \"And you're happy with this situation?\"\n\nGeorge broke into a big grin, \"Ecstatic actually. We wanted to have two children, and now we will.\"\n\nEdie sputtered, \"But ... but ... didn't your wife sleep with Mr. Mellon a couple of years ago and last night?\"\n\nGeorge sobered a little and then toyed with the reporter, \"Oh, yeah. I guess he did.\" He paused and got serious; \"The issue is whether the ends justify the means. In this case, and with the personalities of the people involved, we each think it did. At the request of my wife and me, Jim made love to my wife. Now, I love them both dearly. I wasn't sure they'd fall in love, but I am over the moon that they did. I think it's important to the mother and the babies to know that both their parents love each other. They do.\"\n\n\"Aren't you jealous?\"\n\n\"Of what? Jim putting his penis in my wife and leaving his seed. Hardly. I'd be jealous if he tried to take her away from me. I'm jealous that I can't sing and act like he can. But am I jealous they made love, no; I think that those times they made love and connected were some of the truly beautiful moments I could gift to my wife.\"\n\nI jumped in, \"Edie, there's an underlying philosophy we all share. We share a belief in the concept of polyamory -- giving your loved ones the space to love more than one person at a time.\"\n\nEdie nodded for me to continue.\n\n\"Most people think of love as a zero sum game. If I love Crystal, I can't love you without taking something away from Crystal's bucket.\"\n\nCrystal slipped into the conversation, \"But what we found is that the more people you love, the bigger all your buckets get. You end up with more love than you could wish for -- and I'm not talking just sex, I really mean love.\"\n\nI spoke again, \"I guess we reject that zero sum game assumption, and so far I can tell you our lives are all amazing. Besides the sex, I'm talking about all the other warm and romantic feelings that go along with love. In doing that, we disavow allegiance to the principle of monogamy -- that's the shorthand name for the zero sum game.\"\n\nEdie asked, \"But if you're with Summer, you're not with Crystal. You can't physically be in two places at one time.\"\n\nI responded, \"Right, and that brings us to the principle of 'compersion' -- a word that got coined because our vocabulary had nothing that stood opposite the word 'jealousy.'\"\n\nI turned to my son who had been playing on the floor between all the adults. I spoke to Edie, \"How do you feel when you see my son playing well with a toy?\"\n\nEdie answered, \"Happy. Glad that he's happy and content. I can see that he's learning something, and exercising, and growing. If I were his parents, I'd feel proud at his accomplishments and excitement when he did something new, like learn a new word or walk for the first time.\"\n\n\"Do you feel threatened because I spend time with him? Would you if you were his mother?\"\n\n\"No, I'd be happy for the two of you.\"\n\n\"Might you derive happiness from those times because I was happy and he was happy?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nI went on, \"Well, now you understand compersion. Carry that over to my being with Summer instead of Crystal.\"\n\nShe turned to Crystal, \"You mean you were glad he slept with Summer.\"\n\nCrystal said, \"Just as George said, I was full of joy that the two of them reconnected after being apart for so long.\"\n\nEdie asked, \"Did you know ahead of time that they'd have sex?\"\n\n\"Well, of course. They'd already made a baby.\"\n\n\"That reminds me, when did Jim tell you about his child?\"\n\nCrystal thought a moment before responding, \"I think it was when I met him in Missouri after he'd been to Ohio -- probably about two or three weeks after he'd seen George and Summer. He was excited that he'd probably made Summer pregnant.\"\n\n\"Who else knew?\"\n\n\"I think my sister Ellen and Terry our agent were at the table when he told us.\"\n\nEdie asked, \"And, no one thought that was a little unusual? I mean, by then, weren't the two of you becoming more serious?\"\n\nCrystal said, \"Well, yes, I loved Jim a lot by then; I felt he also was a soul mate to me as well. I was excited and happy for him. He even told me he'd fallen in love with Summer.\"\n\n\"He told you he was in love with another woman?\"\n\n\"Sure. I felt glad they'd connected on such a deep level. The way he felt about Summer didn't take anything away from what I thought we had or have. Just like last night, I was happy for both of them. Summer had such a glow this morning when they got up; I could tell they'd made love again before coming downstairs.\"\n\nEdie's eyes practically rolled up in her head. I could tell that Crystal was subtly teasing the poor woman with increasingly shocking statements. I guessed what was coming next, and Edie fell right into her trap.\n\nEdie said, \"What did you do overnight?\"\n\nCrystal said in a level voice, \"Why, I was with George, of course. I didn't want him to feel lonely.\"\n\nThe pen fell out of Edie's hand again.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nAfter we talked for a while longer about less controversial topics, we took a break. Summer and Edie took Little James by the hands and the two of them slowly walked him down by the lake and out onto the wide dock. The air had turned crisp overnight, the harbinger of an early autumn. James was walking, but not very well and not very far. Summer let Edie carry the baby back in her arms; James liked the attention of a new female.\n\nCrystal and I helped George put out some snacks and opened some wine for everyone. George fired up his grill and prepared to barbeque some steaks. The sun rode low in the sky, and some clouds added to the sky to make a beautiful sunset.\n\nWhen Edie reached the patio she shivered. I automatically reached over and put a warm arm around her shoulders, and she just nestled in and said, \"You're a warm body, and I bet it's going to be cold tonight.\" \n\nWe ate dinner inside, and after dinner George got a fire pit going in the middle of the back yard. The women fussed over Little James and put him to bed, and then joined the two of us outside.\n\nAs Edie walked up with the other women, she said, \"I guess I'll be going. If I leave now I can get back to Dayton before one or two in the morning.\"\n\nWe all spoke at once, Summer the most emphatic, \"You can't go; you're staying with us. We can rearrange so you can be comfortable. Besides, you haven't finished your interviews; I know you wanted to talk some more to Crystal.\"\n\nI could tell Edie was torn between staying and imposing on the rest of us. Maybe I sealed the deal, \"Come on Edie, stay overnight.\" I patted the empty seat on the small outdoor sofa beside me. Somewhat reluctantly, she sat.\n\nOur conversation rambled from topic to topic. At one point, George said, \"I'm going to have a cognac, I'll bring something out for everyone.\" He got up from his chair and walked into the house.\n\nA minute later, he brought out a tray with five small glasses and several different bottles of cognac and liqueurs. Summer looked over at me in anticipation; she remembered. Crystal just winked at me and nodded in Edie's direction. Summer almost burst out laughing when she saw what Crystal had implied.\n\nI poured a glass of Grand Marnier, a rich orange liqueur. I moved in front of Summer, and she stood and faced me. The glow from the fire lit our bodies. I took a sip of the liqueur, and moved to her lips the way I had the night we first made love. As we kissed, I thrust my tongue gently into her mouth, and then jetted the liqueur from my mouth to hers. After that, our tongues danced in the open air between us -- tasting, rubbing, loving.\n\nSummer grabbed a hold of me and really started to French kiss me, more passionately than the tender moment when we shared the liqueur. A quick fire of passion rose between us. I could feel myself harden as I pushed into her.\n\nWe broke apart, and Summer sat, but we both knew we'd make love later.\n\nAfter a quiet word or two with Crystal, George poured his cognac and repeated the sexy gesture with her. Crystal moaned into their kiss, and I watched as her hips bucked over George's leg. She was in heat, and I genuinely felt glad for her. \n\nAfter a moment or two of further kissing and grinding of hips, the pair broke apart and sat together again. George draped his arm around Crystal's shoulders, and she pulled his hand to her breast. She wore no bra, and I could already see her fabulous nipples poking through the cotton fabric of her shirt.\n\nWe were all quiet for a couple of minutes, and then Edie turned to me: \"Would you do that to me -- with the liqueur I mean. That looked so ... so different. I ... I just want to see what it's like.\" We both stood, Edie's stunning body facing me in an innocence a decade below her years. I instantly became more aware of her womanhood -- her slimness, her full breasts, her upturned face to mine, her subtle smile of hopefulness. Suddenly, I hoped she felt and would respond to my maleness. I wanted her.\n\nI took a generous sip from my liqueur glass, put my arms around her, and bent down to kiss Edie. Our lips came together, and she allowed my tongue to penetrate into her body. With intent to excite, I squirted the liquid from my mouth to Edie's, and then I changed from delivery mode to a passionate kiss. Our mouths remained locked together, as we kissed; Edie's tongue came into my mouth and I tried to suck every drop of moisture from her, even swapping some of the liqueur back and forth with her. She moaned, and her arms tightened around my neck, as she pulled me into a deeper kiss -- and another kiss -- and another.\n\nAs we parted, she panted and whispered, \"Oh, God. That was fabulous. Can we do it again?\" She had responded naturally, and then realized we had an audience. She muttered, \"Oh, dear. I ... I didn't mean ...\"\n\nI said softly to her, \"Yes, you did.\" I pulled her to me, and we kissed. She allowed me to run my tongue up her neck and then around her lips. I could feel her body turning to liquid. I sipped the Grand Marnier again, and repeated the liquid kiss; she responded with more intensity this time. Unconsciously, her hips started to grind into mine, and soon her crotch rode up one of my legs as the light of passion reached her midsection. More kisses followed, and then we sat down.\n\nI put my arm around Edie. She stared into the fire, I thought too embarrassed to look at the others. Summer came over and sat on my other side; she unbuttoned her shirt almost to her navel and pulled my hand around her and down to her breasts. \n\nI could almost feel Edie's mind racing to a decision. When she reached it, she too undid a couple of buttons on her blouse and pulled my hand to her chest. She leaned into me as I touched her. When I stroked a nipple, and lightly pinched it between two fingers she groaned in a barely audible voice of satisfaction, \"Oh, fuck, that's nice. I need this.\"\n\nI kissed Summer. She drank from the Grand Marnier and gave me her spurt of liquid. She said, \"Share it with Edie. This is so sexy.\"\n\nI turned to Edie's ready body, and our lips met. She accepted the liquid that had passed from Summer to me and to her. As we parted, she spoke, \"That is so erotic. It's almost like I'm making love with all of you.\"\n\nI said in a kind voice to her, \"You are. You are sharing yourself with us as we are with you.\"\n\nEdie panted, \"But, I want to ... to make love to you -- to all of you. You're all so nice, and ... the way you think about people ... and love ... and relationships is so ... divine.\"\n\n\"We want to make love to you too, if you'll let us.\"\n\nEdie reached to the table behind us and took the glass of liqueur. She took a small swig and turned to face me. She pulled my head to hers, and we kissed with her jetting the liquid fire into my mouth. When she'd finished I turned and shared it with Summer.\n\nAfter Summer and I kissed, we sat and watched the fire. On the other sofa, Crystal had removed her top and George made love to her full curvy breasts. Even from a dozen feet away, we could see her erect and excited nipples centered on her large areolas. The fire glow accentuated the curves of her beautiful upper body. George alternated sucking one and then the other. Crystal seemed to be in a pleasure zone as she cradled his head. Watching the two of them made me harden.\n\nAs I fondled Edie's and Summer's breasts, we watched as Crystal shed the Daisy Mae shorts she wore all the time. Beneath the jeans was a small thong that she also disposed of quickly. She sat down again in George's lap and pulled one of his hands to her pussy.\n\nGeorge gently stroked up and down Crystal's slit as she moaned and squirmed in his arms. Summer, Edie, and I could tell when he found her clitoris because Crystal threw her head back onto his shoulder and spread her legs even further. George inserted two fingers into her cunt, and stroked her clit with his thumb. Crystal started to vibrate in his lap, her body pulsating with pleasure as he pumped his hand in and out of her vagina. He put a third finger into the mix.\n\nCrystal must have been on the edge, because within two minutes she came in a spectacular array of fireworks that lit up the sky. \"Oh ... George ... keep going ... don't stop ... you're bringing me ... right up to ... the edge. Oh, fuuuuuuucccccck.\" The sound of George's hand slapping against her labia came to a slow stop. Crystal's eyes were closed, and she just flowed into some wild kisses with him where she wanted to devour him.\n\nThe broke apart and Crystal stood and pulled George to his feet. She turned to us, \"We have some serious business to attend to. Please excuse us; we'll see you in the morning, and we hope we don't keep you awake.\" The pair disappeared inside the house. \n\nSummer kissed me, and nudged me to have a deep kiss with Edie. Summer said, \"It's time for us to go in too. The fire is dying down, and my back is getting chilly.\" She hitched forward so she could look past me at Edie; her look invited Edie to join us. \n\nEdie said in a low voice, \"I've never been in a threesome. I've never made love to a woman.\"\n\nSummer said, \"You'll love it, and I've never made love to a woman either. Come, let's learn how to please each other together. I'm sure Jim will help.\"\n\nSummer helped Edie stand. She reached over the last of the Grand Marnier in the glass we had been sharing. Summer sipped in the liquid, and then put her hand behind Edie's head and gently guided Edie's lips to her own. The pair kissed, and I could imagine the inferno of emotions each of the women must have felt. They each moaned in pleasure into the kiss.\n\nWhen the broke apart, Summer led Edie inside and to the master bedroom. I followed behind.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nI had Edie help me unveil Summer's tight curvy body. She'd worked hard to restore her figure after the baby, and had been successful. What remained were a pair of breasts that remained firm and vibrant; each still retained the large dark areolas that I found so enticing. \n\nTo my surprise, Edie leaned in and suckled one of Summer's breasts. Summer held her head and guided her for a minute.\n\nEdie looked at me and said, \"It feels so nice to do that. For the first time, I can see why my boyfriends have found my chest so fascinating.\"\n\nSummer and I slowly stripped away Edie's clothing, although there wasn't much -- slacks, blouse, bra, and thong. As we did, Summer talked to Edie in a loving yet lusty tone: \"The moment I saw you, I wanted to eat you up. You look so yummy. I am going to lick you from head to toe, and savor you. I want to taste you -- to taste your female juices that you no doubt have flowing out of your little pussy right now. I'm going to drive my tongue deep inside your mouth and your pussy until you cum ... and then you're going to do all the same things to me.\"\n\nIn a pause, Edie said, \"What about Jim?\"\n\nSummer chuckled, \"When I'm done with you, Jim will fuck the living daylights out of you. It'll be a fuck so fantastic you'll remember it for the rest of your life, partly because I'm going to keep using my tongue all over you. Only one restriction, I get his cum deep inside me. Maybe some other time you can have it, but this week I'm at my most fertile and I want as much of his sperm in my womb as I can get.\"\n\nEdie moaned as Summer's fingers reached into her slit. Summer pushed Edie back onto the bed. I removed my own clothing, and sat in a bedroom chair watching the Sapphic pair and fondling my own shaft so I'd be ready for the call.\n\nSummer and Edie made out as their hands roamed wildly on each other's breasts, and then lower into the wet valleys of love the two had generated. They each provided guidance to the other -- \"harder, slower, just to the right, right there, deeper, use more fingers, pinch harder, yes you can touch there too.\" I found myself surprised by how vocal they were to one another.",
        "Summer ended laying on her stomach between Edie's legs, her mouth going wild on Edie's pussy. Edie writhed and squirmed and moaned under her ministrations. After a few minutes, Summer raised her butt into the air, changing the angle slightly at which she attacked Edie's cunt; she looked back at me over her shoulder: \"Jim, come put that cock in my pussy. Fuck me while I eat Edie.\"\n\nNot one to dally, I did as I was told, kneeling behind Summer on the bed and sinking into her pussy in one smooth stroke. Her pussy dripped female juices of excitement, so I slid right into her. I set up a slow oscillation of my body against hers; I didn't want to upset her tasty meal at Edie's bush.\n\nEdie for that matter stared into my eyes with heavy lids that betrayed lust and sexual excitement. After being eaten to one orgasm, Edie stopped Summer and asked in a pleading tone: \"Can Jim make love to me a little.\" Summer kissed her and said, \"Of course, My Darling.\"\n\nSummer moved to the side, I moved so I could sink myself into Edie. She reached down and spread the lips of her labia, so that she showed me her pink and I could see the gaping hole I was to fill. \n\nI didn't need to use my hands to aim my rigid pole. I just shifted my hips until I lined up with the center of her wet slit with her swollen lips ready to receive me, and filled the hole in long smooth stroke into a well-lubricated female. Edie's eyes rolled up into her head, and she moaned in pleasure, \"Ooooooooh, fuck me.\"\n\nSummer moved and started to suck on Edie's breasts again, returning her nipples to a highly aroused state. Edie's breasts swayed in sync with my thrusts into her body. \n\nI leaned down and passionately kissed Edie. She responded in kind. I used my thumb on her clit, driving her back into orbit and soon into another climax. Edie was almost delirious with pleasure; she was right on the edge of the zone where a woman enjoys one continuous oscillating orgasm.\n\nI gestured to Summer, and she straddled Edie's head, lowering her pussy onto her face. Edie's tongue started working. Summer faced me; we kissed and licked each other's faces and tongues in our lust and passion.\n\nI told Summer, \"Let's put Edie in the zone.\" She nodded in understanding, dismounted her lover's head, and returned to her breasts. She slapped and pinched at both of Edie's nipples, and then carefully bit into each one when she wasn't sucking on it. \n\nI applied my thumb more carefully and directly to Edie's clit, and soon she not only climaxed for a third or fourth time, but also moved into the zone of near continuous orgasms. Now, every little thing we did brought Edie a peak of pleasure: Summer stroked her abs and arms; I leaned down and kissed her ears, nibbling on her ear lobes; Summer used her tongue on Edie's clit even as I pistoned into her body.\n\nEdie just twisted and turned, almost throwing me away from her. Once she thought I would leave her; she pleaded, \"Oh Jim, please don't leave me here -- I'm right -- Oh, fuck, another one. Stay in me ... I'm ... Oh, wow, another one ... Jim, they're coming every couple of seconds. I didn't know I could do this. Oh, fuck; again.\"\n\nI promised Edie I would explain tomorrow, and brought her to yet another climax. After, a half hour of this, Edie finally pleaded with me to stop. \"I hate to stop this, but I may never leave this bed, and I may never let you leave. I don't want to get sore, and I want more of you later. Now, you have to make love to Summer, and you have to cum in her so we're sure she's pregnant.\"\n\nI jerked myself out of Edie's cunt. She had one last orgasm, and then lay unmoving in the center of the bed, two rivulets of sweat pooled between her breasts and near her naval. The rest of her body glowed with a sexual sheen. She held her arms out to Summer, and the pair kissed quite passionately.\n\nEdie hitched herself to the side so that Summer could lie beside her. I impaled Summer on my rigid shaft, and soon I had her moving to the same state Edie floated in of near constant orgasms. Edie, for her part, made love to the rest of Summer's body that I wasn't occupied with. Summer swooned, \"Ooooooooh, Jimmmmm. Fuuuuucccccck meeee!\" I did, and many minutes later I decided to fill my lover with my seed.\n\nI warned Summer, and she pulled me to her for a French kiss of epic proportions. We parted, and our eyes locked in one another. I made a dozen hammering thrusts into Summer, and with each I sent a pulse of my cum onto her cervix. When my last pulse ended, I froze in position above Summer, my arms extended and locked, my back arched, and my head held high.\n\nI leaned in and kissed Summer, and then rolled us so I was between Edie and Summer. My cock remained deep in Summer's body.\n\nAnd that's how we went to sleep.\n\nEdie woke me in the middle of the night. She wanted me to make love to her again. She fellated me to requisite hardness, and then I slid into her body. We did a slow fuck, just idly grinding our hips back and forth from each other with my cock deep in her cunt.\n\nSummer awoke and watched us. I asked her, \"Do you this load of cum?\"\n\n\"No, this time you can give it to Edie if she wants it.\"\n\nEdie pleaded, \"Oh, I do. I do.\"\n\nAnd, only a few minutes later I came deep inside Edie. \n\nEdie and I fell asleep with my cock buried in her pussy.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nI felt invigorated in the morning. The crisp air motivated a long run. I dressed, and snuck out of the house so the others wouldn't wake up, particularly my son. An hour later I trotted back and went down to the edge of the lake. I easily slipped into a meditative trance, and left myself open for messages from within and messages from my spirit guides.\n\nI felt one overpowering message from within, \"Love unconditionally and love everyone. Don't worry, just love and love many. Trust the results.\"\n\nMy reverie was broken when I felt a warm body snuggle up against me. I blinked awake, and Edie pulled my arm around her. She had wrapped herself in a woolen blanket. I could tell she was nude beneath the wrap. She looked up and kissed me. She whispered, \"I think I love you; Is that all right? I don't think it's just the sex. It's you, your philosophy, your obvious caring for everyone, and the love you carry -- even for me.\"\n\nI smiled at her and said, \"It's delightfully all right. Edie, I love you too.\"\n\nWe were quiet for a while, and then Edie said, \"Last night was so wonderful in so many ways. You are a magnificent lover, and now the gold standard by which I'll evaluate anybody else that I choose to love the way we did last night. Summer is equally fantastic. I had no idea I could respond to another woman that way; I don't think she did either. I worried I might become a lesbian, and then you fucked that idea away. I just want both of you again and again,\" she blushed and added, \"and now I'm thinking about Crystal and George too. I am so bad.\" She grinned.\n\nAfter another silence she said, \"I'd never been in a threesome. I'd never seen other people making love; except in one porn film I saw a long time ago. When you were making love to Summer, I couldn't take my eyes from you. I wanted to soak up every subtle detail that each of you did or experienced. Watching is so sexy and erotic -- and I felt such love and compassion for you both. I remember thinking; this is what 'compersion' must feel like.\"\n\nI felt Edie shiver. The blanket was inadequate for the morning chill. I pulled her into my lap and stood, and then I carried her into the house.\n\nNo one was awake. I brought Edie into the living room, pulled my running clothes from my body, pulled Edie's blanket away from her beautiful body, and then we made love again in the middle of the living room sofa. \n\nAfter our orgasms we just lay there, Edie on top of me with my erect shaft still in her vagina. She had her head on my shoulder.\n\nCrystal appeared in the doorway, also wrapped in a blanket. She came over and cuddled up next to me. She tenderly kissed me and then kissed Edie. She said softly, \"I watched the two of you just before you each came. You are so sweet together. You just fit one another, and it was so sexy.\" She kissed us both again.\n\nEdie was getting the deluxe treatment. She'd had romantic kisses with everyone, except George. She glowed, and I could feel the swelling of her heart inside her. She held and exuded love for everyone. She reached out and pulled Crystal into the two of us, and stroked her hair. She kissed Crystal several times, even using her tongue to trace out small designs on one cheek.\n\nWe were quiet for a few minutes, and then I heard the cooing of Little James from his nursery. I looked at the two women, we all sighed, and moved to uncouple and head off to get ready for the day. \n\nOne thing for certain, everyone in that house felt loved.\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nEdie dressed in some shorts and a shirt she borrowed from Summer and George. We all knew of her nudity beneath the scanty outfit. She got her laptop from her car, and sat at the dining room table composing her article based on the interview with all of us the day before. After our relationship turned sexual, and after she had felt the love and caring among all of us, I knew she would do a fair and credible job putting our story to the public.\n\nAround noon, she hooked her laptop up to the printer George and Summer shared. After some trial and error with the technology, she finally printed out her draft of the article and gave us each a copy for our comments.\n\nGreenville, Ohio. Jim Mellon and Summer Ellis confirmed today they birthed a healthy baby boy over a year ago. The namesake love child resulted from a natural insemination Summer and her husband George requested of Mellon. A second child likely is on the way as well. However, the story is not as simple as it appears, and the details are not as lurid as the tabloid press has made them out to be.\n\nWell-known country singer and soon to be movie star, Jim Mellon, served ten years in Army Special Forces with high school friend George Ellis. The two were inseparable, and multiple times saved each other's lives in heavy combat or on clandestine missions. On one of those missions, Mellon watched in horror as Ellis stepped on a mine. The explosion claimed part of Ellis' left leg. With Mellon's help, Ellis survived the incident, but the shrapnel that riddled his lower body left him infertile. \n\nAfter deciding to have children, Ellis and his wife tried for years before testing revealed the damage from the shrapnel. Some other options were explored including adoption, and the couple ruled these out for many reasons: time to adopt, the expense, the legal hassle, and the difficulty of compliance with outdated state laws that work against adopting couples. Knowing of Mellon's impending visit during his well-known road trip across America two years ago, the couple talked about approaching him with their unusual request. \n\nMellon was more than a brother to Ellis, and subsequently to Summer. Mellon and Summer do have a love relationship, not to exclude or replace George but to supplement and augment that relationship. Being in the same room with Jim and George, one can feel the mutual support and love between the pair, and this carried over to Summer.\n\nThe trio did discuss artificial insemination and ruled this out as well because of cost, legal entanglements, and again state laws. Mellon and the Ellis' also feel that a deep expression of love at conception influences a baby's health and well-being for the rest of their life, and so Jim and Summer made love when she was most fertile, and the result was a healthy pregnancy and a beautiful love child [see photos]. \n\nCrystal Lee, Mellon's long-time girlfriend and country music star, knew of the relationship and pregnancy from the start. Jim and Crystal together have created an education fund for the child. Both are God parents for 'Little James' and plan to be an active presence in the child's life as well as continue their solid relationship with the Ellis'.\n\nCrystal commented that she is not sure when her professional life will allow her the privilege of having a child, so she expressed her joy at being able to share in the growth and development of her boyfriend's child with his parents. The love in her eyes for the child and his parents, the Ellis', is palpable when you see them together. Mellon carries the same love for them.\n\nMellon and Lee have maintained an 'open relationship' since they met, partly because of their often conflicting and hectic professional schedules. The pair was recently apart for almost half-a-year making two movies: Mellon in Central America, and Lee in Europe and Russia. Some other musicians and actors have similar relationships [see inset box 1], and the Ellis' share this same general philosophy of polyamory.\n\nWhat appeared at first to be the scandal of the year turns out to be nothing more than a close friend helping another, here in a loving and supportive way that resulted in a beautiful child, a new pregnancy, and four happy adults that surround the child with love. \n\n###\n\nEND OF MAIN ARTICLE.\n\nINSET BOX 1\n\nTitle: Open Relationships Are More Popular Than Many Know\n\nWhat do Rachel Ray, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Will Smith, Pink, Megan Fox, Chris Brown, Nicole Kidman, Gwen Stefani, Goldie Hawn, and Charlize Theron have in common? They are in or were in 'open relationships' or 'open marriages.' This is the short list of celebs in such relationships.\n\nOpenness is a negotiated status that, if the relationship is to survive, depends on a high level of communication, empathy, and sensitivity. Some go into the relationship knowing it'll be open from the start; others shift it from inside - some are heterogeneous, and some are gay/lesbian; some admit many people, others include only one other; some are for young adults, and some for people of all ages; in some the spouses are involved, and in others they remain unconnected to the other person; some are transient -- we use the term 'swingers,' and others are long term -- we use the term 'polyamorous' for these. There is no one model.\n\nSinger Jim Mellon emphasized, \"Love must play an important part in an expanded relationship if it is to survive. A two-way sensitivity to the needs of each partner is needed, not just the guy deciding he wants a little fling. A relationship is constantly changing and needs to adapt daily to the needs, feelings, and desires of both partners and include caring about the others embraced by the relationship. With foundations built on love, there is a strength in such relationships that's hard to duplicate any other way.\" Mellon mentioned that he has friends across the country in polyamorous relationships -- loving relationships between multiple men and women, and they have existed for well over a decade. In each, there are people of all ages.\n\nSingers Mellon and long-term girlfriend Crystal Lee sat next to each other during my interview with them, and there is an aura of love that surrounds the couple. The Ellis' are the same way. Neither couple went into specifics about their beliefs and the details of their relationship, but both said they had talked extensively about all the possibilities and permutations of such relationships, as well as the various consequences.\n\nSeveral studies talk about what percent of the 60 million married couples in the U.S. engage in open relationships. The number ranges from a steady five percent at any one time, to fifteen to twenty percent of those that have tried such a relationship formerly during their life. That means there are about 3 million couples sharing themselves with one or two other people, and it also means that upwards of 12 million couples have tried such a relationship at some time during their life.\n\nWhat's noteworthy, is that these statistics are only for married couples, now less than half the population of the country. The majority -- singles -- are known to have much higher incidence.\n\nMellon and Lee believe that church and government should stay out of the relationship game instead of legislating the 'who, how, and when' relationships are valid. Mellon said, \"Who's to say that gay, lesbian, or incestuous relationships are wrong; a bunch of a*holes we elect -- hardly. Most of them can't find their *** with two hands, and yet they feel that they can inflict their warped morality code on me. Most of what goes on sexually in this country is probably illegal according to what's on the books.\"\n\nHe went on, \"Much of our legal code seems to be based on the Bible, as though that's the one and only sacred book in the world. It's not for most of the earth's population. Further, it was a book put together by, guess who, a bunch of politicians! Further, Abraham, one of the stalwart role models in the Bible, lived in a polyamorous relationship his whole life. To reiterate, we're supposed to have a separation of church and state, so get the morality of the various religions out of our lives because no one of them in 'right,' and get the government out of our private lives too. It's no one's business but our own -- and after all, if it's between consenting adults, who's to care?\"\n\nIn researching this article by studying others, and in meeting Mellon, Lee, and the Ellis', one sees a vibrancy and excitement in their relationships and zest for life that many outside open relationships fail to display. This is an enthusiastic and loving group of people.\n\nMaybe such relationships are like the poem posed by Edna St. Vincent Millay, another well-known celebrity who lived in an open relationship most of her adult life:\n\n<center>\"My candle burns at both ends, It will not last the night; But, ah my foes, and oh, my friends, It gives a lovely light.\" \n\n### </center>\n\nEND INSET 1 -- NO FURTHER COPY\n\n<center>* * * * *</center>\n\nTo be continued"
