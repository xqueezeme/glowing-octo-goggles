        "This is the second chapter of a series. While the author hopes that this story can stand on its own, this story will make a lot more sense if you have read \"The Performance\" by this author. This story draws on some real experiences but is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to any real person or entity is coincidental and unintentional. Thank you for reading this story.\n\n*****\n\nI had agreed to strip naked with the daughter of my good friends onstage in front of an audience. Penny was very beautiful clothed and, as I had learned, stunning in the nude. The idea of engaging in exhibitionism with her was, frankly, exciting, in part because I hoped that it would lead to sex. She seemed open to that idea. Better still, Helen and Jim, her parents and my good friends, approved enthusiastically.\n\nI was disappointed. One obstacle after another arose. Finally, Penny was offered one of those \"too good to turn down\" jobs in Portland. I was sorry that she moved to the other side of the country. I told myself that my fantasies about Penny were only fantasies and would not have become real even if Penny had stayed in the D.C. area. Still, it hurt.\n\nPenny had been gone for about a year when I was introduced to Megan Ward at a faculty cocktail party. Generally, those parties were a bore. However, those of us who had not yet made full professor religiously attended in order to schmooze the senior faculty who would decide our careers.\n\nMegan was an associate professor of art history. While she was technically on the faculty in the Department of Fine Arts, she worked jointly with some of the history faculty and one of them had invited her to this party. Although she outranked me in the faculty pecking order, I guessed (rightly I later learned) that Megan was five or six years younger than me. She was about five foot five, had reddish-brown hair to her shoulders, and had an intelligent face that grew beautiful the longer you looked at it. She was not fat, but I could not tell anything else about her body because she was wearing one of those loose-fitting \"peasant\" style dresses that covered her from the base of her neck to her ankles.\n\nMegan had spent some time with an artist's group on Vancouver Island which, she said \"was how I learned that I was more qualified to be an art historian than an artist.\" Since I had taught in the City of Vancouver, a ferry-ride away from Vancouver Island, that provided enough common ground to maintain a conversation. I discovered that Megan was very observant and had a biting wit. She very softly made some comments about a couple of the senior profs that were hysterically funny and true. Something seemed to click between us.\n\nI had been at the university for over two years and had never seen Megan Ward before that cocktail party. Afterwards, I seemed to run into her several times a week. Finally, having run into her in the History Department offices late on a Friday afternoon, I asked her if she'd like to get a drink. To my grateful surprise, she said yes and let me take her to a small pub a few blocks from campus.\n\nWe began by sharing the usual gripes that are probably shared among everyone who works in academe. That progressed into sharing a bit more of our respective life stories. It turned out that we'd both been in Heidelberg, Germany at the same time. That coincidence opened another line of conversation. Megan was easy to talk with. I hadn't paid attention to the time until I realized that it was getting dark outside.\n\n\"I'm really sorry,\" I told Megan. \"I hadn't meant to keep you here so long. I hope that I'm not making you late for anything.\"\n\n\"Harry,\" Megan responded, \"If I'd needed to be somewhere, I'd have left. No, I don't have any plans for the evening.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" I said, \"May I buy you dinner? There's a good Thai place a block over.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Megan responded. \"I love that place. Sure, I'll join you for dinner, but I'm not letting you buy for me.\" \n\nI was pleased at that, not because Megan wouldn't let me buy and not because I thought that I might get laid. I just enjoyed talking with Megan. Of course, I wouldn't have argued with getting laid. It had been a long time. However, it was very difficult for me to think of Megan as a sexual partner.\n\nThat first dinner turned into periodic dinners and drinks after work through the Fall and Winter. We became friends and started confiding in each other to an extent. I did get the sense that there were significant aspects of Megan's life that she didn't share with me. That was certainly her right. I hadn't shared with her that I frequently hung out nude with my friends Helen and Jim or that I had lusted after their daughter. I also got the sense that Megan was alone. She was often free for dinner or a trip at times when you would expect someone with a spouse or partner to be with them.\n\nSpring had come to the D.C. area. It was a Friday afternoon and Megan and I were enjoying the first outdoor drinks of the year at a table outside a bar which she favored not too far from campus.\n\n\"Harry, do you go to art exhibits?\" Megan asked.\n\n\"Not much, I'm embarrassed to confess,\" I replied.\n\n\"Some young artists whom I know are doing a show of their work Sunday,\" Megan said. \"It's in a converted warehouse over near the Anacostia. It starts at 1:00 p.m. Do you want to go?\"\n\nThat was the first time either of us had proposed doing anything together other than drinks or a casual dinner. It would be rude, I thought, to refuse. And, I wasn't doing anything that Sunday anyway. We agreed on a time and place for Megan to pick me up.\n\nThat Sunday afternoon, Megan showed up in the obligatory Subaru. I got in and she drove us across town. The warehouse, which had been rehabbed slightly and converted into artists' studios and an exhibition space, was in a marginal part of the city. \"I hope my car will be ok,\" Megan said after she'd parked. Looking around, I thought that she had some legitimate reason for concern.\n\nThere were about a dozen artists exhibiting. The works were primarily paintings, sketches, or sculpture. A lot of it left me cold. Maybe I just didn't get it. However, Megan studied almost every work closely. It seemed that she knew most of the artists.\n\nThe artist whose works we viewed last was named Evan Macombe. He greeted Megan more warmly than the other artists had. At first glance, Macombe's works seemed very traditional: landscapes and portraits. However, if you looked more closely, each piece had some twist that made it edgy. After we had thoroughly examined the works Evan had displayed prominently, we started to leave. Evan stopped us. Speaking to Megan, he said, \"Aren't you going to let your friend see our collaborations?\" \n\nI didn't realize that Megan still made art. I glanced at her. She bit her lower lip for a moment. Finally, she exhaled and said, \"If we must.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Evan exclaimed. \"Follow me.\" With an exaggerated swing of his hips that reinforced my initial impression that Evan was probably gay, he led us to the other side of the screen on which the works we'd already seen were hung. Another set of paintings hung on the back side. Visitors to the exhibition didn't see these pieces as they casually walked by. You had to seek them out.\n\nLooking at the works, I quickly understood why they were not featured prominently. The first piece depicted a nude woman standing in front of a frame shaped like the letter \"X.\" The woman's wrists and ankles were strapped to the arms of the frame. The woman appeared to be very beautiful, with full breasts, a flat stomach, and short but elegant legs. In the painting, the woman's hair had fallen over her face. Other pieces showed what I took to be the same model nude in the woods, spread-eagled with her arms and legs tied to tree branches. Another showed her nude in the surf on a beach. In each picture, the model's face was obscured somehow.\n\nThe last picture was almost photographic in its realism. The model was nude again, lying on her back on a white background. The perspective of the picture was from above the model. Her legs were spread and one of her hands was between her legs. One of her fingers was in her own vagina. This picture was unlike the others in that the model's face was clearly visible and bore an expression of pleasure. I turned to look at Megan standing next to me.\n\nMegan was blushing. \"Evan was nice enough to let me orgasm before he ended that pose,\" she said with some embarrassment.\n\nEvan added, \"I'm not really into women, but isn't Megan beautiful when she's naked?\"\n\nLooking at Megan, I said, \"It is a very beautiful picture of a very beautiful woman. All of these pictures are wonderful.\" Megan looked at me for a moment. She started to say something but stopped herself. She turned and started walking away. I followed Megan out of the warehouse.\n\nWhen we reached Megan's car, still with all four wheels, she stopped, turned to face me, and said, \"Harry, it never crossed my mind that Evan would include those pieces in the exhibition. I'm very sorry that you saw those.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, those poses aren't the sort of thing a respectable university professor does,\" Megan replied. \"Images of bondage and masturbation? You must think I'm a dirty slut.\"\n\n\"Megan, I know better than that,\" I replied. \"Yes, I'm surprised to see you in those poses, but it makes me think more highly of you, not less. Not only are you intelligent and charming, you are also adventurous and extremely beautiful.\"\n\nMegan just looked at me for a moment before getting into her car. I got in the passenger seat. In a small voice, Megan asked, \"Do you want to get something to eat?\"\n\n\"With you? I'd love to,\" I answered.\n\nWe went to an Italian place Megan knew in the northwest, near the Maryland line. Apart from ordering, Megan didn't say much. She did quickly down two glass of chianti. I had the sense that Megan had something she wanted to say, so I kept my mouth shut. Finally, Megan said tentatively, \"I think that I ought to explain.\"\n\n\"No explanation is necessary,\" I interjected.\n\n\"Harry be quiet and listen to me,\" Megan said softly. \"The artists' colony outside of Victoria that I told you about. They were into some other things besides art. It got kinky. I discovered that I enjoyed being tied up and exposed naked. Some of the men there assumed that I'd also enjoy pain, beatings and whippings. I don't enjoy pain. I got hurt, not permanently thank God, but that caused me to get out of there. Ever since, when I meet a man, part of me believes that he wants to beat me or whip me. That's why I dress the way I do and work at being unattractive. But, I'm also a very sexual person. Posing for Evan has been my sexual outlet. Evan's safe because he's gay. For him, I'm just an object to depict, not a woman to do things to.\"\n\nI felt like I'd fallen into a pit and didn't know how to get out. I realized that I liked Megan very much. The pictures showed me her sexual side which was exciting, and she was painfully beautiful. I wanted to be around this woman. I didn't want to scare her off or contribute to whatever issues she had. At the same time, I didn't think that I could just ignore what she'd told me, obviously at some cost to herself. \"Megan,\" I said looking her straight in the eyes, \"when I first met you, I realized that you are a very special person. Those pictures simply showed me that you're also an exceptionally beautiful and sexy woman. That anyone would want to mar that beauty or cause you pain is incomprehensible to me.\" \n\nMegan didn't say anything for a minute. Then, she reached out a hand and placed it gently on top of my hand on the table. \"Thank you, Harry,\" she said. \"I believe you.\" She removed her hand and dug her I-phone out of the small purse she carried. She looked at something on her phone and then asked, \"Are you doing anything Saturday?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" I replied. \"Why?\"\n\nMegan smiled for the first time since I'd seen Evan's pictures of her. \"I want to take you on a picnic.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\nI didn't see Megan all week, but she called me on Friday afternoon to confirm that we were still meeting the next morning for our picnic. \"What can I bring?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just yourself,\" Megan replied. \"I'll take care of everything else.\"\n\nMegan's Subaru appeared outside my apartment building at 8: 30 the next morning. I got in and she drove us into Maryland. It took a couple of hours to get clear of the city sprawl. Even so, as she drove us down a narrow two-lane road, I was surprised to be in such a bucolic setting that close to D.C.\n\nMegan turned into a gravel driveway that led to a brick farmhouse which, I guessed, had been there during the Civil War. When Megan stopped the car, she told me, \"Just stay in the car.\" She got out and the door to the house opened as Megan approached. I saw a heavyset, older woman standing in the doorframe. She and Megan talked for three or four minutes. Megan gave the woman a hug, turned, and came back to the car. She turned the car around and went back out onto the two-lane. We drove a half to three quarters of a mile before Megan pulled off the road and parked in the grass. The land sloped down gently from the road to a mowed field. Perhaps a quarter of a mile from the road was a stream and the start of the tree line. To my right, I could still see the farmhouse we'd stopped at.\n\nMegan pulled a sheet out of the back seat and opened the trunk. \"If you'll get the cooler,\" she said, \"I'll carry the picnic basket.\" I picked up the cooler and followed Megan through the mowed field. She was wearing one of her long peasant dresses, which struck me as an odd choice for a picnic in a field. Megan stopped at the tree line and spread out the sheet. I could still see her car and the farmhouse clearly. \n\nMegan directed me to set the cooler in the shade of a tree. She placed the picnic basket on the sheet. She stood still for a moment, looking at me. Then she took a deep breath, said \"ok,\" bent down, and grabbed the hem of her dress. Megan straightened up and pulled the dress over her head. She was nude underneath. She rolled the dress into a ball and tossed it on the sheet. \"Harry, please take your clothes off,\" she said.\n\nWe could be seen from the road and from the farmhouse. Nonetheless, I complied with Megan's request, kicking off my shoes, pulling my polo shirt over my head, and dropping my jeans and boxers. I stood naked, facing an equally naked Megan. \"You have a nice body,\" Megan said.\n\n\"You are incredibly beautiful,\" I said.\n\nMegan extended her hand and said, \"Want to take a walk?\" I took her hand and we splashed across the shallow stream into the woods.\n\nIt was turning into a hot day, but it was considerably cooler in the woods. We followed a path that was just wide enough for us to walk side-by-side. As we walked, Megan explained, \"This land belongs to Robbie and Dave Pfeiffer. Robbie is the woman I spoke with at the farmhouse. I had their daughter Janell as a student a few years ago and got to know them. They let me come out here to go naked in their field and woods. Dave probably gets off on watching me, but he's a nice man and who cares?\"\n\n\"That is very nice of them,\" I said.\n\nWe walked quite a way. As we came out of the woods, there was a fence and horses on the other side of the fence. \"I don't know who owns that land or the horses,\" Megan said. \"The horses are always here. I usually come over and pet them. They seem to like me naked.\" Indeed, three horses had their heads over the fence top vying for Megan's attention.\n\n\"I can understand the attraction,\" I said.\n\nMegan laughed. \"Do you like me naked?\" she asked.\n\n\"Very much,\" I answered.\n\n\"Good,\" Megan said. \"I like you naked too.\" \n\n\"I'm glad of that,\" I said and meant it.\n\nAs we walked back through the woods, Megan asked, \"So, is this your first time running around naked outside?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" I replied.\n\n\"Oh? Do tell,\" Megan said.\n\nI explained about college, about the nude beach near where I'd worked in Vancouver, and about my friends Helen and Jim. \"I heard about that beach but never got there,\" Megan said. \"Helen? Would that be Helen Warner?\" Megan asked. Helen was a full professor at the university.\n\n\"The same,\" I replied. \"Do you know her?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" Megan said. \"I've met her. I wouldn't have guessed that she's a nudist.\"\n\n\"Pretty committed,\" I said. \"She and Jim have an inground pool behind their house. Any sort of clothing is absolutely prohibited in the pool.\"\n\n\"That's a sensible policy,\" Megan said.\n\n\"We could visit them if you like,\" I said.\n\nMegan smiled. \"That'd be nice,\" she said.\n\nWe sat naked on the sheet eating cheese and sausage, drinking wine, and talking. Occasionally, a car would pass on the road, but no one stopped. It was a very, very nice day. It was probably approaching 6:00 p.m. when Megan said, \"I guess it's time to fight the traffic back into the city.\" She reached for her dress and stood up. She started to put the dress on but stopped. I saw a smile grow on her face. \"Do you want to drive back to town naked?\" she asked. \"I've never done that before.\"\n\nI smiled. I really liked this woman. \"Sure,\" I said, \"Just don't get pulled over.\"\n\n\"I think I can handle that,\" Megan said with a grin. We gathered our clothes and the picnic things. I followed Megan's beautiful bare ass back across the field. We stood naked on the roadside as we put the things back into her car. The ride back into the city seemed shorter than the trip out. Perhaps that was because I spent the time looking at Megan's gorgeous bare body in profile.\n\nBack in D.C., Megan was clearly not driving back to my apartment. I just went with it. Finally, she pulled up in front of a garage door in a row of relatively new townhomes not far from the university. Megan pushed on a garage door opener and pulled inside. \"I live here,\" she said. \"Come on up.\"\n\nTaking only her purse, Megan got out of the car. I followed her up a short set of steps and through a door that led into a kitchen. Megan spread her bare arms out. \"Welcome to my place,\" she said smiling. \"Let me show you around.\"\n\nIt was a very nice, two level town home. There was a kitchen/dining room, small study, and living room on the first floor. On one wall of the living room were several framed photographs of a younger Megan outdoors in the nude. She saw me looking at them. \"You understand why I don't invite many people over?\" she asked rhetorically. \"I realize that it's a bit narcissistic to have nude pictures of myself up, but those were taken during one of my happy times and they remind me of then.\"\n\n\"You've always been very beautiful,\" I said.\n\n\"With my clothes off? I guess so,\" Megan responded. She stepped over to me and put her hands on my bare shoulders. She stared into my eyes. Much more seriously, she said, \"Harry, I'm taking a huge chance with you. I'm going to be a little scared. Can you accept that?\"\n\nI put my arms around Megan and gently pulled her to me. \"I'll do everything I can so that you never regret it,\" I said.\n\nMegan leaned her bare breasts into my chest. She tilted her head up and kissed me, once quickly. \"Want to go upstairs and find out how well our bodies play with each other?\" she asked.\n\n\"Very much,\" I said.\n\nIn her bedroom, we had a much longer kiss. Megan started stroking my dick. I put a hand between her legs to finger her. Megan tensed for a second before relaxing and allowing my finger to reach her clit. We played with each other for several minutes until I was very hard.\n\n\"On the bed on your back Stone,\" Megan said. \"I like to be on top.\"\n\nI lay on my back on the bed. Megan straddled me. She looked down at me and said, \"If you're smart, about now you're wondering whether I'm on birth control or have an STD. I'm not telling you. You'll have to trust me on those.\"\n\nI looked into Megan's bright eyes. \"I trust you,\" I said.",
        "Megan started to lower herself down on to me. As the head of my dick touched her pussy lips, she tensed and stopped. She took a very deep breath then lowered herself down and my dick slid inside of her. Megan rode me in a sitting position for a while and I massaged her nipples. As her breathing sped up, I put my arms behind her and gently pulled her down so that I could kiss her. We quickly had our tongues in each other's mouths. I started pushing my pelvis harder. Surprisingly, since this was our first time together, we were perfectly in sync.\n\nMegan finally broke our kiss and leaned back slightly so we could see each other's complete faces. Between heavy breaths, she said, \"Do . . . you . . . know . . . how . . . long . . . it's . . . been . . . since . . . I've . . . been . . . fucked? Oh shit! Oh God! OH GOD!!\" Megan made a guttural moan as she came. Her face looked exquisite. She gulped air. I kept trying to push.\n\nAfter a few seconds, Megan asked urgently, \"Harry, where are you?\"\n\n\"Almost,\" I said.\n\n\"Please come in me, now!\" Megan begged. A few seconds later I did. It had been a while since I'd had sex too. Still, I think I remembered most of my trysts. That night with Megan was, by far, the best. \n\nMegan lay on top of me with my dick in her for a long time. I gently stroked her back. After a time, I moved my hands to her ass. I hadn't seen any blemishes on Megan's ass, but I felt a line of raised, hard flesh where her right cheek met the back of her thigh. \"My souvenir of being whipped,\" Megan said quietly.\n\n\"Never again,\" I said.\n\n\"Harry, I believe you,\" Megan replied.\n\nAt Megan's suggestion, we spent the next several hours exploring every inch of each other's bodies. Megan's scar, when I saw it, looked nasty. It must have bled and hurt like hell. Even with the scar, Megan Ward was an extremely beautiful, sexy, desirable woman.\n\nWe fucked again, very slowly, in the wee hours of that Sunday morning and then went to sleep. Megan held onto me very tightly all night, even while she was asleep.\n\nLate the next morning, we were sitting naked in Megan's kitchen having coffee. \"Harry,\" Megan said, \"can I run an idea by you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I replied.\n\n\"You remember that I told you a week ago that I enjoy being tied up naked and exposed?\" Megan asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"You've seen some of the pictures Evan has done of me naked and tied.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Megan said hesitantly, \"Evan wants to do a picture with me tied up with a naked guy. I've kept saying no because I didn't know any guys I'd want to be tied with. Would you pose that way with me?\"\n\nI thought this was another huge step for Megan. \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't you want to think about it?\" Megan asked.\n\n\"Being tied up naked with you? What's to think about?\" I replied. Megan smiled.\n\nWe were back at the warehouse near the Anacostia River the next Thursday night. Megan and I were naked in Evan's studio. Evan was fully clothed. The fourth person in the room was Al, a large, muscular man who was bare from the waist up. He would do the tying.\n\n\"Ok,\" Evan said, \"Megan, to get ready for the pose, I need you to give Harry a hardon, or I can do that if you prefer.\" \n\n\"No offense Evan,\" I said, \"but I'd prefer that Megan do that.\"\n\n\"Thought so,\" Evan pouted.\n\nMegan giggled and took my dick in her hands. When I was hard, Evan said, \"Harry, I need you to put that gorgeous dick in Megan's cute cunt.\" Megan smiled. We embraced. She spread her legs and I slid into her. We were both standing. \"Al,\" Evan said. \n\nAl took his time tying Megan and me together. He basically wrapped rope around our calves and thighs to mid-thigh. He roped our chests together tightly. Then, he instructed us to each put our hands on the other's ass and he tied our hands in place. If it had been with anyone other than Megan, it would have been very uncomfortable.\n\nI had been told that Evan did his work by sketching his models in their poses and taking photos and doing the painting later at his leisure. As Evan walked around the two of us, he said, \"I think I can get several pictures out of this.\" He got on the floor on his back with his sketch pad and wiggled his way between our legs so that he was looking up at my dick in Megan's pussy. Evan drew for a long time. He then asked Al to hand him a camera and he took several pictures. Evan got off the floor and repeated that process from several different perspectives. Megan and I were tied together in coitus for over two hours. When Al finally untied us, we both ran across the warehouse to the single bathroom without bothering to dress.\n\nIn the car going home, Megan said something that made me both happy and sad. \"Harry,\" she said, \"I really enjoyed that. Being naked with you just feels right and being tied to you made me feel truly safe for the first time in a very long time.\"\n\nThat Saturday was hot and humid. I took Megan to Helen's and Jim's. Helen met us at their front door nude. I glanced over my shoulder at their neighbor across the street who was working in his front yard. Helen said, \"Everyone in the neighborhood had seen me nude and, Harry, you know damn sure that I don't mind. Come on inside. Let's get those clothes off the two of you.\"\n\nI introduced Megan to Helen. We undressed and went out back to the pool. I introduced Megan to Jim, who offered us each a beer. The four of us spent the afternoon in our birthday suits swimming, sunning, drinking, and talking. As the sun went down, Jim fired his grill and made burgers. He put an apron on for that. At one point during dinner, Helen and Jim both went inside. Megan softly said to me, \"I love your friends. Do you think they like me?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" I replied.\n\nWhen Helen came back out, she dropped a small bombshell. \"Harry, I haven't told you, Penny's coming back to D.C.\"\n\nTo Megan, I explained \"Penny is Helen's and Jim's daughter.\" To Helen, I asked, \"What happened to the dream job?\"\n\n\"Her position was funded in part by the Feds, part by the State, and part by the City of Portland,\" Helen said. \"Both the Feds and Portland have cut that funding. Ergo, no more job.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" I said.\n\n\"Really?\" Helen asked sarcastically. \"You'll enjoy having Penny back. Maybe the two of you can finally do that show she's talked about.\"\n\n\"What show?\" Megan asked.\n\nBefore I could stop her, Helen explained how Penny had stripped naked onstage in front of a live audience while talking her way through the experience. She added that Penny had talked to me about doing a similar show in which both Penny and I would undress. I was interested in doing that at the time because I was interested in Penny. With Megan in my life, I was much less interested. That the subject had revived put me in a spot, I thought, where I was liable to seriously piss off Megan, Penny, Helen, and Jim.\n\nBefore I could say something like 'that was then, this is now,' Megan said, \"That sounds like great fun Harry. You should do it. I'd watch.\"\n\n\"Maybe you could join in,\" I said.\n\n\"I'd love that,\" Megan replied. To Helen and Jim, Megan said, \"Harry understandably hasn't told you, but I'm something of an exhibitionist. I love it when people see me naked. So far, I've only modeled for an artist. Standing naked in front of a clothed audience with Harry would be a whole new thrill.\"\n\nHelen laughed. \"Penny loves to be seen too,\" she said. \"Two women undressing themselves and then undressing a man. That has possibilities. Jim, don't let me forget to mention that to Penny next time I talk to her.\"\n\n\"When is Penny coming back?\" I asked.\n\n\"In two weeks,\" Jim replied. \"She has a few things to wrap up out there.\"\n\nHelen got up and sat down next to Jim. \"Would you get naked onstage Dear?\"\n\n\"Not if that's all I got to do,\" Jim replied. \"The thing I fantasize about doing in front of an audience is fucking you.\"\n\nHelen laughed. \"That would get us arrested.\"\n\nJim reached out his hand and began stroking Helen's left nipple. \"We've got an audience right here,\" Jim said. \"Do you guys mind?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Megan answered. \n\nHelen reached down and started stroking Jim's dick. Jim put his other hand between Helen's legs. I saw Jim work a finger into Helen. \"That feels good,\" Helen said. Looking at me, Helen said, \"You haven't seen us fuck since college.\"\n\nMegan looked at me with a questioning smile. \"We were very good friends,\" I said.\n\n\"I wish I'd had friends like that,\" Megan said.\n\n\"You do,\" Jim said. \"Once Helen and I are done, we'd be happy to watch you and Harry.\" Megan put a hand on my dick and smiled.\n\nJim pulled a cushion off one of the lounge chairs and dropped it on the concrete. Smiling, Helen lay on the cushion on her back and spread her legs. Jim mounted her and began to make love to her.\n\nHelen and Jim had been very good friends of mine since college. Additionally, Helen was still a very attractive woman. It was heartwarming and arousing to watch my two dear friends. I don't know whether Megan shared the heartwarming emotion but, looking at her, I could tell that she was aroused by watching Helen and Jim fuck. Megan and I played with each other more intensely the longer Helen and Jim went at it.\n\nAfter what seemed to be a long time, Helen let out a loud \"OH!\" followed a few seconds later with \"God that was good.\" At the same time, Jim let out two loud grunts. Although their hips had stopped moving, Jim stayed on top of Helen for several more minutes while the couple kissed.\n\nJim finally got off Helen and helped her stand up. Jim's still partially hard dick was glistening with Helen's juices and some of Jim's come was running down Helen's thigh. They both looked very happy.\n\nMegan said, \"That was beautiful.\"\n\nJim jovially said, \"Well, now it's your turn. I guess you'll want a fresh cushion.\" He pulled the cushion from another lounge chair and put it on the concrete. \n\nMegan looked at me. She smiled, stood up, and extended her hand to me. I took it and she led me to the cushion. Megan said, \"On your back Harry.\" I lay down on the cushion. I was already hard from watching Helen and Jim and from Megan playing with me. I knew from playing with her that Megan was already very wet. Megan straddled me and, with no hesitation this time, lowered herself down until my dick was as far into her as it could go. Being in Megan felt fantastic. Of course, it always did (and still does). Megan began moving up and down on me as I fondled her tits.\n\nMegan rode me at a moderate pace. I guess she wanted to give Helen and Jim plenty of time to watch us. They were standing a couple of feet away from us, holding hands. This may sound perverted, but I was actually very pleased that my best friends were seeing me have sex with the woman I had fallen in love with. From the look on Megan's face, I inferred that she was also enjoying having an audience.\n\nAfter quite a while, Megan lay completely on top of me and started humping me faster. As we kissed, I used my legs, hips, and back to push into her. As always seemed to be the case, we immediately found a shared rhythm. As our fucking got more intense, I forgot about Helen and Jim. My focus narrowed to the wonderful sensations Megan was causing and trying to do the same for her.\n\nI could feel it coming but exploded inside Megan much harder than I'd expected. My vision got blurry for a moment. As I finished, Megan shuddered and yelled \"Ah, Ah, Oh GOOOOOOOOD!\" Then, her body relaxed except for her very hard breathing. I held her tight. After her breathing slowed, we had another very long kiss.\n\nMegan finally got up and helped me up. Helen and Jim were smiling. \"Good?\" Helen asked.\n\n\"Fantastic!\" Megan replied.\n\n\"Thank you for letting us watch,\" Jim said.\n\nThe four of us cleaned up our dinners. It was late when we got done. Helen said to us, \"You have a choice: there is the guest bedroom, or you can sleep with Jim and me.\"\n\nMegan said to me, \"Can we sleep with them?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I responded.\n\nBefore we went to bed, Megan took me into the bathroom. She sat on the toilet and started pissing. Looking up at me, she said, \"Harry, I had sex in front of two people I just met this afternoon! I couldn't have done that without you. I feel so safe and comfortable with you that I can do anything.\" I appreciated that fucking in front of Helen and Jim was another huge step for Megan. I was gratified that I was helping her become comfortable acting out her sexuality, especially since I got so much pleasure with her.\n\nMegan stood up, flushed, and raised the toilet seat. \"Your turn,\" she said. Megan had a comforting effect on me as well. Ordinarily, I absolutely cannot piss if someone's watching. Megan was watching me that night and I had no trouble at all.\n\nPenny's welcome home to D.C. was spread over a weekend. Her many friends had rented out the back room of a Georgetown bar on Friday evening for the main, clothed, event. Helen, Jim, Megan, and I were invited, and we went together. The room was already packed when we got there. I saw Penny across the room. She was still very beautiful. When she saw me, she elbowed her way through her friends and gave me a tight hug and a kiss.\n\nHelen introduced Megan to Penny as my girlfriend. That produced a visible reaction. After a moment, Penny looked at me and asked, \"So, she's the one you are gaga about?\"\n\n\"Gaga?\" I said.\n\nPenny laughed. \"That's what Mom tells me.\" To Megan, Penny said, \"Come on. Let me get you a drink. I'd like to talk.\" Penny led Megan away through the crowd.\n\nHelen, Jim, and I were over twenty years older than most of Penny's friends. Helen and Jim knew several of them and I'd met a few when Penny did her performance a few years back. However, Helen, Jim, and I stayed together most of the evening. I could see Megan and Penny talking with each other for a very long time. That concerned me, but I saw the two women laughing together more than once. On the drive back to Megan's townhouse that night, she said, \"I really like Penny. I think she's a kindred spirit.\"\n\nThe second phase of Penny's welcome home was much more intimate. Megan and I were invited to Helen's and Jim's the next afternoon for another cookout. Megan and I went to the store that morning. As we walked through the aisles, I said, \"I feel like we ought to at least bring Penny a bottle of wine, but I don't know what she likes.\"\n\n\"Malbec,\" Megan responded with a small smile. \"It's on the list.\"\n\nPenny met us at the door of her parents' house that afternoon. She was, of course, nude. Her first words to us were, \"Let's get you guys undressed.\" Megan and I took off our clothes in the foyer. Penny took a step back and looked Megan's bare body up and down. \"God girl, you are gorgeous,\" Penny said. She gave Megan a bare hug that lasted a couple of minutes. Penny then turned to me and looked me up and down. \"You still look great Harry,\" she said. She gave me a long hug and a long kiss.\n\nPenny, Helen, Jim, Megan, and I spent the rest of the day nude by the pool. We swam, sunned, drank, and talked. Penny gave us a detailed account of her time in Portland. She didn't seem disappointed to be back in D.C. As the sun set, Jim fired his grill, cooking steaks in honor of the occasion (I wish I had his talent with a grill). Helen produced some delicious sides and more wine was poured. I noticed that Megan wasn't drinking much and paced myself accordingly.\n\nAfter dinner, Jim, who had drunk a bit, said, \"You know, there was a time, before she went to Portland, when we were hoping Penny and Harry would hook up.\" I was not pleased that the conversation was taking this direction.\n\nPenny added, \"I know that I was the one who ran away to Portland. It was a great job, but I also wanted to get away from the situation. I wasn't sure about falling for an older man who is my parents' best friend. That just seemed too weird at the time. I decided to come back instead of finding another job out there, in part, because I hoped that Harry was free or that I could steal him from whomever he'd hooked up with. Well, I can see that isn't going to happen.\"\n\nMegan's response floored me. \"I can share,\" Megan said sweetly, \"but only with you.\" Penny smiled as did Helen and Jim. I didn't know what to think.\n\nI was surprised again when Megan insisted that we leave around 9:00 p.m. I had assumed that we'd stay over again. As we went out the front door, Megan said to Penny, \"Nine o'clock ok?\"\n\nPenny replied, \"Great. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nWalking to the car, I asked Megan \"What was that about?\"\n\nMegan smiled. \"We're taking Penny on a picnic tomorrow.\" Megan spent a couple of hours that night at making sandwiches and sides. I tried to help. \n\nIt was a little before noon the next day when Megan parked her car in the grass between the road and the Pfeiffers' field. As we got out, Megan said, \"This road doesn't get much traffic. We can undress here and leave our clothes in the car.\" Megan, Penny, and I stripped naked on the roadside. We gathered the things for the picnic and walked nude through the field. Mr. Pfeiffer was on his tractor mowing maybe 200 yards away. He waved at us. Megan waved back. We put the picnic things on the ground in the shade beside the stream. The path through the woods was too narrow, so I walked behind Megan and Penny.\n\nSome description is in order. Megan and Penny are both, in my opinion, extraordinarily beautiful women. They're both extraordinary people as well. Penny is taller than Megan with long, elegant legs. Penny is a woman whom everyone notices when she walks into a room. Part of that is her beauty, part of that is her height, and part is the confidence which she exudes. While she's classy about it, Penny dresses in ways that flatter her. Her long, light brown hair is always slightly styled.\n\nMegan had, during most of the time I'd known her, tried to blend into the background. You had to take the time to look at Megan to appreciate how very beautiful she was (and is). She is shorter than Penny but has larger breasts. While she kept her reddish-brown hair cut, she didn't do anything else with it back then. The flowing peasant dresses she usually wore gave no hint of the exceptional body they covered. Following the two women that day, I realized that, while Megan's ass was a bit wider than Penny's, both women had asses that were tight, perfectly shaped, and, well, just perfect.\n\nWhen we got through the woods to the fence, the horses didn't seem as impressed with Penny as I am. As they had before, they crowded at the fence in front of Megan trying to get her to pet their heads. Penny and I stood side-by-side watching.\n\nLater, the three of us sat nude in the shade eating the food Megan had made and sipping wine. Penny asked how Megan and I had met and how we'd formed a relationship. Megan explained her history, particularly at the artists' colony. Megan stood, turned around, and bent over so Penny could see the scar at the base of Megan's right ass cheek.\n\n. \"You are so beautiful,\" Penny said. \"It's criminal that someone did that to you. I can understand why you'd be withdrawn from men.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Megan said, \"I've spent years basically scared of heterosexual men. It's irrational, but I believed they all wanted to hit me or whip me. Part of me still feels that way, but I never had that feeling about Harry. From the moment I first met him, something said to me, 'you can trust this man.' I've always told Harry that I didn't expect Evan to have those pictures of me on display at his exhibition. I wonder whether that's true or whether I hoped that they'd be there, and Harry would see them. I wonder if that was my way to inject sex because I was too scared to just tell him that I wanted a sexual relationship. I was truly scared that he'd react badly to pictures of me tied up naked or masturbating.\"\n\nPenny laughed. \"I bet Harry loved them,\" she said.",
        "Megan laughed too. \"He's been extremely supportive. He even agreed to be tied up with me for another of Evan's pictures.\"\n\n\"Nude?\" Penny asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Megan replied. \"Harry slid his dick into me and then a friend of Evan's tied us up that way. Evan made sketches and took pictures.\"\n\n\"Cool!\" Penny exclaimed. \"That would be so hot to do!\"\n\n\"I'll make sure that you see the final picture,\" Megan said. \"Now, what about this show you want to do?\"\n\nPenny explained about the show she had done by herself about three years ago in which she stripped naked and exposed herself in front of a full theater. Megan had already heard about it from me and from Helen and Jim, but she listened attentively. Penny concluded, \"After the show, Harry told me that it was a fantasy of his to be nude onstage in front of an audience, and some theater friends of mine were encouraging me to do it again, so I thought Harry and I could do the show together. We never brought it off, though. Then I moved to Portland.\"\n\n\"I think it's a great idea,\" Megan said. She paused for a moment, thinking. Then she brightened. \"Can I be in it too?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Penny said. \"That means you want us to do it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, so long as I'm nude onstage too,\" Megan replied.\n\n\"Two women and one man, that could be interesting,\" Penny said. \"Are you up for it Harry?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\"But,\" Megan added, \"I think we need to do more than just undress. From what I've heard about your solo show, it worked because of your obvious enthusiasm about undressing and showing yourself in front of an audience. You will never have that 'first time' enthusiasm again. I think we'll need to be sexier to be interesting. You know, touching each other, talking about sex.\"\n\n\"I see your point,\" Penny said. \"The problem is to avoid getting busted. Maybe if the audience was invitation only. I'll see if my theater friends have any ideas and, maybe, talk to a lawyer.\"\n\n\"Let's just make sure that we really do it,\" Megan said. \"I'm getting excited just imaging it.\"\n\nIt was dusk when we picked up our things and walked back across the field and up the embankment to Megan's car. Of course, none of us dressed for the drive back into the city. It seemed equally natural that we went directly to Megan's townhouse. Inside, we showed Penny around and she admired the nude photos of Megan on the wall. We were standing in the living room when Megan came up to me, took both of my hands in hers, and asked, \"Do you want to see how well Penny's body fits with ours?\" \n\nWhen I had first met my best friends' daughter a few years ago, I had wanted to have sex with her. I finally did that night. I fucked Penny doggy style in Megan's bedroom while Penny went down on the woman I love."
