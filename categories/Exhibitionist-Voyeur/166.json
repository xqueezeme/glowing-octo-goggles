        "This is a story about sexual exploration and, open relationships. Open relationships can and do happily exist; but they are not for everyone. If you do not believe it is at all possible for open relationships to exist without damage to any and all involved parties, please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time reading this.\n\nStandard disclaimer\u2014this story takes place in a world where STDs don't exist and only babies planned for and wanted do\u2014in other words, a fantasy world. Any resemblance to real-life people is purely coincidental. \n\n*****\n\nGwen hurried from the mall after her purchase. She was fortunate to have been carrying enough cash to pay for the teddy and the robe; the Lady had stopped her as she had reached for her credit card with an angry reminder that the name on it would identify her as the deviant who had put on the lewd display in the dressing room. That poor, young, innocent clerk, she nattered. You probably scarred her for life.\n\nShe works in a lingerie shop and volunteered to take a look-see, the Slut countered. And if she's so innocent, why is she putting on shows for her boyfriend? Gwen managed to push their bickering aside and enjoy the adrenaline rush of her dressing room escapades and purchase. She arrived home shortly before the first truck did, with just enough time to stash the bag in KD's closet. \n\nThe trucks came back, were unloaded and the employees left. Gwen had dinner waiting for her husband, and they climbed the hill afterwards for a short soak in the hot tub. They had worn robes out into the cool evening air, more for comfort than modesty, and enjoyed the spa as they had come to use the pool\u2014gloriously naked. The couple did not bother to dress again after they had returned to the house for a little TV, and fell asleep that night in each other's arms. \n\nThe Slut chided her the next morning for not taking her bull by the balls the night before and getting the sexual relief she had desired. Tim had not shown any apparent interest in a romantic interlude, Gwen's nudity in the spa and their bed not enough to get more than a twitch out of his flaccid length. He was tired, give the poor man a break from your sexual perversions, the Lady had advised, but the Slut was convinced that thing between his legs would have come to attention with just a few kisses. \n\nToo late now, Gwen sighed as she sorted invoices. Maybe he won't be so tired tonight. \n\nOr maybe he'll be exhausted, the Slut countered. Why take a chance? Take care of business now, and there's nothing that says you have to close the bank if he wants to make a deposit later. \n\nYou've got work to do, the Lady warned even as Gwen rose from her desk and headed for the house. Maybe just a quick one, to hold me over until later, no different than a snack before dinner. \n\nShe was standing naked by the bed a few moments later, amused by how casual the act of grabbing the two large penises and putting them within easy reach had become. Gwen had come a long way since the first time she had gingerly removed that menacing rubber log from its packaging. \n\nShe lay down and let her hands travel up and down her body as sexual thoughts filled her mind. Images of men, naked men, came more easily to her without Tim watching her, and the now-familiar scenario of being on display for a group showing their appreciation played on in her imagination. \n\nGwen's free hand made its way between her legs, a finger dipping into her opening to retrieve some moisture and spread it between her lips. She withdrew it and lightly caressed the skin below her opening, her rosebud so close. I never knew they even had toys designed for back there, she thought, taking a moment away from the show she was putting on for the collection of engorged penises in her fantasy. Dorothy had presented them so matter-of-factly. I guess some people must find it pleasurable...her finger pushed deeper, across the crinkled muscle. But I still don't see how it could relax enough to put anything up there. Natalie's finger was inside, the Slut reminded her, and it didn't hurt at all. That's true, Gwen agreed, remembering her shock at the invasion, but no pain or displeasure. Her finger did its best to center on the muscle in the hopes of testing its willingness to relax, but her weight against the mattress and the comforter below prevented easy access. Gwen raised her head from the pillow and looked about, instinctively checking for prying eyes. Satisfied, she rolled on to her stomach and got up on all fours, pointing her rear end towards the doorway and walking her knees away from each other. The naked woman reached a hand back between her spread legs and slid a finger up and across the skin now above her sex, into the widened gap between her buttocks and on to her rosebud. Gwen found the handstand she was doing annoying and gently lowered her shoulders until her head again lay nestled in the pillow. Her finger circled the muscle, teasing, tingling the nerve endings and daring the owner to push. Gwen accepted the challenge, trying to relax as she initially met resistance, then slid through up to her first knuckle. It felt much the same way Natalie's had, only nastier, and she was surprised just how tightly the ring gripped her finger as the little muscle reflexively tightened.\n\nThis would be a very bad time for Tim to walk in right now, the Lady drily observed, to find his wife's posterior high in the air with a finger in it. The Slut disagreed. I'd think he'd find that the ultimate invitation. \n\nIt's not as unpleasant as I thought, Gwen reflected, feeling slightly ridiculous in her current pose but also feeling the stirrings of something else. On her back with her husband on top of her had always seemed like the proper way to make babies, but this sent a very different message. Presenting her bottom like this just seemed so primal, so...submissive. It was an unmistakable signal to her husband, or to any male, that she was ready and willing to be taken and used. She removed her finger and reached for the first dildo she could find. Big John, she guessed without looking as she grasped the cudgel, remembering what Dorothy had called it. It was gently placed between her lips and inserted with one slow push, her fantasy resuming with Tim behind her while the others enviously watched and stroked. \n\nShe left the giant penis lodged deeply inside her and fumbled for the rabbit, bringing it to life and up between her legs. Gwen meant to apply it to her clitoris, but her sense of sexual exploration was high, and instead it continued on until the length lay nestled between her upturned cheeks. Common sense told her it was way too big to fit \"in there\", but the vibrations against the tight little ring certainly felt good, and the aroused woman found herself wishing she had taken the older woman's efforts to sell her something for back there more seriously. Gwen's free hand moved to the rabbit's original destination, and her finger gently circled the hard nub of her clitoris. \n\nThe pose, the sense of submissive welcome for the cock inside her, the sensations on her clitoris and anus all combined to drive her to a powerful orgasm. She lay there on her side after, breathing heavily, the faux cock still lodged inside of her, the summoned guilt focused on her exceptionally perverted fascination with her anus.\n\nGwen's sexual tension was only temporarily relieved by her session with her toys, and by Thursday night knew Tim definitely needed to be involved for something a bit more fulfilling even after they had finished making love in their more traditional manner. Their routine when they awoke the next morning was unchanged from so many others before, Gwen sending her husband on ahead to the shop, promising to follow as soon as she took care of some nagging housekeeping. He smiled at his wife's need to leave no stone uncleaned and made his way across the yard still shrouded in the early morning gloom. She joined him twenty minutes later, Eric the only employee to have beaten her. \n\nGwen made the rounds to each of the crews, giving them their scheduled for the day and a list of items they would likely need to pull from the storeroom. She delivered Tim's last. \"Can you come up stairs and take a look at something before you leave?\"\n\nHe smiled but didn't look up as he arranged some PVC on the back of his truck. \"Yes ma'am, be right up.\" Mike did his best to hide his smile. Yes ma'am? Fuck was he pussywhipped. \n\nShe was standing near her desk, facing the landing, when Tim trudged up the last few steps. He looked at her and smiled. \"Whattya got for me?\"\n\nGwen didn't answer, instead looking down and beginning to work the button closest to her nearly-closed collar. He looked on in amazement, instinctively glancing behind him to ensure no one else was climbing up behind him, turning back in time to see the smooth flesh of his wife's upper chest revealed. She continued down, more skin appearing where her bra should have been, glances of something dark red in color peeking from behind the sides of her shirt as she reached her belly button. Gwen opened one side of the shirt, then the other, flashing the lacy garment barely concealing her breasts. He stepped towards her. \"For me?\"\n\n\"For you after work,\" she said quietly, starting to re-button what she had just undone even as he reached for her.\n\n\"Aww, unfair,\" he complained good-naturedly, watching her skin disappear beneath the denim. \n\n\"I thought you liked to be teased,\" Gwen asked in a low voice as her fingers worked quickly, worried that she had somehow offended him. \n\n\"Well yeah, I do,\" he replied with a grin, \"doesn't make it any easier when it's happening.\"\n\n\"You can have a better look when you get home. But right now we both have work to do.\"\n\n\"Hope I can concentrate,\" Tim replied taking her in his arms. \"You gonna wear it all day?\" \n\n\"As long as you want me to. Now shoo. Have a good day.\" \n\nHe kissed her. \"It just got better and longer. It's like Christmas Eve.\"\n\nThe trucks left soon after, Gwen hurrying up to the barn to complete her morning chores there. The teddy quickly proved itself too restrictive for strenuous activities like mucking, feeding and laying down fresh bedding. Despite her promise to Tim, she considered making the trip down to the house to change into more comfortable undergarments for the day, at least until her husband was due to return. The barn coat hanging on a peg in the tack room caught her eye and suggested another possibility\n\nGwen quickly stripped down, carefully hanging her work clothes and lingerie in place of the jacket. Ears ever alert to the sound of vehicles in the driveway, she worked in the chill morning air wearing nothing but the old coat and a pair of muck boots, the jacket being removed as well as she began to warm from the physical labor. \n\nShe returned to her slacks and shirt after finishing her chores and carried the teddy back to the office, knowing the morning parts deliveries would be arriving soon. Her lack of underwear and the idea of the cute young driver's reaction had he been let in on the secret made Gwen smile to herself as she signed for the packages. His truck was out of the driveway and she had called Alison before stripping down to nothing for the rest of the day. Her hand seemed to find its own way between her legs as she absentmindedly flipped through paperwork, and she only dressed shortly before the first truck returned. \n\nTim returned home on time, business-like as usual with the crews while Gwen collected paperwork, said her goodnights, and made her way back to the house to start dinner. He followed along shortly after, even as Cliff was pulling out of the driveway. \n\n\"How's dinner coming?\" he asked, hugging her from behind and kissing her neck. \n\n\"Just pulling things together now. \"\n\nHis hand cupped her breast as his head again bent to her throat. \"We're going to bed early tonight, right?\"\n\nGwen smiled and tilted her head to allow him better access to her neck as she concentrated on the frying pan. \"It certainly feels like we are. But would you like dinner first?\"\n\n\"I gotta unwrap it before I eat it,\" he replied, running his hand down her midsection. \"But I need a shower. I stink.\" \n\n\"I like the smell of hard work. Go ahead, I'll get dinner ready so we can spend more time relaxing after.\"\n\nShe heard the sound of his steps in the hall a short time later. \"Smells good, but it -\"he turned the corner and stopped. Gwen was still at the counter, chopping yellow squash, but her shirt and slacks were gone and only the lacy maroon teddy remained. \"Wow. Every man's dream. A beautiful woman in sexy underwear cooking dinner. Just need a beer to make this a Super Bowl commercial.\"\n\nGwen did not look up from her cutting board as she reached to her right, grabbed an open bottle, and handed it back to him. Her husband chuckled, moved behind her, and wrapped his free arm around her ribcage. \"You've become full of surprises.\" \n\nShe smiled and held the knife steady. \"Dinner?\"\n\n\"Later.\" The beer was placed back on the counter and he began to kiss her neck. One hand rested on her hip while the other, still cold from the bottle it had been holding, slid over the bare skin exposed between the two sides of the teddy and up to her lace-covered breast. His kisses moved lower, down her spine, making her shiver. \"I've been wondering what you had on all day long,\" Tim murmured as he sank lower and kissed his way to where the sides of the garment joined to cover the cleft of her buttocks. He groaned a bit as he dropped to his knees, the kisses moving lower, to the exposed skin of first her right cheek, then her left. His lips moved lower, to where the curve of her bottom flowed into her firm thigh. The direction he was moving made Gwen put the knife down and hold the counter to steady herself as she spread her legs in anticipation of his expected route. \n\nHis tongue snaked over the strip of skin between her leg and the lacy fabric running through her sex. The kisses reversed their course, Tim slowly rising as they traveled back up her spine. \n\n\"It's beautiful,\" he murmured, his hardness pressed between her ass cheeks, only her teddy and his shorts between them. His index fingers gently hooked the straps of the negligee and pulled it off her shoulders, sliding the lace down until it met the flare of her hips. He cupped her now-exposed breasts while his lips returned to her neck. Callused palms grated deliciously over her erect nipples, then continued down her body, down to where the nightie lay bunched about her waist. The tight fabric offered some resistance to being lowered further, but Tim was persistent, working it until it slid free and dropped to her ankles. \n\n\"Beautiful,\" he again murmured into her neck as a hand was planted on her mons and a finger began to push down through her valley. \"Bedroom. Now.\"\n\nGwen turned off the stove and moved the pan to a cool burner as the finger between her legs worked itself deeper. She was a little surprised he was suggesting\u2014no, ordering, the Slut preferred to believe\u2014a move to a more private spot. The naked woman had been expecting and looking forward to being bent over the counter and taken right there, next to where the vegetables were still simmering. Being lain back on the kitchen table and spread wide had its possibilities, too...Gwen didn't move right away, enjoying the feel of the body being pressed into her.\n\n\"Bedroom,\" Tim said again, this time with a gentle thrust of his hips into her rear. She led the way, just knowing her husband's eyes were on her swinging buttocks, the perverse pride in being the center of his sexual attention swelling in her.\n\nGwen crawled onto the bed and lay back, watching Tim hurriedly strip down. She smiled as in his lust-fueled haste his erection got caught in the waistband of his shorts, levering it down like the arm on a slot machine until it broke free with an audible slap against the skin below his belly button. That part of the male anatomy certainly seemed better able to take some rough handling better than what hung beneath...\n\nShe began to roll to her side in expectation of him lying beside her as he put his knee on the edge of the bed. Tim wouldn't allow it, reaching out and grabbing her ankles to stop her motion and spread her open. He smiled and began to kiss his way up her calf, up her thigh, and she closed her eyes waiting for him to get to where she knew he was going. She was not disappointed, and the drag of his tongue against the soft folds of her flesh was electrifying. Despite the anticipation of his advance, her hips twitched at the first soft swirl around her clitoris. \n\nThe contact was broken, and Gwen opened her eyes in surprise and worry. Was something wrong? She looked down between her legs, Tim grinning back at her. \"You wouldn't believe how many nasty things went through my head today, knowin' you were struttin' around the office, wearin' that.\"\n\nI was wearing less, Gwen was tempted to respond. \"Like what?\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment, deciding whether to pair action with confession. His stiff cock settled the debate. \"Told ya I like to unwrap my food before I eat it.\" Tim rose to all fours and reversed direction, Gwen's face suddenly shaded by a thigh being brought over it, a pair of heavy testicles hanging just above her lips while her thighs were pulled even wider and stubbled cheeks nuzzled between them. His oral technique was coarser and less practiced than Natalie's, the tip of his nose rubbing against the skin between her two openings as he enthusiastically licked her, and she loved every moment of it. \n\nGwen looked up at the novel view above her before delicately raising her head up enough to kiss the dangling sac and run her tongue over it. She could feel his testicles move beneath her probing. Male musk was beginning to work its way through the scent of the soap from his shower, and her cheeks warmed from the heat being generated between his legs. Her hand reached for the length poised above her throat and began to lightly scratch and stroke. \n\nThe body above her rose slightly, taking the loose sac out of the reach of her tongue. Gwen wondered if it was a sign her efforts were not being well received. The twitch of his hips made her think that perhaps he was asking for something else, something the Slut said most definitely yes to, and she levered the staff she was holding down towards her lips. His penis seemed spring-loaded, resisting the more she brought it perpendicular to his body, and she was afraid of perhaps pulling it to too far, of breaking it, but the owner didn't seem to be complaining and his body again dropped a bit at the first hint of her pursed lips welcoming him in. \n\nHer own orgasm was building, the result of a full day of gentle self-teasing followed by the demonstration of her husband's obvious desire for her. The ravishing of her sex, and the position her husband was in to deliver it, only sped up the inevitable. Gwen did her best to not clamp down on the cock held in mid-stroke between her lips as the first waves broke. \n\nHer thighs clamped around the head between them, just as they had done to Natalie, as she rocked back and forth against the probing tongue. Natalie had just seemed to know what spots to hit during Gwen's orgasm; Tim was guessing, and to Gwen it was mildly frustrating and excruciatingly wonderful to be left guessing as well. She could teach him, she thought as her senses returned; that might be fun, if she could give ever bring herself to give those kinds of directions. \n\nThe penis in her mouth began to slowly thrust again, and Gwen thought she could detect the stronger taste of his semen. She'd finish him like this, if that's what he wanted, and wondered if it would somehow be different in this position, with the sensitive underside of his tip pressed against the roof of her mouth. ",
        "The length withdrew from between her lips and the thigh brought back over. Tim moved up beside her and lay on his back, pulling Gwen on to him. \"Ride me home.\" She straddled him, reaching for his staff to insert him while he pulled her face to his in a forceful kiss. She tasted herself on his lips, a pungent reminder of her orgasm, and remembered Miss Ritter as tasting stronger. Gwen wondered what Natalie might taste like...\n\nStrong hands grasped her breasts and pushed her up into a proper riding position as soon as his manhood could be forced no deeper. Tim's hips drove her upward, reminding the equestrienne of being astride a freshly broken horse. She put her hands on his stomach to steady herself, where the reins would have been, while callused palms roughly fondled and squeezed her mounds. His eyes were shut tightly as his body took over to produce an intense orgasm. Tim's hands dropped to his wife's hips and pressed down against them as he drove himself up into her. \"Coming\u2014\"he hissed through gritted teeth. \n\n***\n\n\"Alison's coming over tomorrow morning,\" Gwen said over her shoulder as she resumed dinner preparations. \n\n\"Going riding?\" Tim asked as he set the table. \n\n\"For a little bit. We're going to have lunch and then go through the things in her room so she can decide what she wants to keep.\"\n\n\"Keep? What's that mean?\"\n\n\"I decided to turn her bedroom into a proper guest room. No need for visitors to sleep in a horse and boy-band shrine.\"\n\nTim smiled. \"So I guess that means you've given up hope she's ever coming back home?\"\n\n\"Stop that! I never wanted her to come back home. She's happily married, there would be no reason for her to come back!\n\n\"Sorry, sorry, just teasin',\" her husband offered, kissing her cheek. He knew Gwen spoke the truth\u2014she had been the momma bird, prepared to kick her fledglings out of the nest the moment she thought they were ready to fly on their own. Ali had gone from home to college to an apartment to marriage, so had never really returned to her room other than the first couple of summers during school. \"Gonna turn KD's room into one too?\"\n\n\"KD's room stays the way it is until she's out of college and settled down,\" Gwen firmly declared. \"When she doesn't need it any more, we can decide what to do with it then.\" \n\nAlison arrived shortly after breakfast the next morning, her mother and father coming out of the barn to greet her. \"No Jason?\" Tim asked, looking at the empty passenger seat.\n\n\"Getting new tires for his car, then this afternoon he's going to Mark's to watch football. He says hi.\" Mother and daughter made their way back up to the barn while Tim headed for the shop to get caught up on some needed repairs. He was gone when the women returned from their ride just before noon. \n\n\"Emergency call,\" Gwen announced as she read the note on the kitchen table, \"left about a half hour ago.\" \n\n\"Mind if we eat real quick before we get started?\" Ali asked, opening the refrigerator. \"I didn't have breakfast.\" \n\n\"No, of course not,\" Gwen replied. \"Here, let me get it.\" \n\n\"Sit down, I can do it,\" her daughter insisted as she reached for her purse and produced a tablet. \"I got some pictures of Dancer's half-sister when I was in Huntsville on business last week. Wanna see?\" Ali turned the device on and set it down in front of her mother. \n\n\"You can see the family resemblance,\" Gwen offered as she scrolled through the pictures while the young woman worked at the counter preparing a sandwich. \"Nice lines.\" She reached the end and began to swipe back to the beginning to view them again. One flick of her finger too many and she stopped on a picture of something decidedly not horseflesh. \n\nIt was a young man's naked torso in profile, or rather, a reflection of a naked torso in what appeared to be a bathroom mirror. The picture had apparently been taken by the subject himself, the flash of the camera obscuring his face. He was fit, with a muscled chest and flat stomach. Gwen's focus was further down, however, on the impressive erection beneath. It was long, longer than Tim she guessed, although perhaps not as thick, with a pair of testicles drawn up tightly below. The subject's manhood was shaved smooth, like his chest and stomach, making the almost banana-like curve of his penis even more evident. The tip of the pink head peeked out from a dark collar of loose skin. \n\n\"It sounds like she's got the same attitude as her sis\u2014\", Alison began, coming back to the table with her food. She struggled to put the plate on the table as she saw the photo her mother had stopped at. \"OH MY GOD MOM! I'm so sorry,\" the young woman screamed as she grabbed for the device. \"I forgot that was on there!\" \n\nBe the cool mom, the Slut counseled, be the cool mom. \"It's alright. You're a married woman. What you and Jason do is none of my business. It is Jason, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course it's Jason,\" her blushing daughter wailed as she fumbled for the off switch. \"He, he likes to send me pictures when he's traveling to uhh, show me how much he misses me.\" No need to tell her that he was only responding to the one I sent him first, Ali thought, hoping her mother had not scrolled any further back. \n\n\"Well, it looked like he missed you very much. He's certainly, umm, healthy.\" \n\n\"Yeah, he, uhh, certainly is,\" Alison agreed with a nervous laugh, unsure how else to reply. Gwen broke the awkward silence by getting up to make her lunch and turning the conversation back to the pictures she was supposed to have seen. \n\nThey were sorting the contents of the bedroom a half hour later, identifying what would be put into storage for the young woman's future home or children, and what could be given or thrown away. Gwen sat on the bed watching her daughter go through the contents of her dresser. \n\n\"He had a lot of extra skin.\" \n\nAlison stopped and turned to her mother. \"Huh?\"\n\nIt was Gwen's turn to blush as she looked down at the t-shirt she held. \"Jason, uhh, looked like he had a lot of extra skin...on his...thing.\"\n\n\"He's uncircumcised, Mom. That's his foreskin. Haven't you ever seen an uncircumcised one?\" \n\n\"Well no, not all puffed up like that. I just thought those slid back when...\" You are talking about foreskins with your own daughter, the Lady cried. Please stop!\n\n\"Some do, some others you have to help a little...Mom, how many 'puffed up ones' have you seen?\"\n\nGwen decided she didn't need to count those times on the beach. \"If you must know, your father is the only man I've ever been intimate with.\" True as stated, she thought uncomfortably.\n\n\"Really? Never a stable hand at the place you worked before you met Daddy, or a walk on the back nine after dark with someone from the country club?\"\n\n\"Your father is the only man I've ever been with,\" her mother repeated. \"Why? How many have you seen?\"\n\nAlison laughed and sat down next to her mother. \"I went to a large university, remember? Co-Ed dorm for three years? You sure you really want to know?\"\n\nOh God, the Lady huffed. No, we don't. Gwen smiled. \"You seemed to turn out alright despite the co-ed dorms. Yes, I'd like to know.\"\n\nAlison smiled weakly. \"Well, I saw a bunch, but maybe four...up close and personal? That includes Jason,\" She quickly added, deciding to keep the number low and only admit to those she had actually allowed between her legs. There had been another five she had used her hands or mouth on to keep at bay while their owners were evaluated for the full experience. And don't forget Sean Hunsicker. She had actually gone to bed with him twice, ready to open the gates to the kingdom, but he had shown such a complete fascination with her smallish breasts that more traditional means of intercourse had been ignored and he had ended up titfucking her both times. Luckily Sean had a talented tongue and both parties ended up satisfied.\n\nGwen looked at her daughter. A short time ago she would have been appalled at her loose behavior, but now she was maybe a little...envious? \"Is that a lot? I'm sorry, I don't know much about this kind of thing.\"\n\nAlison shrugged. \"Average, maybe a little below average, if I had to guess from what I saw in college. You're not mad, are you? Or disappointed?\" \n\n\"No, no, honey, I'm not mad and I'm certainly not disappointed,\" she said, patting her daughter's thigh. \"As long as you were careful, and apparently you were, you sound like you were just being a normal young person. I just have a lot of learning to do still\u2014I'm not very experienced with all this...sex stuff.\" \n\nAlison did her best to hide her shock. Never in a million years would she have imagined her mother would give the okay to premarital sex. \"I give you a lot of credit for even talking about it\u2014I can't believe I would ever be having this conversation with you. I think it's great you and Daddy are making each other happy that way\u2014you are making each other happy, right?\" \n\nGwen rolled her eyes. \"Yes Alison, he makes me very happy, and he hasn't complained.\" He didn't complain before you got all slutty either, the Lady grumbled. \n\nHer daughter grinned and hugged her shoulder. \"Good! So I guess the pictures you had taken for him made him happy. Can I see them now?\" \n\n\"Alison Marie! No! Why on earth do want to see pictures of your own mother?\" \n\n\"Because if I'm really lucky I'll still look like you when I get older,\" she said shyly. \"I'd kinda like to see what I might look like then, if Jason might still find me attractive that way.\" \n\n\"Jason will always find you attractive. I mean, look at the picture he sent you!\"\n\n\"Yeah, but he's still young. He gets that way a lot. I want to be able to inspire that kind of reaction when I'm older?\"\n\n\"Stop that. Of course you will. You're a very pretty girl.\"\n\nAlison bit her lip. \"Aunt Natalie let me see hers...\" \n\nGwen raised her eyebrow in disbelief. \"She showed you those?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, the ones she had taken for Uncle Adam. They were great, but I, umm, don't look like her. People say I look a lot like you, though.\"\n\nThe older woman relaxed a bit at the realization the pictures of Natalie were not the most recent set. She sat there for a moment, deep in thought. \"Alison, are you sure you want to see them?\" she finally asked wearily. \"Personally I don't think they look like me\u2014the photographer was very good. They're very risqu\u00e9. And once you see them, you can't un-see them.\" \n\n\"I'm sure. So does that mean you will?\"\n\nGwen got up. \"Wait here.\" She returned a moment later and handed the bound leather album to her daughter. \"Last chance to say no.\" \n\nAlison grinned and pulled back the cover. She spent some time looking over the photos, occasionally looking up at the woman sitting next to her and grinning before again focusing on the album in her lap, an occasional 'wow' escaping her lips. \n\nThe young woman finally reached the last photo. \"Mom, those are stunning. Never in a million years would I have guessed you had it in you to do that. I still remember all the times you made me change before I left for school.\"\n\n\"You always wanted to wear such revealing outfits,\" Gwen protested, realizing now that they really hadn't been that bad after all. \"You have to dress like a lady to be treated like one.\" \n\nAlison held up the album. \"And if you dress like this you get treated even better,\" she retorted with a laugh. \"Daddy was all over you, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Alison Marie! That is your father you are talking about and none of your business! And now may I put them away again?\"\n\nHer daughter pulled the photos back. \"He was, wasn't he? Can I and bring them back after I show them to Jason? It might give him hope for the future.\" \n\n\"You may not!\" Gwen shrieked, reaching out for the album. \"If he needs hope for the future because he doesn't know what he has right now, he's a fool and you're too good for him!\" \n\nAlison laughed and let her mother grab the album from her hands. \"Just kidding Mom, just kidding. They really are good, though. If those were of me I'd be making people look at them.\" \n\n\"Some things are meant to remain private. I can't believe I showed them to you. And you better not tell Jason what you saw today\u2014or what I saw, for that matter!\" \n\n\"Like nothing ever happened,\" Alison replied with mock seriousness. Jason already knew of the existence of his mother-in-law's boudoir photos, the knowledge combining with his memories of her vibrators to forever shatter his perception of Gwendolyn Nelson the prude. He knew of Natalie's too, and Alison had made it clear he wouldn't see either, but he still held out hope of a slip-up somewhere. He loved taking pictures of his own Nelson, and wanted some inspiration...\n\n\"Thanks for showing them to me,\" Alison continued on. \"I'm really touched and flattered that you would trust me that much.\" \n\nMother and daughter hugged.
