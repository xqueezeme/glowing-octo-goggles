        "Author's Note: Thank you all for reading, especially those who have been taking the time to vote and leave your comments. Constructive critique welcome! \n\nStandard disclaimers.\n\nThis is a story about sexual exploration and, open relationships. Open relationships can and do happily exist; but they are not for everyone. If you do not believe it is at all possible for open relationships to exist without damage to any and all involved parties, please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time reading this.\n\nAlso, this story takes place in a world where STDs don't exist and only babies planned for and wanted do\u2014in other words, a fantasy world. Any resemblance to real-life people is purely coincidental. \n\n*****\n\nGwen was first into the shower, playfully dismissing Tim's attempts to join her in the too-small bathtub while she washed away the oil from her breasts and stomach. He waited patiently for her to finish before trading places with her to clean the slickness he had accumulated from his slide down her body. \n\nGwen stood looking into her overnight bag, idly pondering the merits of either the jeans or the sundress she had packed. The Lady's demands for some guilt or shame were proving to be a distraction, not so much for the acts themselves anymore, that rebuke had lost its effectiveness, but instead for her willing submission to another, even if it was her husband. Gwen had vowed to never again allow herself to be somebody's plaything after her experiences with Miss Ritter; The Lady pointedly reminded her that this broken promise only highlighted the weakness her growing perversion was exploiting. \n\nFor Gwen, the thought frightened her. She was the boss, the bitch with iron panties, always in control, but she had truly enjoyed letting go of that for a while and letting Tim have his way\u2014just like Miss Ritter did, the Lady ominously reminded her. \n\nIt's not an all-or-nothing thing, the Slut countered. You let it go for a while\u2014you just took a break, and it felt good. You can take back control any time you want. Try it! She smiled and reached for the sundress as a plan began to form despite the Lady's protests.\n\nHe's so attractive, Gwen thought as her naked husband walked out of the bathroom, toweling his hair. A handsome face and easy smile, muscular arms and legs, and while he didn't exactly have a six pack, his stomach and chest just made him seem so male, so masculine. Not to mention that beautiful thing swinging between his legs...it was sleeping now, the soft length hanging halfway down over his loose sac. She felt a pang of regret over taking so long to fully appreciate the man she had been blessed with on nothing more than dumb luck, and briefly reconsidered subjecting him to her plot before silently promising to make it worth his while.\n\nAs Tim feared, breakfast was over by the time they made it downstairs to check out, getting directions for a nearby place serving brunch the desk clerk swore by. They found it a mile down the road and were seated at a quiet table for two in the middle of the small dining room. \"Nice dress,\" Tim noted as they waited for the server. \"New?\"\n\n\"From your daughter's closet. I don't think she even remembers it was there.\" It was a floral print, two not-quite spaghetti straps over her otherwise bare shoulders, the hem ending above her knee. Gwen had thought it too revealing when it had first been purchased, but it hadn't been her money... \n\nTim didn't look up from his menu. \"Ali, or KD?\" he asked distractedly. \n\nShe giggled. \"Alison. Do you think my chest is even close to being up to the task of filling out something of KD's? I'd need a lot more...volume...\" \n\nTim glanced about, guessing nobody could hear or was paying attention to their conversation. \"Yours are perfect just the way they are,\" he volunteered softly, his voice dropping to a rumble. \"Perfect for looking at, and...other things.\" \n\n\"You don't think they're too small?\"\n\n\"They're perfect.\" he repeated, returning his attention to the menu, trying to decide between waffles or eggs. Gwen Nelson talking about her tits in the middle of a busy restaurant, he thought with a smile and shake of his head. Ain't things crazy.\n\nTheir orders placed, Gwen bent to pick up her napkin she had dropped alongside the table while the young waitress had been asking Tim about his choice of potatoes. His eyes widened as he watched her bend at the waist, waiting until she had sat back up before leaning across the table towards her. \"You're not wearing a bra,\" he whispered, more of a statement than a question. \n\nGwen leaned forward to meet him halfway. \"I'm not wearing any underwear at all,\" she whispered back. \"Is that alright? Should I go out to the truck and get some?\"\n\n\"NO\u2014no,\" he grumbled even as his eyes glanced downward to see if she was exposing herself even now. \"But I thought we were stopping at Outdoor Outfitters on the way home?\"\n\n\"You said you wanted to, right? You were looking for some new lures?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, but there'll be a lot of people there...\" he glanced meaningfully at her chest.\n\n\"Then I'll just have to be careful, right? It'll be just between us. But if you change your mind, I do have clean underwear in my bag...\"\n\nHe smiled. \"No sense adding to the laundry.\" \n\nTim's appetite was not diminished in the least by the secret he had been let in on, although he did eat with one eye on the other diners, wondering if some of them might have already caught a glimpse of something they shouldn't have. He did his best to pay attention while Gwen firmed up some of the expansion plans started at dinner the night before, thinking how much she looked like your typical Sunday morning soccer mom\u2014 a classic Southern belle if she had been with the kind of man she was supposed to have married, he reminded himself\u2014and yet nothing about her gave the other diners any clue that only a thin layer of floral print fabric prevented her from being exposed as someone not quite so prim and proper. His glances about the room occasionally stopped on some of the other women, wondering if they were dressed similarly, if they too had secret sides known only to a lucky few... \n\nTo his disappointment she was indeed careful all through their meal and then out to the truck, delicately climbing into the passenger seat with legs closed enough to prevent an inappropriate peek while he held her door open. She successfully reversed the process in the parking lot of Outdoor Outfitters, \"everything for the outdoor sportsman under one roof!\" and took Tim's hand as he led the way into what before this weekend had been the only toy store he cared to spend time in. Gwen had been here before with him; it was a favorite stop of his whenever he was in the area. She remembered the layout of the immense building and could believe the slogan, a main floor complete with stuffed hunting trophies scattered about a mountain pond stocked with fish. Second and third floors opened out onto the view of the first below, balustered railings lining the balconies above the atrium. The throng of customers always struck Gwen as a curious mix of men and a surprising number of women, urban professionals shoulder to shoulder with the more rural residents of the state, \"rednecks,\" as some of them proudly proclaimed themselves, and she could understand how hunters and fisherman\u2014and her husband-could easily spend an entire day here moving about the various displays, demonstrations and seminars.. \n\n\"What time you want me to meet you?\" Tim asked after they paused just inside the entrance. Gwen had always set him free to wander for a set period of time while she sat in the caf\u00e9 towards the rear of the main floor, instructing him to meet her there once his allowance of time was up. \n\nGwen smiled. \"Can I go with you? I promise to let you look as long as you want. But if you think I'll be in the way...\"\n\n\"No, you can come with me if you want,\" he replied quickly before she could change her mind. \"Might be pretty boring for you, though.\" Tim led the way through the clothing displays between the entrance and the open wooden staircase that rose in an arcing sweep up to the second floor and everything fishing. She looked down at the shoppers below as she climbed, guessing the design of the stairs might allow them a quick glimpse up a skirt or dress if a girl wasn't careful. I would have settled for a thong, the Lady grumbled, certain the perverts below had worked out well in advance exactly where and when to look up. Gwen took her time, each step deliberate as she looked about, Tim keeping pace. He had guessed at the view from below as well and made note of her slow climb. \n\nGwen had been on the second floor once before to collect Tim when had forgotten the time and the amount of things invented by mankind to catch a fish amazed her now as it had then. They wandered together through the racks of poles and shelves of lures, line and nets, clothing and coolers. Tim's attention was been split between the latest in fishing technology and his less than fully-clothed wife, watching as she wandered from time to time out to the railing while he examined the advances made in line strength, wondering if someone might be discretely standing underneath her and looking up. \n\nShe patiently stood next to him while he kneeled in front of a low shelf, debating the merits of the frog-jig lure he held. A mannequin dressed in waders, flannel shirt and vest at the end of the row caught her eye and she smiled, imagining herself dressed in just the waders, wondering if Tim might find that sexier than lingerie. Or would he like just the vest, and nothing else...a giggle escaped her at the idea of fishing gear becoming the new naughty nightie and imagined modeling them at Cho's next party, or perhaps even at one of the many product demonstrations they gave at that little theatre downstairs...\n\nTim looked up from where he was kneeling. \"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\" She turned away from him and bent over to retrieve something from the rack while he watched the hem of her dress rise higher and higher, the line of sight from where he kneeled perfect for seeing the first hint of a darker split nestled between firm thighs. Out of the corner of his eye he could see a man to his left, the view from where he stood probably not as good but still enough for him to take note of the ass being presented. He caught Tim's glance and hurriedly returned his attention to the multicolored lures in front of him. \n\nGwen removed a plastic bag from a hanger near the floor, the clear plastic of the cylinder inside shot through with purple dots and ribbed in a spiral, a flat curl of rubber extending from one end. To Gwen, it looked like some sort of miniature vibrator. \"This one's interesting,\" she said, straightening and turning back to Tim before needlessly bending over to show it to him.\n\nHe glanced at it only briefly, his focus on the dangling breasts now visible inside her loose top, certain the guy behind him could see them too if he dared another look. \"Oh yeah, that's a spring grub. I have one like that.\" \n\n\"It looks like something they would have had at that other store yesterday.\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah, I guess I see what you mean. Did you want one like that?\"\n\n\"Maybe next trip.\" Gwen squatted facing him, legs together but the dress riding high up the front of her thighs. \"So many different colored worms,\" she mused, apparently unconcerned with the amount of exposed leg, looking at the rack. \"They look like those gummy worms the girls used to like.\" \n\nTim laughed nervously, aware that his body was probably blocking the view from his left, wondering if the guy would risk an obvious move for a better look. \"Yeah, I guess they do.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, but this does not look real at all. I can't believe any fish would fall for this.\" Gwen reached sideways for a yellow and green striped worm, her right knee moving away from the other and dropping to the floor to balance herself, thighs opening and further pushing back her dress in the process. \n\nTim's eyes left her spread legs long enough to acknowledge the lure she was holding, then returned to unabashedly stare at her exposed sex. \"Uh, yeah, they do, though. I guess bass get dumb when they see something they want to eat.\" \n\n\"Like fisherman,\" Gwen said with a mischievous smile, standing and smoothing her dress.\n\nTim got a few more brief peeks as they continued to shop, certain the offered glimpses were intentional and not at all upset about it. He was ready to go after selecting a few items for purchase, probably sooner than if he been shopping alone, but he had seen the bait being offered and was anxious to rise to it. His request to see a little more once they were in the privacy of the truck's cab was gently rebuffed, as was his suggestion they pull off somewhere along the way like they had that night after Bob and Yvette's. \n\nCricket had already left by the time they returned to the house, a note written with precise penmanship detailing her stay including the news that Alison had come over the previous afternoon and that they had ridden together. Tim returned to the kitchen after dropping their bags in the bedroom, wrapping his arms around her from behind and kissing her neck. \"Now can I see some more?\"\n\n\"I'm going for a swim,\" Gwen replied while tilting her head to give his stubble more neck to rasp against. \"If you come with me, you'll see everything.\" Callused hands scraped against the outside of her thighs, pulling her dress up as he nuzzled. She gently pushed them back down and pulled away. \"Can you bring some towels and something to drink? I'll meet you up there.\" \n\nGwen was already treading water in the middle of the pool when he came through the gate, dress discarded over the back of a nearby chair. \"I thought I was going to get to see everything?\" he said with a chuckle.\n\n\"Maybe the view is better in here?\" \n\nHe grinned and quickly stripped, his erection catching on the waistband of his underwear before springing free. \n\nGwen laughed. \"How long have you had that?\"\n\n\"On and off since breakfast.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have teased you like that. That wasn't very nice.\"\n\n\"Aww, that's okay. You can be a cocktease all you want as long as they make good on the tease. You're gonna finish what you started\u2014\"he pulled her to him, easily holding on as she wrapped her legs around his waist and arms around his neck\u2014\"right?\" \n\nHis kiss cut off her answer. I'm a cocktease, she thought, wiggling against the hardness lodged in the folds of her sex, the Lady insulted by the label, the Slut wearing it with pride. \n\nHe slowly walked with her still entwined about him towards the pool stairs, only letting her slide off his cock at the first step. Gwen led the way out of the water while Tim hung back, taking a moment to appreciate how her skin's wet sheen only made that beautiful ass more desirable. \n\n\"Lie down,\" she requested, motioning to the nearest recliner. \"I'm going to finish what I started.\" Tim smiled in reply, lying back with hands folded behind his head in a pose that smacked of casual confidence, waiting to see what exactly she had in mind. Gwen straddled the chair above his midsection, feet firmly planted on the wet cement, smiling down at him as he squinted up at the figure above him framed in the afternoon sun. Two fingers circled the head of his cock and levered it up, aiming while she sank down to meet it in one fluid motion, pausing when his flared knob nestled between the lips guarding her opening. Gwen smiled again and slowly sank down on it, her journey reminding Tim of a cylinder returning to rest position. He was the engine driving the piston for that cylinder, and his hips thrust up into her as she bottomed out against him. \n\n\"Let me,\" she said, more of a command than a request.\n\nHe finished the thrust and lay still. \"Have at it.\" \n\nGwen basked in the heat of the sun on her bare back for a moment before leaning forward and placing her hands on his chest, wiggling into the spike she was impaled on as if testing the fit. Satisfied, her hips began to rotate, her mound grinding sensuously against the wiry patch of hair over Tim's pubic bone. \"You can play with my...tits...if you want.\" His hands were happy to have something to do besides grip the chair's armrests and enthusiastically applied themselves to their task, kneading the pliant flesh, thumbs circling and flicking the erect nipples.\n\nGwen understood the position she had chosen to fuck her husband was no accident, just as being on all fours in the hotel had been done to send a message. On her hands and knees, her rear presented for his pleasure had always struck her as the pose of ultimate submission; it was the way males of all species took their mates. To have him beneath her like this was the polar opposite...so much like riding a horse, Gwen mused, both of us working together, but it's my dance to lead and my will to be obeyed when I'm in the saddle\u2014or on a man. Her hips were still grinding, sliding him in and out now as she rose and fell on the length inside her. Her left foot came up off of the cement, then the right, allowing her to kneel astride her mount while she began to bounce up and down on him with surprising force. \n\nTim noticed the enthusiasm in her style as well. \"You like it hard?\"\n\n\"I do, sometimes, like last night\u2014and right now,\" she grunted, emphasizing her point with an especially energetic stroke as she finished her thought. \n\n\"I'll have to remember that.\" He let her use him, hoping to delay his own gratification long enough to completely fulfill hers, aware that her intensity was quickly making that impossible. Her fingers grasped at his chest, short nails leaving red marks as each downstroke was accompanied by an equally intense grinding of her clit against him. \"You're gonna make me come, Gwen.\"\n\n\"Come in me,\" she growled, \"as deep as you can!\" She again forced herself down on him to add an exclamation to her request, and his own fingers left marks on the tender flesh of her breasts when they moved to grasp her hips and force them against his. Gwen studied his face for the subtle and not-so-subtle signs of his orgasm as Tim screwed his eyes shut, his jaw tensing while his hips twitched with enough strength to briefly lift her off him while he pulsed inside her.\n\nHis long exhalation and satisfied chuckle signaled the end of his immediate need and Gwen gently fell forward, her body light on his. The rotation of her clit returned, more gentle now, rebuilding the intensity. \"Put your hands on my ass,\" she murmured into his neck. \"I like them there.\" Gwen felt a finger land beyond one cheek and in the spread crevice between the other, resting lightly on her rosebud. She didn't care whether its resting place had been intentionally chosen or not; she wiggled against it in welcome, and the finger responded by circling the crinkled muscle a few times before pushing just hard enough to force it apart. Her body worked unbidden to maintain the delicious pressure on her clit while keeping the cock deeply buried and the finger right where it was.\n\nThis climax did not sneak up on her; she could feel its approach and worked to exert her will on it, letting it creep forward in small bursts until deciding that allowing it to burst forth was a form of control as well. The orgasm obediently exploded through her, her asshole spasmodically gripping his fingertip, the walls of her pussy contracting around the softening cock that seemed reluctant to leave as waves of pleasure radiated from her sex. \n\n\"I'm sorry I teased you like that,\" she repeated once her mind could again form words, murmuring into his neck. \"And that I made you wait so long.\" \"I just wanted to see...if I could. I'm sorry. That wasn't very nice.\"\n\n\"It was worth the wait,\" Tim replied with a laugh. \"I thought maybe you were punishing me for last night\u2014and this morning.\"",
        "Gwen sat up, his now limp member sliding from her to nestle between her lips as she continued to straddle him. \"Punishing you? For what?\" \n\n\"You know, making you to go get ice, tying you up and leaving you...I was kinda calling the shots. I know you don't like people telling you what to do.\" \n\n\"I liked you telling me what to do last night\u2014and this morning,\" she insisted. \"I'm just not used to it. I have to admit it was a little outside my comfort zone, but that's part of why it was so exciting, I think.\"\n\nTim laughed. \"Well, that's why I thought breakfast and after was your way of getting back at me.\"\n\n\"It wasn't that exactly, it was just that I wanted to be sure that I could, I guess, still be in control if I need to.\" \n\n\"That's why I was a little nervous about asking you to do that stuff\u2014I knew you said you would if I wanted you to, but I didn't know if you really meant it, or were just trying to be nice...\" \n\n\"I did mean it. I think a man who's confident\u2014and brave-enough to tell me what do is very attractive. It's very sexy.\" Gwen lewdly slid her hips back and forth over him. \n\nTim arched an eyebrow and lightly slapped her asscheek. \"Oh, yeah? So, I guess in that case, go get me a beer, woman.\"\n\nGwen crossed her arms defiantly and laughed. \"I didn't say all the time. Ask nicely and maybe we can go get it together.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Your brother wanted me to warn you that your father caught wind of the fact that you guys are thinking about forming a partnership.\"\n\nGwen smiled over at Natalie carefully guiding Tigger up the rutted section of trail. \"I know. He called me as soon as he found out. He still doesn't quite understand why we're doing it, but he promised that Adam would be available to give us whatever help we need. How's he coming on the paperwork?\" \n\n\"Good, standard stuff so far, from what I understand. He's waiting on the financials and worth appraisal.\" \n\n\"So are we. I think we're both a little worried the business isn't worth as much as we think it is.\" \n\n\"Adam doesn't seem to think that will be a problem.\"\n\nWe'll see.\" \n\nGwen had eagerly awaited Natalie's arrival that morning; she had spent far too little time with her lately, something her sister-in-law keenly felt as well. They had plenty to catch up on, things phone calls just didn't seem to do as good a job at. \n\nGwen smiled at the topless rider by her side. \"Speaking of Adam, when you had your, uhh, model of him made, did they call you after to see if you wanted any alterations?\"\n\nNatalie smiled back. \"You mean my dildo. Sure did. I think they do that after so whoever you're having recreated doesn't hear that you might like him a little bit bigger, or wider, or both. Don't want 'em to think their perfect cock could be a little more perfect.\" \n\n\"I suppose that makes sense, but won't they notice anyways once you get it?\" \n\n\"Maybe, maybe not...maybe they just prefer to think they really do look like that.\"\n\nSo, did you, uhh, enhance Adam?\"\n\n\"I really wanted to put a turtleneck on him, you know, a foreskin, just to see what he'd say, but I just asked for him to be a little chubbier since I like 'em that way. I don't think he even noticed; he probably thought he was just having a really good day when they took his measurements...so I'm guessing you got a call, too. Did you get Tim supersized?\"\n\nGwen laughed. \"No...I think it's perfect just the way it is.\"\n\n\"Awww, that's so sweet! How'd he react to the whole measuring thing? Little Tim didn't get shy or anything like that?\"\n\n\"No, he was really good about it, probably better than I would have been.\" The Slut laughed and questioned her honesty. \n\n\"So you guys stayed in Atlanta overnight, right? What else did you do while you were there?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing much...a little shopping, dinner, decided to expand the business, back to the hotel. We did almost miss check out time Sunday morning, though,\" Gwen added with a mischievous smile.\n\nNatalie giggled. \"I'm sure it wasn't because you overslept.\" \n\n\"No...\" Gwen hesitated, deciding the time was right to try and resolve one of her nagging concerns about her behavior over the weekend. \"Can I ask you something? I know you told me once that you let Liz tie you up sometimes just because she likes to do that kind of thing...if you wanted to be tied up, that wouldn't be weird enough to get worried about, right?\" \n\nHer sister-in-law smiled. \"Alright, out with it, who got tied up, who did the tying and what were the circumstances? I want details, woman!\"\n\n\"We did a little shopping at Cho's after Tim's measurements. He wanted to get some cuffs, you know, the kind that go around your wrists and ankles, and, well... I let him use them on me that morning before we came home. That's why we were late checking out.\" \n\n\"I knew it! I knew it! And you liked it?\" \n\nGwen could not look her companion in the eye. \"I guess I did, yes. That's weird, right?\"\n\nNatalie laughed. \"No, not weird. A lot of people like it. There's a reason Cho sells that stuff\u2014people buy it and use it. I'm not surprised you like it, probably more than you're letting on. I think it runs in your family. Your brother likes me to tie him up from time to time, too, although it almost killed him to ask me to do it the first time. You Currans have a pathological need for control, so you probably think it's very kinky to have to do things you're not supposed to be dong and have it be someone else's fault for a while.\" On the other hand, Natalie thought with a grin, your mother would make a superb dominatrix. Who knows, might already be. An image of the whip-wielding leather-teddy clad Curran matriarch came to mind before she returned her attention to Gwen. \"So, nope, not weird, completely kinky, and completely normal. The nurse in me has to warn you about any rough stuff that might go with it, though\u2014don't let him get carried away. Saw a couple of people come into the ER with some rather embarrassing injuries back in the day...\" \n\nAs long as we're baring it all, why don't you ask her if running naked down a hotel hallway is weird, the Lady asked, or letting another woman use your husband for hand job practice. Gwen ignored her, instead making sure she understood the meaning of \"rough stuff\", remembering the incredible variety of paddles, whips and clamps she had seen at Sensual Sensations. 'No, no rough stuff! He just tied me up and then, well he left for a while. I was so scared someone might come in while he was gone!\" \n\nHer riding partner smiled knowingly. \"I'll bet you were...imagine someone seeing you naked and you couldn't do a thing about it...you'd just have to let them look, or worse...\"\n\nGwen shifted in her saddle uncomfortably. Natalie knew quite a bit about her darkest fantasies. \"You and Adam don't, uhh, no rough stuff, right? I'm just now getting used to the idea my little brother has sex; I can't bear the thought of him getting tortured.\"\n\n\"Oh God, no!\" she laughed. \"I just tie him up and tease him until he begs. I love to hear big tough lawyer guy promise me anything if I'll just finish him off. I do have a leather bustier and thigh-high black boots though, make me look like a badass! I might have to borrow one of your riding crops for next time, just to make him worry a little. I promise I won't actually use it on him. So how long did Tim leave you tied up?\" \n\n\"I think he was gone about an hour, and then another forty five minutes after that, I guess.\" \n\n\"He let you off easy! I finished Adam off after three and a half hours our last vacation. I wasn't even there for the first two hours. I just left the room and let him imagine what I was up to without him. I came back and made up some very detailed and explicit stories about where I had been for the next hour and a half. I think he was ready to believe anything I told him.\" \n\n\"What kind of stories?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know...things I know make him really horny.\" \n\n\"Oh...do you really think my family is like that? You know, controlling?\" \n\n\"Don't you? Admit it, there isn't a Curran out there that doesn't want to be calling the shots when they're in public. In private though? We know there's at least two of ya that like having to be someone's plaything for a while. It wouldn't surprise me at all if John and Barbara have some things hidden away for special play dates, things that neither one of 'em would ever admit to.\"\n\nGwen wanted to argue, but couldn't. She was forced to admit the \"calling the shots\" remark certainly applied to her parents as well as John. He had stayed on the West coast after law school and joined a firm out there rather than join the family's because he hadn't wanted to work for his own father. A mental image of her very serious, respectable older brother, really a younger version of her father, tied to a bed while her equally respectable leather-clad sister-in-law hovered over him came to mind and was quickly dismissed. \n\n\"So what did he do between the time he came back and when he finally let you go?\" \n\n\"You know...\" she demurred. \"Some touching, he massaged me with some baby oil...Cho gave me something while we were there, he used that on me. That kind of thing.\" \n\n\"Oh, really? What kind of thing?\" Natalie purred. \n\n\"Well...you remember Neal? The male model at the party? She, uhh, gave me a reproduction of\u2014him.\"\n\n\"I know who Neal is,\" Natalie said with a laugh. \"You're a lucky girl! So, is it accurate?\" \n\n\"I guess, from what I remember.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think you remember just fine. Sorry Gwen, but we all noticed how you kept checking him out. I figured it was because you hadn't seen many up close and personal. I have to admit, up close it IS quite a specimen.\"\n\n\"You ALL noticed? Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed! I didn't think I was looking at him like that.\"\n\n\"You were and don't be, no harm in admiring works of art. Don't tell her I told you, but Liz was trying to get Gita to ask you if you wanted to touch it just to see your reaction.\" \n\n\"I probably would have crawled under the table and died!\"\n\n\"Yeah, maybe, but you can be full of surprises...does Tim know the story behind your not-so-little gift?\"\n\n\"Cho left a hint on the card, and I didn't want to lie to him, so...\"\n\n\"And he was alright with it, knowing it's from a guy you know?\" \n\n\"I think he was. I mean, he used it on me...I think he liked seeing it\u2014you know, in me.\"\n\nNatalie smiled. \"Of course he did.\" \n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" \n\n\"Nothing, nothing, sorry...hey, is it alright if we stop at the picnic meadow for a while? I've got some time before work and it's just such a beautiful spot on a day like this.\" \n\nThe horses were tethered in the shade, Natalie shucking off her boots and jeans while Gwen laid out the small blanket she had tied behind her saddle, joining her sister-in-law on it once her own clothes had been shed. They lay together, eyes occasionally opening to look into the cloud-flecked sky before closing again to enjoy the quiet of the field and surrounding forest. \n\n\"How's your friend Cricket doing?\" \n\nGwen's eyes popped open in fear that perhaps Natalie had somehow found out the depths to which their relationship had descended. That's ridiculous, she quickly rationalized. Only three people know about that, and none of us would have said a word...\"She's good. She's over here most weekends riding.\"\n\n\"I ran into Ali at the grocery store. She said Cricket was here more than her.\" \n\nGwen rose on one elbow and looked at the nude woman lying next to her. \"Ali's not mad about that, is she? She knows she can come over whenever she wants\u2014\"\n\n\"Ali's fine with it,\" Natalie said with a laugh, not bothering to open her eyes. \"She's glad that you have someone to ride with-she worries about you out here alone. If anything, she feels bad that her schedule makes it hard to come over more than she does.\" \n\n\"Tell her I'm fine,\" Gwen gently retorted as she lay back down. \"I'm a big girl.\" \n\n\"So, I have to guess you two didn't just go to sleep after dinner Saturday night,\" Natalie deadpanned. \"Am I right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Gwen answered truthfully, thankful the discussion seemed to be moving on from Cricket. \"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but Tim told me to get some ice down the hall, so I did.\" \n\nIt was Natalie's turn to get up on one elbow and look over, her heavy breasts spilling down across her chest. \"I have to guess you're telling me this because there's more to the story than just ice?\" she asked with a knowing grin. \n\n\"I had to do it without clothes,\" Gwen replied, turning her head and squinting from the glare of the midday sun. \n\n\"Ooohh, naked dares! I love those!\" her sister-in-law gushed. \"So much fun!\"\n\n\"You've done that?\"\n\n\"Not for ice, no, although now that you've done it I'm gonna have to try it just to keep up...naked pizza delivery is our thing.\"\n\n\"Naked pizza delivery?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we order pizza, I answer the door in a towel and let it drop\u2014accidentally, of course.\"\n\n\"Really? Is Adam there when you do this?\"\n\n\"It's his idea half the time. He gets a kick out of seeing how the delivery guys react to another guy's naked wife. I don't even bother with the towel when I open the door for room service at the resort in the Caribbean we go to, but I don't think it's as big a deal for them since they've got the nude beach.\" Natalie's hand found Gwen's stomach and gently stroked. \"Anybody see you when you were getting ice?\" \n\n\"No, I don't think so. There was an older couple that got off the elevator and could have seen me if they knew where to look, but I don't think they did.\" She laughed. \"Tim got a video, though. I told him he couldn't show it to anyone.\"\n\n\"Anyone?\" The hand was moving further up and down her midsection, fingers grazing the bottom of her breasts and the top of her dark thatch. \"Even me?\" \n\n\"Why would you want to see that?\" \n\n\"Because it sounds incredibly hot and you naked in a hotel hallway is something I never, ever thought I'd see when I first met you. You know you scared the hell out of me back then, right? Almost as much as your mother?\"\n\n\"Me? Why?\" Gwen was sure she knew the answer, but she had to ask for appearance's sake. \n\n\"Because you were so serious, so stern, and I thought you and your mother were going to join forces to get Adam to see me as a bad girl, which I kinda was and still am, and a bad idea, which I didn't think I was then or now, and by that point I had really fallen hopelessly in love with your brother. Things certainly have changed! Look at you now, naked and,\" Natalie bent to deliver a soft kiss while she slid a finger between Gwen's legs, \"wet. So, can I see the video of the really hot chick doing a naked ice run?\"\n\n\"You'd have to ask Tim,\" Gwen deflected, wanting those lips back, hoping for the finger to stay right where it was. \n\n\"I will.\" She was kissed again, kissing back, her free hand reaching for Natalie's body. She briefly missed the lips as they again left hers, consoled by the guess as to where she thought they were going as they traveled down her neck to tease a nipple. Natalie's finger was now boldly probing deep inside her, pulling moisture from her opening and spreading it across already-wet pussy lips before returning for more. Gwen was disappointed when her attempt to return the favor between Natalie's legs came up short as her sister-in-law sat up and got to her knees. \n\n\"You're getting a little untamed down here,\" she said with a smile, her fingers taking a quick detour to run through the tufts of Gwen's thatch before returning to her slit. \"Want me to trim it up when we go back down?\" \n\n\"I can't-Danilo\u2014the photographer\u2014asked me to let it grow out until the photo shoot so he can decide on my hairstyle thennnnnnn ohhh that feels good,\" Gwen gasped and moaned, a finger now deliberately circling her clit. \n\nNatalie nodded. \"Ahh, yes, the photo shoot. That's alright, I think I know the landmarks well enough by now to know where I'm going.\" She bent, gently kissing her carpeted mons, sliding down until her lips stopped at the top of her slit. A tongue flicked at Gwen's partially-hooded nub and she squeaked in welcome as Natalie's hand snaked down under her thigh to slide a finger in her opening. Her own hand found its way up her sister-in-law's thigh, to where her sex was presented; Gwen slid a finger up and down the abundant lips before pushing through them to fill Natalie's opening with one, then two fingers while a thumb rocked against her clit. \n\nGwen's hips rocked back and forth, trying to help guide her sister-in-law to the most sensitive spots. And then suddenly the tongue was gone, the pussy surrounding her fingers also withdrawn, and Natalie reversed herself to straddle Gwen's leg. \"Is this what you need?\" she asked breathlessly, a smile on her face, her mons pressed solidly against the woman below her. \"Because I know I do.\" Gwen reached for the ass straddling her thigh, her hips beginning to circle in response, creating even more blessed pressure against her clitoris. \"Oh God, that feels so good,\" Natalie groaned and bent to capture a nipple between her lips. Gwen offered it gladly, her nipple and areola hungrily kissed, licked and nibbled. \n\nNatalie abruptly broke contact with Gwen's breast, throwing her head back and squeezing her eyes shut. \"Oh-oh-oh-oh yes, oh yes,\" she chanted, her climax building steam. Oh, so good, so gooodddd\u2014\" her arms locked at the elbows, fighting to keep her upper body from falling heavily on the woman below her while her lower half gave up the fight and sagged against the thigh between hers. The waves finally passed and she allowed herself to gently sink down on to Gwen, conscious of the sex beneath her still grinding into her hip, fighting to bring about her own orgasm. \"Here,\" she said softly, rolling to her side, encouraging Gwen to roll on top of her. \"Turn around and bring yourself up here where I can get at you.\"\n\nGwen got off the panting woman and turned, lying on her side with a leg bent at the knee to prop herself open. \n\n\"No, get on top of me,\" Natalie offered, gently pulling at her upturned hip as if helping her to understand.\n\n\"I don't want to crush you,\" Gwen replied unconvincingly, her body anxious to regain the contact that had broken. The orgasm that was even now stalking the edges of her senses made debate difficult.\n\n\"I think we've proven that's not gonna happen,\" Natalie replied with a laugh. \"You're light as a feather as opposed to some others that have assumed the position. C'mon, bring it up here. I want to kiss your beautiful pussy.\" Gwen brought a knee over the blonde's head, her pussy inches from the woman's face, crouching lightly over the big, beautiful breasts that had fallen a bit to each side. \"Closer honey,\" Natalie coached, one hand on the front of her sister-in-law's thigh to compel her further back while the other hand pressed lightly on her back to settle on the body below. There was contact, glorious contact, and her body ground against the rediscovered pressure. \"Mmm, that's better,\" came the muffled voice between legs as a tongue drew a line from her clit down, splitting her lips. Gwen sagged against the tongue, a part of her worried about her weight on the person below her, just as she always worried when in this position even as her climax built from the delightful contact. She crouched heavily on knees and shins, her upper body dead weight against Natalie's midsection, her head nestled between the vee of two raised thighs. \n\nIn the end it was the feel of her clit against Natalie's chin that triggered the climax's storm of sensations, a tongue delicately probing her folds and the entrance to her opening. She took the gentle insistent pressure from Natalie's hands pulling her down that she was not smothering\u2014or drowning!-the poor woman between her legs, the soft tickle of her breath on tingling lips confirming she was breathing easily as Gwen lay heavily on her body recovering. Natalie was in no hurry to make her move, allowing her to choose when to roll off to the side. They lay together, head to foot, looking up the sky, resting, recovering. Natalie made her shift with three minutes to spare."
