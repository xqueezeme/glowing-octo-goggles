        "This story takes place in a fictional world with fictional people. Any similarities to people or things in the world we actually live in is coincidental.\n\n*****\n\nTim's support had been requested by a local contractor at the planning board meeting that Tuesday evening. Gwen waited until all the trucks were back and being unloaded that afternoon before she kissed him goodbye and headed off on her own. She had told her husband and herself that she really needed to do some clothes shopping, and that part was true; her loosening morals had made her current attire seem dull and she felt an obligation to Tim to give him what she believed he wanted. Some newer, fresher styles were needed\u2014not too slutty, she cautioned herself, just more in keeping with the times and her expanding comfort level.\n\nWhat she would not admit, what the Slut on her shoulder did not dare even suggest, was that she craved some excitement. Perhaps if the conditions were right, she might be in a position to give someone a peek of her underwear, or perhaps her bare back. All without them knowing she was doing it, of course; it would have to be a believable accident on her part. \n\nHer destination was not the mall, but a smaller shopping center two towns over; she had no desire to run into anyone she might know, and she wondered if even the distance she had traveled would be enough to prevent that. The long-sleeve shirt that had maintained her modesty in front of the boys back at the shop was discretely removed after she pulled to a stop in the shopping center parking lot; not before a thorough scan of the area for any passerbys, however. Underneath was a tank top she had found in Alison's closet, scandalous in the amount of bare shoulder and arm it showed, even threatening to reveal a bra strap if she were not careful. \n\nGwen glanced down as she hurried across the scorching pavement towards the cool interior of her target. The top was a little tighter on her than she had hoped, her breasts distinctly defined under the thin material and pushed into a hint of cleavage beneath the low-scooped top. The Lady was adamant her bra would not be up to the task of preventing her nipples from proclaiming her loose morals should she get a sudden chill, while the Slut hoped the Lady was correct. Gwen took solace in the fact that the trickle of sweat running down between her breasts made that unlikely, at least in the short term. \n\nThe first blast of refrigerated air hit her in the face as the doors slid open. Gwen managed to keep a measured pace to the first racks of clothing before again looking down. The Lady had been right about the bra. She briefly thought about returning to the truck, at least to retrieve the shirt she had just removed, but instead pressed on in the opposite direction, compromising by keeping her chest pointed away from the other shoppers. \n\nGwen made a quick pass by the dressing rooms upon reaching women's wear, making note of the fact that waiting area and changing rooms were even more closely situated than Crandall's. That the area was currently without an attendant was not lost on her, either. One less person to put a crimp in her ill-advised plans. \n\nShe hurried back into the racks of clothing, intent on quickly choosing items to try on that she might actually buy and wear\u2014she had to go home with something for her efforts. A look of disappointment almost cracked her deceptively-calm demeanor as another pass by the dressing rooms revealed nobody, male or female, waiting for a friend of significant other. You've been parading around this store with your nipples sticking out of this ridiculous shirt, the Lady scolded. Just try on the slutwear you've got in your hand and go home before you get in real trouble! A part of her wanted to take the direction; perhaps just going into one of the stalls and undressing would be enough to satisfy her need for excitement. The Slut finally talked her into making one more trip into the racks to look for a few more items. If there's still no one here when I get back, Gwen decided, then I'll just go in and see how these look. That would probably be for the best, anyways\u2014this is insane!\n\nThe trembling woman continued to carefully select items, taking her time. The chill of the air-conditioning had worn off some time ago, but still the bra failed to contain the eraser points beneath it. Finally Gwen could wait no longer and made her way among the racks back to the open area at the rear of the department. \n\nHer breath caught at the sight of the tall, thin, man standing with his back to her in the entranceway to the dressing rooms, looking down the stall-lined hallway. Gwen took stock as she brought her gathered items to her chest as a sort of shield and advanced. Neat black hair, t-shirt, Cargo shorts, sneakers with no socks, wedding band on the ring finger of the left hand which was resting high on the doorframe. \n\n\"Umm, excuse me?\" \n\nThe man turned and looked down at her, a surprised smile on his face. \"Oh, sorry, please, excuse me.\" His eyes surreptitiously scanned her from top to bottom before he moved to the side\n\nGwen could hear the sound of a belt buckle hitting the floor in what seemed to be the last cubicle on the right. Are you crazy? The Lady screamed. You can't go in there! What if this man decides to trap you and have his way with you! There will be no one here to help you!\n\nThat's probably his wife back there, the Slut reasoned. I seriously doubt she's going to let him do that. Besides, there's plenty of people in this store just a scream away. Gwen pressed on, selecting the second booth on the left. \n\nWith shaking hands she \"carelessly\" let the left half of the barroom-style swinging door stick in a partially open position, a ten-inch gap between it and its partner while she sorted and hung her potential purchases,. The oversight was not attended to, and Gwen glanced right, into the mirror on the wall. The reflection allowed her to see through the gap, the waiting area partially visible behind the thin man still standing in the entrance to the hallway. She allowed herself a long enough look to see his eyes shifting nervously back and forth between the end of the corridor and her door.\n\nDon't look in the mirror, Gwen chided herself as she decided her next steps. Don't let him know you know. With a deep breath, she turned her back to the reflection and bent to remove her sandals. \n\nThe sound of dressing room doors rattling momentarily froze her in place. Not mine, Gwen decided. Further down the hall.\n\n\"How's this look, honey?\" \n\nA male voice, the man at the entrance, replied. \"Uhh, looks nice.\"\n\n\"Keeper?\"\n\n\"If you like it.\" \n\nGwen turned slightly and risked another look in the mirror. The man was still there, his attention drawn to the end of the corridor where his wife was modeling. She quickly averted her eyes as the sound of the door closing came up the hall and the man's eyes began to shift back to her cubicle. \n\nNow what? Did she actually dare to go through with this crazy scheme? It would be so easy to just reach back and pull the door shut, ask him to take a seat, do the proper thing...a nice compromise might be to close the door and strip naked knowing he was just a few feet away. \n\nNo. Not enough. The Slut wanted more. Fingers moved to the zipper of her jeans without need for further instruction, slackening the tension on the brass button only slightly before it too was undone. The denim was slowly pushed down and off her hips, dragging panties along for an inch or two until the friction on them was lessened. Gwen felt some consolation in the possibility of reversing the action and stopping her depraved show until she stepped out of one, then the other leg. Now, with underwear, naked thighs and calves on display, in her mind there was no turning back. \n\nShe bent to pick up her jeans, taking the time to give her audience a long look, the top of the cleft between her globes visible above where her panties had been dragged down. Gwen finally straightened and gave up what little cover the tank-top offered with a quick pull of it over her head. Another decision point had been reached. She could stop there, clad in her bra and panties, and go about the business of trying her items on, or she could go further. The sound of the man's wife coming back out into the corridor gave her time to consider. Gwen risked another look.\n\n\"How about this one?\"\n\nThe man was still in the same spot, a look of surprise and guilt on his face as he looked past her doorway and down the hallway to where his wife stood. \n\n\"Uhh, that one's nice, too.\" \n\nDo you like this one, or the first one better?\" \n\n\"Uhh, that one?\" \n\n\"Alright. Let me try on the others.\" \n\nThe man turned his attention back to the open door as soon as his wife disappeared from view to find Gwen's naked back on display in the reflection. He nervously looked over his shoulder, suddenly aware his voyeurism might not have gone unnoticed by others. The slightly-open door called him back, to where Gwen had turned sideways to reach for the items hanging on the wall hook there. He was rewarded with a view of the side of firm, pert breasts pointed proudly at the clothes as she selected a shirt, turning her back to the mirror only after she had buttoned it. Two more shirts were tried and removed in the same manner before the man's wife stepped out again. \n\n\"Too short?\" \n\n\"Uhh, no, no, I don't think so.\" \n\n\"I think it might be...\" \n\nHe returned his attention to the cubicle just a few feet away even as Gwen was pushing her modest panties down. The separation of her muscular cheeks was clearly visible, her most secret place almost visible in the dusk between her legs. \n\nPlease turn around, the man begged as he held his breath, and he was not disappointed. A beautifully sculpted body of smooth, flowing lines was presented to him, the lips of her shaven sex clearly visible beneath a short tuft of hair. This was too good to be true-she had to be doing this on purpose! The entrancing view was brief as Gwen reached for a skirt\u2014the shortest skirt she had ever considered\u2014and stepped into it. Breasts jiggled and dangled invitingly. \n\nThe door down the corridor opened, followed by the sound of the woman walking purposefully up the hallway. \"I like this, but it's a little too small. I'm going to go get another size. My purse in there; can you hang out so nobody walks off with it?\" \n\nGwen risked another glance to find that her audience had retreated back into the waiting area, out of sight; another look a moment later found him still by the chairs, but now in a position to resume his watching, albeit from a greater distance. She obliged him with more casual switching of clothes, spending as much time as believable in nothing at all. \n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nGwen almost shrieked as she reached for something to cover herself up with. The wife had returned and was standing outside her door. She willed herself not to throw up.\n\n\"Uhh, yes?\"\n\n\"Sorry, but your door is a little open. Not sure if you knew or not.\"\n\n\"Oh my goodness,\" Gwen replied as she quickly snatched it shut. \"How embarrassing. Thank you so much.\" \n\n\"You're welcome.\" The woman continued on back to her cubicle. \n\nA surge of adrenaline fueled a frantic scramble to dress, her heart pounding as she zipped her jeans back up and leaned against the wall. The shirt in her truck would come in handy right now, an extra layer to proclaim her modesty upon her exit. She couldn't leave now, not until the man and his wife were gone\u2014it would be too embarrassing to face him! She contented herself with rearranging the items she had tried on, neatly hanging and folding, certain she would not be buying any of these slutty outfits today.\n\nHer breathing and heart rate began to slow only after the woman exited the dressing room without a confrontation. Gwen waited another five minutes before making her own escape, furtively looking left and right, anxious to avoid the couple if they had decided to continue shopping. She surprised herself by willingly tempting disaster and staying long enough to purchase many of the items she had tried on, Gwen's perverted arousal again surging as she presented the decadent garments to the cashier as clear proof that she was slutty enough to wear these! \n\nAdrenaline-fueled giddiness pulsed through her as she pulled out of the parking lot and on to the road home. She had not felt this way since the first time she had gone horse jumping without her parent's knowledge. The same exultation at being a part of something so risky, so dangerous, so forbidden...I'll bet you wouldn't be so happy if that woman had known that you were showing her husband your naked body, the Lady grumped. What if she had taken exception to it? What then?\n\nHe didn't have to look, the Slut countered. \n\nGwen knew there was another feeling this time that the horse jumping had not produced, however. She was almost painfully aware of an intense sexual need that would likely produce a memorable orgasm, and the reliving of this event would produce others. Her hand strayed to her denim-covered crotch more than once, the Lady reminding her of the need for two hands on the wheel each time. \n\nHer headlights swept across the row of vehicles in front of the shop as she made the turn up the driveway. Tim's truck was still absent, but Cliff's was parked at the end of the shop, where it normally sat on workdays. Either he had gone with Tim to the Planning Board meeting, or was still here, working on something...the shop was dark, though. She could just make out three towels hanging over the pool fence like signal flags that some of the boys had been swimming in her absence. Was Cliff still up there? Her heart thudded as she idled the vehicle and checked her phone for a string of text messages that had come in while she was on the way back\u2014no texting and driving for the Nelson family!\n\ntaking forever\n\nnot sure when Ill be home\n\ndont wait up\n\nlove you\n\nNo mention as to whether Cliff was with her husband. Gwen bit her lip, then turned off the engine and opened the door. The Lady instructed her to call out in case the pool was still in use and the swimmers not decent; the Slut advised stealth for a greater chance of an accidental encounter. She closed the truck door just enough to turn off the dome light and made her way up the hillock. \n\nTo her disappointment, the pool water was still and the hung towels dry, clear signs nobody had been up here for quite a while. Cliff must be with Tim, she decided.\n\nThe sexual heat from her dressing room display had not lessened on her drive home, and the brief hope of accidentally catching the muscular black man in a compromising position had made it flare. The right thing to do, of course, would be to wait until her husband got home and satisfy her lust that way, but there was no telling when he would return and whether he would be in the mood to take her when he did. Her toys might be the thing to take the edge off; but what if the men returned in the middle of her debauched activity? Her palm and fingers, under the covers in a darkened room, seemed her safest bet. But maybe a swim first...\n\nIt seemed too much trouble to go all the way down to the house and change into a bathing suit. As long as she was quick about it, she could be in and out and back to the house before they came back, and if they did show up early, she would have time to get dressed before they discovered her. Gwen stepped farther up the pool deck to a point where she was sure no one in the yard would be able to see her, disrobed, and dropped into the water with a small splash. While the water was cool enough to refresh after the heat of the day but not chill, it did nothing for the sexual fire that raged. The nude woman swam to the other side, to where she knew the filter jet lay just beneath the surface. I'll still have time to get out and get dressed if anyone comes, Gwen reasoned as her elbows and forearms were positioned on the edge to allow her mons and clitoris to be pounded by the forceful underwater stream. What was the man who had seen her naked doing now, she wondered? Were he and his wife making love, or was he touching himself, images of Gwen fueling his lust? Her mental wanderings switched to an image of him masturbating right there in the dressing room corridor even as her climax began. \n\nGwen grit her teeth and rode the orgasmic waves as her hips involuntarily twitched against her watery tormentor. The intensity became too much to bear and the semi-coherent woman turned her body enough to take her out of the jet's outflow, the swirling water nearby still creating sensations on her sensitive skin. \n\nOnly now did the danger of her morally corrupt actions in the store begin to occupy her thoughts as she climbed the pool stairs on unsteady legs, her lust no longer able to mask the fact that she had again willingly exposed herself to another man. Still, the Lady shook her head in disbelief as Gwen reached for one of the hanging towels and began to dry herself, the idea that the fabric drying her skin may have done the same for a young man's sexual parts just a short time ago. \n\nGwen gathered the other towels from the fence and made her way down to the house, deciding to dress and come back up for her clothes after she had deposited her current load in the hamper. Task completed, the Slut pushed her to push the envelope a bit further, to forego a change and just go back up to the pool for the things she left. Gwen accepted, but drew the line at doing barn chores in the nude\u2014to be that far from the house if Tim and Cliff were to come back was just plain crazy. In the end, she had been in bed for an hour before the men returned, the sound of one truck pulling into the yard followed shortly after by another leaving muffled by the hum and woosh of the central air. \n\nThe Slut pointed out how wise her decision to take care of herself earlier had been after Tim quietly entered the bedroom, undressed, climbed into bed and kissed her, then fell asleep. \n\nGwen fretted the next two evenings as after-hours emergency calls kept Tim out late, delaying her need to show her husband\u2014and herself\u2014just how much she loved and desired him despite her perverse behavior. Others may get to see her, she subconsciously acknowledged, but only he could have her. \n\nNatalie was right on time the next morning, again wearing a shirt that struggled to contain the breasts beneath it, again removing even that little cover before leaving the barn. Gwen followed suit shortly after. \n\n\"You ever ride naked?\"\n\nGwen turned in surprise. \"Huh? Out here? Oh, no, I never have.\"\n\n\"Ever think about it?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would be that comfortable,\" Gwen replied after regaining her composure. \"No matter how broken in the leather is on these western saddles, there's so much, I'd think your thighs and your, uhh, privates, would stick once they got sweaty.\"\n\nNatalie laughed. \"Yeah, I suppose that's true.\" \n\n\"I did an English saddle without any clothes a couple of times.\" Gwen cursed the fact her words had completely bypassed her modesty filter.\n\nIt was Natalie's turn to be surprised. \"You did? When?\"\n\nGwen replied slowly, kicking herself for saying anything in the first place. \"Well, Miss Ritter made me do that in the indoor riding ring between our apartments. She said it would be a good reminder to keep my bottom off the saddle and in a good riding position.\"\n\n\"Wow! Weren't you scared you'd get caught?\"\n\n\"I was petrified. I guess she made sure nobody would be around the nights she had me do that.\" \n\n\"And you didn't wear anything?\"\n\n\"Just my riding boots and a pair of gloves.\"\n\n\"Sorry Gwen, I'm sure it wasn't the most pleasant experience for you, but that sounds incredibly hot.\" \n\n\"I guess it wasn't too bad...at least she let me get dressed to put my horse away.\" ",
        "The two rode in silence for another quarter mile. \"Ever hear of anyone getting an orgasm when they were out riding?\" \n\nGwen laughed in shock. \"Good heavens Natalie, what's with you today? I mean, what kind of question is that?\" \n\n\"Just a question. I mean, you've got this big ole' hunk of leather between your legs, you got this saddlehorn conveniently placed to apply some extra pressure...you mean to tell me no girl has ever made use of that?\" \n\n\"Not that I know of. I'd tell you that if you'd like to be the first to try, go ahead, but I'm afraid you'd fall off and hurt yourself.\" \n\nFair enough. Sorry, but Adam's been way too busy lately, and my toys are starting to get stale. I guess I'm looking for something a little change-of-pace, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Maybe you could go see Liz?\" Gwen marveled at how casually she could suggest her sister-in-law go have lesbian sex. \n\n\"If I could get away that long...\" \n\nThe pair talked of more mundane matters as they climbed to the picnic table, Gwen wondering if she had chosen this path for something other than the view. They sat mostly in silence, their exposed skin soaking in the rays, until the heat became too much. Gwen laughed at the idea anything could have happened as they began the trip down. The barn was reached, horses put out in the paddock, a bottle of wine was produced, and the two now naked women lounged in the pool as a storm began to roll in. \n\n\"We might want to get out before the storm hits,\" Gwen suggested as the sun disappeared behind a particularly dark cloud.\n\n\"Might not be a bad idea. I've got some spare time\u2014need a trim?\" \n\n\"Oh\u2014uh, you mean right now?\" She could hear the Lady squawking warnings.\n\n\"Why not? We're dressed for it.\"\n\n\"Umm, okay, sure, I guess, why not?\" \n\nNatalie gathered up the wine bottle and glasses while Gwen went ahead to gather up the needed materials. \n\n\"Me first,\" the busty blonde declared as she flopped back on the bed and spread herself wide. \"You need the practice anyways, right?\" \n\n\"I can do that,\" Gwen declared with more conviction that she felt, and began to work. Her hands were steadier than the week before, her strokes every bit as careful and measured. \n\n\"I think you're getting' it,\" Natalie declared from propped-up elbows, taking sips of wine when Gwen withdrew to rinse the blade. \n\nThe last drag of the razor was made and Gwen removed the excess shaving gel with a towel before taking the required swipe of her finger through the very slick slit in front of her, something she was only too happy to do, she was ashamed to admit. The smell of female sexuality was clear, and Gwen wondered whose it was. \n\n\"Oil?\"\n\nGwen looked up to see Natalie smiling down at her. \"Oh, yes, of course.\" She spent more time than necessary rubbing it in to the newly-shaven skin, marveling at the way the tissue underneath moved beneath her touch, only stopping when her fingers stopped gliding freely. \n\n\"Thanks! Your turn.\"\n\nGwen replaced her sister-in-law on the bed and Natalie returned the favor, expertly removing what little growth had occurred in the last week before her finger made three slow passes between her wet folds. The baby oil was applied and thoroughly worked in, Gwen making every effort not to flex her hips up into her sister-in-law's palm when it covered her mound. Lady and Slut debated vigorously whether it would be proper to announce her need to masturbate. \n\n\"All set,\" Natalie announced softly. She didn't rise from her spot between Gwen's outstretched thighs. \"Listen, I, uhh, I'd like to take care of something before I go to work. Would you mind if I borrowed one of your vibrators? I can go in the bathroom,\" she added hurriedly.\n\n\"Of course you can borrow one!\" Gwen cried as she rolled off the bed and towards the closet. \"But you don't have to leave! Just use it here.\" \n\n\"Oh\u2014okay, I just kinda thought you might be freaked out by another woman doing that on your bed.\"\n\nGwen hesitated at the closet doorway. She imagined the Lady bound and gagged on one shoulder, the Slut smiling broadly on the other. \"It won't bother me at all. I do more than just sleep on that bed, too,\" she offered as saucily as she could manage. As a matter of fact,\" she added slowly as she reached into the boot containing the immense rubber penis, \"would it be alright with you if I did it too? If you think the bed's big enough?\"\n\nNatalie smiled. \"It's plenty big enough. Are you sure?\"\n\nGwen couldn't bear to make eye contact as she dumped her toys on the bed. \"I'm sure. I'd like to see how you, umm, do it, without a blanket in the way. So I know I'm doing it right.\" \n\nThe two women stood there, Natalie smiling, Gwen nervously looking around the room. \"So, uhh, how do we start?\"\n\n\"Well, if you're just interested in watching\u2014\" Natalie paused to check her sister-in-law's reaction for the possibility there might be something more\u2014\"then let's make sure you get a good view. Toss me three of those pillows.\" Gwen did as asked, and Natalie placed them one on top of the other at one end of the bed. \"Okay, choose your weapon.\" Gwen looked up in confusion. \"Which vibrator would you like to use?\"\n\n\"Oh-oh, that. You're my guest, please, you pick.\" Natalie chuckled at the woman's outstanding sense of manners even in this situation. \n\n\"Alright, I'll take the Rabbit and Mr. Wonderful here, or did you ever name him?\" Gwen blushed furiously and shook her head. \"Go plug yours in.\" Natalie hopped on the bed and lay back on the pillows, feet facing the headboard. \"Okay, you lay at the other end with your feet facing me.\" It took Gwen's shaking hand some time to properly fit the plug into the socket before she lay down parallel to her sister-in-law, her feet even with the side of the woman's flattened breasts. \"Now, move over so you can put your feet on mine.\" Natalie bent her legs at the knee to make room. \"Scooch up and lean against the headboard. Gwen gingerly moved into place, her slouching position allowing her to look between her spread legs and down to Natalie's open sex, the dildo lying on the duvet between her thighs, pointing to her opening like some sort of obscene trail marker. \"Alright, do whatever you feel like doing. Watch, join in, it's all good.\" With that, her eyes closed and a finger began to circle the areolae of her left nipple while the other hand stroked and smoothed her stomach. It didn't stay there long, gradually turning circles until made contact with the tiny patch of fluff. A light scratching of her nails through the sparse thatch turned into longer strokes, her lips giving way to the finger being pushed in to begin stroking the bud at the top of her slit. \n\nGwen watched in fascination, her discomfort at being exposed and spread in front of her sister-in-law forgotten as the woman continued to stroke herself, a finger occasionally dipping low and pulling moisture back up with it. \n\nNatalie raised her head and briefly opened her eyes to find her vibrator, then flopped back on the pillow as an experienced thumb found the switch and started it humming. Gwen's finger began to lightly trace along her own lips, while she stared at the scene in front of her. She lost track of time as her sister-in-law pushed and ground the rabbit into her clit while her other hand kneaded the abundant flesh of her breasts more firmly. \n\nNatalie's head abruptly left the pillow while her eyes opened into slits. Gwen stopped the movement of her finger, suddenly conscious that she might have been caught touching herself. Her sister-in-law's hand let go of the breast it had been squeezing, red marks evident where the fingers had been, and reached between her legs for the black cudgel lying there. \"I've gotta be really wet to take this thing. I hate to use lube,\" she mumbled as the dark invader was firmly grasped just above the testicles and moved forward to where it just touched her lips. \"It's so messy. That's one of the reasons Adam only gets my ass on special occasions. How about you and Tim? You guys use lube?\"\n\nGwen's eyes alternated a couple of times between the giant penis between Natalie's legs and her face before settling on spot near her belly button. \"Uh, no, we don't really need it...\"\n\n\"You take him in the ass without it?\" \n\n\"Oh no! I don't...we don't...we've never done that...\"\n\n\"Sorry, sorry, I should have known that. Can't say you're missing much. Doesn't do much for me, but for some reason guys go nuts over it.\" Her head flopped back, and the tip of the penis rubbed up and down her slit while the vibrator continued to hum.\n\nThe head of the snake began to inch forward, pushing Natalie's lips apart, disappearing to just below the crown before stopping. It withdrew and began again, this time sliding up until the ridge disappeared as well. Again it withdrew, and again it was inserted, this time traveling even deeper. Yet again the dark length slid out, her sister-in-law's lips closing like a curtain as it exited, only to part again as it pushed forward until the scrotum bumped against the curve of her butt. \"Oh, shit, that feels good,\" Natalie moaned. \"I love it when my pussy feels full.\" From her limited experience with that monster, Gwen could certainly relate. \n\nThe faux cock continued to make slow, short thrusts for quite some time, Natalie's hips moving forward to meet it. Gwen's finger found its way back to her sex while the other hand toyed with a breast as Natalie climbed to orgasm, her head back on the pillows and eyes closed, lost in her own world. \"Oh God, I'm cumming,\" she finally announced through gritted teeth as she pulled her feet from beneath her sister-in-law's to clamp thighs tightly together. \"Cumming\u2014\" Natalie let out a soft wail and grunted her way through the waves of pleasure that jolted her. Gwen sat back in shock, unsure what to do. Miss Ritter had climaxed in front of her, certainly; But her pleasure was controlled, even as Gwen's face was planted firmly against her sex. Natalie had no qualms about letting it all out. \n\nShe finally stretched her legs out with a sigh, allowing them to lay across Gwen's open thighs, pushing them down and opening her further. \"Well, that hit the spot,\" she said through slitted eyes. \"I do love an audience.\" With cat-like slowness she withdrew her legs and rose to a sitting position. \"Your turn. I wanna see you cum.\"\n\nThe still-bound Lady recoiled at the thought of being the center of attention for this lewd display; the Slut exulted in it. Gwen couldn't look her sister-in-law in the eyes as she reached for the vibrator lying next to her and switched it on. Her eyes closed altogether as the bulbous head made contact with her clitoris. I'm going to perform just like I did with Miss Ritter, she decided before correcting herself. No, with her I had to for my job. With Natalie, I just really want to. \n\nThe powerful vibrator buzzed angrily as she applied it with force to her mons and clitoris. Gwen didn't dare risk a peek to check her sister-in-law's reaction, but the fact she was there watching was enough to push her up the slope to her climax quickly. Her hips had just started the rhythmic twitch of her impending orgasm when she felt a gentle hand on one thigh and something solid against her opening. Instinctively she tilted her hips upward to allow the visitor access, and it slid in without resistance. She grit her teeth and rode the breaking waves while the penis made short trips in and out of her and the hand on her thigh stroked. \n\nAnd then it was over, her senses returning to her, the bulk lodged in her sex still, the hand just resting on her skin. Gwen shut the vibrator off and dropped it to her side, too weak to move. There was a call to return to modesty and close her legs, but Natalie still sat between them.\n\n\"Wow, you could have gotten away with that in a library!\" \n\nGwen opened her eyes to see her kneeling sister-in-law smiling broadly. \"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"You were so quiet! It looked like you were trying to hold in a sneeze!\" \n\n\"Is that bad?\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not, I've just never seen anyone have that much control with so much good stuff going on in their body. Have you always been like that?\"\n\n\"I guess...\"\n\n\"I'd probably explode if I tried to bottle it up like that. I get so loud sometimes that I worry the kids will hear me.\" Natalie leaned forward until she was hovering over Gwen in a position that reminded the prone woman of the one her husband assumed when he was preparing to mount her. She planted a light kiss on her startled sister-in-law's lips. \"Thanks. That was just what I needed. Gotta get to work.\" And then she was gone, heading up the hallway and towards her car for a change of clothes. \n\nThe two women talked as Natalie dressed, Gwen aghast at how indifferent they both seemed to be to what had just happened. \"Hey, why do you keep your toys in the closet like that? It seems like a pain to get them out when you want them,\" Natalie asked as she pulled on her jogbra. \"Just leave 'em in your nightstand.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't want anyone to find them.\" \n\n\"If someone's looking in your nightstand, then they're snooping, and that's their bad, not yours.\" \n\nNatalie left a short time later, no further mention of the bedroom episode made. Gwen thought all afternoon about what had just happened, weighing the enormity of the situation, debating whether she had actually cheated on Tim, but managed to maintain her calm demeanor as the trucks returned. The last employee had left for the weekend and the couple had made their way back to the kitchen before she turned to her husband. \n\n\"Tim, I need to tell you something.\""
