        "The drive home had taken forever. One thing she had done right in the last few days, was to go to campus security and have them pry open her car door. After the party, she had run back to the dorm she had shared with Jasmine grabbed her spare key, a change of clothes, and headed for her car. As she drove, the frigid night air tangling her curls, Galynn liked to believe that she was doing the right thing. At least it was fun while it lasted.\n\nPulling into her familiar neighborhood, and into her parent's familiar driveway, Galynn could finally breathe a sigh of relief. She hadn't been home in a while, partly because she had nothing to say to her mother, and partly because she just didn't want to. Her relationship with her mother was tenuous at best, but she did miss her father. For a long time, her weekly calls with her father had been the only thing to get her through her lonely nights on campus. She was the first one of her family to go to college, and she never wanted to let them know how hard it was for her.\n\nWhen she slipped her key into the front door, and stepped into the living room with one small bag on her shoulder her father's voice greeted her.\n\n\"It's about time.\"\n\nHer father was a big man. Six foot even, but his presence always seemed much larger than that. As a girl she could remember being terrified of his booming voice. Strangely enough, it was a voice that he never raised toward her. He was like a gentle giant, until you pissed him off.\n\n\"Hey Pops,\" Galynn said with a smile in her voice. \"Isn't past your bedtime?\"\n\nHer father laughed. \"Of course it's past my bedtime. If you didn't drive so slow, I would be asleep by now.\"\n\nGalynn dropped her things at the door and moved into the living room to give her father a hug. He stood when she got closer, and his arms enveloped her.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\"\n\nAlan shook her head into her father's chest. \"No daddy it's not. Where's mommy?\"\n\nShe's upstairs.\n\n\"I was surprised when she answered the phone.\"\n\n\"She still surprises me too, kiddo.\"\n\nHer father flopped down on the couch, and patted the cushion next to him. \"Tell me what's wrong, so we can get this all sorted out. I'm sure you have classes tomorrow, don't you?\"\n\n\"Dad, it's almost four in the morning. I think this can wait until tomorrow.\" Galynn loved her father with all her heart, but sometimes she could do without his directness.\n\n\"So, what do I care? I've got nothing to do tomorrow.\" Her father had been retired for the better part of ten years already. To say that he missed working would be a lie, but while Galynn was still home, he filled his days keeping up with her. Now that she was out of the house, he had nothing to do but his crossword puzzles and go for breakfast with the guys. \"Let me have it, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.\"\n\n\"It's about a boy.\"\n\n\"Isn't it always?\" He said with a grin. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"I thought that he really liked me, and it turns out that he didn't.\" Galynn stared at her hands. When her father didn't say anything, she looked up. He had a warm smile on his face. \"Don't look at me like that, I thought it was for real. Like the stuff movies and happily ever afters are made of.\"\n\n\"Honey,\" he said as he patted her knee. \"Do you remember Jacob Mills?\"\n\nGalynn nodded her head. How could she forget? She was four when she met Jacob. She was convinced that they were going to get married and have babies and do nothing but kiss all day. She smiled at the memory.\n\n\"Remember how, at the tender age of four and a half, you found him behind your play house in the back yard kissing Melissa George from down the street?\" Galynn laughed and nodded her head again. \"Remember how you thought the world was going to end?\"\n\n\"Yea, until you told me to go kick him. That made me feel much better.\" Galynn and her father sat on the couch at four in the morning laughing at the memory.\n\n\"Exactly.\" Her father let out a heavy sigh. \"The idea of happily ever after changes as you get older. When you were four, it was kissing Jacob. When I was younger, it was nice cars and a big house and a beautiful wife who I could share my life with. It was to be happy. As I got older, I had to adjust my ideas a little bit and be happy with the hand I was dealt and the choices I made.\"\n\nIt was no secret her parents weren't happy in their marriage. Neither of them spoke of it, but everyone knew, even her mothers pet bird. It was pretty obvious. \"My point is, if you love this guy, or think you love him, then give him some time. Guys are assholes. We don't know what we're doing. We tend to think with our dicks. If he can't figure out that he's an asshole and apologize, then fuck him. You don't need that. Trust me. If I had listened to my father and realized that your mother was too much of an asshole to admit when she's wrong, I could have saved myself and you a lot of heartache.\"\n\n\"But I'm your favorite, most expensive mistake aren't I?\" Her father laughed and ruffled her hair.\n\n\"You know it kid. Now, go upstairs and tell your mother you're here.\"\n\n\"Dad,\" Galynn whined.\n\n\"Go, you know it's the right thing to do. Even if she won't remember it in the morning. I love you. Now go.\"\n\nGalynn kissed her father on the cheek and trudged up the stairs and he disappeared into the basement. Her parents hadn't slept in the same room in over three years. It still pained her to see her father suffering like this. He loved her mother; she just didn't have the capacity to love him back. She only had room in her life for one love, and that was the bottle.\n\nGalynn stood outside the door to her mother's room and sighed. She hated talking to her mother, but her father was right. Just because her mother couldn't get her shit together didn't mean that she had to be a shitty daughter.\n\nGalynn was thirteen when her mother let the story slip. She had met her father through a mutual friend. He had a nice car, looked good, and had an excellent job. Her mother hooked him with an unplanned pregnancy. Never one to run away from his responsibilities, her father did the only respectable thing he could do. He married her and made sure that his baby girl never wanted for anything. It always saddened Galynn to think about where she would be without her father constantly looking after her. He went to the PTA meetings, he went to her basketball games, and drove her around when she was younger. Her mother was never around.\n\n\"Mom?\" Galynn said as she cracked the door. The smell of liquor hit her hard. She tried not to scrunch up her nose at the smell. \"Mom, I'm home. I'm going to bed.\"\n\n\"What time is it?\" Her mother was slumped over in the bed.\n\n\"About 4:15 in the morning.\"\n\n\"You're not pregnant are you? Is that why you came home?\"\n\n\"No, it's not. I'm not pregnant.\"\n\n\"Good,\" her mother said squinting at her through the darkness. \"You still need to loose weight.\"\n\n\"Yep. Working on it.\"\n\nHer mother's words rarely had any effect on her anymore, but tonight they brought tears to her eyes. \"Good night, mom.\"\n\n--\n\nThe next few mornings progressed as she expected. Her father woke up at an ungodly hour to make coffee and fix himself breakfast, and her mother remained shut in her room. It was Saturday today, and it was a ritual for Galynn and her father to plant themselves in front of the television for college sports day, and of course, it was time for football.\n\n\"You're school must be going nuts, 'Lynn.\" Her father commented as he motioned toward the television. The Celt football team was coming out of the tunnel.\n\n\"Yep, everyone is in love with the Celts,\" she responded dryly.\n\n\"Why shouldn't they be? They've got that kid Will, who is a monster. Have you seen the way that kid runs through defenders? And Russell, he puts the ball exactly where it needs to be. It's amazing. Good hands, good eyes.\"\n\nGood hands is right.\n\nGalynn smiled and nodded. She promised herself she wouldn't spend this time at her parent's house moping and thinking about Alceo. She tried, she really, really did, but this was just cruel. She couldn't tell her father she didn't want to watch his favorite football team play; he would know something was up. So, Galynn would just have to sit, grin and bear it.\n\nShe disappeared into the kitchen to grab her and her father a beer. Luckily, her mother didn't drink beer, so there were still a few left in the fridge from the last time Galynn visited home. If she'd be forced to watch Alceo, she could at least be drunk for it.\n\nLet the games begin.\n\n--\n\nAlceo didn't want to be here. This was the last game of the regular season. It wouldn't matter one way or the other if they lost the game. The fans were cheering and his team was pumped, but he just couldn't get himself there.\n\nAfter Galynn left him standing alone in that bedroom, he gave her a few minutes then walked out to find her. He never did. He never should have waited. As soon as she walked away, he should have made her stay, and made her listen to him. Now it was too late. No one had seen her, no one had heard from her. It was as if she just disappeared.\n\nWill sensed something was wrong and told him that she had used his cell phone to call someone before she left the party. It had to be her family, right? Alceo didn't have the guts to call the number.\n\nHe showed Will the picture Jasmine had given to Galynn and Will smiled -- he had a good time that night too, but Will confirmed what he had been trying to tell Galynn. The picture was taken about eight months ago, and to his surprise, Will pointed out that the lockers and the locker room walls were a completely different color than they are now. They painted the locker room more than three months ago.\n\n\"C'mon man, get your head in the game.\" Alceo hadn't even realized Will was standing next to him.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Alceo responded as he pulled on his helmet. I didn't think it would be this bad, but I really miss her, man.\"\n\n\"Yea well, think about it after we win.\" Alceo nodded his head and took the field.\n\nHe had to do something drastic.\n\n--\n\nGalynn couldn't watch, and her father was going insane on the couch next to her. The first half had been murder. Never, had Galynn, or her father for that matter seen anything so terrible. Alceo had three interceptions, two fumbles, a safety, and two sacks because he wasn't scrambling in the pocket. She felt herself cringing whenever Alceo got the ball. Luckily, it was half time and both her and her father could take a breather. Her father was red in the face from shouting at the television, and Galynn was thoroughly drunk.\n\nAs the players were filing off the field, Heather Cox, an ESPN correspondent, grabbed Alceo. Galynn watched as Alceo had to stoop to hear the reporter's questions.\n\n\"Alceo, what's happening out there? Two fumbles, three interceptions, a safety and two sacks; your team is down by twenty-eight at the half. That's never been seen before for this team what do you see is the problem?\"\n\n\"The problem, Heather, is that I've got somebody on my mind, and its messing with my game.\"\n\nGalynn's ears perked up.\n\n\"Well, okay.\" Clearly the seasoned analyst had never had anyone admit this to her before, and she wasn't sure what to do.\n\n\"Who is it? Is it a loved one? Is a family member sick?\"\n\nHe smiled, and ran his fingers through his hair. Galynn could tell by the look on his face that he was trying to decide something. God, he looked good.\n\n\"Hey, do you have a cell phone on you?\"\n\nHeather was taken aback. \"Uh, yea.\"\n\n\"Can I use it? Its important.\" Heather looked at the camera for a split second trying to decide if she should. After another second, and Alceo looking at her expectantly, she fished the phone from her pocket and handed it to him.\n\n\"Well, this is unprecedented.\"\n\nAlceo looked at his arm, read something from the play card on his wrist, then began dialing a number.\n\n\"Who are you calling?\" Heather shoved her mic into Alceo's face. He shushed her. Galynn couldn't help but laugh.\n\nWho could he be calling? Galynn had never seen anything like this either, and was glued to the television just like her father.\n\nThe house phone began to ring as she cracked open another beer. He was probably calling Jasmine to propose. Well good, she could have him. Heather Cox was talking into the camera trying to explain to anyone that was listening that Alceo Russell had her cell phone and was making a call. She didn't know whom he was calling, but based on what he was saying, someone must have answered the phone.\n\n\"Lynn, its for you.\" Her father handed her the phone, while not taking his eyes from the television screen.\n\n\"Who is it?\" No one called her here. No one had the number. He father said nothing as she took the phone from him. \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hey.\" She knew who it was. Her stomach tightened and her heart caught in her throat. She turned back toward the television and watched as a smile spread across Alceo's face just for her.\n\n\"Hey.\" A second before she got her hopes up, she snapped back to reality. This was Alceo and he was calling her during a game. This was the same guy that had gotten head from Jasmine in the locker room after spending the morning with her. This was Alceo Russell. \"Why are you calling me?\"\n\nShe watched as he hesitated a second before beginning. \"I'm sorry. You told me the girl was nuts, and I didn't listen. I promise you that I didn't do the things you think I did -- when you think I did them. I swear, and I can prove it. I miss you. It's not the same without you here. Tell me you'll give me another chance.\"\n\nGalynn wanted to believe. I mean really, who would call during a nationally televised football game? This had to count for something didn't it?\n\n\"OK.\" She was at a loss for words.\n\n\"OK? That's it? Will you come back to me? I will call you every morning and every night until you do. I will make it up to you, I promise. I will prove it to you.\"\n\nGalynn could feel her father's eyes boring into her as he listened along with the whole world as Alceo spoke to her on the phone.\n\n\"OK.\" She truly didn't know what else to say.\n\n\"Thanks, baby. I've got a game to win.\"\n\n\"Try to hold onto the ball this time,\" she said with a smile in her voice.\n\nAlceo stared into the camera for another beat before hanging up the phone and handing it back to Heather. \"Thanks, Heather,\" he shouted as he started to jog towards the locker room with a big goofy grin plastered on his face.\n\nGalynn hung up the phone and watched open-mouthed as Heather fired questions at Alceo as she jogged after him. \"Who was that? What's her name? What is it you were supposed to have done? How will this change your game plan for today?\"\n\nAlceo ignored her as he winked one last time at the camera then disappeared into the tunnel.\n\n\"The reason you came home, that boy...what did you say his name was?\" Her father was staring at her.\n\n\"Dad, don't look at me like that.\"\n\nHer father looked back at the television then back at Galynn. \"Seriously? Wow kid. The star quarterback.\" He clapped her hard on the shoulder. \"Holy shit.\" He rose from the couch and walked into the kitchen with a huge grin on his face.\n\n--\n\nThe rest of the game passed in a blur. Coach was beyond pissed at him for being late to the halftime strategy meeting. Alceo knew it was his fault and didn't try to place the blame anywhere else. He promised his coach his head was in the game now. He apologized to his team and told them how they were going to win.\n\nThe game progressed as Alceo had said it would. When the team emerged from the tunnel again at the end of half-time, Heather and a slew of other reporters tried to stop him to talk more about his phone call, but he would just smile and tell them that he had a game to win.\n\n\"I don't know what you did, bro, but I'm glad you did it,\" Will said to him when they were back in the huddle.\n\n\"I called her.\"\n\n\"What? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you with your mouth guard in.\"\n\n\"You heard me,\" Alceo said after spitting his mouthpiece into his hand. \"I called her. I wrote down the number you gave me,\" Alceo pointed to the play card on his wrist and smiled.\n\n\"Wow. The balls on you, dude.\" The other guys in the huddle were shocked.\n\nAlceo smiled. \"Let's have some fun.\"\n\nHis team didn't hold the first half against him. It was hard, but they managed to do it. Without having to worry about Galynn, Alceo was able to focus and do what he did best. He just wished she had been here to see it in person. He threw two touchdowns to a couple of freshmen, ran one in and handed the ball off to Will for another. Seventy-three rushing yards for the guy on that one touchdown- things had definitely turned around.\n\nWhat he hadn't expected was how many reporters would be trying to get ahold of him after the game. Not only had they finished the season with an amazing record, but they were off to the Daisy Bowl. Then the NFL Draft. But first, he had to get through all the questions and hopefully see Galynn.\n\nHe smiled sweetly at Heather when she tried to corner him on his way back to the locker room. It was impossible to hear her because the roar of the crowd was so loud. She tried to keep up with his long strides as he headed off the field.\n\n\"So, Alceo, how does it feel to have just come back from a twenty-eight deficit and win the big game for your team?\"\n\n\"It feels amazing.\"\n\n\"Who is it that you called? Was that some motivation for you to get your head back in the game?\"\n\n\"It sure was, Heather.\" He winked at her and picked up his pace. The security guards stopped her from entering the tunnel.\n\nHe wished he could have remembered the second half of the game, but really it passed too quickly, but he had gotten the job done nonetheless.\n\nThe locker room exploded when he walked in. Coach tried to hand him the game ball, but he waived it off. He tossed it to Will. He deserved it.\n\n\"Alceo, I don't know what's gotten into you, but don't let it happen again.\" His coach was a big bear of a man. For half a second, Alceo was terrified, until his coach cracked a smile. \"I hope she was worth it.\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\nCoach clapped him on the back and smirked. \"I hope so. You are never going to hear the end of this. What were you thinking?\"\n\n\"That I had to do something drastic.\"\n\n\"You got balls kid. Next time sort all this shit out before kick-off, OK?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" His coach nodded and walked away.\n\nAfter the adrenaline rush left him, Alceo was exhausted and all he wanted to do was go back to his room and hit the sack. Unfortunately, the aches in his body wouldn't let him, and neither would the press. After every nationally televised game they had to hold a press conference. Trying to put it off as long as he could, he spent an hour in the ice bath and another twenty minutes on the table with the therapist working his shoulder, wrist and back.\n\nRelaxed, but exhausted, his shuffled into the shower. He wasn't in there as long as he would have liked, but he got the job done. The team manager was rushing him out, trying to get him to the press conference on time. Alceo changed his clothes and popped a couple of dry ice blocks into his bags.\n\nHe pulled his Celt hat a little lower on his head and stepped into the Press Room. He waited until he was seated in front of the mic to pay any of the reporters any attention.\n\n\"How does this win feel for your team?\" Someone shouted out.\n\n\"It feels great. Granted, it could have been a little neater, but hey, a win is a win.\" He knew the drill by now, even though he hated all the stupid and redundant questions.\n\n\"You're next stop is the Daisy Bowl. With a win there, you will most certainly be a shoe in for the Heisman. How does it feel?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I haven't thought about it. It's all about taking it one game at a time. After the Daisy Bowl is over, then I think about other things.\"",
        "\"Do you mean to say that you haven't thought about the NFL Draft either?\" Someone else shouted out.\n\n\"I haven't. I can only get there by doing everything else correctly.\"\n\n\"Does that include calling your girlfriend on national television?\" Alceo didn't bother to correct Heather when she chimed in.\n\n\"It sure does.\"\n\n\"What's her name?\"\n\n\"Galynn.\"\n\n\"Where did you meet her?\" Heather clearly had time to get her shit together since the last time she bombarded him with questions.\n\n\"OK guys, isn't this supposed to be about football?\" He coach asked as he jumped in.\n\n\"It was, until Alceo called his girlfriend on national television from my cell phone.\"\n\n\"Young love makes no sense,\" he replied as he pulled Alceo from his chair and shoved him toward the door.\n\n\"Oh, its love is it?\" Heather asked.\n\n\"All right guys, the quarterback is tired, how about we let him rest.\"\n\nThe walk back to his room was uneventful. The game had ended hours ago, and the rest of his team was off at a party celebrating their victory. Alceo honestly just wanted to go to sleep -- and see Galynn. When would he see her again? Would she call him? He was too tired to think about it.\n\nHe slid his key into the lock and pushed his way into his room. He pulled off his hat, shrugged out of his jacket and dropped his bag.\n\nHe turned to his bed and was staring at a figure lying on his bed. For a half second, he thought it was Jasmine, but then he recognized the curls. It was Galynn. And she was asleep. Really? He thought, she's asleep?\n\nSmiling like a fool, he pulled off his clothes, grabbed a hunk of dry ice and set it on his nightstand and climbed into bed. He tried his best not to wake her, but he was just too big get into this small bed unnoticed.\n\nGalynn stirred as he wiggled up against her. Her eyes opened as his lips pressed to hers.\n\n\"When did you get here?\"\n\n\"A few minutes ago.\"\n\n\"What took you so long?\" She asked she rose up on her elbow to look at him.\n\n\"Post-game press conference and treatments.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said looking annoyed. \"If I had known it was going to take you this long to get back, I wouldn't have nearly killed myself trying to beat you back here.\n\nAlceo kissed her again. \"We won the game,\" he said as he nuzzled her neck.\n\n\"I know. I was listening to it on ESPN radio. I really wanted this to be a surprise, but I fell asleep. So much for that.\"\n\nAlceo kissed her on her frowning lips in hopes of turning it into a smile.\n\n\"Believe me, it was a surprise. I'm glad you're here.\"\n\n\"Me too.\"\n\nAlceo snaked his arms around Galynn under the sheets. He was feeling a lot of bare skin. He raised his eyebrow at her.\n\n\"What? It's just my underwear.\" She replied shyly.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said. \"I am really, really glad you're here. Jasmine made up the date stamp on the photo. I swear it. If you want I can take you to the locker room right now to show that the lockers and the paint in there is all different. They changed the paint like three months ago. There is no way that picture was taken when the date says it was.\"\n\n\"I believe you.\" Galynn moved closer to Alceo.\n\n\"Really? Because we can go right now if you want.\" Alceo wasn't lying. He wanted nothing more than for her to believe him.\n\n\"Any guy that calls someone on national television to say he's sorry is ok in my book.\"\n\nAlceo attacked Galynn with his mouth. A moan came from deep within Alceo when their lips touched. Her tongue parted his lips with a passion that made her legs shake. Their tongues began to play together in a new rhythm, one of passion and need on both their parts. Alceo's hands moved to Galynn's hair as he tried to pull her closer to him still.\n\nForgetting that for half a football game he had very large men mashing him into the dirt, Alceo gasped in pain when he pulled Galynn with him as she rolled onto his back.\n\n\"Am I too heavy?\" Galynn genuinely looked worried.\n\n\"No,\" he smiled at her. \"You aren't too heavy, I was just run over by several three hundred pound trucks tonight.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Galynn replied as she moved more to his side. \"Where does it hurt?\"\n\n\"My shoulder.\" Galynn kissed his shoulder gently.\n\n\"Where else?\" Alceo liked this game. He pointed to his lips. She kissed him there too. She was so beautiful. She still had her glasses hanging off the tip of her nose as she leaned closer to kiss his lips again.\n\n\"God, you're beautiful,\" he said as he ran his fingers through her curls. He kissed her lips as her face heated.\n\n\"Where else does it hurt? I wanna make it better.\" He pointed to his chest. He watched as Galynn peeled back the sheets and tasted the flesh of his chest. Her tongue danced hotly across his skin as she left a trail of fire across his chest.\n\nHe pointed to his belly button, and had to grit his teeth as her tongue dipped into his flesh and teased him there.\n\n\"Is that it?\" He shook his head. He motioned for her to move lower, and she did. He could feel her hot breath pulsing over his cock.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this,\" she commented has she fished his cock from his boxers.\n\n\"Trust me, its hurting real, real bad.\"\n\n\"And how would you like me to fix it?\"\n\nAlceo had to refrain from growling. He wanted to stuff his cock in her mouth and make her feel it in her throat. She was teasing him, and he didn't know how much more he could take. \"Suck it.\"\n\nWhat started out as a game quickly had him loosing his mind.\n\n\"Just a taste,\" she said as she ran her tongue along the length of his hardness. \"Just a taste,\" Galynn said as she slipped the head of his cock between her lips. She gripped his thighs, opening her jaw as his cock slammed into the back of her throat. Galynn couldn't help but moan over him, looking up into his eyes as he pulled all the way out and rubbed the tip over her full, swollen lips.\n\nHer hand jerked his shaft in a tight twisting fist as her mouth engulfed the angry red tip. Her eyes drank in the natural tan of his smooth skin, the nest of dark hair that tickled her nose as he held the back of her head and filled her mouth with his length.\n\n\"Come here.\" It wasn't a demand Galynn was about to refuse. Galynn slid up his body, and Alceo's hands were on Galynn's breasts and pushing into her panties at the same time. His lips came down on hers at the same second his fingers plunged inside her. Galynn's mouth came open on a cry as Alceo's tongue thrust inside, tangling with hers, stroking and coaxing it to pleasure, just as his fingers were doing to the inside of her cunt. His thumb sought and found her clit, which he started rubbing in a circular motion.\n\nThe pressure was building inside Alceo, and he could tell the pressure was building inside her as well. He could feel the pump of blood in her clit struggle against his teasing thumb while her inner walls contracted around his thrusting fingers. It felt like an electrical charge was building insider her clit, which finally exploded as Alceo swallowed her cries with his lips.\n\nRipping her panties from her body, Alceo fisted his cock as he climbed on top of her, his lips never leaving hers. Alceo could feel the heat emanating from her dripping pussy, her creamy juices running down her thighs as she bit and sucked at Alceo's shoulder. Clamping her hands above her head, Alceo positioned the head of his cock at the entrance of her pussy. He slid his cock up and down her juicy slit, coating it in juices. He made sure to look Galynn in the eye as he slammed his entire length into to her tight, wet and waiting pussy.\n\nGalynn screamed out as his cock ripped into her. The pleasure was intense as Alceo's cock filled her to the busting point. Alceo was out of control. He could feel her pussy clenching around him, and he could feel her muscles contracting with each breath she took. Watching the emotions on her face caused his dick to jump. He could feel her cumming on his cock already.\n\nGalynn was going crazy, her hips bucking and grinding against the man that loved her as she came, her pussy juice creaming the base of his cock. The sensation was too much for Alceo. He started ramming into her as hard and as fast as he could. He grabbed a hold of her ankles, spread her legs wide and bore down on Galynn stretching her cunt even wider. Looking between them, he could see his thick white cock hammering in and out of her tiny, swollen chocolate hole.\n\nGalynn's mouth fell open in a soundless scream. He knew exactly what she wanted. She was coming again, he could feel it, her head rolling from side to side as she gasped for air, tears wetting her thick lashes. Galynn's entire body stiffened, and she stopped breathing and her eyes opened wide as she began to claw at the bed sheets.\n\n\"God damn, baby,\" Alceo managed through clenched teeth. As Galynn's body began to relax, Alceo flipped her over, and entered her from behind. He smiled as she cried out, with her tits slapping her chest. \"You feel so fucking good, baby. You can't leave me. Don't ever leave me, you're mine.\"\n\nGalynn moaned in response, because that was all she was capable of. Panting and flushed, her curly hair was wild. Her ass was spread for him, as were her gleaming pussy lips.\n\n\"Say it,\" he commanded. He needed this from her. He needed this now. Gripping her hips and positioning her right where he wanted her, Alceo slammed his shaft deep into her walls. He grinned as Galynn's breath caught in her throat. He slowed his thrusts, trying to give her time to catch her breath.\n\n\"I'm yours,\" she panted out.\n\n\"Say it again.\" Alceo demanded as he slammed into her again.\n\n\"I'm yours!\" Galynn wiggled her ass on him. She moved forward, causing his cock to slide out of her. Just as the head was about to slip out, Galynn slammed her hips back and ground down, burying Alceo deeper inside her.\n\n\"Fuck!\" she screamed. Alceo smiled. Everyone would know they were fucking. The thought sent him over the edge. Grabbing her hips and bracing one leg on the floor, Alceo fucked Galynn brutally, pulling out all the way then slamming is cock back in. The force of his thrusts were so hard, Galynn fell to her chest on the bed.\n\nReaching under her for her breasts, Alceo latched onto a nipple with his fingers and twisted as he pounded her tight pussy. Galynn was panting hard and cried out as another intense orgasm hit her. Letting go of her nipple, his fingers found her clit instead as his other hand left her hip to grab a fistful of long curly hair. His fingers rubbed Galynn's clit, just the way she liked it. And as her next orgasm began to build, Alceo thrust harder, making sure that he was going to explode when she did. He yanked her head back as he stuffed more of his cock into her swollen cunt.\n\nAs Galynn's walls began to contract, Alceo couldn't hold on anymore, his cock felt like it was ready to burst. He felt her walls close in on him as his dick swelled, ready to release his seed. Pumping into her, he let the first gush of cum coat her pussy. The next shots got her walls as he continued to pump in and out of her. His hands left her clit and held onto the back of her neck as his teeth latched onto her skin.\n\nGalynn was incoherent. Moans and sighs were all that Alceo could make out, but he knew how she was feeling. Galynn's pussy continued to milk Alceo's cock as spurt after spurt of his cum flooded her pussy. Finally, Galynn's legs gave out and she collapsed on the bed, Alceo not far behind her.\n\nTheir bodies were covered in a fine sheen of perspiration and Alceo could feel Galynn trembling from the aftershocks of her orgasms. Gently, he pulled himself out of Galynn so he could take his weight off of her.\n\n\"After that, you can't take it back.\"\n\n\"Take what back?\" she asked after a big sigh.\n\n\"That you're mine.\"\n\n\"Who knew you were so Alpha?\"\n\n\"I'm serious. You can't leave me. You're mine.\"\n\n\"I'm yours,\" she said again as she sealed it with a kiss.\n\n--\n\nThe two lay in bed, naked, talking about everything and nothing. It would have continued, but there was a knock at the door. Alceo groaned. \"Go Away!\" The knock came again.\n\n\"Don't worry, I will get it.\" Galynn got up, pulled on a pair of his sweats and pulled her t-shirt down over her head.\n\nWhen she pulled open the door, fury overtook her. \"What do you want Jasmine?\"\n\n\"To congratulate Alceo on an amazing win.\"\n\nThe girl had the nerve to try and step into the room. Galynn slammed the door in her face and was rewarded with a sickening crunch. She turned back to Alceo, who was laughing hysterically. \"Wow, who knew you had it in you?\"\n\nYea, who knew?\n\nGalynn opened the door to see Jasmine doubled over holding her nose as blood dripped from her face.\n\n\"Babe, give her this.\" Alceo tossed Galynn a chunk of dry ice. Galynn hurled it at Jasmine's head and it bounced off the girl's face.\n\n\"Here. If this isn't obvious enough, I will say it again. Stay the fuck away from Alceo, and stay the fuck away from me. Besides, I'm sure you won't want everyone to know that fat Galynn broke your nose, now would you? Go back to your hole and hide. No one wants to see a slut with a busted nose.\" Galynn shoved Jasmine away from the door and slammed the door in her face for the second time.\n\nBefore she could turn back to Alceo, she felt his strong arms around her. He spun her in his arms and a moan came from deep inside Galynn when his lips touched hers and his tongue parted her lips with a passion that made her legs shake.\n\n\"That was the sexiest thing I have ever seen you do.\"\n\nShe wrapped her arms around his waist but she wanted to be closer still. She threw her arms around his neck and wound her fingers through his soft shaggy hair. His hands trailed down her sides to land at the back of her thighs. He pulled her legs up and wrapped them around his waist. Galynn was shocked, but he just smiled into their kiss.\n\n\"I hope you don't think all that working out is just for me,\" he said as he bit at her neck. He lifted her bottom easily and pushed his sweatpants from her hips. God, there was nothing sexier than a woman wearing his clothes. When her pussy came in touch with his hard cock, he lifted his head and moaned. \u2028Leaning her against the door, he kissed down her neck and back up towards her ear.\n\n\"Oh, God, baby, I want you so badly.\" He started to move against her and he could feel his cock swell even more. \"You are so fucking beautiful,\" he whispered, kissing her earlobe and touching her thighs with his fingers at the same time.\n\nGalynn was swept away by her emotions. His muscular body excited her, and he held her so easily. She could feel his powerful hips and thighs beneath her legs as he pushed her up against the door. She could feel the swollen tip of his dick as it threatened to slip between her slick folds. She could feel his tongue trailing down her neck, and his teeth pulling at her t-shirt.\n\nGalynn let go of Alceo's head to wrap her fingers around his thick cock. With her other hand, she grabbed his shoulder as she guided his cock towards her wet pussy.\n\n\"Oh fuck,\" he moaned, leaning his forehead against hers as the head of his cock began to enter her slowly.\n\n\"Goddamn you are so fucking hot,\" he moaned, trying to not just push all the way in.\n\nGalynn moved her hips up, and when she let herself down again she impaled herself on his cock completely. She let out a gasp. This angle was completely different.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" she moaned, closing her eyes and wrapping her arms around his shoulders, \"you feel so good inside of me.\" The slow movements of his cock in and out of her made her feel light headed. Alceo's rushed breaths made her even more excited. He stepped away from the wall, fully supporting her weight as he hammered in and out of her. It was amazing. She never thought she could feel so full, or wanted.\n\nAlceo easily bounced her up and down on his cock as he licked her neck. Sensing he wanted access to her nipples, Galynn ripped off her shirt and tossed it. His teeth clamped down on a nipple as she howled his name. Hot damn, this man is an animal. Galynn was so close she could taste it.\n\nAlceo tossed her onto the bed and flipped her onto her stomach. His fingers teased the crease between her thigh and her sex as he held her down with his free hand. Galynn tried her damnedest to hold back the moan that was threatening to escape, but she didn't have as much control over her body as she thought she did.\n\nAlceo slid his hand over the swell of her pussy and pulled her ass cheeks apart. He shifted the hand on her ass and slid his open palm down the crack of her ass sending a shiver through her. He was touching her like he wanted to memorize each and every part of her body, as if he were afraid he wouldn't get to touch it again. Galynn wanted to say something, anything, but she didn't want to break the spell he was undoubtedly under. \u2028\u2028\n\nHis middle finger grazed her rosebud, and she felt a familiar shock shoot thorough her. He circled his finger around it and involuntarily, she felt my body lean back into his hand. He didn't stay there long as his hand continued its journey to its prize. \u2028\n\nAlceo's fingers spread her sex open as his middle finger eased along her slit. Galynn didn't try to hold back her moan of pleasure. His middle finger swirled in her wetness as he brought the moisture back to her clit while his other fingers continued to hold her open. She felt her leg quake as his ministrations with her clit began to cause a familiar tingling in her body. \u2028\u2028\n\nHe kept his finger pressed against her clit as he eased another finger into her wet cunt so slowly. Galynn could feel each knuckle as it passed the entrance. She was dripping wet, and I couldn't wait for him to finish what he started.\n\nGalynn could feel her wetness dripping in tiny rivulets down her leg when she felt his breath against the back of her legs. The rough hand holding her to the bed had disappeared, but it didn't matter. Galynn was right where she wanted to be. She heard him as he kneeled behind her, and she felt his breathe as he moved his face closer; her pussy was clenching in anticipation.\n\nGalynn knew what he was planning to do, and she was expecting it, but when his wet lips replaced his finger on her clit, she nearly exploded in his mouth. His hands pushed her legs wider and closer to his face as she struggled breathe. His tongue slipped into her sex as his fingers teased her clit. She was seeing stars.\n\nAlceo's tongue traced a very wet path from her sex to her ass as he reamed her out. The sensation was exhilarating. Galynn begged him not to stop as he flicked his tongue in and out of her ass as he shoved two fingers deep into my leaking sex. Galynn pushed her ass harder into his face determined to get his tongue deeper inside of her. Alceo moaned and nipped at her bottom with his teeth.\n\nHis fingers continued to seduce more wetness from her core as he planted loving kisses on her ass. He trailed his kisses further down her legs, then back up, landing on her pussy. He licked and kissed her juices from her skin, and attached his mouth to her leaking cunt as he tried to suck out more. \u2028Galynn's toes were curled, and her fingers ached from gripping the sheets so hard. She could feel her climax approaching, and it was going to be a big one.\n\nShe could feel the flush beginning to creep into her face and neck as Alceo's tongue continued to probe deeper inside of her. He kept flicking my clit with his fingers as his tongue tried to touch every inch of her insides. She could feel her pussy start to spasm and grip his tongue. She was almost there, and it was going to be earth shattering, bone-breaking good.\n\nShe almost cried when she felt him remove his fingers and mouth from her body. She was so close, she could taste her orgasm and he stopped. She was about to scream for him not to stop when she felt the head of his cock poised at her entrance. Just the feel of it's angry head rubbing up and down my slit and the knowledge of what that thing could do to me was enough to send her over the edge.",
        "The muscles in her legs clenched, and she clamped her jaw shut in an effort to stifle the blood-curdling scream that was threatening escape when he slammed his entire length into her. \u2028Her pussy was tightening and contracting in bliss as he rammed himself into her. She could hear Alceo sigh from behind her as he gripped her thighs tighter and pulled her closer to him. Slowly as if he wanted to feel each and every contraction of her pussy walls squeeze him tight, he pulled out of her then gently pushed himself back in. \u2028\u2028\n\nGalynn collapsed on the bed, knowing full well she couldn't support her own weight. Alceo was thrusting into her harder now, nearly lifting her off the bed with the strength of his thrusts. She could hear him grunting behind her as he pushed his length into her over and over again. Galynn called out his name as he grumbled under his breath.\n\nOne orgasm was about to fade into another and he picked up speed. He folded himself over the back of her body -- his hard stomach pressed to her soft back as he continued to jackhammer his hips into hers. Galynn's vision was getting blurry, and her mouth hung open as she tried but failed to get enough air. His face landed next to her ear as he her mass of curls to the other side of her neck and began to nip and bite at the sensitive skin there. She could feel his cock staring to swell inside me, and its increased girth was stretching her more sweetly than it was before. Knowing that he was close the edge, he snaked a hand under her and began to rub her clit, instantly exploding her juices all over him.\n\nGalynn couldn't move as she lay limply underneath him as he jerked and thrusted a final few times before he erupted inside of her. The feel of his hot ropy cum shooting inside of her caused her to moan in satisfaction. She could feel the heat of his cum swirling inside of her. \u2028\n\n\"Fuck.\" It was the first word he'd said.\n\n\"Fuck is right.\" Galynn agreed.\n\n\"At this rate, I will have you barefoot and pregnant in no time.\" Galynn stiffened. Seriously?\n\n\"Really? That's all you want from me?\"\n\n\"God yes. I want lots and lots of little Galynn's and Alceo's running around.\"\n\n\"When will I have time for a career?\" She was shocked by what Alceo was saying. She would love nothing more than to be the mother of his children. But was this just post-colloidal bliss he was spewing?\n\n\"I've thought about it. You want to be a physical therapist, right? That's what all the science classes are for, right?\"\n\nGalynn nodded her head.\n\n\"Well, you can be my personal physical therapist.\"\n\nGalynn had to laugh. There had to be more to his plan than this. \"And what makes you think you can afford me?\"\n\n\"I'm goin pro, baby, and you're coming with me. If you want, you wont have to work at all.\"\n\n\"I'll see it when I believe it.\"\n\n-- EPILOGUE --\n\nGalynn's life had been a whirlwind since that night Alceo called her on national television using Heather Cox's cell phone. It seemed as if everyone knew they were together, and it was impossible for Jasmine to ignore the happy couple now. They were always together -- like tonight. It was the first night of the NFL Draft. Everything Alceo said was beginning to come true, just as he said it wouldxs. Galynn was two months pregnant, and if her appetite were any indication, she would be having triplets.\n\nShe had opted to finish the last of her classes online, giving her more time to get ready for the baby. A lot of those plans would depend on what happened tonight. All the speculation had put Alceo in the first round, but who knew. She knew football, but couldn't entirely understand how they made that distinction. Quarterbacks were lacking in the NFL, and there were several teams that needed him.\n\nAlceo Russell sat next to Galynn and his best friend Will, their agents and their managers as the lights dimmed. He had a death grip on her hand as Roger Goodell took the stage. As the best running back in the country, and the winner of the Heisman Alceo had no doubt that Will was going to be picked first. All the sports analysts predicted it, and so had Will's agent, although that was his job.\n\n\"It is my please to announce, the first round overall number one draft pick for the 2013 NFL Player Selection Meeting is,\" he paused for dramatics, and Alceo thought Will was going to pass out. \"William G. Fanner.\"\n\nWill nearly fell out of his seat as he tried to stand on shaky legs. Galynn could do nothing but beam at him as grabbed her and Alceo into a giant bear hug then took the stage. Alceo clapped for his best friend and hooted his name with the rest of the crowd. Will would be playing for the Kansas City Chiefs. Alceo looked on happily as Will stood with his new NFL jersey to take pictures.\n\nAfter Will sat back down, still dumbstruck, Goodell took to the podium again. The second pick has gone to the Philadelphia Eagles, after the Jacksonville Jaguars waived their choice. They have chosen,\" Goodell paused again and looked down at his cards to confirm the name he was about to read. Alceo was squeezing Galynn's hand so hard, she thought it was going to break, but she said nothing. \"Alceo Russell!\"\n\nAlceo jumped up, grabbed Galynn and kissed her hard. \"See baby, just like I said.\"\n\nHe took the stage beaming. He said his thanks to his parents, and his agent and of course to the Eagles. The photographers stepped in to take his picture, but he hasn't done yet. \"If I could just have one more second, Commissioner?\" Goodell gave him a thumbs up. \"Thanks. I just want to say a special thanks to the love of my life for putting up with my moods, the bruised ego and body, and now, the egotistical NFL quarterback I'm about to be, Galynn Pierce.\" Galynn felt her eyes grow moist. \"Galynn,\" he dropped to one knee, and the crowd howled. \"Will you do me the honor of being my wife?\"\n\nIf Galynn hadn't thrown up already before taking their seats, she would have right then on national television. She stood speechless for a second under the heat of the spotlights as Alceo hopped off the stage and bent to one knee in front of her. \"Will you give me your heart? You know you already have mine?\"\n\nGalynn could have heard a pin drop.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted. This was the second time her man had gotten what he wanted by doing it on a national stage. She had to admit, the guy's got balls.\n\nHe produced a very large and very expensive ring from his pocket and slipped it onto her finger. She stared back at it and back at him as streamers began to fall from the sky.\n\n\"You planned all of this?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I had to put a little more thought into this, then I did a phone call.\" Alceo grabbed her, kissed her and dipped her for everyone in the world to see.\n\n\"I love you he said, you've made me the happiest man alive.\"\n\n\"Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Russell. Now get back up here Alceo so we can move on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Alceo hopped back up onto the stage to take his pictures.\n\nAs Galynn looked down at her ring, and he smile on her fianc\u00e9's face, she had to admit. The guy's got balls. But he was hers, and she was his."
