        "I know this seems odd. Your probably wondering right now why i resubmitted the same chapter. Well...I gave it the wrong title.  Originally it was chapter six. Obviously...its not. So I submitted it again to avoid confusion.\n\n\n\n\nThe past month had been a very enjoyable one for Cheyanne.  While her days were filled with classrooms and work, her nights were spent in the arms of her Irish man.  Whenever enough time was available, they both would step out of their normal routine and spend a couple of hours together.  Cheyanne seemed to really enjoy those moments she spent with Declan.  He would take her out and show her parts of the city she had never really taken an interest in before.  Everything to her seemed more exciting and new, partly because she now had somebody to share it with.  \n\nOn top of it, Declan had proven to be such a gentleman.  Whenever he had enough time off from work and the gym, he would always go out of his way to pick her up from her afternoon classes and take her to work at the caf\u00e9.  She couldn\u2019t thank him enough for it.  \n\nOn the rare occasions that he would talk about his personal life, he would always let her know about how his training was going.  When she had first heard that he frequently competed in tournaments, she had become concerned that she would have to deal with the many injuries that came with the job. But listening to him talk about how dedicated he was and how hard he worked reassured her that she didn\u2019t have to worry.\n\nEven though he didn\u2019t like to talk about his own life, he was always interested in learning about her life back home.  He liked to listen to her talk about her life back home and her family. From what he had heard, she had grown up in the same, modest two stored home for most of her life and that her parents had worked normal nine to five jobs.   It was interesting to hear that she only had one other sibling, a sister.  Declan grew up in a house with five other children.  He had suspected that she was probably very lonely as a child, but Cheyanne had told him that she and her sister were very close growing up.  She couldn\u2019t have imagined growing up any other way. \n\n It was the beginning of December now, and Cheyanne was glad that she no longer had to worry about her classes anymore.  She had passed her exams with flying colors and was in a celebratory mood.  But first she had to go to work.\n\nIt had now become normal for Declan to come by her dorm and take her to work after classes.   Most of the time he was in town for a client and would swing by for her in case she was running late or had been asked to take another shift.  Now it was just routine for him to come before she left for work.\n\nStepping out of her building she quickly scanned the parking lot before her eyes fell on the all familiar truck that she had gotten used to seeing.  A small smile spread across her face as she took in the tall figure approaching her.  She didn\u2019t know how, but Declan seemed to grow even more handsome every time she saw him.  Today he was wearing a black sweater and denim jeans, with a dark jacket over his shirt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d  She said through clenched teeth.  She tried rapping the thin sweater she had tighter around herself to keep out the cold, but it failed to keep out the cold weather.  She was a little unprepared for the sudden snow fall they had received over the last week.  White Christmas\u2019s in Dallas are few and far between.  Whenever the weather did surprise them with a little snow, it usually would be gone the next day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cause you need a thicker jacket, silly.\u201d  Pulling her into his embraced, Cheyanne rapped her arms tightly around him and soaked in his warmth.\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s so much better.\u201d She spoke into his chest.\n\n\u201cMi God, you\u2019re shivering.\u201d He said with a smile, careful not to let his amusement leak out. \nShe grunted.  \u201cHow often does it snow around here?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty often,\u201d he didn\u2019t bother to conceal his chuckle at her disappointed face.  \u201cWe usually get a good couple of inches during the winter months.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She grumbled pulled herself closer to Declan.  Running her nose across his collar bone, she was able to take in rough manly smell of him.  \u201cYou smell like sweat and grass.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did just get back from a job ya know.\u201d She continued to rub herself against him, making Declan extremely aware of how tempting her body was.  Leaning down he gruffly whispered in her ear. \u201cDo ya like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hmm.\u201d She nodded and looked up at him.  \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d She was now rubbing her hands across his chest, and Declan loved the way they glided over him.  \u201cGood.\u201d Leaning over her, he lightly grazed his lips over hers, before wrapping his hand in her loose hair pressing his lips to her.\n\nDeclan loved the way her plump lips would move over his.  Today he could tell that she had put on her favorite lip gloss as the hint of angel food cake teased his taste buds. His tongue teasingly played at her lips before he forced them open.  He couldn\u2019t help but let out a small groan when he felt her small tongue press back against his. There were day\u2019s he\u2019d swear that the woman in front of knew just what to do to drive him crazy.\n\n\nCheyanne couldn\u2019t help but get lost in Declan\u2019s arms.  With the way he was kissing her, and the way he was holding her, she had completely forgotten about the cold.  \n\nLately, their meeting\u2019s had been getting pretty intense; with their lips never leaving each other for a more than an hour. Any other time, Cheyanne would love to get lost in the moment.  Unfortunately, she did have some place to be.\n\n\u201cDec\u2026Declan,\u201d she spoke between kisses.  \u201cI\u2026I have to be\u2026At work\u2026in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nHe pulled back an inch.  \u201cThen that gives us nine minutes to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDec-,\u201d Before she could get another word in, Declan silenced whatever protest she had with his lips.\n\nGetting her hands in front of her, she gently tried to push him away from her.  With his arms tightly wrapped around her, Cheyanne\u2019s gentle nudges across his muscled chest barely registered.  Eventually, Declan released her lips and began placing light kissed across her cheek and down her neck.  Leaning her head back just a bit, Cheyanne appreciatively gave him more access to her throat.  She couldn\u2019t help but revel in the attention Declan was giving her at the moment.\n\n\u201cDec\u2026Declan please, I have to go.  I can\u2019t afford to be late today.\u201d\n\nWith a heavy sigh, he finally relented and released his hold on her.  \u201cFine.  Hurry up and get your fine ass in the truck.\u201d  With a light smack to her bottom, Cheyanne quickly shuffled to the other side of the car and jumped into the passenger seat. \n\nSince it normally took Cheyanne ten minutes to get to work on foot, the two easily arrived at the small caf\u00e9 in no time flat.\n\nAfter opening the door for Cheyanne, Declan quickly entrapped his woman in his arms again.\n\n\u201cYou see, now you\u2019re early for work, which means we could have had more time to do this.\u201d  He gave her a small lingering peck to her lips.\n\n\u201cYes we could have.  But if we had, I would have never made it to work.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at that.  \u201cYeah, guess your right about that one.  But I guess you\u2019re just going to have to make it up to me this weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis weekend?\u201d A little lump began to form in her throat. \n\n\u201cYeah, their closing the gym down for the holiday, so I figured you and I\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nConfused, Declan pulled back a bit.  \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell the thing is\u2026 I\u2019m going to be out of town for the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d He was a little confused as to why he was just hearing about this now. \n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She paused for a second and let the information she surprised him with soak in.  When he didn\u2019t respond she took it as a sign to continue.  \u201cSee, even though I talk to my parents all the time I still kind of miss them; and since I wasn\u2019t able to go and visit them for Thanksgiving, I figured it would be a good idea if I went and spent my winter break with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole winter break?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\n\nHe pulled back further and stuck his hands in his pocket. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFour weeks.  I know.\u201d\n\nDeclan cursed under his breath.  He could feel another headache coming on and pinched the bridge of his nose.\n\n\u201cAnd you conveniently failed to mention this to me because?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me I didn\u2019t mean to keep this from you like it was some big secret.  It\u2019s just been a crazy couple of weeks.\u201d  When he continued to stare at her she sighed.  \u201cCome on, you know how crazy it\u2019s been.  I know it\u2019s not a good excuse\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYour right it isn\u2019t.\u201d He snapped.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the truth. And besides,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s not like you share everything with me.\u201d\n\nDeclan straightened a bit.  \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh please, don\u2019t act stupid.\u201d She huffed and crossed her arms.\n\n\u201cWell for arguments sake, let\u2019s just pretend I\u2019m stupid.  What is it that I don\u2019t exactly share with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything!\u201d She said, throwing her arms out.  \u201cCome on Dec, let\u2019s be honest here.  I barely know anything about you. Okay, sure you may not be a complete stranger to me, but I hardly know anything about your personal life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know everything about my personal life. It\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not everything, but I\u2019d at least like to know something.  Something like what you would do on a normal Tuesday morning or what dinner with your family is like. Now that I think about it, in the entire time we\u2019ve been together you\u2019ve never once even talked about your family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you about my family.  How is it any different?\u201d Cheyanne\u2019s voice was starting to rise, causing a few passer-byes to take notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2026It just is.\u201d He fixed a few nosey people with some hard stares before turning back to her.  \u201cWill ya keep your damn voice down.  People are starting to stare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d  He didn\u2019t go out of his way to pick her up to have to deal with this shit.  Walking to his side of the car, he opened the door and paused. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans tonight, so you better find another ride home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I did use to walk here before you came along.  I\u2019ll do fine on my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheyanne I don\u2019t want you walking out at night by yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cTough shit.\u201d  And with a flick of her hand that she turned around and headed into the caf\u00e9.\n\nDeclan stood there fuming as he stared at her retreating back.  Just what the fuck had gotten into her.  Why the sudden need to know more about his family?  Things had been going fine just the way they were.  Then, all of a sudden, she needed to know what type of family man he was.  Oh hell fucking no. That was not how their relationship worked.\n\nThen how does it work. He thought to himself .Cursing under his breath, Declan finally got into his truck and pulled out into traffic.\n\nAfter hanging up her sweater on the coat rack, Cheyanne quickly shuffled around the counter and made a bee line towards Ginger.  She couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she watched her friend struggle with the blender.\n\n\u201cHow the bloody hell do you work this thing?\u201d She said throwing up her hands in defeat.\n\n\u201cGinger. Relax.  It\u2019s just a blender.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I know. Trust me. I know how to work a blender.  But this bloody high tech contraption is getting on my friggin nerves.  There are at least five different settings on this thing that I have never even heard of before.\u201d\n\nCheyenne sighed.  The blender, along with a few other electronics in the caf\u00e9, was recently upgraded to a more high tech model.  The owner brought them in hoping they would bring in more customers and increase efficiency at the caf\u00e9 as a whole.  So far they\u2019ve only proven to be a pain in the butt for some of the less technologically savvy staff members.\n \n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she smiled. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, love.\u201d Ginger graciously step back from the cursed machine and leaned back against the counter.\n\n\u201cWhat were you trying to make?\u201d Cheyanne asked as she looked at the contents of the blender.\n\n\u201cSome sort of caramel vanilla frap bean thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, give me the order.\u201d Looking at the order on the slip of paper Ginger had, she quickly went to grab the ingredients and began fixing it.  Opening the lid of the blender she peaked inside and took a sniff the concoction. \u201cWhew, oh yeah, that smells.\u201d\n\nGinger laughed at Cheyanne\u2019s face.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how you kids drink this stuff.  When I was your age, we use to drink coffee one way.  Dark, black, and hot.\u201d\n\nThe comment made Cheyanne roll her eyes. \u201cCome on Ginger, you barely into your mid-forties. You\u2019re not that much older than me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m starting to feel that way.\u201d\n\nThey both shared a laugh and then quickly went to work finishing people\u2019s orders.  The dinner rush would be coming in soon, which Cheyanne actually looked forward to for once.  It was the perfect distraction she needed.  She didn\u2019t want to have to think about Declan at the moment.  Really, though? How could he not realize how closed off he could be?  And then the way he snapped at her when she asked about his family.  He was being completely unreasonable.  But she didn\u2019t need to think about him right now.  She just needed to think about work.  Nothing else. Just work.  Yep, she wouldn\u2019t give Declan a second thought-\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\n\nShit.\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d She turned to Ginger who was leisurely leaning on the counter waiting for her order from the kitchen to come up.\n\n\u201cI asked you what you were thinking of.  You seemed sort of distracted.\u201d\n\nShe sighed.  \u201cSorry.  I just have a lot on my mind right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, does it have anything to do with that fine man who dropped you off?\u201d Ginger gave her a knowing smile.\n\n\u201cHey, is my order almost ready.\u201d Cheyanne shouted through the kitchen window. \n\n\u201cOh no missy, you\u2019re not getting out of this one.\u201d Taking hold of her arm, Ginger lead Cheyanne from behind the counter. \u201cHey Jerry,\u201d she shouted to a guy preparing drinks, \u201cme and Annie are heading to the back for a bit.  Watch the front for us will you.\u201d\n\nJerry nodded his head and waved them off.  Maneuvering their way towards the back Ginger pulled Cheyanne into the ladies bathroom and locked the door so no one could barge into their conversation.\n\n\u201cNow tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is going on,\u201d she shrugged and looked away nervously, \u201cme and Declan just had a\u2026small\u2026misunderstanding.\u201d Hopefully she sounded convincing.\n\nGinger wasn\u2019t buying it.  \u201cYou know as well as I that if you two really had a misunderstanding, you wouldn\u2019t be as fidgety as you are now.\u201d\n\nCheyanne relented and sighed. \u201cI know, I know, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201dshe grunted. \u201cHe is just being so unreasonable.\u201d\n\nGinger raised her eyebrow in confusion. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n\nCheyanne didn\u2019t really feel like retelling the whole argument but knew that there was no way of getting around it.  \u201cMy trip home was brought up on the way here\u2026and I had yet to tell him about it.  Suffice to say that he was upset about it, and rightfully so, but then he had the nerve to get snappy with me when I brought up the fact that he conveniently doesn\u2019t share things with me either.\u201d\n\nGinger nodded.  \u201cI can see why that would upset you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.  I mean, how hard could it be for him to just talk to me.\u201d\n\nGinger paused before speaking. \u201cMaybe he has a good reason not to.\u201d\n\nThe statement surprised Cheyanne and caused her to straighten.  \u201cWhat do you mean? Why would have to hide things from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you do know that he\u2019s a gypsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Cheyanne just shrugged her shoulders. From her friend\u2019s tone of voice and nonchalant attitude, Ginger could tell that Cheyanne didn\u2019t fully comprehend what exactly that meant for Declan.\n\n\u201cListen love, I know you haven\u2019t been here for very long, so I know this is probably all new to you.  But there\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to understand about gypsies and travelers. They\u2019re a lot different then you and me. No listen\u2026\u201d she raised her hand to stop the protest she knew was coming.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that we should treat them any differently because they act different.  It\u2019s just that there uniqueness causes people to think that way; that they don\u2019t somehow belong with the rest of us. Even now you\u2019ve got whole cities trying there hardest to kick gypsies out of their own homes, only to have them forced back into the city.  It\u2019s all in an attempt to make them conform to society.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeclan\u2019s family, the Irish Traveler\u2019s, their lives are based on old traditions and high morals that date back hundreds of years ago.  But with all the changes that are being made in the twenty first century, they\u2019re having a hard time trying to adapt.  Their culture is slowly dying out and they are trying their best to keep it alive any way they can, even if it means they have to secluded themselves and keep the rest of the world away.\u201d\n\nCheyanne stood there and let her friend\u2019s words sink in.  She had never really taken the time to understand what being a gypsy really entitled.  Now she had been given a crash course on the subject and was finding it to be a bit overwhelming.  Cheyanne was shocked to find out how harshly criticized they all were.  It was just blatant discrimination, is what it was. Upon hearing all of these things, Cheyanne was finally able to realize just how little she knew about Declan and his life.      \n\nWalking over to where Ginger stood, Cheyanne turned and leaned against the wall, allowing herself to sag against it.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026what you\u2019re basically telling me is that Declan chooses to keep secrets from me, because he feels like it\u2019s the only way to protect his family.\u201d\n\nGinger shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what are you saying, Ginger? Because right now, I\u2019m still having trouble trying to figure out why Declan feels like he can\u2019t share anything with me.  Why can\u2019t he just talk to me like he would with any other person?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re not just any other person.\u201d She said. \n\nCheyanne shook her head and cast her eyes down to her feet in frustration.  \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that, love.  And it\u2019s not exactly the easiest thing to explain either.  But trust me when I say that, if he could, he\u2019d have no trouble telling you his whole life story.  You see that\u2019s what makes you so special.  Gypsies never go out with non-gypsies.  It\u2019s just too much of a culture clash. But for whatever reason, Declan chose to break tradition\u2026 for you.  My only guess is that he doesn\u2019t want to tell you about his family and such because he doesn\u2019t want anything to come between the two of you.  He doesn\u2019t want you, the person he cares about, to start judging him like any other person would.\u201d\n\nCheyanne stood there for a moment, not saying anything, only thinking back on everything that had happened.  She inwardly groan when she though back to the conversation she had with Declan.  To him, she must have sounded like any other judgmental person he\u2019d have come across on the street, quickly sputtering out questions in an attempt to pry into his secretive world.  God she felt horrible, and stupid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, love.  Everything\u2019s going to be alright. You two just had, what you would call, a lover\u2019s spat.  It happens to all of us.\u201d She lightly patted her shoulder.  \u201cYou both will get over it. But you both better get over it soon.  It would be bad for you two to leave things unsettled before you left for home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, your right.\u201d Cheyanne said.  \u201cI\u2019ll apologize after work.\u201d  Straightening herself, she reached for the knob and opened the door to the bathroom.  Just before they walked out, Cheyanne turned and looked at her friend.  \u201cSay, how\u2019d you know so much about gypsies anyway?\u201d She quirked.\n\n\u201cI lived next to a gypsy family growing up.  They were lovely people actually.\u201d\n\n****\n\nAt nine thirty, the small caf\u00e9 closed and Cheyanne had just finished cleaning up and was readying herself to leave.\n\n\u201cHey Ginger, I\u2019m heading out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t need a ride home?\u201d Ginger shouted from where she was cleaning a few glasses.",
        "\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. You guys have a great Christmas.\u201d With that, Cheyanne turned and exited the caf\u00e9, with a chorus of farewells echoing behind her.\n\nShe only walked a few feet from the door when she finally saw the old trucked parked in front of her.\n\nCheyanne silently stared at Declan as he leaned across the front of his car.  His whole demeanor seemed casual to her, while she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little tense as moments of their earlier argument and her conversation with Ginger began to race through her mind.\n\n\u201cYou gona get in.\u201d He said stiffly.\n\nAfter a seconds hesitation, Cheyanne merely nodded and walked over to the car.  Stepping into the front cab, she quickly realized how warm it was.  The heat coming from the vent easily warmed the chilly feeling that she had gotten from standing outside.  The feeling almost made her relax.  Almost.\n\nAs soon as Declan jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, the tension in her body grew again.  She was trying her hardest not to look at him, but it was becoming increasingly difficult as the seconds past.  She could tell the he was still peeved from what happened earlier, and was ready to give him a much needed apology. But as soon as she opened her mouth, the small speech that she had prepared all day at work suddenly vanished.\n\n\u201cYou know, if you keep yar mouth open like dat, you\u2019re bound to catch flies.\u201d His tone was not humorous.\n\nShe needed to say something.  Anything!\n\n\u201cI told you I could walk home.\u201d  \n\nShe wanted to smack herself.\n\nDeclan lightly scoffed, barely hinting towards any other emotion other than annoyance.\n\n\u201cAnd I told you, I didn\u2019t want you walking around here at night.  Some\u2019ting could happened to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve walked out here at night before.  You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d He said sternly.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I could live wit myself\u2026 if some\u2019ting were to happen to you.\u201d The last part was spoken softly, as if saying it any louder would reveal some big secret.\n\nHearing that he cared about her only made Cheyanne feel worse about what she had said that afternoon.   She just needed to hurry up and apologize to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026about what I said earlier.\u201d Turning her head a little, she tried to peak at him through the corner of her eye.  His gaze was held firmly on the road.  As the seconds past, Cheyanne decided to continue when he didn\u2019t respond.  \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so pushy with you about trying to share things with me.  I understand why you can\u2019t.  We\u2019re just different-different people, that is, \u201cshe quickly corrected herself, \u201cand we just move at different paces.  What I might be ready to share with you, you might not be ready to share with me.  And that\u2019s completely fine.  I\u2019m not going to rush things with you.  I know that you\u2019ll open up to me when you\u2019re ready, and I\u2019m willing to wait till then.\u201d Reaching over, she lightly pulled his left hand off the steering wheel and held it in hers.  \u201cI\u2019m willing to wait for you.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything at first.  He didn\u2019t even bother to acknowledge their hands, only allowing his hand to lie limply in her palm. The long silence was beginning to worry her, and she started to wonder if maybe she had said the wrong thing.  Maybe her apology wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\n   A good minute passed before Declan lightly squeezed her hand and nodded his head. Silence continued afterwards, but it wasn\u2019t the same harsh silence as before.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Declan turned into the university and parked the truck in front of Cheyanne\u2019s dorm.  Tomorrow she would be leaving, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her for four whole weeks.  The thought frustrated him just a little.  He hadn\u2019t been expecting her to leave, and even when she had told him, the thought of her being gone still had not registered.  He had felt unprepared, and was still upset that she had not bothered to tell him.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s taking you to the airport?\u201d\n\nCheyanne fidgeted in her seat just a little.  \u201cWell\u2026I was going to ask Hannah if maybe she could take me, that is\u2026if you weren\u2019t able to.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether he\u2019d drive her to the airport hung in the air, letting him know that he could easily say no and let her find her own way.  He was still angry, and she knew it.  She was giving him way out if he wanted one.\n\n\u201cWhat time is your flight?\u201d\n\nCheyanne lightly smiled.  \u201cTen fifteen.\u201d\n\nHe curtly nodded.  \u201cI\u2019ll be here at eight.\u201d\n\nCheyanne didn\u2019t bother to hide her smile this time, and leaned in towards his lips.  But instead of the long lingering kiss she had expected, Declan merely gave her a small peck and turned from her.  Cheyanne pulled back in order to look at his face.  The set of his jaw was tight and his eyes did not waver away from the spot on his windshield he had suddenly taken great interest in. Obviously she wasn\u2019t out of the clear yet.\n\nFeeling a little hurt, Cheyanne quickly climbed out of the front cab and softly murmured a goodbye. Heading toward her building, she didn\u2019t have to turn around to know that Declan had already pulled out of the parking lot.\n\n****\n\nIt was nine fifty the next morning and Cheyanne was patiently sitting in her seat waiting for her plane to be called.\n\nDeclan was quietly sitting next to her, silently watching people pass by.  It seems that things had not changed since last night.  She had hoped that maybe a good night\u2019s rest would diminish some of the anger he had felt towards her.  Apparently, Declan was the type of person to hold a grudge.  She piled that away for future reference. \n\nThe ride to the airport had been a quite one, with only a few words passing between them concerning which terminal her plan was at and if she had all the necessary ID.  The ride over wasn\u2019t too bad, and finding their way to the terminal wasn\u2019t as bad as she had expected.  It seemed the hardest part was having to sit there while Declan gave her the silent treatment.\n\n\u201cAre you going to miss me while I\u2019m gone?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a moment.  \u201cProbably. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t be missing you as much if you had told me that you were leaving sooner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.  I know I should have told you.\u201d She said.  \u201cBelieve me when I say that this wasn\u2019t something I was planning on keeping from you.\u201d Shyly she looked down and her hands and began playing with a loos string on her carry-on bag.  \u201cYou just always have a way of distracting me.  We\u2019d always have so much fun, that I\u2019d just forget about the world sometimes.\u201d She nudged him lightly in a playful attempt to loosen him up.\n\nAfter a moment, Declan cracked a small smile. \u201cYeah, I guess I can be pretty distracting.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cVery.\u201d\n\nHis smile faded slightly.  \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026I wish I had known earlier. I would have been more prepared\u2026 if I had known.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? What could you have prepared for?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and shrugged.  \u201cI don\u2019a know.  I might have tried spending more time with you\u2026or something.\u201d\n\nShe laughed a little. \u201cYou already spend a lot time with me.  Really.  Plus, you have so many other things on your plate right now.  I don\u2019t expect you drop any of those things for me.\u201d\n\nHe turned his head and lifted his gaze to her.  \u201cStill. Being in this type of\u2026relationship\u2026it\u2019s new to me.\u201d\n\nCheyanne nodded.  \u201cIt\u2019s knew for me too.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, a woman\u2019s voice came over the intercom announcing that the plane to Dallas, Texas was now boarding.  Declan and Cheyanne both stood up as the others quickly headed towards the loading bridge.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Cheyanne said, \u201cfor taking me here.  You really didn\u2019t have to, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He said simply. \u201cBut I wanted to.\u201d\n\nShe nodded her head, a small lump beginning to form in her throat.  \u201cSo I\u2019ll call you as soon as I land.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d  The smoldering look Declan was giving her right now was making her feel light headed.  The small lump in her throat seemed to have grown two sizes bigger, and was now affectively blocking her air way. Standing there at the terminal, with no other choice but to leave, Cheyanne didn\u2019t realize how much she was going to miss Declan until now.\n\nNoticing the saddened look in her eye, Declan reached out to her.\n\n\u201cCome here, dove.\u201d  Declan effectively wrapped her in his arms and rested his chin on her head.  He knew exactly how she was feeling right now, because it was exactly the same way he was feeling.  Even though he knew he was going to see her again in just a few short weeks, up until this moment, they had been able to spend almost every day together.  It was going to be difficult not being able to be with her.\n\nPulling back just a little, Declan leaned in and claimed her lips.  Feeling there softness against his, Declan took the small moment they had to saver her sweetness.  If he was going to be living without her lips for four weeks, he wanted to at least have a good memory of what they tasted like.\n\nWhen the second call for her flight was announced, the couple reluctantly pulled apart.  Hefting the small carry-on bag over her shoulder, Cheyanne turned and headed towards the loading bridge, taking every moment she could to look back at her man before finally boarding the plane.\n\n****\n\n\u201cGuess who\u2019s finally here.\u201d  Cheyanne\u2019s father shouted as they walked through the door.\n\nThe announcement of Cheyanne\u2019s return was quickly accompanied by a loud chorus of squeals.  From around the corner, a small little girl sprinted around the side, effectively ramming into Cheyanne\u2019s knee.\n\n\u201cOomph.\u201d Cheyanne fumbled a little, but quickly regained her balance.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been missed.\u201d Her father\u2019s deep voice rumbled off to the side.\n\n\u201cI can tell.\u201d She said.  \u201cAnd who might this be?\u201d She playfully rubbed the small girl\u2019s curly hair.\n\nThe chubby face looked up and gave a toothy grin.  \u201cIt\u2019s me aunty Naynay.  Simone.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d She feigned shock and picked up the girl to place her on her hip.  \u201cMy gosh you\u2019ve gotten so big.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big girl now.  I turned four.\u201d The small child held up her fingers in proof.\n\nCheyanne smiled.  \u201cI know.  I\u2019m sorry I missed your birthday kiddo.  But,\u201d she place Simone on the floor, \u201cI did get you a couple of cool Christmas presents to make up for it.\u201d\n\nSimone let out another high pitched squeal, and turned to run into the living room she had just come out of.\n\n\u201cNaynay\u2019s here.  Naynay\u2019s here.\u201d She said in a sing song voice.\n\nWalking into the living room, Cheyanne was greeted by a few excited family members.  Upon seeing her sister, Cheyanne almost had to control the urge to scream like her niece had.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Her older sister practically pulled her into her cage like arms. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever ever move that far away again. I just can\u2019t stand you being that far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t live here forever.\u201d  With her head firmly held to her sister\u2019s chest, her words came out muffled. \u201cRenee, you have to let go.  Your boobs are smothering me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d She pulled back.\n\n\u201cCome over here college girl.\u201d From behind her Renee\u2019s husband, Aaron, pulled her away from her sister into a smothering hug of his own. \u201cWe\u2019re glad your home, short stuff.\u201d\n\nCheyanne tried to let out a sigh, but found that she could not muster up enough oxygen to create one. \n\n\u201cThanks Aaron\u2026.um\u2026can\u2019t breathe\u2026over here.\u201d She lightly patted him on his back in warning.\n\nHe merely let out a soft chuckle.  \u201cSorry short stuff.  Just glad to have you back home.\u201d\n\nCheyanne had to hold back a groan.  \u201cYou know how much I hate that name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut until you find some magical way to reach my height, you\u2019ll just have to find some way to get use to the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd unless there is some sort of magical bean to add eight inches onto my legs, I guess I\u2019ll have no choice.\u201d\n\nAaron was definitely on the tall side, averaging a height of about six feet three inches, effectively beating Declan\u2019s height by two inches.  As a young man, he was able to play college basketball for a few years before changing his focus to law.  People always managed to question his choice to switch careers, always stating that he had such a great potential to make it to the NBA.  But he\u2019d always reply by saying that if he hadn\u2019t made the change, he would have never met the love of his life.\n\nIt was in one of his classes that he had happened to meet Renee for the first time.  She was the student teacher aid for his history class and had asked her for her help in understanding the material.  Needless to say, it wasn\u2019t her brain that he was interested in.\n\n\u201cI finally see my sister convinced you to shave that beard of yours.\u201d Cheyanne playfully reached to touch his goatee.  \n\nAaron ducked away from her hand and palmed his jaw to touch the smooth skin. \u201cYeah, well, what can I say?  She presented a good case, and I would have been insane not to comply.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had no choice,\u201d Renee turned to her sister and whispered in her ear. \u201cI told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch me if he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Cheyanne backed up and raised her hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Renee continued, \u201cYou\u2019d look more professional with a goatee.  How do could people at court take you seriously with a bald head and a full beard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was winning cases before I shaved.\u201d He remarked.\n\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019ll win more of them.\u201d Placing a quick kiss to her husband\u2019s lips, she quickly turned and grabbed her sister\u2019s hands.  \u201cCome on, mom\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nFollowing her sister\u2019s lead, the two women silently walked in toward the back of the house where the kitchen was located.\n\nUpon entering the room, the two ladies quickly spot the small woman at the stove.  With her back to them, the smaller woman failed to notice the two other\u2019s sneak up behind her. As they approached the stove, Cheyanne was able to take in the warm aroma of several different foods.  Lifting her head, she lightly sniffed the air.\n\n\u201cMmm, is that pot roast I smell?\u201d\n\nQuickly whirling around, the older woman gazed at Cheyanne with a surprised expression before letting out a load scream.  Cheyanne couldn\u2019t help but scream along with her.\n\n\u201cWhaaaaa, oh my god!  My baby\u2019s home!\u201d Cheyanne\u2019s mother, Pam, excited shouted.\n\nBefore Cheyanne even had the chance to reply, her mother quickly pulled her into her tight hug.  \n\n\u201cOh thank you Jesus, my baby\u2019s finally home.\u201d\n\nCheyanne smiled and calmly endured her third suffocating hug of the evening.\n\n\u201cMom, mom, you might want to let up a bit.  Your hugging the life out of Cheyanne.\u201d Renee interjected.\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Pam pulled back but did not release her daughter from her arms. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy that my baby is finally safe and home.  I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I let your father convince me to let you move so far away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was probably thinking about how much he wouldn\u2019t have to pay since they offered her a scholarship.\u201d Renee commented.\n\nWith Renee standing next to their mother, Cheyanne couldn\u2019t help but notice how much they resembled each other.  Although her mother had grown a bit plump over the years, she still remained as beautiful as ever.  Renee was the same way in that regard.  Cheyanne was always jealous of how stunning her sister looked.  Both her mother and sister shared the same chin length curly hair and smooth chocolate skin.  The only difference between the two of them was there height, with their mother being the shorter of the two.\n\nWhile Cheyanne definitely got her height from her mother, it was her father she favored the most; not just in looks, but in attitude as well.  They both tended to laugh at the same jokes, watch the same movies, and enjoyed the same activities.\n\nAs if on cue, her father noisily stumbled into the kitchen with two of Cheyanne\u2019s bags in tow.\n\n\u201cExcuse me ladies,\u201d he huffed and dropped the bags onto the floor.  \u201cBut I do believe Cheyanne has something else she needs to be doing right now.\u201d Turning to his younger daughter and gave her a look. \u201cNow I know you didn\u2019t think I was about to carry all this up to your room by myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Donald, can\u2019t I have a minute with my daughter.\u201d Pam scowled.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my daughter too.  And I would think that she knew better than to let an old man carry so much weight.  It\u2019s bad on my back.\u201d\n\nWith a smile Cheyanne walked over to her dad and picked up both bags. \u201cYou\u2019re not that old.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now that I\u2019m surrounded by you young folks I\u2019m starting to feel that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAww, well if it makes you feel any better you can still think of me as your baby girl.\u201d\n\nDonald smiled down at her.  \u201cYou are my baby girl.\u201d He said, and placed a small kiss on her forehead.\n\n\u201cNow, you better go on up and unpack your stuff,\u201d her mother interrupted. \u201cDinner is almost ready and I made your favorite, pot roast with roasted potatoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere better be some macaroni and cheese over there, too.\u201d Donald added as he walked past Cheyanne and into the kitchen\n\n\u201cHoney, tonight is not all about you.  I made this especially for Cheyanne.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere still better be macaroni.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, just relax.  It\u2019s sitting in the oven.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you baby.\u201d Placing a small kiss on his wife\u2019s cheek, Donald made his way over to the dinner table and took his seat at the end.\n\n\u201cYou better hurry and get ready for dinner.\u201d He said. \u201cYou know we\u2019ll start eating without you.\u201d\n\nWith that, Cheyanne turned and made her way up the stairs into her room.\n\nAh, it was good to be back.  As much as she loved the little England town she now currently lived in, nothing compared to home sweet home.  She missed the sea green wall of her small childhood room.  Looking around she smiled at the old posters of teen pop bands she no longer listen to and the old worn out furniture she had since middle school. Yeah, this was home.\n\nAfter placing her bags in her room she headed down the hall to the bathroom to freshen up and place her toiletries on the counter before unpacking.\n\nWhile in the middle of unloading one of her bags, she heard a small knock at the door.\n\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d Renee\u2019s voice echoed from the other side of the door.\n\nGetting up from her spot on the floor, Cheyanne went an opened the door. \n\nShe gave her sister a look. \u201cSince when have you ever asked to come in my room.\u201d\n\nRenee tilted her head and smiled. \u201cYour right.\u201d Sliding past Cheyanne, Renee plopped herself on the bed. \u201cAhh, did I ever tell you how soft your bed was?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, which was probably why you\u2019d sneak in in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t act so sour.  We always had our best talks at night.\u201d She sat up. \u201cRemember that one night we were sitting in here and I had told you that I wanted to be a teacher.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd mom and dad had been working doubles because they were saving up for you to go to medical school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was so afraid to tell them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrified.\u201d Cheyanne laughed.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Renee smiled. \u201cTalking to you helped me buck up the courage to tell them.\u201d\n\nCheyanne smiled at the memory. \u201cWe certainly did have some good times up here.\u201d\nPicking up one of the smaller bags on the floor, Renee unzipped the top and began helping her sister unpack.\n\n\u201cSo how is everything up there in jolly old England?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cEverything is going pretty well actually.\u201d Cheyanne replied.  \u201cI\u2019m doing well in my classes, which is great since I\u2019m also working every week.  All in all, I\u2019ve got nothing to complain about.\u201d Taking one pile of clothes, she walked over to her dresser and placed the clothes in one of the drawers.\n\n\u201cAnd have you made any new friends while you\u2019ve been there.\u201d Renee inquired.\n\n\u201cI have actually.\u201d Cheyanne went on to tell her about Hannah and some of the crazy things that she would do.  She even went on to tell her about how Hannah had convinced her to go to the disco.\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d Renee asked. \u201cYou, miss bookworm, actually went out clubbing?\u201d Renee placed a hand on her chest and feigned shock. \u201cDear Lord, there must be a God, because he has definitely worked miracles on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeez Renee, you make it sound like I was completely boring in high school.\u201d",
        "\u201cBecause you were.\u201d\n\nCheyanne looked back at her sister.  \u201cThanks.\u201d She said sarcastically.\n\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Renee didn\u2019t even bother to hold back her smile. \u201cAnything interesting happen that night?\u201d\nCheyanne pause before answering. \u201cNope.\u201d\n\nRenee stopped in the middle of folding a shirt to look at her sister.  \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d Cheyanne answered as she continued placing clothes in the drawers. She didn\u2019t want to have to turn and face down her sisters observant stare. Her husband may have been the lawyer, but Renee sure knew how work someone like they were on trial.\n\n\u201cYes you are.\u201d Renee countered.  \u201cEvery time you lie you use one word answers, and your voice tends to get high and squeaky.\u201d\n\nCheyanne turned around with her hands on her hips.  \u201cI do not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. You do.  Now what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d She squeaked out. \n\nDamn it. Cheyanne could have hit herself.\n\n\u201cSee there you go again.\u201d Renee could help but smile at the look of discomfort on her sister\u2019s face. \u201cSomething big must have happened that night for you to be so shy about it.\u201d \n\nCheyanne didn\u2019t say anything at first.  She didn\u2019t know if it was good idea to tell her sister the whole story.  But then again, this was her sister, and she told her everything.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026something big did happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew it.\u201d Renee gave triumphant smile.  \u201cDoes it have anything to do with that guy that you told me about?\u201d\n\nCheyanne and talked briefly about Declan to her mom and her sister.  She told them they had gone on a few dates but she hadn\u2019t really elaborated on their relationship.  They didn\u2019t exactly meet under normal circumstances.\n\nCheyanne tried to hide the fact the she was blushing. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cOooo, I knew my baby sister couldn\u2019t stay innocent forever.\u201d Renee pushed the clothes she had folded off to the side and patted the spot next to her on the bed.\n\nPlopping herself down next to her sister, Cheyanne retold the entire story of how she and Declan had met. She didn\u2019t leave a single detail out and once she had finished her story, she couldn\u2019t help but notice that her sister was blushing too.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026I have got to say when you first told me about him, you made him sound sexy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\n\u201cBaby girl, you make this boy sound like some Greek god!\u201d Renee said excitedly.\n\nCheyanne started to laugh when her sister started fanning herself.\n\n\u201cGirls, your mother made all this great food. It\u2019d be a shame if you didn\u2019t get a chance to eat it.\u201d\n\nCheyanne smiled at her dads joke before turning back to her sister.  \u201cTime for dinner.\u201d\n\nThe two got up from the bed and headed out of the room.  Just before they reached the stairs, Renee turned and whispered to her sister.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think we won\u2019t talk about this later.\u201d\n\nWalking into the kitchen, Cheyanne saw that her dad and Aaron had already seated themselves at the table.\n\n\u201cTook you two long enough.\u201d Donald commented.\n\n\u201cWhat were you two ladies gossiping about upstairs?\u201d Aaron asked.\n\nLeaning down, Renee kissed her husband before taking the seat next to him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaynay sit next to me.\u201d Simone excitedly pointed to the empty chair next to her.\n\nCheyanne smiled and took her seat next to her niece just as her mother came in with the macaroni and cheese.  All the food smelled delicious and warm.  The effect of her mom\u2019s cooking was making her mouth water. Oh yeah, she missed having a home cooked meal.\n\nOut of the corner of her eye she could see Simone reaching her hand out to grab a bread roll.  \n\n\u201cUh uh,\u201d her mother reached out and patted Simone\u2019s hand away. \u201cNow you know better than that. What do we do before we eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Judging from the way Simone was chewing on her fingers, Cheyanne could tell the little girl was at a loss.\n\nLeaning in she whispered in her nieces ear. \u201cWe say grace-\u201d\n\n\u201cSay grace. Say grace!\u201d The little girl shouted enthusiastically.\n\nEveryone at the table laughed before grabbing each other\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cBaby girl, why don\u2019t you say grace.\u201d Donald suggested.\n\nShe nodded and bowed her head. \u201cDear lord, thank you for allowing us to gather here this day and share this wonderful meal as a family. I pray that all of us will have a wonderful Christmas and a great New Year as well. Amen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen.\u201d They all said in unison.\n\nWithout any further encouragement, everyone at the table began to fill their plates with mountains of food; except for little Simone, who of course needed help from her favorite aunt.\n\n\u201cSo how is everything going at school?\u201d Aaron asked.\n\n\u201cPretty good. All my classes are going well.\u201d Cheyanne said before popping a big piece of pot roast in her mouth.  Closing her eyes she savored the rich flavors the seemed to have exploded in her mouth.\n\n\u201cI knew they would,\u201d her dad replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a smart girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks dad.\u201d Cheyanne gave a small smile before letting her gaze fall to her plate. \u201cIf only I was smart enough to pick a major.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax, sis, a lot of people go into their first year of college with an undeclared major.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Renee said, \u201cBut I also changed my major. Which is just as normal as being undeclared.\u201d\n\nCheyanne sighed and popped another piece of pot roast in her mouth.  For whatever reason, they juicy meat wasn\u2019t as appetizing as before.  Here it was, mid-December, and she still hadn\u2019t figured out what her major should be.  Was it weird that she still didn\u2019t know what direction she wanted her life to go in?\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much short stuff.\u201d Aaron spoke around the macaroni in his mouth.  \u201cBesides, you could always go into my field.  You\u2019ll be a step ahead of all the others since you could get firsthand knowledge from me.\u201d\n\nCheyanne suppressed a smile.  \u201cYeah right.  I can\u2019t even manage to keep a straight face in front of your wife.  I don\u2019t know how you expect me to be able to do it in front of a judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s not for everybody.\u201d Aaron leaned in. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t take it too personally with your sister.  I think she has a sixth sense when it comes to people being sneaky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is probably why I always catch you when you try to sneak an extra cookie to our daughter before bed.\u201d\n\nHearing her mother mention her favorite treat, Simone perked up.  \u201cCookie! Cookie!\u201d\n\nThe room erupted into a fit of laughter at the young girl\u2019s enthusiasm. \n\n\u201cNow see what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Renee laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve turned my daughter into the cookie monster.\u201d\n\nAaron smiled. \u201cAt least now I don\u2019t have to hide the cookies anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cBaby, you couldn\u2019t hide anything if you tried.\u201d Renee turned and gave Cheyanne a mischievous smile. \u201cJust like Cheyanne couldn\u2019t hide her dirty little secret about her boyfriend from me earlier.\u201d\n\nCheyanne struggled not to swallow her fork and choke on it.  Oh my God. Her sister had now just opened a big can of worms at the dinner table.  There were no secrets within their small family, and now that Renee had let it be known the Cheyanne was holding something back, everyone would be on her like white on rice.  \n\n\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Her dad was the first to jump the bait. \u201cWhat boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Cheyanne couldn\u2019t help but stutter.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Her mom interjected. \u201cYou mean that nice boy you were telling me about over the phone?\u201d\n\nOut of the corner of her eye, Cheyanne could see her dad stiffen.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u201cI thought you said yall had only gone out on a few dates.\u201d Pam said.\n\n\u201cDates!\u201d Her dad dropped the fork he was holding onto the table.\n\n\u201cYes mom, we have gone on a few dates.  But thats what you do when two people are\u2026\u201d she looked back and forth between her dad and her mom, \u201ctogether.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow wait just a minute!\u201d Her dad exploded.\n\n\u201cNow Donald, calm down.\u201d Her mom interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious.  From what Cheyanne had told me, he\u2019s a very nice boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would you know that, Pam? Have you talked to this boy?\u201d \n\n\u201cDad, be reasonable.\u201d Renee jumped in.  \u201cThis is Cheyanne we are talking about.  You know she\u2019s not the type of girl to get mixed up in anything bad, especially boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI sent you to that fancy school to get your education, not mess with boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d Pam interjected.\n\n\u201cRidiculous? How am I being ridiculous?  This boy could be dealing drugs for all you know.\u201d Frustrated, he picked his fork back up and jammed it into his food.\n\nThe jab at Declan slightly agitated Cheyanne. \u201cDaddy, he does not deal drugs.  Why would you even say something like that? You don\u2019t even know him.\u201d\n\nPicking up his fork he pointed it at her.  \u201cExactly.  Why am I the last person to hear about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe because I knew you\u2019d act like this.\u201d Cheyanne had to admit that part of the reason she hadn\u2019t exploited her relationship was because she knew her dad wasn\u2019t too happy about the idea of his daughters dating boys.  When Renee had first started dating Aaron, Donald wasn\u2019t too happy about it.  It took several months for him to finally warm up to Aaron.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want you getting into any type of trouble because of this guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know daddy.\u201d Cheyanne leaned over and placed her hand on her father\u2019s. \u201cI know.  You don\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d She gave him a reassuring smile. \n\nFor a few seconds, Donald remained silent.  He didn\u2019t like hearing that his daughter was suddenly in a relationship.  She was always a quite child and hardly went out while she was in high school, let alone go on dates.  But looking at her now, he realized that his daughter wasn\u2019t a teenager in high school anymore.  She was a young woman now, and was capable of making her own decisions.  After about a minute of silent contemplation, he nodded his head a grunted.\n\n \u201cYour right.  You\u2019re a smart girl, and I know you wouldn\u2019t get mixed up in anything bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Cheyanne smiled. \u201cI am your daughter.  You should have known you had raised me better than that.\u201d\n\nAt that he had to laugh. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us more about him, baby girl?\u201d Pam asked.\n\n\u201cUmm, ok well\u2026let\u2019s see\u2026His name\u2019s Declan McCarthy.  He lives near his family in an area a little outside of town. We sort of\u2026ran into each other one night, and ever since then we have been hanging out with each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you two see each other a lot?\u201d Her mom asked.\n\n\u201cPretty much.  We try to see each other at least once or twice a week and we talk to each other almost every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d her mother gave her a knowing smile. \u201cSeems to me like your relationship is a bit more serious then you let on.\u201d\n\nCheyanne couldn\u2019t stop the smile that formed on her face.  \u201cYeah,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWe seem to be pretty serious about each other. At least, I think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too serious I hope.\u201d Her dad stated. \u201cHow old is he?\u201d\n\nCheyanne paused for a moment before answering. \u201cTwenty-two.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-two!\u201d \n\nAh shit, here we go again.\n\n\u201cDonald.\u201d Pam jumped in.\n\n\u201cUh. No. Honey, that man is too old for-\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald!\u201d Pam fixed her husband with a hard stare that made him stop mid-sentence.\n\n\u201cCome on daddy.\u201d Renee said. \u201cLet the poor girl talk.\u201d\n\nDonald sighed before continuing. \u201cFine,\u201d he grunted. \u201cDid you two meet at school?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t go to school.\u201d Cheyanne said simply.\n\n\u201cWell then what does he do.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe and his cousin own a lawn grooming business.  Usually they mow lawns and trim people\u2019s tree and bushes and stuff.  If you want to do any type of landscaping they\u2019ll usually be the ones to do it.\u201d\n\nHer dad only nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\nShe could tell her dad wasn\u2019t too thrilled to hear that Declan wasn\u2019t a student.\n\n\u201cBut his main thing is cage fighting, like the kind you see on TV.  That\u2019s really what he wants to do.  He plans on going pro one day.\u201d\n\n\u201cKind of like Rampage Jackson?\u201d Aaron asked.\n\nCheyanne nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he go to school?\u201d Her dad continued to press on.\n\n\u201cUm, well, with Declan\u2019s family school isn\u2019t really that big of a deal.\u201d She shrugged.  \u201cIt\u2019s just how they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d This time it was her mom that asked the question.  Cheyanne could tell by the look on her mother\u2019s face, on everyone\u2019s face, that they were more than a little confused.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Cheyanne said. \u201cYou see, Declan and his family aren\u2019t exactly what you would call an average family.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Then what would you call them?\u201d Her dad asked.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026they usually call themselves Irish Travelers.\u201d\n\nEveryone at the table continued to stare at her confused; except for Simone, who continued to happily nibble on her mac and cheese.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Cheyanne straightened up in her chair and sighed.\n\n\u201cGypsies.\u201d\n\nEveryone at the table noticeably stiffened. Cheyanne\u2019s statement was met with silence.  She knew to expect this type of reaction from her family.  Gypsies in the states, or anywhere for that matter, weren\u2019t exactly painted in the best light.  No one at the table knew how to respond to her statement.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Renee was the first to speak.  \u201cWell that\u2019s\u2026ummm.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent.\u201d Their mother finished for Renee. \u201cNot that anything\u2019s wrong with different.\u201d Pam quickly added.\n\n\u201cNothing of yours has gone missing has it?\u201d Aaron asked, causing Renee to pinch him in his side for asking such a stupid question.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t stolen anything Aaron, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying.\u201d Cheyanne snapped at him.  \u201cHe\u2019s been a complete gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheyanne, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said while rubbing his now bruised side. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\nShe raised her hand to wave off his apology. \u201cIt\u2019s fine Aaron. You don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d\n\nOff to the side she heard he niece ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gypsy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, sweet heart.\u201d Renee answered.\n\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d Cheyanne looked over at her father, who had remained silent this whole time.\n\nDonald had his hands clutched together and resting under his nose, staring intently at something on the table.  He didn\u2019t acknowledge that he heard her.  Just remained quiet.\n\nCheyanne knew that he wasn\u2019t fond of the idea of her dating anyone.  He had always been touchy when it came to the subject of boys, especially since she was his youngest.  But for whatever reason, she really wanted her father to accept that she was dating Declan, even though he wasn\u2019t the typical guy her parents had imagined for her.  She wouldn\u2019t know what to do if her father decided to forbid her from seeing him.\n\nAfter a few more minutes of silence, Donald unclenched his hands and slowly turned his gaze back to his daughter. \n\n\u201cDoes this boy treat you well?\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d Her voice came out a little weaker then she had hoped.\n\n\u201cA perfect gentleman?\u201d he pressed.\n\nCheyanne took a breath and straightened up. \u201cYes.\u201d she said more confidently.\n\nDonald slowly nodded his head. \u201cWell then, that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nCheyanne let out the breath she had taken and slumped back into her chair.  Looking around the table, she could tell that everyone else had visibly relaxed as well.  Nobody was expecting such a calm response from old Donald, Cheyanne especially.  But none of that mattered anymore.  A crisis had been averted; and having gotten past such a crisis, the Turner family continued to enjoy their dinner while avoiding any more stressful topics.\n\n***********\n\n\u201cOy, Declan, where ya go\u2019in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Da. I jus\u2019 got ta make a phone call.\u201d Declan said over his shoulder as he headed for the front door of his parents small home.\n\n\u201cA\u2019ight, well hurry up! Ya brot\u2019er har is tryin\u2019 on his new boxin\u2019 mits and he wants ya to see.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, Patrick began jabbing at his imaginary opponent with the bright red boxing gloves Declan had gotten him for Christmas.\n\n\u201cKeep punching jus\u2019 like that Patty.  I\u2019ll be back in a second to give ya pointers.\u201d  Opening the screen door, and then the outer door, Declan walked a few feet from the house and pulled out his phone.\n\nHe stared at his blank screen for a moment, contemplating whether or not he should try to call Cheyanne.  They had only spoken to each other maybe three or four times since she had left for the states, and only for a few brief moments.  Frequently, Declan would find himself in a never ending game of phone tag with her.  The time change didn\u2019t really allow them to contact each other at the most opportune times. Plus, today was Christmas, and he doubted she would be able to pick up the phone. But he had to try.\n\nSomething she had told him had been wearing on his mind since the day she left.  All winter break he had taken her words to heart and he felt that now was the time to tell her.\n\nUnlocking his phone he scrolled through his contacts until he came to her number.  Hitting the call button he pressed the phone to his ear.\n\nRing. Ring. Ring.\n\n\u201cCome on. Come one. Pick up\u2026\u201d\n\nRing. Ring. Ring.\n\n\u201cCome on baby\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\nHe smiled.  \u201cHey there dove.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d She sounded happy.  \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good. We were all about to open our presents actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, really-\u201d\n\n\u201cBaby girl, who\u2019s that you\u2019re on the phone with?\u201d Declan heard an older woman\u2019s voice say in the back ground.\n\nThere was a bit of shuffling before he heard Cheyanne say. \u201cI\u2019m talking to Declan mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell tell him you\u2019ve got to call him back.\u201d said a more manly voice. \u201cYou\u2019re spending quality time with your family.\u201d\n\nHe could hear Cheyanne laughing on the other end.  \u201cYes, daddy.\u201d\n\nThere was another moment of shuffling before she spoke again.\n\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d He said. \u201cI can let you go if\u2019n yar busy.\u201d\n\nThat was stupid to say.  It was Christmas day.  Of course she\u2019s busy!\n\n\u201cI can spare a few moments.\u201d\n\nHe could almost hear the smile forming on her face. God he missed seeing those cute dimples.  It made him smile.\n\n\u201cHow has your Christmas break been so far?\u201d She asked. \u201cYour family doing ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, ya it\u2019s been great.  Thar all do\u2019in great.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.  Can you tell them Merry Christmas for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026,\u201d he looked over his shoulder to see if anyone in the house was eavesdropping. Not seeing anybody, he walked further form the door into the front lawn.\n\n\u201cYa\u2026.Well, thar all sorda into thar toys and stuff.  It\u2019s kinda hard to get thar attention right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d the excitement in Cheyanne\u2019s voice seemed to deflate just a bit.\n\n\u201cBut I will tell them later.  I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to get the message.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d She said simply.\n\nOk, he needed to change the subject.\n\n\u201cYar parents seemed nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah thanks.  They can be a bit nosey sometimes, but you can\u2019t help but love them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I bet they love ya jus\u2019 as much.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cThey do, although they can be a bit over protective at times.  You should have seen my dad when he found out we were dating.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said a little surprised. \u201cSo I take it you told your parents about me?\u201d He stated.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cI jus\u2026wasn\u2019t sure if ya thought our relationship was that serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so serious about telling my parents about you?\u201d She asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not as I were ever keeping you a secret.\u201d\n\nNow Declan really felt like shit.  This was not how he wanted this conversation to go.\n\nHe pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cListen, I called ya because I have some\u2019tin\u2026important to say.\u201d  If only he knew how to say it.  What he needed to get off his chest wasn\u2019t exactly something he\u2019d share with\u2026anyone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d Cheyanne said impatiently.\n\nDeclan took a big breath and opened his mouth.\n\n\u201cRathkeale, Ireland\u2026.It\u2019s where me and me family usually go ta far Christmas.  Me mom has some family out thar that we like to visit during the holidays.  It\u2019s hard sometimes far us to reconnect since our people are usually traveling everywhere.  Christmas is one of those times where we get to see one another and catch up.\u201d\n\nHe smiled as he recalled on old memories of the many Christmas\u2019s he had spent there.  \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful over thar.  Lots of wide open spaces and fresh air. My sister, Darcy, she always described it as a winter wonderland.  You wouldn\u2019t believe how white the snow is.  Me and me cousins would love ta have snowball fights, but we nev\u2019a wanted ta mess wit the perfection of da snow. So much of it goes untouched, and it\u2019s jus amazing ta look at when the sun hits it jus right.\u201d He paused to bask in the memory.",
        "\u201cSounds beautiful.\u201d Cheyanne spoke after a moment.\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d He answered.  \u201cEvery year my mom goes out and gets my youngest sister Joanne new dresses for Christmas.  It\u2019s some\u2019ting the mothers tend ta do for their youngest daughters.  My mom gets at least\u2026\u201d he paused to count, \u201cthree dresses made each year, I think.  One of them tends to be red, cause it represents the blood of Christ.  This year, however, my mom didn\u2019t get new dresses for my little sister.  The twins, Patrick and Joanne, went ta thar first communion this year. So my mom spent loads of money to make sure they had the best outfits out of all the kids at church.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re very religious if you can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\nDeclan heard a faint laugh. \u201cI can tell.\u201d She was silent for a moment. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cBefore ya left, ya told me that you\u2019d be will\u2019in to wait until I felt comfortable sharing my secrets wit ya. And honestly\u2026I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019d be will\u2019in to be that patient wit me. No one.  Even my parents get frustrated when they think I\u2019m hide\u2019in some\u2019ting from them.  That\u2019s just the way I\u2019ve always been, though. It\u2019s just easier to be closed off towards people because then they won\u2019t be able ta find a reason ta hurt me family.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I dona want to hide any secrets from you Cheyanne.  I dona have any secrets wit ya.  I trust ya, and I know ya won\u2019t do anything to hurt me or me family.\u201d   \n\nThe line was silent for a moment, as both tried to gather their thoughts and feelings together.  Declan had certainly thrown a lot on to Cheyanne, and she hadn\u2019t expected their conversation to go in this direction when she first picked up the phone.  \n\n\u201cDeclan, I want you to know I would never do anything to purposely hurt you or your family. I don\u2019t know what else to say to make you believe that\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBaby, ya dona have to say any\u2019ting.  I told ya that.  You\u2019ve proven ta me that I can trust ya, and ya don\u2019t have ta convience me otherwise.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI care about you Cheyanne\u2026a whole lot more than I ever expected, and I want us to work.  Yar different from any other girl I know.  My parents, hell, my whole family doesn\u2019t really like different. But I don\u2019t give a damn any more. As far as I\u2019m concerned, when it comes to you, they can all just kiss my ass.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m the perfect girl.\u201d She said.\n\nAfter a moment he said, \u201cMaybe you are.\u201d\n\nCheyanne knew that he had admitted a lot in that statement, and she would be lying if she didn\u2019t say it made her unbelievably happy to hear him say those things.\n\n\u201cDeclan\u2026\u201d She began.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d\n\nShe gave a small laugh before taking a deep breath to steady herself.  \u201cYou could not possibly imagine what I\u2019m feeling right now. Hell, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m feeling right now.  I couldn\u2019t even put it to words.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs\u2026that a good thing?\u201d He asked hesitantly.\n\nShe gave a hardy laugh this time.  \u201cYes, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d He lowered his voice and whispered. \u201cCome home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am.  I\u2019ll be home before you know it.\u201d She said. \u201cAlthough I do wish I had picked an earlier flight now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn four days.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I pick you up?\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d She countered. They both shared a small laugh.\n\n\u201cCheyanne, you better hurry up and get in here.\u201d Renee shouted from the living room. \u201cYour little niece over here has been eyeing your present, and if you don\u2019t hurry up, there might not be anything for you to unwrap.\u201d\n\nCheyanne smiled and playfully grunted.  \u201cI have to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay baby.\u201d Declan said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be made if you didn\u2019t.\u201d She replied.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the line disconnected, and Cheyanne slowly removed the phone from her ear.  She calmly basked in the happiness of the moment before walking down the hall and into the living room.\n"
