        "Olivia looked at Louise and took another step backwards. All she heard was the name 'Sinclaire'. What she didn't know was why she didn't know that they were in the area and why her father hadn't told her. Then she realized that he couldn't have known and that didn't make sense to her. He paid people to track all of the big names in the vampire world and the Sinclaires were amongst the biggest; if not the biggest other than the vampire queen and her family. She belatedly realized that she should have put it together herself when she saw Thorne Blackwell.The Blackwell/Sinclaire split was well known in the hunter world for only one reason: If one of them was around, the other wasn't far away. Regardless of their past history, the two families would always back each other up. It was something that happened in the past more than once.\n\n\"Shit,\" she muttered as she assessed Louise.\n\n\"I promise that I'm not here to hurt you,\" Louise repeated.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nLouise let her shields down and allowed Olivia's hidden fear and distrust was over her. She lowered them even further to take in more of her emotions and then raised them again.\n\n\"Is it alright if I call you Olivia?\"\n\n\"I asked what you wanted,\" Olivia replied.\n\n\"Just to talk,\" Louise said. \"Do you mind if I sit? And by the way, you can call me Louise or Lou if you prefer that.\"\n\nNathan stood tensely in a corner watching and ready to move. It was the only way he was going to allow Louise in the room with the hunter. She hadn't liked it, but he stood firm. He finally had to admit that as much as he didn't like it, it was the way to go and Louise was more than capable of protecting herself. It was just that it went against everything he believed and had been taught about keeping one's mate safe.\n\nHe relaxed slightly as the tension in the room eased. A feeling of intense pride made his heart swell as he watched Louise begin to put the hunter at ease. He didn't know if the plan that Thorne and Ethan had cooked up would work or not, but it was worth a shot if it would save lives on both sides. He settled in to listen to the conversation between the two women as Louise had requested.\n\n\"Since you're going to be there, listen to what she says; I may miss something.\"\n\n\"I can do that... Lou, me not wanting you to do this has nothing to do with not trusting you. It's all about me keeping you and our baby safe. I want you to know that. You doing this is against everything that I've been taught and believe.\"\n\n\"Nathan I know that and believe me, if I thought for one second that I would really be in danger; I wouldn't do it. But I'm not and I maintain that she needs someone to reach out to her.\"\n\n\"So-may I sit down?\" Louise asked again as she glanced in the direction of the corner where Nathan stood and then looked at a chair.\n\n***\n\nHarry looked out into the darkness trying to see beyond the tree line. There were people in the woods camping. He could smell them and the fire over which something was cooking. He licked his lips and started for the door and then stopped. He reminded himself that it was because of his impulsiveness that they were stuck up in the mountains hiding like frightened animals. The distant sound of someone laughing reached his ears- a woman.\n\n\"Don't you even think of leaving this house,\" Nell said from behind him. \"We're here because of you, now get away from the damned door and don't think about vanishing.\"\n\nHarry turned to look at her and smiled.\n\n\"If you weren't my sister, I would kill you.\"\n\n\"Yeah well, lucky me,\" Nell replied sarcastically meeting his gaze. \"Step out of this cabin and I will kill you brother or not.\"\n\n\"Stop it you two!\" Mary said. \"This isn't the time to be fighting. William is out there trying to help us...\"\n\n\"Do you really believe that shit?\" Harry asked laughing. \"William is trying to save his own ass and the ass of that bitch. I'm telling you, he's in love with her and he'll turn all of us over just to save her.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't do that,\" Mary said staring at Harry.\n\n\"He would and I'll tell you why,\" Harry said. \"It's what I would do. The way I see it is that as long as we stay here, we're sitting ducks. I think that we need to scatter.\"\n\nNell and Mary looked at each other and then back at Harry. \n\n\"We agreed to wait for a certain amount of time before we did that,\" Nell said.\n\n\"You can stay if you want,\" Harry said, \"but I'm out of here. For all you know the hunters and every vampire group in the area could be on their way here.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Albert said.\n\n\"What?\" Nell and Mary said at the same time.\n\n\"I said that I agree with Harry. I think that William would turn us over to save his ass.\"\n\n\"This is what I think,\" Nell said. \"I think that you would agree with anything that went against William. You're still pissed because he took over.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it-\"\n\n\"Yes Albert, it does,\" Mary chimed in. \"I know that I'm supposed to side with you, but Nell is right. You're reacting out of anger and you're not thinking. I think that we need to give William the time that he asks for and leave if he doesn't show up. I don't believe for one minute that he would give us up to save a hunter no matter how he feels about her.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Nell said. \"I say that we stay.\"\n\nThe argument raged on for another hour before Albert tried to put an end to it.\n\n\"This isn't a fucking democracy! I don't give a shit about what William said to do and he sure as hell isn't the leader of this family- I am and I say that we're leaving.\"\n\n\"Together?\" Nell asked. \"Are you out of your mind? They'll be looking for us as a group!\"\n\n\"Albert...\"\n\n\"Get ready to leave- we're going back to Palm Springs,\" Albert said. \"They've searched the place by now and there's no reason for them to go back-\"\n\n\"But they could be watching,\" Harry said suddenly uncomfortable with the way things were going. \"I don't think...\"\n\n\"We're going back to Palm Springs,\" Albert said interrupting him.\n\n\"I'm not going,\" Nell said. \"The rest of you can do what you want, but I'm waiting for William.\"\n\nIn the end, they all stayed even though Albert grumbled. The one thing the argument proved to him was that he had truly lost control of his family.\n\n****\n\nWilliam followed the hunters out of the house without looking back. He hoped that the old vampire would stay hidden for at least thirty minutes before coming out. Saving him had been an almost impulsive move and one that he hoped not to regret. He paused as he realized that saving the old vampire could work in his favor. An idea began to brew in the back of his mind, the problem was initiating it. He was being watched, especially by Caleb who was looking for any opening or reason to try to kill him.\n\nHe smiled at the thought. He was doing the exact same thing except he didn't need a reason, just the opportunity. He fastened his gaze on the back of Rufus's head and he fought the urge to rip it off of his shoulders.\n\n\"Patience William,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\nThey went back to the vacation house to wait for the crew leaders to check in. By dawn, all but one crew had called in.\n\n\"When were they last heard from?\" Caleb asked.\n\n\"They were the team sent out to Blackwell's house,\" Rufus replied. \"Call the team closest to there and have them check it out.\"\n\nWilliam listened as Caleb made the call. He was almost certain that he knew why the hunters hadn't checked in. His suspicions were confirmed an hour later.\n\n\"Dead? All of them?\" Caleb shouted into the phone. \"How? Was it vampires? Are you sure? Decapitate them just in case.\" He said and slammed the phone down.\n\n\"How did they die?\" Rufus calmly asked.\n\n\"It looks like wolves,\" Rufus replied.\n\n\"Vampires and wolves working together- interesting,\" Rufus mused. Even he didn't put the two species together. They would have killed each other, but wolves' working for the vampires was unusual and made things more dangerous. \"Caleb, call for more teams. I want every suspected vampire home checked out. If in doubt as to whether they are human or not- kill them.\"\n\n\"Rufus- \"\n\n\"This is war and there are casualties,\" Rufus said, \"if you can't do what needs to be done, then maybe I've chosen the wrong man as my successor.\"\n\nWilliam watched with interest. Caleb's response would show him what kind of man and leader he would be.\n\n\"I'm on it,\" Caleb said discounting his misgivings.\n\n\"Good and also issue this order, if my daughter is found, she is to be killed immediately. I can't take the chance that she is one of them and carries one of their brats.\"\n\nWilliam left the office and went to his room. He realized that Olivia was safer where she was and he had to find a way to get a message to either the Blackwell's or the Sinclaires. He thought about the old vampire that he had saved and knew how he was going to do it. If the vampire had left the house he was back to square one. He looked at the clock, it wasn't quite dawn yet and if he vanished, he could be there in seconds. He locked the door to the bedroom and vanished in the hopes of finding the old vampire still at the house.\n\n**\n\nBarb looked at the papers on the bed still undecided as to what she was going to do. The only thing that she was sure of was that she didn't want to be a mother. She weighed the options again taking that into account. On the face of it, that ruled out the option of remaining Thorne's mate. She had no doubt that if she chose that option, that he would expect her to live up to the terms of the agreement. Celeste's words about it not being too late to learn to like her baby ran through her head. Leon's threat followed close on its heels. Not only would Thorne expect her to keep her end of the agreement, her entire family would as well. She read through the entire document again looking for a loophole in her favor. She wasn't a lawyer, but as far as she could see there was none. The agreement was ironclad.\n\nShe read through the other agreements and it was the same. Still, she would have someone look at it. She would look for the most expensive attorney she could find since Thorne was footing the bill. In the meantime, she still had to take care of herself and \"it\" as she called the baby. There was no rush to sign anything; she had several months to make up her mind. She turned on her side and thought about Celeste. Her anger at the little girl had cooled enough that she realized that she didn't dislike her, she was afraid of her. She couldn't wait until they could all go home...\n\nWhere was home for her? She wondered. At the moment, she was living under Thorne's good graces. He hadn't been kidding when he said that she could go back to the tiny condo if anything happened to the baby. She would have to go back to work. She would be right back at square one and that was unacceptable.\n\n\"Damn it!\" she cursed as she turned onto her back. \"I wish that I had never come here.\"\n\nIt occurred to her that if she chose one of the other options, she could leave California and never come back. She could move to where no one knew her. The idea appealed to her. The more she thought about it, the more she liked it. But she wouldn't make a decision until an attorney looked at the papers. She tossed and turned unable to get comfortable.\n\n\"Barb,\" Adrianna called from the door, \"I've got some updates if you want to hear them.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Barb replied sarcastically. \"It's not like I'm doing anything important.\"\n\nAdrianna started to comment about the remark, but gave the updates instead.\n\n\"Louise is where?\" Barb asked sitting up.\n\n\"She's talking to the hunter Olivia,\" Adrianna repeated. \"The hope is that she'll be able to get Olivia to help us end the war with the hunters.\"\n\n\"Nathan let her do it?\" Barb asked surprised.\n\n\"I guess so,\" Adrianna replied, \"she's there.\"\n\n\"Is there any word on the vampires that work for Olivia's father?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"No, the consensus is that they're gone. Do you need anything? I'm going to work on my paper.\"\n\n\"No.... yes, I have a question. Do you know any good attorneys? I have some papers that I need looked over.\"\n\n\"I don't know of anyone and even if I did I wouldn't give you the name,\" Adriana replied.\n\n\"Why not?\" Barb asked surprised by the answer.\n\n\"Because you would use it against me and Mr. Blackwell,\" Adrianna replied. \"I don't know what papers you want looked at and I don't want to know. My guess is that they have something to do with your situation. If I gave you a name, you could say that I informed Mr. Blackwell of who you hired and then you would accuse him of putting me up to finding out the information.\"\n\n\"Do you really think that I would do that?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"I know that you would,\" Adrianna replied. \"You might not have thought of it now, but you would have and I refuse to be pulled into your stupid assed games. Do you see a recurring theme here? Everyone is getting tired of your shit. You said that you weren't doing anything important- you should be. You should be trying to figure out how you're going to keep your family from ditching you.\"\n\n\"You don't have the right to talk to me like that,\" Barb snapped.\n\n\"You know what? You're absolutely right,\" Adrianna said. \"Forget that I said anything.\"\n\nAdrianna walked out leaving Barb alone. She turned on her laptop and did a search for attorneys. After searching for almost two hours, she found one that she thought would meet her needs. As she read about the woman's experience, Barb realized that she hadn't thought about Louise or her safety since she found out what she was doing. She also realized that she hadn't given the safety of anyone else any thought either.\n\n\"Selfish bitch.\"\n\nBarb looked up sure that someone was in the room with her. At first she thought that it was Adrianna, but she could hear her typing in the next room. She sat on the edge of the bed for several minutes before lying down again. She closed the laptop and waited for the voice to come again. She tried to think of how to describe the voice. It wasn't male nor female, soft but harsh and impatient. Several minutes passed before she realized that it wasn't going to speak again. For a very brief moment, she wondered if she wasn't losing her mind. As far as she knew, only crazy people heard voices. Her next thought was that somehow Thorne was behind it. Even as she thought it, she knew that it wasn't the case. Thorne wasn't one to play games. There had to be another explanation.\n\nOn a whim, she decided to call Gene thinking that even though he had changed, he would understand her position. Gene answered on the third ring.\n\n\"Hey sis! How are you?\"\n\n\"I've been better,\" Barb replied. \"How is the sobriety going?\"\n\n\"It goes, but I still have my moments. Dana and I are talking about once a week or so, but I'm not sure that it's going to go anywhere.\"\n\n\"Are you still at your job?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"Yes-Barb what's going on? You've never asked about my job or anything else for that matter.\"\n\n\"Can't I be interested in my brother's life?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"Yes, but my point is that you've never cared before,\" Gene replied.\n\nHis answer told her what she wanted to know. Even Gene who had been the most like her had a low opinion of her.\n\n\"I guess you know that I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I heard,\" Gene replied. \"I also heard that you and the baby's father aren't getting along. Are you alright?\"\n\n\"I'm fine... Gene, am I as bad as people are making me out to be? I mean to hear them tell it, I'm related to the wicked witch of the west.\"\n\n\"Barb,\" Gene said after a brief hesitation, \"I'm the last one to tell someone how bad they are. I've done my share of shit including planning the murder of our sister.\"\n\n\"That's precisely why I'm asking you,\" Barb replied. \"Of all of us, you were the most like me. You understood me better than the others did or ever could.\"\n\nGene sighed before speaking, he was about to impart some hard truths.\n\n\"Alright, remember that you asked,\" he said. \"As I said, I'm the last person to talk about how bad someone's been, but here it goes. Barb, we're both fucked up. We just dealt with it in different ways. I hit the bottle and you pursued the American dream of a big house, money and prestige. I wanted those things too and was actually there until the bottle took over. In order to get those things back, I made some very bad decisions that almost cost me my family although it did cost me Dana.\"\n\n\"It isn't wrong to want those things!\" Barb retorted.\n\n'No, it isn't,\" Gene agreed, \"but how we tried to get them is. Both of us have hurt our family and we've been doing it for years. Let me ask you something, you've got the money and the house; are you happy?\"\n\n\"If it weren't for the pregnancy, I would say yes,\" Barb replied.\n\n\"You don't want the baby?\" Gene asked.\n\n\"I never wanted children-\"\n\n\"But yet you got your first husband to marry you by telling him that you would have children,\" Gene interrupted. \"I only know because he talked to me after he left you. Do you want to know something really sad? He loved you. If you had been honest with him about how you felt about having children he would have married you anyway. But you lied to him and that's what did it. You already had what you wanted and you fucked it up.\"\n\n\"H...he told you that?\" Barb whispered.\n\n\"Yes,\" Gene replied. \"I know that you thought that you had to lie, but sis; you're still lying. One of the things that they tell us at our meetings is that we have to take responsibility for our actions and that we have to face those that we've wronged. Until we do that, there's no moving forward. We get stuck in this black hole and it becomes easier to blame others for our issues. I don't know the story of what's going on between you and your man and I don't know what you're planning to do about your baby, but Barb; speaking as someone who's been there- start fixing things before it's too late.\"\n\nBarb wiped at her face and looked at her hand surprised to see that it was wet.\n\n\"Are you saying that I am related to the wicked witch of the west?\" she asked half joking.\n\n\"A close relative,\" Gene replied, \"but then so am I. I don't know what all of the issues are with you and the others, but sis; if they can forgive me for what I tried to do, then they will accept and forgive you too. The thing is-\"\n\n\"I've got to give a little,\" Barb finished for him.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Gene said. \"The hardest part is going to someone and admitting that you were wrong and apologizing. That first phone call to Dana was one of the hardest things that I had ever done. Telling Kevyn and the rest of you what I did was the hardest.\" \n\n\"Does it get easier?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"No it doesn't, but as I said, it's the only way.\"\n\n\"Gene- do you hate me?\"\n\n\"Nah and neither do the others. You all just have to come to some kind of understanding.\"\n\n\"Leon told me that I was the one doing the abusing and that mom and dad never abused us- do you feel the same way?\"\n\nIt took Gene so long to respond that she didn't think that he was going to respond.\n\n\"I would have to agree,\" he finally said, \"But so was I. Instead of being the man that dad wanted me to be, I dumped my responsibility onto Kevyn and Louise and then got pissed when Kevyn made the decisions. I sabotaged her at every turn and in effect made things much harder than they had to be. Barb there was other families much worse off than we were. Some of those kids had parents who didn't care about them at all. On more than one occasion one of my friends came to school with bruises and was hungry. That never happened to us but I'm not going to try to tell you that you weren't abused. Do I believe that you were? No I don't.\"\n\nBarb gave what Gene said some thought and wondered why she was the only one who saw their lives as being abusive.\n\n\"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on the issue of abuse. But you do understand that I can and never will be anything but what I am don't you?\" Barb asked. \"I am not ever going to be the nice person that they and now you are.\"",
        "\"I think that's part of the problem,\" Gene said. \"You think that everyone is expecting you to become this sweet person when that isn't you. No one is asking that of you. What we're asking is that you remember that you have a family and that you can't keep treating us as if we were shit. We also want you to stop blaming mom and dad and the rest of us for your fuckups. You're just as responsible for your decisions as I was and am for mine. What are you going to so about the baby and the father?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" Barb replied.\n\nThey talked for a few more minutes before hanging up. Barb sat on the bed with tears running down her face. If she had only been honest, she would still be in Pittsburgh with everything that she ever wanted. She looked down at her slightly swollen belly and began to cry in earnest. No matter what, she didn't want the baby. But she was forced to rethink her part in its conception.\n\n\"Shit,\" she cursed as she lay down on the bed. \"Shit.\"\n\n*****\n\nOlivia looked at Louise for several seconds before she sat down. She felt no threat coming from the woman who was obviously pregnant and wondered what she wanted.\n\n'If you're here to lull me into a false sense of security, forget it.\" \n\n\"I'm not here for that,\" Louise replied, \"but I do hope that you understand that I'm not going to hurt you. I have something that I want to talk to you about and before you say no, hear me out.\"\n\nAn hour later, Olivia wasn't sure of whether to laugh or not.\n\n\"You want me to help you get rid of my father? Are you crazy? I don't want to be the head of anything!\"\n\n\"Olivia, think about it,\" Louise said. \"We've all lost loved ones because of this ongoing war between the hunters and vampires. Isn't it time to end it?\"\n\n\"I never said that I liked it, but you're asking me to betray my father,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Your father has already betrayed you,\" Louise said. \"He set you up to fail. Is there another crew that consists of one human and the rest vampire? What do you think he's going to do if he finds you?\"\n\nOlivia was silent. She already knew what he would do to her. He would assume that she had already talked and had been turned. There would be nothing that she could say to convince him of anything else. If by some slim chance he did believe her, he would marry her off to whoever he had chosen as his predecessor. A sudden flash of insight hit her. He had already chosen someone. A moment later, she realized who it was.\n\n\"Ask yourself this,\" Louise was saying, \"if you really believed what your father teaches, then why haven't you tried to escape?\"\n\n\"I ... they said that they would kill me,\" Olivia replied weakly.\n\n\"As far as I know, you haven't made any demands to be released nor have you tried to bargain. Why is that?\" Louise asked. \"The day that you were spotted, you were out shopping alone-why? Where were your guards? Why didn't you wait for your crew or call for a security team?\"\n\n\"You don't know what you're talking about,\" Olivia replied. \"I just wanted some time alone.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Louise replied, \"Just as I can understand being put in a position that you don't want to be in. Your father is put you in one and now we're doing the same thing. The difference is that we aren't going to kill you. If you say no, then that's the end of it. Our people will continue to fight and lives will be lost.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with me then?\" \n\n\"Let you go I suppose,\" Louise replied. \n\nOlivia looked at Louise, assessing her for a lie.\n\n\"We aren't going to turn you against your will nor are we going to compel you to do what we want. Whatever you decide, it has to be your choice.\"\n\n\"So you're saying that I can walk out of here right now?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nOlivia hesitated. She knew that as soon as she was spotted her life was over.\n\n\"Can I have some time to think about my options?\"\n\n\"Of course... do you need anything?\" Louise asked.\n\n\"I want to call my father.\" \n\n****\n\n\"Damn she's good,\" Thorne said as he watched Louise with Olivia.\n\n\"Yes she is,\" Ethan replied. \"What do you think about letting Olivia call her father?\"\n\n\"I think,\" Thorne said after a long pause, \"that, if anything will tip her in our favor. I listened to the messages that he left on her phone when he couldn't reach her. Not once did he express worry or concern over her. He doesn't care for her as a parent should care for a child, he only cares that she does as she's told.\"\n\n\"Of course there's the question of whether she will allow her father to be killed,\" Ethan said. \"No matter how she may feel about him, he's still her father. At any rate, let's get the phone call over with.\"\n\n****\n\nLouise looked in the corner where Nathan was waiting and saw his nod.\n\n\"Here, use my phone,\" she said as she reached into her pocket.\n\n\"Is this a trick?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"No trick,\" Louise replied. \"Take it.\"\n\nOlivia took the phone, looked at it and then dialed her father's number.\n\n\"Dad?\"\n\n\"Olivia? Where in the fuck are you?\" Rufus demanded.\n\n\"I... I don't know, but I'm alright-\"\n\n\"Did they turn you?\"\n\n\"No, but...\"\n\n\"Did they fuck you?\"\n\n\"Dad! No, just listen-\"\n\n\"How is it that you're calling me? Did you tell them anything?\"\n\n\"Dad, please listen to me-\"\n\n\"How do I know that you haven't been turned and already carrying one of their spawn?\n\nLouise watched Olivia as she grappled with the fact that her father didn't care about her.\n\n\"Are you looking for me?\" Olivia asked with a trace of hope in her voice.\n\n\"That's a stupid question! Of course we are! I've already lost an entire team in the search!\" Rufus snapped.\n\n\"Lost?\"\n\n\"They were killed because of you! A pack of wolves killed them. Who would have thought it, wolves working for vampires?\"\n\n\"Dad, what will happen if I come to you?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"We'll have to make sure that you aren't turned and knocked up by one of them,\" Rufus replied. \"If you're clean, you marry Caleb and give him a bunch of little hunters.\"\n\n\"Dad, why haven't you asked me if I'm alright?\"\n\n\"You said that you were fine and I don't have time for sentiment, but that leads me to question something that you said,\" Rufus said. \"You said that they haven't turned or fucked you- why not?\"\n\nOlivia was stunned. Her father sounded almost disappointed. The realization that he was going to have her killed either way struck her.\n\n\"Are they willing compromise?\" Rufus asked.\n\n\"What are you offering for my return?\" Olivia asked neglecting to mention that she was free to go.\n\n\"Tell them that I want to meet with them and work out a truce of some kind in exchange for you.\"\n\n\"Who do you want to meet with?\"\n\n\"Ethan Sinclaire and Thorne Blackwell and they have to come alone,\" Rufus replied.\n\n\"Will you come alone as well?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Rufus said after a brief hesitation.\n\n\"And you'll keep your word and let them go?\"\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" Rufus yelled into the phone. \"You sound like you're working with them.\"\n\n\"I'm not... I just want be sure that the same thing that happened with mom doesn't happen again.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Rufus asked.\n\n\"I know what happened at that meeting, the one where you took the girl and mom ended up dead,\" Olivia replied.\n\n\"I can hear that they've filled your head with lies,\" Rufus said. \"Do you have any idea of where you are?\"\n\nInstead of answering, Olivia hung up and handed the phone back to Louise.\n\n\"If you don't mind, I need some time alone,\" Olivia said softly. She had a lot to think about.\n\n****\n\nNathan met Louise outside of the room and hugged her. He knew that Ethan and Thorne had questions for her, but they had to wait.\n\n\"Sweetheart, are you alright?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, just a little tired,\" she replied. \"Let me answer their questions and then you can take me back for a nice, long nap.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Thorne and Ethan asked at the same time.\n\n\"You heard the same thing that I did,\" Louise replied. \"But... I think that she's going to help. Her father will kill her no matter what she does and we won't. Give her some time to think about it oh and by the way... she wants some mint chocolate chip ice-cream.\"\n\nMoments later, Ethan and Thorne were back in Thorne's office making plans for the next night. They would start searching for Rufus Saunders. Thorne's cell phone rang interrupting their planning.\n\n\"Grant, what's happening?\"\n\nThorne listened as Grant told him about the ransacking of his home and the deaths of the hunters.\n\n\"Were you able to obtain any information?\"\n\n\"We know that Rufus Saunders and his second in command are staying in a house that Olivia rented for her crew when they were on vacation. Whether they're still there or not I can't say. There are too many vampires and wolves patrolling the grounds for us to get close enough to see. The leader did mention that by tomorrow evening, another two-hundred hunters would be here. I don't know if you're aware of this, but not only is Saunders using vampires, he has other species working for him too. We need to sway some of these from him.\"\n\n\"You work on that and I'll talk to Ethan about what our options are,\" Thorne replied.\n\nAfter he hung up, Thorne filled Ethan in.\n\n\"Thorne, if you were Rufus, why would you hire so many other species? I mean he hates anything not human.\"\n\n\"I don't know....oh fuck!\" Thorne exclaimed. \"He's going to watch while we kill each other off!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Ethan said grimly. \"Grant is right, we need to start swaying these other species to our side and we have to kill Rufus and his second in command with or without Olivia's help.\"\n\n\"That means that the focus of the search parties changes,\" Thorne said. \"Rufus Saunders is now the main target.\"\n\n****\n\nWilliam appeared in the kitchen of Ethan's ransacked house and noticed that it had already been cleaned up. \"What in the hell?\" he muttered as he left the kitchen and went to the dining room where he could hear the old vampire tinkering.\n\n\"Why are you still here?\" William asked.\n\nThe vampire turned around and looked at him.\n\n\"This is my home- why did you come back? Did you change your mind about killing me?\"\n\n\"No, William said as he sat down in a chair. \"I was actually hoping that you would still be here. You owe me a favor.\"\n\n\"If it's to ask me where Mr. Ethan is, I don't know and even if I did; I wouldn't tell you,\" The old man said.\n\n\"I already knew that,\" William said, \"but you do know how to reach him.\"\n\nThe old vampire's silence told William that he was right.\n\n\"I want you to contact him and tell him that I want to meet with him. Tell him that I saved your life and that you are contacting him on my behalf as repayment.\"\n\n\"What do you want with him?\" the vampire asked after a few moments. \"You were with those hunters which means that you work for them.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" William said, \"but I won't be for much longer. Grandfather, will you help me?\"\n\n\"Help you what? Kill the people who have been nothing but kind to me? No, I won't do that.\"\n\n\"What if I were to give you my word that I mean them no harm?\" William asked.\n\n\"If I say no?\"\n\n\"Then I will leave you to your cleaning and find another way,\" William replied.\n\n\"Give me your hands,\" the old vampire said as he approached William.\n\nWilliam held out his hands as requested and waited.\n\n\"Turn them so that the palms are facing up,\" the vampire instructed.\n\nHe stared at William's upturned palms for at least twenty minutes before speaking again\n\n\"You are ...good at heart. You were foolish- but good. You have done some bad things, but yet-you are redeemable because-you love someone. I will do as you ask.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" William asked looking at the old vampire.\n\n\"No one special, but my name is Travis. I prefer to be called that as opposed to grandfather.\"\n\n\"I meant no offense,\" William said. \"I meant it as a term of respect.\"\n\n\"No offense taken,\" Travis replied, \"It's just that being called grandfather makes me feel old.\"\n\nWilliam saw the twinkle in the vampire's eyes and laughed. \"As you wish,\" he said looking at his hands.\n\n\"So, young man; who may I tell Mr. Ethan to call?\"\n\n\"My name is William and I will give you a number where I can be reached. I thank you for your help.\"\n\nWilliam stood to leave, but the old vampire stopped him.\n\n\"Where are you going? It's light out unless you're one of those day walkers.\"\n\n\"I am not so fortunate,\" William replied, \"But I can tolerate some sunlight. I will be home in a few seconds.\"\n\nSeconds later, William was back in his room. He looked around to see if anything had been disturbed. His very dangerous game had just begun. He lay on the bed and closed his eyes after checking his cell phone. He extended his senses throughout the house listening for any conversation that could help him. He knew that Rufus would speak freely because he thought that once vampires were down for the day that they couldn't hear. Caleb knew better, but wouldn't say anything because it would be seen as a challenge.\n\nHe started in the small office and struck pay dirt.\n\n\"I'm telling you,\" Rufus was saying, \"They've turned her!\"\n\n\"Rufus listen to me,\" Caleb said. \"Olivia has never lied to you has she? Maybe they haven't turned or touched her. According to my research, the Sinclaire/Blackwell group is the most civilized of all of them. It's entirely possible that they haven't touched her.\"\n\n\"But they can compel can't they?\" Rufus shot back.\n\n\"Yes, but...\"\n\n\"I want her dead!\" Rufus said cutting Caleb off. \"I won't take the chance that they've fucked with her mind even if they haven't turned her.\"\n\nWilliam listened to the discussion with a growing sense of apprehension. He picked up the phone and made sure that the volume was on. It was imperative that he talk with Ethan Sinclaire as soon as possible. He tuned his hearing back to the conversation between Caleb and Rufus. Caleb was showing rarely seen backbone.\n\n\"Rufus, the fact that she's in their hands is your fault. I mean, you sent her here with a crew made up entirely of vampires. If you didn't want her take over for you, why didn't you just say that? Why set her up?\"\n\nWilliam sat up on the bed. He could almost feel Rufus's anger at being questioned.\n\n\"How dare you question me! I am still the head of this organization! You will do as I say and kill her on sight! Am I being clear?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Caleb said weakly his moment of bravado gone.\n\nWilliam tuned out of the conversation as they had gone to talking about more mundane things. It was now more important than ever that Olivia stay where she was. He wondered if the old vampire had reached the Sinclaires yet. He almost left the room to go back to the house, but decided to wait. He knew that Caleb would eventually come to the room to make sure that he was there.\n\nHe wondered about his family. He hoped that they did as they were told and went back to the mountains, but when he chose to be; Albert could be very persuasive. The other issue was Harry. He had been and still was their wild card. He knew that as long as Harry was alive, he would continue to endanger all of them. Harry had to die, but could he bring himself to kill his own brother? He didn't think so, but he had to prepare himself for the possibility that he might have to.\n\n***\n\nHarry stood by the door inhaling the scent of the camping humans. As he listened to their laughter, the need to go to them grew. The more that need grew, the less Harry remembered that it was because of him that his family was hiding in the mountains. He looked behind him and saw that he was in the kitchen alone. \n\n\"All I need is a few moments,\" he said licking his lips.\n\nHe looked behind him again and vanished to the porch. After a moment's hesitation, Harry made his way to the campsite of the unsuspecting humans. He stood behind a tree and watched as they roasted marshmallows over the campfire. \n\n\"Okay guys,\" a pretty brunette said after eating her marshmallows, \"I'm going to wash up and get ready for bed.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to come with you?\" a male asked.\n\n\"Nah, I'll be fine,\" the woman replied. \"There's no one up here except us.\"\n\nSilently, Harry followed the woman to the creek where she washed her face and hands. Harry waited until she was so engrossed in what she was doing that she didn't know that he was there until he was standing behind her.\n\n\"Jude!\" the woman yelped thinking that it was one of the males from the campsite.\n\n\"Quiet!\" Harry hissed as he looked down at her. \"You will do whatever I require of you, do you understand?\"\n\nHis dark eyes flashed several times before the woman nodded her head to the affirmative. Harry looked around to be sure that they were still alone and prepared to feed.\n\n\"Let her go,\" Nell said from behind him. \"There's plenty of blood back at the cabin.\"\n\n\"I don't want that warmed up shit,\" Harry replied. \"I want it warm, directly from the vessel.\"\n\n\"What happens if you kill her?\" Nell asked. \"We're here because you killed someone. Now, release her from the compulsion and let's go.\"\n\nHe was about to disregard Nell when they heard the sound of voices coming toward them calling for the woman. Harry growled low in his throat, released the woman from the compulsion and vanished seconds after Nell. By the time he appeared in the kitchen of the cabin, he had made a decision.\n\n\"I'm leaving,\" he said. \"I refuse to stay here while William roams free.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Albert asked.\n\n\"You're going to let him go?\" Nell asked incredulous. \"I just stopped him from feeding on a human woman!\"\n\n\"Have you heard from William?\" Albert demanded.\n\n\"No, but ....\"\n\nWhile they argued, Harry vanished back to Palm Springs. He stood across the street from the condo and watched for more than ten minutes before deciding that it was safe to go in. He vanished into the condo, but left the lights off in case a crew of hunters was in the area.\n\nNow that he was alone, he could sit and think in peace. He wondered where William was and thought that he knew. It was where he would have gone too-the vacation home. \n\nHe weighed his options. The option that made the most sense was that he leave California and not look back. He had money, not as much as he suspected William had, but he would be comfortable. The second option that he looked at was going to the house. The question he asked himself was how it would be to his benefit to do that.\n\n\"No benefit to me at all,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\nHe thought about Olivia and anger rose. He hadn't wanted to go on vacation with her or anyone else for that matter. He always vacationed alone that way no one could inhibit his movements. What he appreciated even less was the fact that he was being told what to do by a female. Nell telling him what he could and couldn't do had been the final straw.\n\nHarry's thoughts wandered toward Nadine. He wondered where she was. He had killed the last woman because she reminded him of her. He wondered if she was still alive, but then knew that she was. His planning went from deciding what to do as far as William was concerned to finding Nadine. He hoped that she had a mate and children. He would make them watch him take her before he killed her and then them. The question now was where to start looking. \n\n****\n\nNadine sat up drenched in sweat, her heart pounding. She hadn't dreamt about Harry since the night she finally told Leon about him. In the past, the nightmares while bad had an almost surreal feeling to them. In this dream, she was an active participant. She could actually feel Harry's hands on her as he forced himself into her. She felt the bites on her neck and then the pulls as he drank from her. She could hear his demands to \"say it!\"\n\nAt the time she hadn't known what he meant only that she couldn't and wouldn't say it. Her hope was that he would either let her go or kill her. By the third time, his family interfered. They talked in riddles about his turning her and what they were going to do about it. In the end, they decided to leave her to die.",
        "\"Dina?\" Leon said when he came into the bedroom. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she lied. \"I just had a bad dream.\"\n\n'You're lying,\" Leon said. \"I believe that you had a bad dream, but you're lying about being fine.\"\n\nNadine sighed. She knew that if she told him that Harry was now actively looking for her, he would take off half-cocked. She needed his promise that he wouldn't do anything rash.\n\n\"Make love to me and I'll tell you,\" she said as she removed her sweat drenched night shirt.\n\nLeon hesitated but his libido took over. He stripped, got into the bed and pulled Nadine close.\n\n\"Baby you're shaking.\"\n\nNadine burrowed into his body, kissed his neck and then bit hard enough to draw blood. It was a sure way to get Leon to stop talking and to do what she wanted and needed. It had the desired effect. Leon moaned and pulled her on top of him. Nadine straddled his hips, rose up and slammed herself down on Leon so hard that his breath left him with a whoosh.\n\nLeon was caught by surprise and took a few seconds to recover. In one move he had her beneath him and was pounding into her. He covered her mouth with his taking in her breath and screams. It was during the last screeching scream that he emptied into her. \n\nAfterwards, as they recovered; he wondered what had her so upset.\n\n\"Tell me what's going on,\" he said his tone firm.\n\n\"Before I tell you, I want your promise that you won't do anything stupid,\" Nadine said. 'If you can't make that promise, then I'm not telling you.\"\n\n\"Dina-\"\n\n\"I mean it,\" Nadine said. \n\n\"Alright! I promise,\" Leon said after trying for several minutes to get Nadine to talk to him.\n\n\"Harry is looking for me.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Leon asked jumping out of the bed. \"Where is the son of a bitch?\"\n\n\"I don't know for sure, but he's not that far away,\" Nadine replied. \"Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. You would forget the promise that you just made me and go after him alone. Leon, come sit down.\"\n\nLeon sat on the bed clearly angry.\n\n\"One of the things that I love about you is the way in which you stand up for your family,\" Nadine said rubbing his shoulders. \"But Leon, you are a new vampire-strong but still new. You wouldn't stand a chance against Harry especially if the others are with him. Not even Nathan or Patrick would go up against them alone and they're old. I know that you're going to go after him and I know that nothing that I say is going to stop you. I just want you to stop and think before you go looking for him alone. Think about me being left here alone because if you die, then I'm going to die too. There would be no reason for me to continue to exist.\"\n\n\"Nadine-\"\n\n\"I mean it Leon,\" Nadine said. \"And don't think that I don't know that you're hoping that I'll get pregnant so that I'll have someone in case something happens to you. If something does happen, it'll be because you tried to do things alone. I swear that if anything happens to you I will never forgive you. Now you promise me that you will let the others help you.\"\n\nLeon sighed. He understood what Nadine was saying and after a few minutes decided that she was right. \n\n\"Alright, I promise,\" he finally said, \"But Dina, he dies and you can't make me change my mind on that.\"\n\n\"I know; that's why I didn't mention it. What will you do about the others?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but Harry is the one that I want. If the others cross my path I will kill them too.\"\n\nRelieved that she had gotten Leon's promise, Nadine relaxed. When she had a moment, she planned to talk to Hans. It wasn't that she didn't believe Leon; she knew that if he saw Harry, he would forget his promise to her. She moved from behind him to straddle his lap earning a low moan from him when she wiggled against his erection. Leon bent his head down, kissed her and then took a dark nipple into his mouth. Nadine let out a soft sigh as she ground against him. Not wanting to miss the chance of possibly impregnating her, Leon lifted her and eased her onto his cock that was wet with her juices. A few short, hard and fast thrusts later, Leon was emptying into Nadine. She collapsed against his chest with her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes.\n\n*****\n\nHarry was restless and hungry. He made a snack and looked at the units of blood that Nell had taken out of the freezer to thaw out. He knew that he should be satisfied with one of them, but he wanted to feel a warm body pressed against him as he fed. He stood at the door and reached out with his senses. Maybe there was someone home alone in one of the other condos. A woman would be preferable, but he wouldn't be choosy.\n\nThe only thing he heard was a television playing from the condo two doors down. He slipped out of his condo and appeared in the bedroom of the condo where the television was playing. He could hear someone in the shower: a man. He cursed his luck that it wasn't a woman and then reminded himself to be grateful. Finding food had been much easier than he anticipated. He walked to the sound of the running water keeping his ears tuned for anything that sounded out of place. As he approached the shower, it wasn't the sound that attracted his attention- it was the smell. It was wrong- it wasn't human.\n\nIt took him several seconds to place the scent. It was the smell of a wet wolf. Harry cursed his luck and vanished just as the shower stopped running. He appeared in the condo not quite believing his bad luck. He decided to stay in and make do with the bagged blood as unappetizing as it was. He opened a bag, looked at it in distaste and poured it into a glass. Grimacing, he put the glass of blood into the microwave to warm.\n\nAs he waited, his thoughts drifted to Nadine and the night that she had almost killed him. As always the scar on his chest itched and burned when he thought of that night. He conveniently forgot that everyone had tried to warn him of the fact that Nadine wasn't his- he wanted her. He also conveniently forgot the fact that he had turned her and was going to leave her to die after he had one last turn at her. Harry jumped when he felt a brief, intense stab of fear that didn't belong to him. She knew that he was coming for her.\n\n****\n\nLouise stood in the shower letting the hot water run over her while Nathan stood behind her washing her back. When he was through, he pulled her back into him, placed his hands on her swollen belly.\n\n\"Have I told you how proud I am of you?\" he whispered in her ear.\n\nLouise was about to answer when she froze. It wasn't a feeling of dread as much as it was a warning. A moment later, she saw a solitary figure. She was confused. All of her previous visions all of the crew were in them.\n\n\"They've separated,\" she murmured.\n\nNathan turned off the shower, wrapped a towel around Louise and led her to the bedroom listening as she murmured under her breath. There were times that she didn't remember what she said and he became her live tape recorder.\n\n\"Only one of them means us harm-no-not us.... Nadine. Where is she?\"\n\nLouise started to get up, but Nathan held her in place.\n\n\"She's here with all of us,\" Nathan said softly. \"Sweetheart-\"\n\n\"What? Oh I'm ok,\" Louise said leaning back into him. \"I just got a little disoriented.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that you're alright?\" Nathan asked.\n\n\"I'm fine, just tired- did I say anything important?\"\n\n\"You mentioned that they separated which we assumed, but you also said that only one of them means us harm, then you specifically said Nadine's name.\"\n\n\"I know which of them killed that girl at the club. It's the one named Harry. Nathan, he's looking for Nadine. And if I know then so does she.\"\n\n\"Were you able to tell where he is?\" Nathan asked.\n\n\"No, but he isn't far away.\"\n\n\"What about the others?\"\n\n\"I don't know why I can't feel them unless it's because they aren't an immediate threat. But I think that they've separated.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that Leon knows by now,\" Nathan said. \"I need to talk to him and Hans as soon as possible. Why don't you lie down and take a nap while I do that? I'll bring dinner back with me. Do you have any requests?\"\n\n\"No, whatever you bring is fine,\" Louise replied.\n\nAfter Nathan left, Louise thought about Barb. Was she as scared as the rest of them were? Even Katrina was scared and she had been living in the vampire world for almost thirty years. She reminded herself that this was a much different situation than the one with Bradford. He was only one, but now they were facing many. \n\nHer mind began to spin with thoughts of the men going out in search of Rufus, the thought that some of them might not come back and what she would do if Nathan was one of those who didn't return. She struggled with something else as well. In all of her life she had never deliberately hurt anyone. She had just spent the evening asking a daughter to help in the betrayal and assassination of her father.\n\nShe heard the pain in Olivia's voice when she spoke with her father. She heard the sadness when it finally sunk in that her father was going to kill her no matter what happened. Part of her felt guilty, but part of her didn't. She simply did what had to be done in order to save the lives of hundreds if not thousands of people. \n\nLouise turned on her side, whispered a prayer and closed her eyes. She didn't expect Nathan back anytime soon. She was almost asleep when there was a tap on the door.\n\n****\n\nOlivia couldn't believe it. Her father was really going to kill her. That was the only reason he was looking for her-that and it would send a clear message to both sides. The idea that he was willing to kill her made her think about her mother. Had her father wanted her killed? If he did, then the question was why. Then she thought that she had the answer. Every so often there would be murmurings about ending the war with the vampires. Whenever it came up and didn't die out on its own, something happened to renew the old hatred. She thought back to the time when her mother was killed. She couldn't remember hearing anything, but she was young. Her mind was on boys and the next party.\n\nEven though she couldn't remember, she knew that she was right. He had known that the vampires would bring her mother as a bargaining chip. He had set up her mother just as he had set her up and like her mother, she was going to die. She wondered who he would get to do it. He wouldn't do it himself, but then; maybe he would. It would show that he would do anything to protect the human race. He would use her captivity as a way to keep the anti-vampire sentiment and the war going.\n\nHer father, she realized was insane, but could she kill him? He was still her father and to some degree he had loved her, but she couldn't allow him to continue what he was doing. She didn't know what to do. It struck her as odd that she was safe with the very people that she had been hunting. She lay on the couch and closed her eyes to think. She thought about William and hoped that he was somewhere safe. The others she could care less about, especially Harry.\n\nTime was getting short and she needed to make a decision. The idea of taking her father's position didn't sit any better than it had before, but... she could initiate changes. Maybe they wouldn't have to kill him. Maybe he would compromise she thought. At least he deserved the chance to decide. \n\nIt came to her that she had decided. She was going to help overthrow her father. She hoped that he wouldn't have to be killed, but she knew that it was inevitable; he would die before agreeing to a compromise of any kind with the vampires.\n\n****\n\nTravis sat at the table long after William left debating over his decision to help him. It was true that he owed him a favor, and his hands hadn't lied. The hands never did. He thought about going back on his word, but that was something that he had never done in his life. Finally, after more self-debate, Travis stood up and went to the phone.\n\n****\n\nNathan found Hans in the kitchen making a dinner tray for Juliette and the kids. It looked as if all of the males had the same idea. That was confirmed when Ethan came in followed by Leon. \n\n\"Good, you're all here,\" Ethan said. \"I know that you're all anxious to get back to your mates as am I, but there's been a change in plans. The rest of the men will be here shortly.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Thorne walked in followed by Joseph, Martin. Victor walked in and moved to where he could see and hear. Rik and Luc came in and stood in the doorway.\n\nAn hour later, everything had been explained.\n\n\"Can we trust her?\" Joseph asked.\n\n\"There is always the possibility that she could change her mind,\" Ethan said, \"but I don't think that she will. What I do expect is for her to want to talk to her father first. She'll want to try to get him to step down and leave.\"\n\n\"He won't go for it,\" Thorne said. \"He's already sacrificing his only surviving child to keep this war going. The bottom line is this, even if she doesn't help us; Rufus Saunders and his second in command need to be dealt with. But here's another thing, Saunders is going to have all of the species turn on each other. When our numbers are low, he'll swoop in and finish us off. For this reason Saunders and his second are now our primary focus. If we happen across the traitors, we will deal with them.\"\n\nNathan saw the expression on Leon's face and spoke up.\n\n\"There is another issue that needs to be addressed. One of Olivia's crew-Harry is looking for Nadine.\"\n\nHans stopped what he was doing and listened.\n\n\"Louise saw only him and says that he isn't far away,\" Nathan continued. \"I understand that we have to deal with Rufus, but we now have a direct threat to one of our own.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" Thorne asked.\n\n\"I am suggesting that Hans, Leon and I look for him as we do our patrol. If any of our patrols spot him, we are to be called.\"\n\nEthan and Thorne looked at each other and nodded.\n\n\"Fine,\" Ethan said. \"I'll put the word out to the other groups. As far as protecting the house, Noel, and Martin will stay here. Joseph, Rik and Luc will patrol together. If they spot any activity, they'll call the team closest to where they are. If this goes beyond tonight, we'll rotate. I don't need to tell you all to be careful and to stay in touch. We're going to talk to Olivia again to see what she's decided to do. You'll know by the time we leave tonight whether to kill Rufus on sight or not.\"\n\n\"I have a question,\" Noel said from the corner of the kitchen. \"Do you all realize that if Olivia agrees to take over for her father that there's going to be a split on both sides? We will have gotten rid of Rufus, but there are those who will always be loyal to him just as there are those of us who believe that all hunters should be found and killed.\"\n\n\"We've thought about that,\" Thorne replied. \"We'll deal with that when it happens but I agree with Ethan, this has to end. The hunters and we have a common enemy and if we joined together, we could eradicate them.\"\n\n\"The Rogues,\" Nathan whispered.\n\n\"Yes the rogues,\" Thorne confirmed. \"They are growing in number and must be dealt with.\"\n\nThe meeting lasted for a few more minutes and the preparation of the dinner trays continued. Nathan pulled Leon and Hans aside.\n\n\"Leon, I know that you're eager to end this threat to Nadine. I would feel the same if it was Louise, but we can't just go rushing into this. We need to have a plan in place.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Leon replied. \"Nadine and I have already had this discussion.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Nathan said. \"I want all of us to come out of this unscathed.\"\n\n\"I want you to understand something,\" Leon said. \"When we find him, I'm going to be the one to kill him.\"\n\n\"I expected as much,\" Hans said, \"but if I see that you are in danger of dying, I will step in. Do you understand? You can get as angry as you wish, but Nadine's wellbeing comes before your pride.\"\n\nLeon started to argue, but then remembered that his promise to Nadine.\n\n\"Agreed, but you only interfere if you see that I'm going to die and I don't mean if you see a scratch and I'm bleeding. I have to be out for the count and Nathan, the same goes for you. You don't interfere unless I can no longer protect myself.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Nathan said after a long pause. \"We'll meet after the mates are asleep and make our plans. And Leon, I want your word that you won't go off on your own. Just as you have given your word to Nadine, I gave mine to Louise.\"\n\n\"I also gave my word to Juliette and the children,\" Hans said. \"Do we have your word?\"\n\n\"You have my word,\" Leon said. \"And you have my thanks.\"\n\n****\n\nEthan sat the dinner tray on the small table by the bed. He was about to wake Katrina when his cell phone vibrated in his pocket. He slipped out of the room to take the call.\n\n\"Travis? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Yes sir Mr. Ethan,\" Travis replied and then told him about William.\n\n\"I told him that I would talk to you on his behalf. I read his hands and he doesn't lie. I have his number if you would like to talk to him.\"\n\nEthan took the number, peeked in the room to check on Katrina and went to Thorne's office. He knew that he would be there and would have been surprised if he wasn't. It was no secret that he and Barb were at odds. He tapped on the closed door and waited for the invitation to enter.\n\n\"Why aren't you with your mate?\" Thorne asked when Ethan was sitting.\n\n\"I was, but I got a rather interesting phone call from one of my house staff.\"\n\n\"So, this William who is one of Olivia Saunders's crew wants to talk,\" Thorne said when Ethan was finished talking. \"What do you think he wants?\"\n\n\"I have no idea but I think that it would be in our best interests to at least hear what he has to say.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Thorne said after thinking about it for a moment. \"He could be the way to find and get to Rufus.\"\n\nEthan picked up the phone on Thorne's desk and turned on the speaker phone. William answered on the first ring.\n\n\"Who is with you?\" William asked.\n\n\"Thorne Blackwell,\" Ethan replied. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Is Olivia well?\" William asked.\n\n\"She is alive and unharmed\" Thorne replied. \"What can we do for you?\"\n\n\"I want you to keep her there. She is far safer with you than with her father- he plans to kill her.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling us this?\" Ethan asked. \"What's in it for you?\"\n\n\"My only concern is her safety,\" William replied. \"I also think that you want the same thing that I do-I want Rufus Saunders dead.\"\n\n\"What has he done to you?\" Ethan asked, \"You work for him.\"\n\n\"Working with him was not my choice,\" William replied. \"I work for him because my family does.\"\n\n\"But yet only you seek to betray him,\" Thorne replied.\n\n\"This is true,\" William said, \"but I have no love for the man. He is insane with hatred and he will sacrifice everything to get rid of all things not human.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" Ethan asked.\n\n\"He is currently at the home where we were spending our vacation,\" William replied. \"I don't know how much longer he will be here.\"\n\n\"Are you there too?\" Ethan asked.\n\n\"I am,\" William confirmed. \"I am waiting for my chance to kill the son of a bitch. You asked me what was in this for me. Nothing except that he will be dead along with Caleb the one that he has chosen to succeed him. I will however ask one thing of you. Let my family go in peace. I will give you my word that they will no longer work for the hunters or bother any of yours.\"\n\n\"We have a problem regarding that,\" Thorne said. \"One of our mates was attacked, turned and then left to die by one of yours. Her mate wants to avenge her.\"\n\n\"Nadine,\" William said softly. \"What if I were to convince Harry to leave California and never pursue her?\"\n\n\"You would be too late,\" Ethan replied. \"Harry is already looking for her. Where is the rest of your family?\"\n\n\"I won't tell you that. This is between you and me, but as for Harry, I will still try to talk to him. If he agrees to leave Nadine alone, will you talk with her mate?\"",
        "\"I will talk to him,\" Ethan replied, \"but you must understand that it will change nothing. In his mind as long as Harry exists, Nadine will never be safe. I would feel the same if it was my mate that we were talking about.\"\n\nWilliam hesitated realizing that Ethan was right. Hadn't he thought about giving up his family for Olivia?\n\n\"I understand, but still I will try,\" William replied. \"Tell me of Olivia.\"\n\nEthan and Thorne looked at each other understanding. William was in love with the hunter.\n\n\"You have our word that no harm will come to her,\" Ethan replied. \"Whether she stays with us or goes is up to her.\"\n\n\"Another favor then, but first are we agreed that you will leave my family in peace?\"\n\n\"Give us a moment,\" Thorne said and then put the phone on mute. \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"I think that he's our best chance of getting to Rufus if Olivia doesn't help us,\" Ethan replied. \"I also know that there's no way in hell that Leon will agree to letting Harry go free. I propose that we let the rest of them go with the stipulation that they leave the state and don't return. If they do, the agreement is null and void. They will have twenty-four hours in which to leave.\"\n\nThorne unmuted the phone and explained their terms to William. It took William several minutes to respond.\n\n\"I agree to your terms and now for the second request. If Olivia decides to leave, alert me. She isn't safe from either side.\"\n\n\"We can do that,\" Thorne said. \"We will call later today in regards to her decision.\"\n\n\"One more thing,\" William said. \"I plan to kill Rufus Saunders no matter what happens.\"\n\nWilliam hung up without saying anything else. It wasn't open for discussion: Rufus Saunders was going to die.\n\nWilliam did a calculation of the time and vanished to the cabin in the mountains.\n\n****\n\nBarb tossed and turned unable to settle. Snippets of her conversation with Gene wouldn't let her rest. She had been expecting more sympathy and understanding than what he had given her. In effect, he told her that she was every bit as horrible as others thought she was. But the thing that really got her was that she had already had what she wanted and she threw it away. It hadn't occurred to her to be honest with her ex before she married him. All she saw is what he had and what she wanted. She was prepared to say or do anything to get him to marry her. That thought prompted another one- something that Thorne had said to her.\n\n\"If it hadn't been me, it would have been someone else.\"\n\nHe made her sound so... cheap and desperate. But she saw it as her going after what she wanted. It was the same with Clay and several others. Another question popped into her mind- one that she had been asked several times over the past several weeks. \"Are you any happier?\"\n\nIt was a hard question to answer. She was happy with the money, but not about the vampire and baby part of it. That was far more than what she bargained for. The options that Thorne gave her came to mind and she ruled out one of them. She wasn't going to sign the option that said that she had to be a mate and the mother to the baby. She knew that she wouldn't be able to fulfill the obligation. When she turned over, Celeste was sitting on the chair beside the bed. Barb hadn't heard her come in.\n\nThe first feelings that Barb had when she saw her was anger followed by betrayal and then finally fear. She checked herself to be sure that she wasn't thinking anything that could be construed as intent to harm herself or the baby. Only then did she speak.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nCeleste didn't reply, but looked at her with her head cocked to the right. A moment later, she was on the bed next to Barb and reaching for her. Barb pulled back in surprise, but Celeste kept moving toward her. Finally Barb's only option was to get off the bed.\n\nCeleste sat on the bed watching Barb then without a word, climbed down from the bed and left the room. Barb stood by the side of the bed for several minutes before getting back in. She was more than scared of her niece; she was terrified. She had the feeling that Celeste knew what she was thinking as well as being able to communicate with the baby. Celeste was the one thing that could have her tossed back into the tiny condo with nothing but what she had come with.\n\nShe took a deep breath and tried to relax. She laid back and began to sift through the remaining options including a few that she had come up with on her own. As she closed her eyes, she realized that she had always had options other than the ones that she had chosen. It was a first step in accepting responsibility for her choices.\n\n****\n\nAfter Ethan left, Thorne sat at his desk scribbling on a piece of paper. Working with Ethan felt good and it felt right. The feeling reminded him that he promised Celeste that he would talk to Ethan about the rift between their families. He also wondered why Noel hadn't complained of any headaches.\n\n\"It's all related, but how?\" he asked out loud. \"What does Noel know that I don't?\"\n\nHe looked up from his drawing to see Celeste standing in the doorway. He was surprised to see her since one; she had never approached him and two\u2014all of the mates and families were spending the day together.\n\n\"Is everything alright?\" he asked as Celeste as she stepped into the office.\n\n\"He wants me to give you something,\" Celeste replied.\n\n\"He does?\" Thorne asked, \"What is it?\"\n\nCeleste walked over to where Thorne sat, stood on her tip toes and kissed his cheek.\n\n\"That's from him,\" was all she said and walked out.\n\nThorne stared after her as she left the office. He shut down his laptop and left the office. It was time to go see Olivia, but he had a stop to make first. He went to Barb's room, tapped on the door and walked in.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked not really caring.\n\nThorne sat in the chair that Celeste had vacated and looked at her. He was honest with himself. He was only there because of the baby.\n\n\"I came to comfort our child,\" Thorne replied. \"He is in need of reassurance.\"\n\n\"I suppose in order to do that you have to touch me,\" Barb said dryly.\n\nWhen Thorne didn't answer, she shifted into a more comfortable position and waited. Her breath caught when Thorne moved to sit on the bed beside her. She felt her nipples tighten and bit her lip. She had never said that sex with Thorne wasn't good-it was better than good but not good enough that she wanted to stay mated to him. When she looked at him, he was paying her no attention. His entire focus was on her belly. Both of his hands were slowly massaging her stomach and he was speaking just loud enough that she could hear him. When he was finished speaking, he continued to massage her stomach for a few more minutes. Barb held her breath as he bent closer to her stomach and kissed it. Thorne stood up, moved away from her and looked at her.\n\n\"As you know, tonight the hunt for Rufus Saunders begins. If anything should happen to me, you will be taken care of. We need to discuss what will happen to the baby in the unlikely event of my demise. It is clear to all that you have no interest in being a mother to our child. If something should happen to me, I want one of your siblings to raise him. I have no preference as to which one as they are all decent, kind and loving people and he will be well loved and cared for.\"\n\nBarb didn't know what to say. It hadn't occurred to her that Thorne could die. For the most part, she didn't really care; but on the other hand if the others changed their minds about taking the baby, she would be stuck with it.\n\n\"I guess that you had better come back safe and sound,\" she said snidely.\n\nThorne gave her a grin so icy that she felt goose bumps rise on her arms.\n\n\"I guess I know which option you chose,\" he said with a satisfied smile. \"Remember to do as Adrianna says.\"\n\n\"That's it?\" Barb shouted. \"That's all that you're going to say to me?\"\n\n\"What is it that you want?\" Thorne asked. \"Were you thinking that because I might die that I would come in here and give you my unwavering love? Were you expecting the kiss on the temple? I told you that I don't and will not love you. That is a kiss that you will not receive now or ever. I am here because as I said, our child needed comforting and to let you know that as my mate- for lack of a better term, you will be financially cared for.\"\n\nBarb didn't know how to respond. She didn't know what she expected from him. He was right in that he did tell her that he didn't and wouldn't love her and she was alright with that because she didn't love him either. But what had she been expecting?\n\nThorne waited for a response. When none was forthcoming, he walked out without looking back. Barb watched him leave knowing that he was hoping that she wouldn't choose the third option-he wanted her gone. It hurt she realized. With the exception of her ex and now Thorne, she had always been the one to do the rejecting.\n\n\"You're going to lose everything,\" a soft androgynous voice whispered in her head. \"Ask yourself if what you think you want is worth the price of losing those who love you.\"\n\nBarb looked around for the source of the voice. It took her several minutes to realize that it was coming from within her.\n\n\"I'm going crazy,\" she whispered.\n\n\n\n****\n\n\"Come in!\" Louise called as she sat up. \n\nKevyn and Juliette peeked in and then walked into the room. \n\n\"We thought we'd stop in and see how you were doing,\" Kevyn said.\n\n\"Scared, but ok... how about you two?\"\n\n\"Scared,\" Juliette replied. \"I was thinking that maybe we should go check on Barb while the guys are downstairs. I think that there's some kind of meeting going on. I know that she and Thorne aren't-together, but she might still be scared. Katrina suggested that we all get together after the men leave so that we can talk and support each other. Maybe we can get Barb to come.\"\n\n\"It can't hurt to ask,\" Louise said. \"Let me get dressed and I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Do you think she'll come?\" Juliette asked Kevyn while they waited for Louise to get dressed.\n\n\"I wouldn't count on it,\" Kevyn replied, \"but we can hope.\"\n\nLouise came out a few minutes later wearing one of her new maternity outfits. It seemed as if overnight her regular clothes no longer fit around the waist. They were almost out of the room when she had a thought. \n\n\"Wait a minute,\" she said and ran back into the room. She came back with a small bag in which she put two maternity outfits. \"This all happened so suddenly and I don't know if she brought any maternity clothes with her.\"\n\n\"Well let's go and get yelled at,\" Kevyn said.\n\nAs they walked to the other end of the house, they passed Adrianna who was going to the kitchen to make a tray for Barb.\n\n\"Is she awake?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"She's up,\" Adrianna replied, \"but the meeting is over. I just saw Mr. Blackwell leave.\"\n\n\"Thanks, when you go downstairs will you tell the guys where we are?\" Kevyn asked.\n\nAdrianna nodded and continued on her way.\n\nThey went to the room, knocked on the door and got a curt \"who is it?\"\n\n\"It's us,\" Juliette replied. \"We wanted to check on you, can we come in?\"\n\n****\n\nBarb debated. Gene's words and the words of the voice in her head went through her head. It was up to her what happened next. Was she ready to make some concessions?"
