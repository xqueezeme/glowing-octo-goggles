        "Thanks for the comments and feedback and I am mean for leaving you guys hanging like that, but hopefully this chapter will ease at least some of your anxieties. Or course, it wont answer all of your questions, but that's the point inst it? I gotta keep you coming back for more right?\n\nThanks again, as always, I hope you.\n\n<CENTER>_(*(*(-)*)*)_</CENTER>\n\nI hesitated. I couldn't do it. Don't make that face, I know it seems like after all this time, I would be jumping for joy, breaking out the confetti and throwing a ticker tape parade, but this whole...situation didn't seem likely. For all I knew I could really be curled up on my couch dreaming about this very moment like I've done many times before. I have been known to be a tad delusional in the past. \n\nHere was Gavin for all intents and purposes commanding, not asking, me to do the one thing I have wanted to do freely for almost six years. But there was still a problem. Why did I have to be the one to kiss him? Why couldn't he kiss me? How come he couldn't just say what was really on his mind and tell me what his real intentions were? If he wanted me so badly, why couldn't he sweep me off my feet, whisk me away to the bedroom and make endless love (I visibly cringed at the word) to me like men did in the trashy romance novels I read when I thought no one was looking? More importantly, why me? Why now? After all these years, why now?\n\nWhy the hell was I standing here thinking about this now?\n\nI'm standing here thinking about all this now because I've been in this situation before. Wilson had done the same thing to me just before things between us had really picked up, and look were that got me. Trivial matters to be concerned with, I think not. \n\nI'd suppressed most of the bad emotions evoked by Wilson but now they were impossible to ignore. They came rushing back and there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it. \n\nI couldn't meet Gavin's gaze, so I stared at his throat. I watched the throbbing of his pulse at the base of his neck. \n\nThe fact that Gavin and Wilson had been such good friends for so long was always lingering in the back of my mind. So if Wilson saw me as a conquest - a joke, than what did Gavin see me as? Friends, but something more? Why now? Was this just a grown up version of their Hymen Buster game? And what does that say about Gavin that he was willing to do this with his best friend's little sister, also his best friend? \n\nGranted, Gavin and Wilson haven't had a civilized conversation in ages, but what if that was due to their extreme competitive natures? That would definitely explain why Gavin was so pissed when Wilson and I started dating. And the fight that night at Spike's, what if that started because Gavin finally got a chance to pound Wilson for getting me first? That would make sense. Right?\n\nI couldn't do it. \n\nI hesitated just far enough from Gavin to feel his heavy breaths washing across my face. I needed to think about this. There was no way I was going to let anyone hurt me as badly as I'd been hurt by Wilson, least of all my best friend. Gavin had the potential to do way more harm than Wilson ever could. Was it worth it?\n\nThis scene seemed eerily similar to the one that marked the beginning of the end with Wilson. I'd been pushing this thought away, but now there was no stopping it. It started just like this. Wilson suddenly showering me with lots of attention, hanging off me at parties, his body language making it known to everyone that he was with me now. I didn't mind it at first because I'd been used to the way guys were. Wilson found someone new, and that turned out to be me. I was different from what he was used to. I didn't primp in front of the mirror, I didn't flaunt my tits every chance I got, so I figured that after awhile of us just hanging out, eventually I would turn into one of the guys, just like I did with everyone else. \n\nI expected Wilson would go from hanging on me all the time to just hanging on me when a bouncing pair of DD's wasn't around. He would share his secrets with me, but not in an intimate way, in the way that allowed friends to get closer. We would hang out and watch Sports Center together when I wasn't with Gavin and my brother. Then eventually when he found a bouncing pair of DD's to keep him company at night, he'd ask my advice: What were the best presents to get? What do girls really want? What does it mean when a girl won't answer her phone, but I know she's been waiting for me to call? \n\nBut his attention never waned. I waited and waited for it, and was surprised when he was still hanging on me at parties, like us being together was an unspoken agreement. When I'd jokingly asked him if spending time with me was disrupting his chances of a tumble in the sheets with someone else, he looked at me like I was crazy. \n\nHe smiled his devilish grin and shook his head at me. Of course, I wanted to know what that reaction was about, so I asked. \n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" He questioned like I should have picked up on the point he was trying to make by now.\n\nI raised my eyebrows certain he'd gone off the deep-end. What the hell was he talking about? I was standing near the television in his apartment about to put in a DVD. I stood there dumbly as I waited for him to answer. \n\nWilson picked himself up from the couch and reached me in three long strides. He took the DVD from my hand and threw it behind him where it landed with a thud on the couch. His eyes trained on me and I could feel the heat beginning to rise in my cheeks. I was suddenly very nervous. The air in the room was thick with tension, and I wasn't sure what to do about it. \n\nHe ran his hands up my sides. One stopped at the base of my neck and the other stopped at my jaw. My eyes flashed wide with confusion then recognition as the pad of his thumb traced the line of my jaw. I'd never been in a situation like this before, let alone with someone as gorgeous as Wilson Butler, so I stood there numbly as he did what he wanted.\n\nHis eyes fixed on my lips as I tried to moisten them. He bent down closer to my face. With a need I didn't even know I had, I rose up on my toes to get closer to his lips that were just out of reach. I was shocked when he pulled back slightly, widening the gap between our mouths. Had I read the situation wrong? If it were possible, I'm certain I turned an even deeper shade of crimson. \n\nWilson stood a little straighter, and said to me, \"I want you to kiss me.\"\n\nMy brows knitted in confusion, if he wanted me to kiss him, then why did he pull away? The thought wasn't at the forefront of my mind, because I was distracted by how damp my panties had become. I'd kissed him before, that night at the bonfire, so I thought I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I stepped closer to him, eliminating the space between our bodies. \n\nI stared up into his face searching his features for an answer I could understand. Did he really want me, plain old Isabelle? After all the exploits I'd heard about, I was certain he couldn't be interested in me.\n\n\"Kiss me,\" he commanded again, his tone no longer soft and compassionate. I'd never done this before, so I thought it was appropriate. I watched the ocean blue of his eyes change as he looked at me. There was something in the way he said it. I didn't question it, mostly because I didn't know any better. \n\nWilson stood up tall and I rose onto my toes to get closer to his mouth. He didn't meet me half way like they do in the movies. It was all me. I was the one that went to him, and I guess that's exactly what he wanted. \n\nI kissed him. He didn't really kiss me back. I didn't realize until later that that was the problem. He commanded me to kiss him, and I did. He didn't have to do anything; I was ready and willing to do anything he'd asked. I was so caught up in the fact that Wilson Butler wanted me, that I never questioned him.\n\nI'd never had sex before, so when things progressed to his bedroom, I thought him demanding I do this, or do that, was how sex worked. He should know, right? After all the girls he'd been with, he would be the perfect person to teach me, right? But he was never satisfied. Nothing was ever good enough for him. Nothing I did was right... \n\nDo you have any idea what that feels like? You're in the bed naked with someone, at your most vulnerable, and they are telling you that you aren't any good. They don't sugar coat it by saying 'practice makes perfect', with a loving look. They say 'I thought that girl Sandy from the bar was bad at sucking cock, but you're way worse. Just stop'. \n\nDo you know what that does to a person?\n\nSo I resigned that I was just one of those people sex didn't really work for. It seemed like a good idea at the time. \n\nAfter awhile we stopped having sex all together. We didn't even try. It was nearly impossible for Wilson to get hard with me naked and him demanding I turn, this way or that.\n\nI was too stupid and I to know better and believe me, I hated myself for it.\n\nGavin was the only person to truly arouse sexual feelings in me. That night in the coffee shop bathroom was the first time I'd ever had an orgasm. But maybe Gavin was just better at sex than Wilson. I had sex with Gavin that night because it was an impulse and I forced these troubled feelings deep down but now they were back with a vengeance. \n\nI regarded that night as a fluke. But now this, this was different, today was different. That night was just sex and by the way Gavin was talking, he wanted more. How much more I wasn't sure and I didn't trust myself enough to ask. And I'm ashamed to say I didn't trust Gavin enough to answer. After Wilson, there was no way I could do this again.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" \n\nHow long I stood there lost in thought was beyond me, but Gavin's rich voice shocked me out of my thoughts so unexpectedly, I almost yelped. \n\nI still wouldn't meet his gaze. I continued to stare at the hypnotizing fluttering of his heartbeat pulsing at the hollow of his throat. My jaw clenched and my eyes clouded over with tears. \n\nI couldn't do this. \n\nGavin had the potential to hurt me a lot worse than Wilson ever could, and self-preservation just wouldn't allow that.\n\n\"Look at me.\"\n\nThere was no way I was going to do that. All I needed was to see pity in his eyes, and I'd be done for. Gavin knew better than to try and force me to look at him. He knew I was fighting back tears, but I'm certain he would never know why, and I wasn't about to tell him. \n\nI felt cold. A lot colder than I should have been having consumed all that beer and being so close to Gavin's over heated body.\n\n\"Please, Isabelle,\" Gavin said as he stepped closer to me and wrapped me up in his securing embrace. If he felt me flinch at his touch, he didn't let on that the noticed. \n\nHe and I weren't supposed to be like this. Things were supposed to be easy with Gavin. The label of best friends was supposed to wipe away all the awkwardness. He was supposed to pull my hair, eat off my plate, borrow money and never give it back. We were supposed to go to the movies together, get drunk and talk about people together. He was supposed to tell me to shut up when I was in one of my moods. We weren't supposed to be like this. We were supposed to be best friends...not this. \n\nThe desperation in his voice was almost too much. This wasn't right. Gavin sounded sincere, but Wilson taught me that was an emotion easily faked. \n\nI didn't want to, but I was so tired of fighting everything else, that I didn't fight his clutches. I'd been pretending for too long, and it was catching up with me. \n\nI melted into him, and let the scorching heat of his body envelope me. It felt good, but this was how I got into trouble in the first place. Almost immediately, I threw my guard back up. I didn't push Gavin away, but I stopped hugging him. Eventually his grip on he loosened until he got the hint and let me go. \n\nThe cold came rushing back to me. \n\n\"I'm sorry Isabelle, I didn't mean to push you, but please tell me what's wrong.\"\n\nThe pleading in his tone was almost enough to get me to raise my eyes to him. Almost. Pleading was sincerity's distant cousin, and both were very easily fabricated. I could have looked Gavin in the eye, but I was afraid I'd see the same deception there that I'd seen in Wilson's eye. I was even more afraid that since Gavin knew me so well, he'd be better at hiding it. I didn't look up.\n\nI couldn't tell Gavin what was wrong with me now. Voicing my fears out loud was way worse than just hearing them in my head. The fact that I kept the real details of my relationship with Wilson a secret was slowly chewing a hole though me. \n\nMy stomach churned as I could feel Gavin's gaze burning into the top of my head. I had to get out of there. It didn't matter that I didn't have my phone, or keys, or anything else for that matter. I was a coward, and I was going to do what I do best. Run away.\n\nWilson really did a number on me. You'd think that after a lifetime surrounded by men, I would have seen it coming \u2013 nope, and that made the pain that much worse.\n\nWithout really thinking about what I was doing, I stepped around Gavin in what little space there was between us, with every intention of bolting for the door. Gavin though, didn't let me get very far. I watched his Timbs come into view as he stepped in front of me. With the lightest touch on my hip, he held me in place. I could have pushed past him, I guess, but it was the feather light touch that kept my feet rooted to the ground. It was such a contrast from the way we usually touched each other, that I was puzzled at first.\n\nIt seemed that just the tip of his finger forced me in reverse, my feet peddling numbly backwards until I hit the pool table. I stood there, still staring down at his shoes, not sure what to do. My mind didn't seem to be working fast enough to come up with an adequate solution to this disastrous turn of events. \n\nGavin made sure I was flush with the table, then pressed his hips into mine. There was nothing sexual about the gesture even though I could feel the length of his erection pressing into me. He did it to keep me in place as he moved his hands to my hair. \n\nHe didn't say a word as we stood in the living room of his apartment hip to hip. He pulled my hair free from its messy bun and ran his fingers through my long curls, fanning them out about my shoulders and face. With my hair as a flimsy barrier, I began to feel better. \n\nGavin's feather like caresses stilled at my neck and he leaned closer to plant a kiss on my forehead. It almost seemed like he didn't mind that I lacked the courage to meet his gaze. His touches weren't sexual, but they made me feel all warm and tingly inside. I felt safe. For the first time, in a long time, I felt safe. \n\nWithout so much as a grunt, or an expression of exertion, he grabbed me by the hips and hoisted me up onto the lip of the pool table. The table allowed us to be eye level with each other, but I still wouldn't meet his gaze. Instead I watched his chest. I examined the weave of his undershirt with undaunted concentration. I began to question everything about it.\n\nWhere was it made? How long did it take to make it? How many yards of string was it made from? My mind was flitting from question to question \u2013 anything to keep my mind off the present. I was one hiccup away from freaking the fuck out.\n\nGavin stepped closer to me as I tried to imagine the process of his shirt being made. He gripped me around my thighs and pulled me closer to the edge of the table. He separated my legs so he could fit between them. My arms hung limply at my sides as I tried not to imagine where this situation could end up. \n\nMy mind had been working on overdrive for so long that it seemed to have run out of steam. I didn't feel capable of rational thought at this point, so I sat there. I didn't want to think anymore. If I were being honest, I didn't want to feel anymore either. Maybe Gavin would tire himself out if I just let him do what he wanted. Then I wouldn't have to run from him, he'd run from me. Then I could walk away and never come back. I didn't think there would be anyway I'd be able to look him in the eye ever again. Self pity was eating me alive.\n\nIsn't it funny how things change?\n\nGavin said nothing as he stood in between my legs. Judging by the lump I felt, I knew his erection still hadn't subsided. Even with the physical presence of his arousal between us, his caresses still didn't feel sexual; they felt comforting. He continued to twirl my hair through his fingers. He ran his hands down my sides as he searched for my eyes. I turned away, not wanting him to see my face.\n\nHe placed both hands on the pool table on either side of me, and leaned down. It was the pose of someone who was about to give up, and I couldn't help but sigh in relief. Finally, this would all be over.\n\nGavin watched my profile then stood. He slid his hands to my lower back as if trying to hold me in place and leaned my body towards his. I would have been afraid of falling if his frame wasn't supporting mine. More gently than I could ever have imagined, he pressed his lips to my temples. Once he was certain that I wasn't going anywhere, he slid his hands up to the base of my neck. \n\nI tired not to flinch as he touched me. The flood of memories of the things Wilson did to me made me feel dirty. I wouldn't be good enough for anyone, and Gavin was about to find that out. I tried to tell him the nice way, but he just wouldn't listen. This wasn't how I wanted our friendship to end. If anything, I wanted us to be friends long into our old age. Now I'd have to wait until he found out for himself and decided I was just as useless as Wilson said I was. \n\nGod, how pathetic am I?\n\nI sat stoically, waiting for him to reach his conclusion. \n\nI closed my eyes as I felt the thumbs of his hands gently press my chin higher. I heard his sharp intake of breath and didn't realize I'd been crying until I felt his lips connect with the wetness on my cheeks. \n\nI remained still, determined to not feel any more humiliation than I already felt. Crying is a useless emotion, but I couldn't help it.\n\nI got close, but never managed to keep the tears from falling. I never cried, especially in front of someone else. This was beyond humiliating. Now I was crying and didn't even know it. Surely my best friend had to be having some second thoughts now. Maybe he'd realize I wasn't worth it and let me go. I could only hope.\n\nHe continued to plant feather-light kisses on my face. The tears were falling in earnest now and I didn't even try to stop them. I kept my eyes closed as I felt him kiss them away. He moved to my eyelids, then my cheekbones then back to my forehead. Once he kissed the furrows from my brow, he moved to my jaw. \n\nGavin began to kiss down my neck and tickled my collarbone with his growing stubble. I stifled the moan that cautioned escape. If I just kept a clear head, I wouldn't get caught up. I'd be able to wait it out. Surely, Gavin wouldn't want to expend that much energy on me. \n\nKeeping a clear head was easier said then done. \n\nGavin began to hold me tighter to him as his kisses increased in potency. I felt his tongue snake out of his mouth and tease the dip in my neck where my collarbones joined. He traced my jaw with his lips allowing his tongue to sneak out every now and then, his teeth nipping at my chin. I was beginning to see why he liked it so much when I did that to him. Involuntarily, I moaned into his mouth as he moved to kiss the edges of my lips. \n\nI didn't realize until he grabbed my hands and laced his fingers through mine that I'd been shaking. \n\n\"God Isabelle,\" he never called me Isabelle. Here it comes, I thought as I squeezed my eyes shut. It was almost over. ",
        "\"I am so sorry,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"What did he do to you?\"\n\nThat wasn't what I'd expected to hear. Without thinking, my eyes flew open and it took me a minute to adjust. The harsh lights and my teary eyes cast a haze around Gavin's beautiful features. \n\nHe was staring down at me as I finally managed to look up at him. \n\n\"I am so sorry,\" he said again. He bent his head toward mine stopping when our foreheads touched. He was silently asking permission for him to go any further. I didn't say yes, but I didn't flinch when his lips got closer to mine.\n\nHis lips touched mine tenderly as if he were trying to restrain himself. \"Baby, I am so sorry.\"\n\nThe sudden movement of me throwing my arms around his shoulders and pulling him closer shocked him, but he quickly recovered as he hugged me back. I didn't realize I was sobbing into his shoulder until he tired to quiet me.\n\n\"I swear to god, I won't let him hurt you ever again.\" He took a deep breath. \"I'll fuckin kill him.\"\n\nI sobbed harder. This was embarrassing, but I couldn't stop. The sincerity in his voice was tearing down all the defenses I'd build up. I clamped my mouth shut in effort to quiet my sobs, and he told me not to. He wanted me to let it out. Talk about showing weakness.\n\nI sat on the edge of his pool table in his apartment clutching myself to him. If my life depended on it, I don't think I could have let him go. His hands let go of my back as he wrapped my legs around his waist. Seemingly without an ounce of effort, he lifted me in his arms and held me to his chest. He settled me on his waist with his hands clapped underneath my bottom.\n\n\"I \u2013 I'm to \u2013 too heavy.\" It was the first thing I said and it came out in gasps as I tried to control myself. \n\n\"That's what you're worried about?\" He asked as he stepped away from the pool table. He was standing like he didn't have a full-grown human clutching onto him for dear life. \"Don't worry, I got you.\"\n\nI felt the muscles of his hips and torso shift under me as he began to sway to the music I hadn't heard until now. My sobs had quieted, and I wasn't sure what was next. Gavin continued to dance while holding me, slowly lulling me to sleep. My head was pounding and I was still certain in the back of my mind that there was still time for him to change his mind. \n\nThe music continued and he shifted and swayed. I lay my head on his shoulder as he turned to inhale the scent of my hair. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feel of him beneath me. His hard chest was pressed against mine, and I could feel the faint pitter-patter of his heartbeat. Neither of us spoke as he danced with me in the middle of the floor, the pool game long forgotten.\n\nHe has to be sick of holding me, I thought as I attempted to disentangle myself from him. I was about to unwrap my legs from around his waist when I felt his hand on my thigh.\n\n\"No.\" He pulled back to survey my face. \"I like this. Let me hold you.\"\n\nI tightened my legs around him, pulling myself closer to him in the process. I hadn't noticed until now that he was still hard. He ignored his arousal as he continued to hold me to him while swaying to the music.\n\nI wasn't sure how long we stood like that, but I stirred when I felt him reach behind him first with one hand then the other to untie my boots and slip them off my feet. \n\nGavin turned and started walking. I began to panic when I realized he was walking towards his bedroom. As he walked down the hall, he kicked off his own boots, leaving them in a haphazard pile in the hallway. \n\nMy breath started to quicken - not in a good way; in that way I knew something bad was about to happen. He kicked his door open and closed it behind him. I couldn't breathe, and I wanted to get out of his arms. This was the perfect way for my short-lived happiness to end. \n\nGavin walked to the edge of his bed, and I tried to get away from him.\n\n\"Shh,\" he said. \"Nothing is going to happen. I promise.\" I stilled, but I still didn't completely believe him. \n\nWith me still hanging off him, he pulled the comforter back and crawled into the bed. I was willing to let go so he could move freely, but he wouldn't have any of it. He held me tighter as he climbed into the bed with me dangling underneath him. Silently, I marveled at his strength.\n\nHe laid me down gently on the bed and shifted slightly so he wouldn't crush me beneath his weight. \n\nI knew what was supposed to happen, but I didn't want to ruin it. I had to do this right. With a shaky hand, I snaked it down in between us. I sighed trying to force Wilson's sneer from my mind. My hand was still shaking when it connected with Gavin's belt. \n\nMy eyes flew open as I felt Gavin's steely grip on mine. I'd messed up already, and Gavin was about to tell me how bad it was.\n\n\"I told you nothing was going to happen.\" I looked at him like he was crazy. \"Nothing is going to happen, and I mean it. You need to rest.\"\n\nI stared at him in shock as he removed my hand from his belt and brought it his lips.\n\n\"What about you?\" His erection had to be hurting him by now, but he didn't look the least bit uncomfortable. \n\n\"I'll be fine,\" he said as he tucked my hand into his. I was about to open my mouth in protest, but he silenced me with a kiss. \n\nHis lips teased and tasted mine. I couldn't do anything but melt into his touch. Words couldn't describe the relief I felt. Wilson would have been demanding I put his thing in my mouth and make him happy. But Gavin was content with just cradling me in his arms. Maybe there was hope yet.\n\nGavin broke the kiss and tucked my head under his chin, our fingers still entwined. I chanced a look out the window and saw the sun low on the horizon. The brilliant colors of the sky and the sound of Gavin's heartbeat under my ear slowly and gently pulled me under, and I fell asleep.\n\n<CENTER>_(*(*(-)*)*)_</CENTER>\n\nI knew it was a dream, but I couldn't seem to wake myself. I was in Wilson's apartment; we had been talking about nothing in particular. This was how the dream had always started, and I couldn't make it stop. We were sitting on the couch watching a movie. He was acting distant and he hadn't paid much attention to me since I got there. We had just gotten back form a party at one of his friend's houses. \n\nAt the party, he'd been every bit attentive as a boyfriend should be. He always was when we were in front of other people. I thought things would get better after he promised me they would, but when he got back to his place, he slipped right back into his old routine. To be honest, I liked it better when he was ignoring me.\n\nVaguely I wondered why I even bothered answering the phone when he called me anymore, but I was his girlfriend, he said he'd wanted to see me. I had blown off my brother and Gavin to be there, and I was having a miserable time. I wondered what they were up to. \n\nA raunchy sex scene appeared on the TV and Wilson, enthralled, leaned forward. I rolled my eyes at the girl on the screen. The movie didn't have to show everything for me to understand what was going on. I rolled my eyes at the sounds the girl was making. No one made noise like that during sex, at least not in my experience.\n\nWilson turned to me, a sudden glint in his eye, and I tried not to cringe. I knew what he wanted, and I was surprised it had taken this long for him to express his want. He stood and turned his back to the television. He was staring down at me with that far away look in his eye. \n\n\"You know what to do,\" he growled as he started unbuttoning his pants.\n\nBut this time, something was different. This time I told him no.\n\nHe dropped his pants and grabbed the back of my head. His cock was bouncing in front of him standing only at half-mast but my struggling was causing it to fill with blood.\n\n\"C'mon baby, you could get it right this time.\"\n\nI felt the bile rise in my throat as I tired to untangle his fingers from my hair. If I could just get away from him, I knew that everything would be okay, but it seemed like the harder I struggled, the harder it was for me to get away.\n\nWilson took a step closer and tried to force himself into my mouth. With all the strength I had, I pushed at his body, but it wasn't enough to get him away from me. He was overpowering me, and I couldn't escape. \n\nI felt his hands leave my hair and I tried to get up. His hands were on me so fast they felt like shackles as they pressed me deeper into the couch. I could just give in and let him do what he wanted. He would be finished in a minute, then he would leave me alone, but something was different.\n\nI didn't give in I kept struggling. I was thrashing around as I tried to get more distance in-between us. I was pushing and kicking trying not to look into his face. I heard someone call my name, but I was so caught up in trying to get away from him that I didn't recognize the voice right away.\n\n\"Isabelle!\" They shouted it again. It sounded like Gavin, but what was he doing in Wilson's apartment?\n\n\"Isabelle, wake up!\" My eyes flew open, and for a second, the darkness of the room seemed even more oppressive than my dream had. Where the hell was I?\n\n\"Isabelle, it's only a dream.\" \n\nI could feel what was around my wrists, pressing me into what had to be a bed.\n\nGavin's voice was coming in clearer now, and I stopped struggling. He was sitting on top of me holding me down. I instantly relaxed. \"It was just a dream.\"\n\nEven in the darkness I could see the concern etched across his face. I wanted to dissolve into tears, but I forced myself to keep it together. I didn't think it was fair to let him see me cry anymore. \n\n\"You said his name.\" Gavin's features hardened as he let go of my wrists. He slid off me and lay down on his side facing me. I was still lying on my back staring up at the ceiling. \n\nNow was not the time for this conversation.\n\n\"Yea well, everyone has nightmares, right?\" I said trying to keep my tone light. I tried to remember where my shoes and jacket were.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Stop apologizing,\" I snapped. If I could just get us back into the role of best friends, I would be able to deal with him better. I wasn't sure how to deal when he was acting like...this.\n\nGavin sighed and brushed some of the hair from my face. \n\n\"Then what would you like me to do?\" His voice had grown husky.\n\n\"What time is it?\" I asked changing the subject.\n\n\"Because I could think of a few things I could do.\" He continued as if I hadn't just tied to derail him. \"Well, they would involve you too, of course.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes in the darkness. This was comforting, despite my breakdown earlier and the nightmare that was still sending shocks through me, we were right back to where we used to be. That felt good. \n\n\"And what did you have in mind? No more alcohol I hope.\" I grinned to myself. I was tempting fate and I knew it.\n\n\"Well, now that you're awake, we could play Parcheesi, perhaps Scrabble.\" I laughed out loud. \"Or we could do something else.\" I raised an eyebrow. \"Charades has always been one of my favorites. I would be willing to show you some of the pretty amazing things I could do with my hands.\" He looked so smug I couldn't stand it. \n\nThe quick retort died on my lips as I felt his paw land on my breast. He found my nipple through the fabric of my shirt and bra and began to trace his finger around it. I moaned out loud.\n\n\"Or,\" he continued. \"We could watch a movie, or go get something to eat, but something tells me you won't want to leave this bedroom.\"\n\nMy brain fogged over, and I couldn't concentrate. His lips landed on my neck and I shuddered. \n\n\"What makes you think I want to play Charades with you?\" I asked trying to keep my tone conversational. We both knew the kind of Charades he was talking about.\n\n\"Why don't I let my hands do the talking?\" He snaked his tongue along my neck to my ear. He sucked my earlobe into his mouth and did something with it that made me gasp.\n\nI made an effort not to protest as I felt the heat of his hand creep lower down my stomach. I prayed he couldn't feel the butterflies flapping in my belly as his hand connected with my bare flesh. His fingers drew lazy circles on my abdomen as he waited for me to answer. When I said nothing, he slid his hand further up under my shirt, bunching the fabric as he moved his hand higher and higher.\n\nI tired not to get ahead of myself as he bent lower to kiss and lick my neck. I was fast learning that this was a place of great pleasure for me.\n\nIn one motion, he shoved my bra above my breasts as his fingers met with the resistance. He palmed a breast in his hand and I couldn't stop myself from arching into his touch. He rolled the bud of my nipple in his hand as he continued to kiss his way down to my chest.\n\nHis mouth landed on my other nipple. He captured the pebble in his mouth through my shirt as he continued to stoke my arousal to even greater heights. I forgot about everything, all I wanted was more of his mouth, and more of it everywhere. \n\nGavin was making mewling sounds as he tired to get as much of my breast into his mouth through my shirt. I was breathless at the sight of this gorgeous creature sprawled across me, worshiping my breasts. The fact that I couldn't see where his hand was going made my senses that much more heightened.\n\nHe shifted and slid his knee in between my legs. I felt my panties stick to me, held in place by the wetness Gavin was coaxing out of me. I moaned as I felt his knee start to move back and forth between my legs.\n\nI moaned and tangled my fingers in his hair. I wasn't sure which sensation to concentrate on as he moved his kisses back up to my neck. He captured my lips with his as he shifted on top of me. \n\nI could feel his erection pressing into me from behind the rough material of his jeans. I clutched at his back as he slowly ground into me making it known exactly what he wanted from me. \n\nThis was so much different than that night in the coffee shop. That night, he'd been drunk, and I'd been caught off guard. Then we'd just succumbed to an attraction; him to what he wanted, and me to his angering good looks. Maybe I was reading too much into it, which I have been known to do, but if I wasn't \u2013 this would be SEX. Not just a hump in a bathroom, sex. \n\nBut if this didn't go well, I'd loose my best friend. If this didn't go well, I'd never be able to look him in the eye. I couldn't do it. \n\nI could feel the panic starting to rise in me from his silent demand. For just a second, I faltered, but Gavin felt it. He stilled with his erection still pressed into me. \n\n\"I'm nothing like him.\" \n\nWith a fire and intensity I'd never seen before, his eyes shone brightly through the night. My heart seized and my throat clutched. I didn't trust myself to speak. Today had been filled with more than my fair share of emotional exchanges, and I didn't think I could handle another. \n\nA slight nod of my head was all I could manage, but the look that passed between us assured me that Gavin understood what I was trying to say and in so many words, I understood him too. I was relieved the words weren't spoken out loud. Words lead to expectations and unmet expectations lead to disappoint. Leaving things unspoken was probably a good thing.\n\nJust as I decided to push all misgivings aside, a smile spread across his face. I was about to ask him what was so funny when he ground himself into me. His smile got wider when I groaned, and even wider when I panted his name. The full contact of his body on mine, creating the delicious friction between my legs scrambled my thoughts. \n\nI glared at him as I opened my mouth to scold him. It wasn't nice of him to try and derail me like that. I was about to tell him so when he did it again.\n\nHe caught his lower lip in between his teeth as he tried unsuccessfully to contain his mega watt smile.\n\n\"Is there something you wanted to say?\" He asked as he hovered above me. I was still extremely aware of every inch of his body that was touching mine. \n\n\"You think you're \u2013 uhhhh.\" Despite myself, my words melted into one long moan as his head descended to the hollow in my throat and his hips swiveled into mine. \n\nMy own smile appeared on my lips as I ran my fingers through his silky hair. I grabbed either side of his face, and stopped him from moving. He looked up alarmed until he saw the grin spread across my face, but his brows were still knitted in confusion. \n\n\"Two can play that game,\" I said as I slid a hand down his neck to his stomach. It seemed like he stopped breathing as I slid my hand lower; my eyes still locked on his gaze. I could feel his stomach muscles tense as I traced a light pattern on his stomach through his undershirt. \n\nHe growled at my teasing when my hands stopped at his belt. I fingered the buckle trying not to laugh at the barely restrained lust in Gavin's eyes. He was a hair away from snapping, but I liked playing with fire. Slowly I drew one finger along the zipper of his jeans, causing him to shudder. I could feel the vibrations in my own hand, and I could only imagine what this felt like to him. \n\nHis eyes closed and his jaw clenched. My smile got wider when he grunted. \"Was there something you wanted to say?\" I asked teasingly.\n\n\"You're gonna get it, Red.\"\n\nMy heart quickened, and I knew he could feel it. Unconsciously I humped myself to him.\n\n\"Get what?\" I was surprised at the tremble in my voice. I couldn't wait.\n\n\"Exactly what's coming to you,\" he said as he clamped his teeth down on my nipple through my shirt; the hardened bud marking his target. \n\nThe mixing sensation of pleasure and pain caused me to cry out. I tried to keep it together, but I couldn't. My hands flew to his hair as I clutched him to me and rode out the waves of pleasure that were washing though me. He'd barely touched me, and already I was feeling better than I ever had. \n\nHe alternated rolling each nipple in between his teeth as he fumbled to pull my pants off. I would have helped him, but at this point, I didn't think I would've been capable of undoing the complex mechanism of a button and a zipper. \n\nI raised my hips to help him get my pants off. We were both panting, him bathing my nipple in his warm breath, and me fluttering his hair as I tried to catch mine. He sat back on his heels and pulled off his undershirt and started working on his jeans. \n\n\"Take your clothes off.\"\n\nI shimmied under the covers, pulled off my t-shirt and bra and tossed them across the room. He was indulging me as he slid beneath the covers with me, only clad in his boxers.\n\nHe kept his jaw clenched as he lay down beside me on his side with his head propped up on one hand. His other hand landed on my stomach, just like it had before, but this time, it began its journey south. Watching my face, he slid his hand lower and lower. I waited for him to finally touch me the way my body was asking for, but his hands took a detour and landed on my hipbone. \n\nI grunted in frustration as he swirled his fingers closer and closer to my sex, but never quite hitting their mark. He said nothing as he watched my face.\n\n\"Stop teasing me, damnit.\" I could feel my juices literally leaking out of me onto the bed. I knew I couldn't take much more of this before I exploded.\n\nGavin ran a calloused hand down my thigh then back up to my waist. He pulled me closer to him with one hand. His touch was feather light when he moved his hand to catch my thigh and drape it over his legs. Now I was turned and had no choice but to look him in the eye.\n\nI slight smile appeared on his face as he ran his hand up and down my back as if trying to memorize every curve and dip of my skin. My eyes fell to his lips as he traced his tongue along them. I wanted to, but I couldn't look him in the eye as his hand stopped on the swell of my behind and gripped me even tighter to him. I couldn't help but push back into his hand as he slid his fingers between my cheeks. He stopped briefly and teased my rosebud causing me to cry out at the unfamiliar sensation. My face heated a deep red when I heard him chuckle.",
        "\"Look at me.\"\n\nIt took me a second to build up the courage, but when our eyes finally met, his fingers slid lower and grazed my quivering slit. I grunted. I couldn't help it, it just came out. I grunted and grabbed onto his arm as his fingers continued to tickle my sex. I would have been more embarrassed by how wet I was if I couldn't feel the twitch of his erection as it rested hotly against my belly. \n\nThe look in his eye told me he was more than ready, but he was doing this slowly for my benefit, and boy was it working. I could feel his middle finger parting my lips and swirling through my wetness as he lay looking at me as if we were talking about politics. The fact that he was doing everything in his power to remain under control, sent a wave of tingles through my body at the knowledge that little 'ol Red was doing this to Big Bad Gavin.\n\nGavin slid his middle finger further up my slit cautious not to touch my clit. I could have screamed, but a smile spread across my face as I realized this was what he wanted. I would have given in to him without hesitation, but I wanted to see how far he could go without losing control. \n\nGavin swirled his fingers around my clit and I couldn't help the involuntary shudder that went through me. I caught my lip between my teeth as I tried to stifle a moan when he added a second finger. I could feel him moving his fingers back to my dripping slit. He poised his fingers at my entrance then stilled them.\n\n\"Show me what you want.\" I couldn't resist. The timber of his voice had dropped and sent a chill through me. \n\nTo hell with seeing how long he can hold out, because I certainly can't.\n\nI began to move my hips trying to get his fingers as deep into me as they would go as he lay there staring at me with watchful eyes. I grunted in frustration when no matter what I did, I couldn't get them far enough into me. I reached out and grabbed his hand, forcing his fingers closer to my sex, and he let me. I pushed his hand into me and held it there. I didn't know what came over me as I mashed the heel of his hand into my clit and continued to move my hips on his fingers. \n\nI could feel them deep inside me now, two of his thick, rough fingers deeper in my sex than anyone had ever been with only the digits on their hand. Together they were stretching me as I continued to move my hips up and down bring myself closer and closer to the edge. My eyes closed as I tried to refrain from calling out his name and verbalizing how badly I needed him. \n\nHe kept his hand still as I brought myself closer and closer. My hips began to move erratically as I felt the tingle start in my toes and begin to creep higher. The shocks were too intense already and I couldn't keep up my rhythm. I was so close I could taste it, but the force of this orgasm was already starting to lock my muscles and it hadn't even hit me yet.\n\n\"Open your eyes.\" My eyes flew to his face as I screamed out his name when he shoved his fingers deeper into me still. He shoved his fingers in and out of my dripping cunt faster than my mind could process as I felt my pussy begin to spasm around his fingers. \n\nI could feel the muscles in his arm tense as he continued to pound me with his more than capable fingers. My eyes began to flutter closed as I felt my orgasm about to ripple through me, but again he commanded me to open them, and I did. \n\nMy muscles locked and the leg thrown over his waist tightened around him brining him closer to me. White dots were floating in front of my eyes as my voice caught in my throat. Gavin reached down and clamped a nipple between his teeth as I felt the stabs of pleasure shoot through me.\n\nI screamed and thrashed while he stayed latched onto me as I loudly rode out the waves of my orgasm. His fingers were still inside me, and the walls of my pussy were still milking them for the reward it wanted. I collapsed onto my back, and Gavin, still attached to my nipple, followed me.\n\nGavin relinquished the grip he had on my chest, and I could see his teeth impressions left in my skin. I was about to comment when he wiggled his fingers erasing any coherent thought in my brain. He swirled his fingers around in my juices and pulled them away from my body. I tried to suppress the whimper that escaped my lips when his fingers left me. I felt empty.\n\nI watched from under hooded lashes as he brought his fingers to my lips. I knew what he wanted, and obediently, I opened my mouth and drew his index finger into my mouth. I had never tasted my own juices before, but under the circumstances, it seemed perfectly appropriate. \n\nI was surprised that I liked what I tasted. Gavin grunted as I began to suck on his finger harder trying to remove all traces of myself from his forefinger. I swirled my tongue around the tip of his finger like I would if his dick were in my mouth. He pulled his finger from my mouth, and slipped his middle finger between his own lips. His eyes closed in satisfaction as he removed the evidence of my arousal from his hand. \n\nHe said nothing as he drew his finger from his mouth and placed his lips on mine. The fact that I could still taste myself on his lips made me probe his mouth deeper with my tongue. \n\nI shifted on top of him as we continued to kiss each other. I straddled his waist and folded myself onto him. His hands moved from my face to my hips as I moved my kisses to his jaw and nipped at his chin. I kissed my way to his Adam's apple and licked at the masculine protrusion there. I could feel the vibrations of his growl as his hands pushed my hips harder into the erection shielded from my sex by only the thin material of his boxers. \n\nI wasn't sure what to do, but following his lead, I kissed a trail to his pebbled nipples and pulled them into my mouth nipping at them with my teeth the same way he'd done to me. \n\n\"Harder,\" he barked through clenched teeth. \n\nI hesitantly closed my teeth on the rosy bunched flesh. He commanded me to do it harder until he grabbed the back of my head and held me in place. I alternated sides, making sure that each got equal attention. I looked him in the eye as I started to kiss his stomach. I could feel his muscles clenching under my lips as I kissed lower and lower. \n\nFeeling devious, I snaked a hand between our bodies and latched onto his erection. I was a little unsure what to do, but his hand clamped over mine as he showed me how tightly he wanted me to stroke him. I could feel the wetness that leaked out of the tip of his engorged member, and my only thought was to see what it tasted like. \n\nI slid lower down his body with his hand still clamped around mine and I snaked my tongue out and tasted the wetness. Gavin's hips arched off the bed toward my face startling me. I looked up at his face startled afraid I'd already done something wrong. His eyes were closed, his head thrown back and his jaw clenched. \n\nA smile spread across my lips as I realized he wasn't upset, he was trying to keep himself from exploding all over my face. I stuck my tongue out and licked at the tip again. I watched his stomach muscles clench as he grumbled something I couldn't understand. His steely grip was still around my hand when he slid our hands lower down his cock letting more of the angry purple head peak free. \n\nFeeling brave, I slid the whole head into my mouth and sucked hard. His reaction this time was wholly unexpected as he sat up, grasped me under the arms, and flipped me onto my back so I was lying where he just was. In a flash, he was on top of me shoving his entire length into me.\n\nI cried out at the unexpected intrusion into my body. My eyes shot the ceiling, and my mouth hung open in a silent cry as my body tried to figure out how to decipher the pleasure I was feeling at my best friend slamming his hard and hot length into me. \n\nWith one hand, he grabbed my hair and pulled so more of my neck was exposed. His teeth bit down on the side of my neck as he continued to pound into me. I knew there would be a mark. The pain of the bite and the pleasure created by the friction his cock was causing caused me to cry out. \n\nI wrapped my legs around him as he ground his pelvis into my clit. I could feel my leg starting to twitch, and I wasn't sure if it was a good thing or not, but I wasn't about to stop and ask.\n\nGavin pounded into me relentlessly and he held himself up on his forearms, his face just inches from mine.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he bit out under his breath. \"Do you like it baby?\"\n\nA whimper was the only thing I could get out, the force of his thrusts was knocking the wind out of me. \n\n\"Say it,\" he growled into my ear as he snaked his tongue around my ear.\n\nI opened my mouth and a moan escaped. My throat felt dry, and I didn't think I'd be able to say anything for a couple of days.\n\n\"Say it!\" he yelled as he slammed viscously into me. It almost hurt, but I wouldn't have told him to stop for the world. \n\n\"Oh god, I \u2013 it...it feels so soo go \u2013 good. Don't stop.\" I could barely get the words out as he picked up speed.\n\n\"Cum for me Isabelle.\"\n\nI wasn't sure if it was him calling me Isabelle, the fact that I was already so close to orgasm, or if I felt his cock swell and begin to twitch inside of me that set me off, but it did. I came on his command, my pussy spasming tightly around his dick still sawing in and out of me. \n\nHe grunted and shouted as he erupted inside of me, my pussy still spasming trying to milk more and more of his cum from his body. His arms trembled, and he collapsed on top of me still buried inside of me. He tried to move off me, but the weight of his body was comforting and I wrapped my legs around him to keep him in me. \n\nGavin swirled his hips gently coaxing a moan from my throat as he captured my mouth again. I traced my hands up and down his sweaty back as his hands tangled in my hair and pressed my mouth harder to him. \n\nWe fell asleep just like that.\n\n<CENTER>_(*(*(-)*)*)_</CENTER>\n\nI'd lost track of how many times I woke during the night to him pulling me beneath him and slipping into me. It was much slower the gentler than the first time. I knew I was going to be sore in the morning but I didn't care. He'd taken me while I was on my stomach, on my side, and in any other position imaginable, and I was always astounded that no matter when I woke, I was wet and ready for him.\n\nI woke in the morning exhausted but sated as I pulled myself as gently as I could from under his arm without waking him. Gavin slept like the dead and I knew he wouldn't wake if I didn't jostle him. I just needed some time to think things over.\n\nOn the one hand, this was the most amazing thing ever, on the other; I've said those words before. \n\nI stood from his bed ashamed that I was as naked as the day I was born, but I did take little solace in the fact that he couldn't see me. I gave up searching for my clothes, because between his messy room, and the tossed about bed linens, I couldn't find a damn thing.\n\nChancing a glance back at Gavin to make sure he was still sleeping, I had a hard time stifling the giggle that was threatening to escape. He was spread out over the bed spread eagle; the only stitch of fabric covering him was the corner of his black sheets that shielded one wrist from view. He looked like a little kid, a blissful smile spread across his face. My eyes slid down his body as I caught sight of the long jagged scar running from the top of his mid right thigh to his hipbone. Instantly, rage filled me. I'd forgotten about the scar \u2013 its presence and occurrence wasn't something Gavin liked to talk about. The rage probably would have consumed me if I hadn't gotten a glimpse at the sleeping organ nestled against his thigh.\n\nEven now it looked like a sleeping monster, just waiting to get another shot, at what it wanted. I scurried to the bathroom mindful of the fact that I didn't want to get caught ogling my best friend. As I slipped into the bathroom, and turned on the water, the smile I didn't know was across my face, slowly melted away.\n\nAs the water washed over me, I began to realize that this wasn't a situation I could control any more. I almost had another panic attack in the shower as I realized that things still had the potential to head right down the shitter. \n\nI'm not sure how long I stood in the shower, trying to scrub myself clean. Now that it was morning, we would definitely see each other in a new light. Would he have any regrets? Would I? The more worked up I got; the more I lathered and scrubbed at my skin. I was going to drive myself insane if I didn't figure out what the hell was really going on. \n\nBy the time I was ready to get out of the shower, I'd forgotten that I didn't have any clothes with me. I wrapped Gavin's towel around my body silently chastising him for not buying bigger towels. The damn thing barely covered me. \n\nI reached into the top drawer for Gavin's brush, when I noticed a big box of open condoms yearning to be used. I had to grip the edge of the counter when I physically felt the blood drain from my face.\n\nNot a big deal, right? I know for a fact that most guys keep condoms all over their homes, cars and sometimes in their desks at work, so why was this box so troubling? Well, for one thing, it was almost empty, for another, Gavin never used one last night...or this morning. \n\nThe force of that thought buckled my knees as I sat down hard on the toilet. How many times had Gavin cum inside me last night? My mind raced as I tried to calculate my last period. I couldn't do it. Sitting in his bathroom with the hot steam of my shower swirling around my head was not conducive to control my panic. The moisture in the air made it hard to breathe. \n\nI wobbly stumbled to my feet and pushed my way out of the bathroom. I couldn't even remember where the closest CVS was located; I could always get the Morning After Pill. I froze mid step in the hallway. Was that something I was actually willing to do? I had never given it much thought before. Was a baby something I was ready for? I knew the answer to that question before I even finished thinking it. Gavin certainly wouldn't want a baby \u2013 let alone a baby with me. \n\nI shook my head. I was getting ahead of myself. It was only one night. One night of sex. One night of great sex. \n\nI took a deep breath and told myself over and over that it was impossible. I couldn't happen to me. \n\nI'm not pregnant. I didn't realize I was speaking the words aloud until I heard them cut through the fog and silence that was spilling out of the bathroom around me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to quiet the groan that was threatening to escape. There was no fuckin way.\n\nNope.\n\nNumbly, I walked down the hall to the living room just glancing into Gavin's room to make sure he was still sleeping. He was on his side, turned toward the window, and I was more than relieved. The last thing I needed was for him to wake and ask me why my face was so pale. \n\nI shuffled into the living room, Gavins hair brush hanging limply from my fingers. I snatched the remote off the floor determined to let the noise of the news drown out the screaming in my head and distract me.\n\nThe images were flashing before my eyes, but I wasn't seeing them. Instead I was seeing Gavin's reaction when I had to tell him the consequences our night of passion brought. I sighed heavily and kept pretending to watch the news. It was 9:30 in the morning all ready and I had to be at work in a couple hours. Hopefully there, I would be busy enough to forget about my newest set of problems. \n\nWas I being dramatic? It's totally possible. Unreasonable even, but at least I felt like my concerns were grounded in reality. Gavin had a very serious view on children; they were money pits and sources of stress. He avoided them at all costs. I don't know if Gavin thought I was on the pill, but when...if I reminded him that last night, we didn't use condoms, he'd probably blame the lapse in judgment on me. \n\nWe have seen plenty of our friends fall victims to girlfriends who conveniently forgot to take their birth control to trap their man into a dying relationship. Gavin was almost shouldered with that responsibility once, and I cringed to think about his reaction. If I told Gavin nearly an identical situation happened between us, I'm not sure what he'd do.\n\nOf course he would take half the blame, but the other half, the big part would be on me. He would yell and scream and remind me that he never remembers anything. He'd tell me that even though he had a part in what happened, I should have been thinking about what we were doing. He'd be mad as hell at me.\n\nI wanted the throw the brush against the wall as hard as I could, but instead I sighed and kept brushing. Throwing a fit wouldn't solve nothing. My shoulders slumped as I struggled to detangle the mess that had become my hair. \n\nAll I had to do was act normal, and get things back to normal. Treat Gavin like nothing significant between us had ever happened \u2013 that way if my fears materialized, he would understand that trapping him wasn't what I wanted. There was absolutely no reason to freak until I could figure out when my last period was. I silently berated myself for not paying closer attention to it, but then again, I never had a reason to. \n\nJust keep things friendly.\n\nWhen the news became repetitive, I reached around for the remote without taking my eyes off the television. Somehow it ended up perched on the back of the couch, and when my fingers grazed it, it clamored to the floor. I mentally smacked myself in the head hoping that the noise hadn't woken Gavin. I still wasn't ready to talk to him yet. As I stood to get the remote, my eyes slid to the clock. It was 9:49. Sooner or later, I would have to face the music, because somehow I had to get to work.\n\nThe idea flitted in my head that I could just sneak out, call a taxi and go to work like nothing was different. Of course, this was the chicken way to do things, but I honestly didn't think that left alone with Gavin I would be able to keep my fears to myself. That would be a sure fire way to end the great night I'd had with him. \n\nStill mentally debating the best course of action, I walked to the back of the couch and saw the edge of the remote poking out from under the back of the couch. I got down on all fours cautious not to push the remote even further out of my grasp. Of course, what did I do? I knocked the damn thing even further away from me. Now I had one arm almost completely extended under the couch trying to get to the remote. \n\nI thought I heard something behind me, but I couldn't tell with the sound of the television and my head pressed against the bottom half of the couch. I could feel the remote, just out of reach, and I prayed that nothing was under there that was going to bite me. I knew for a fact that Gavin only cleaned when it was absolutely necessary. \n\nThe tips of my fingers gripped onto the remote and I began to gingerly slip it out, the last thing I wanted to do was loose it under his massive couch. \n\n\"Hah!\" I exclaimed as I finally saw the end of the remote peak out from under the couch again. \"Gotcha.\"\n\nI sat back on my heels and sighed. That was one small victory in what I was sure was going to be a very difficult day. I re-tightened the towel around me and used my hands to push myself to my feet. I was almost straightened when I felt a rough hand push me back down.\n\nThe sudden pressure and heat from that hand nearly shocked me out of my skin, but there was no doubt in my mind who it was when the sound of the gruff voice commanded me to stay just was I was when I tried to stand up.\n\n\"I have to go to work,\" I choked out. Heat flooded my face when I realized the view he must have gotten. How long had he been standing there? There was no doubt that he saw everything, and I was so caught up in trying to get the fucking remote that I forgot that I was hardly wearing any clothing. ",
        "Gavin said nothing as he ran a calloused hand up the back of my thighs. I could tell by the angle that he was touching me, he was standing, and that meant that my backside was perfectly in line with his crotch. Perfect, I thought to myself. I was supposed to be keeping things on an even keel, and already at 10 o'clock in the morning, I was failing. \n\nI opened my mouth to protest again when I felt his hand resisting my urge to stand upright, but the words died in my throat when I felt his hand travel higher up my thigh. I blinked trying to focus on my train of thought, and not the journey north his hand was making. I tried to focus on each word, each syllable as it would come out of my mouth, and not the way his rough fingers were coaxing a trail of goose bumps from my skin. I tired, but it wasn't really working. \n\nI said his name again, my tone almost pleading with him to let me up. I couldn't do this now, there were more pressing matters at hand. I smiled to myself at my choice of words. He paid me no attention, so I said his name again, hopefully this time with enough clear-headed emotion to convey that despite what my body was saying, I didn't really want to be in this position. His name rolled off my lips as a cross between a moan and a cry for help. I was doomed. \n\nI heard his chuckle as he slid his fingers closer to my sex. He traced small circles on my skin, teasing me with the closeness of his goal. I held my breath in anticipation. I clutched onto the remote so hard, the TV started flipping channels, but neither of us seemed to notice. \n\nHis fingers teased the crease between my thigh and my sex, I tried my damnest to hold back the moan that was threatening to escape, but I didn't have as much control over my body as I thought I did. His hand continued its path north, but not the north I wanted. I curved around the outside of my hip and up under the towel that wasn't doing me a damn bit of good by keeping me covered. His hand roamed to the swell of my ass as he gripped my bottom tightly. \n\nHe slid his hand over the swell and pulled my ass cheeks apart. I could feel the heat in my face as I realized the view that he must be giving himself. There was no doubt in my mind that he could see my rosebud now. I thought that realization would have embarrassed me, but instead it made me wetter. \n\nI could still feel the pressure of his hand on the small of my back still pressing my upper body down. He was having a good time back there, and he wanted to make sure I didn't ruin it. \n\nHe shifted the hand on my ass and slid his open palm down the crack of my ass sending a shiver through me. He was touching me like he wanted to memorize each and every part of my body, as if he were afraid he wouldn't get to touch it again. I wanted to say something, anything, but I didn't want to break the spell he was undoubtedly under. \n\nHis middle finger grazed my rosebud, and I felt a shock shoot thorough me. He circled his finger around it and involuntarily, I felt my body sift back into his hand. He didn't stay there long as his hand continued its journey to its prize. \n\nHis fingers spread my sex open as his middle finger eased along my slit. This time, I didn't try to contain the moan that escaped. His middle finger swirled in my wetness as he brought the moisture back to my clit whiel his other fingers continued to hold me open. I felt my leg quake as his ministrations with my clit began to cause a familiar tingling in my body. \n\nHe kept his finger pressed against my clit as he eased another finger into so slowly, I could feel each knuckle as it passed the entrance. I was dripping wet, and I couldn't wait for him to finish what he started. I gripped the remote, barely aware that I was painfully close to snapping the stupid thing in half. \n\nI could feel my wetness dripping in tiny rivulets down my leg when I felt his breath against the back of my legs. The hand pressing me in half was gone, but I had no intention of moving. I heard him as he kneeled behind me, and I felt his breathe as he moved his face closer; my pussy was clenching in anticipation. I knew what he was going to do, and I was expecting it, but when his wet lips replaced his finger on my clit, I almost exploded in his mouth. \n\nHis hands pushed my legs wider then closer to his face as I struggled to remain breathing. His tongue slipped into my sex as his fingers teased my clit. I was seeing stars. I dropped the remote as I tried to grip the back of the couch to prevent myself from toppling over. My fingers dug into the leather, and I was certain there would be nail marks left there when he was finished with me. \n\nHis tongue traced a very wet path from my sex to my ass as he reamed me out. The sensation was exhilarating, and though I would have thought it was disgusting, it felt amazing. I told him not to stop as he flicked his tongue in and out of my ass as he shoved two fingers deep into my leaking sex. \n\nI pushed my ass harder into his face determined to get his tongue deeper inside of me. Gavin moaned and nipped at my bottom with his teeth. I yelped at the sharp pain but couldn't get enough.\n\nHis fingers continued to seduce more wetness from my core as he lay loving kisses on my ass. He trailed his kisses further down my legs, then back up, landing on my pussy. He licked and kissed my juices from my skin, and attached his mouth to my leaking cunt as he tried to suck out more.\n\nMy toes were curled, and my fingers ached from gripping the couch so hard. I could feel my climax approaching, and it was going to be a big one. The pins and needles were working their way up my legs and I could feel the flush beginning to creep into my face and neck. \n\nHis tongue continued to probe deeper inside of me as I started to buck against him, my clit growing almost too sensitive to touch. He kept flicking it with his fingers as his tongue tried to touch every inch of my insides. I could feel my pussy start to spasm and grip his tongue. I was almost there, and it was gong to be heavenly. \n\nI almost cried when I felt him remove his fingers and mouth from my body. I was so close, I could taste my orgasm and he stopped. It was just like him to tease me and leave me high and dry...well wet.\n\nI was about to scream for him not to stop when I felt the head of his cock poised at my entrance. Just the feel of its angry head rubbing up and down my slit and the knowledge of what that thing could do to me was enough to send me over the edge. The muscles in my legs clenched, and I clamped my jaw shut in an effort to stifle the blood-curdling scream that was threatening escape when he slammed his entire length into me.\n\nMy pussy was tightening and contracting in bliss as he rammed himself into me. I herad him sigh behind me as he gripped my thighs tighter and pulled me closer to him. Slowly as if he wanted to feel each and every contraction of my pussy walls and they squeezed him tight, he pulled out of me then gently pushed himself back in. \n\nI folded myself over the back of the couch knowing that I wouldn't be able to stand much longer if he kept sliding into me the way he was. He was thrusting into me harder now, nearly lifting me off the floor with the strength of his thrusts. I could hear him grunting behind me as he pushed his length into me over and over again. \n\nI called out his name as he grumbled under his breath. One orgasm was about to fade into another and he picked up speed. He folded himself over the back of my body \u2013 his hard stomach pressed to my soft back as he continued to jackhammer his hips into mine. My vision was getting blurry, and my mouth hung open as I tried but failed to get enough air. \n\nHis face landed next to my ear as he flipped the hair on the other side of my neck and began to nip and bite at the sensitive skin there. I could feel his cock staring to swell inside me, and its increased girth was stretching more sweetly than it was before.\n\nKnowing that he was close the edge, He snaked a hand under me and began to rub my clit, instantly exploding my juices all over him. I couldn't move as I hung limply over the back of the couch and he jerked and thrusted a final few times before he erupted inside of me. \n\nThe feel of his hot ropy cum shooting inside of me caused me to moan in satisfaction. It could feel its heat swirling inside me, and as I hung over the couch.\n\nHe stayed inside of me for a minute, no doubt trying to regain use of his own legs, then he stood. As he slipped out of my overused pussy, I groaned. I had no idea how sore I was until that moment. \n\nHe stood behind me and pulled me up to meet him. He turned me around so he could look at my face, which was still flushed, and would continue to be because I could feel our combined juices starting to leak out of me.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said as he cupped my sex, keeping our juices inside of me.\n\n\"Good morning,\" I replied, and at that moment, it was perhaps the perfect morning of my life...until I realized that we just had sex - again. Without a condom \u2013 again.\n\nFuck!\n\nBut by the way he was trapping his cum inside of me; one would think that's exactly where he wanted it to be.\n\nHe leaned down and kissed my lips. \n\n\"I have to go to work,\" I said after a moment when our lips finally parted. My eyes searched for the clock, and I gave a very unlady like grunt as I realized I only had 27 minutes to get to work, and is still had to get home and change. \n\n\"You gotta take me home so I can change and get my car.\" Fuck! I still didn't have keys or a car, for that matter. \n\n\"I'll take you to work.\"\n\nI gripped at the towel that amazingly was still around me. I didn't want to give him any more reason for me being late to work.\n\nI started to rush to the bathroom when he caught me by the elbow and smiled his crooked grin. He shook his head no, and told me to go get dressed.\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n\nHe pushed me into his room and tossed me my bra. I was still confused.\n\nWhen I stood there dumbly, he said, \"I want you going to work with a sticky reminder of what you're gonna get when your shift ends.\" \n\nMy knees buckled at the seriousness of his tone. I felt my pussy flood with juices and I knew that I would definitely chance being late \u2013 or even not going to work, if I could see that look in his eye all the time. \n\n\"Whatever,\" I said off-handly as I forced myself to look for the rest of his clothes. If I let that look get to me now, I'd never get to work. I pulled on my bra, trying to do so over my towel as I felt his gaze on me. It didn't really work, so I gave up and wrapped it around my waist.\n\nI put my bra on and searched for my panties. \n\n\"Gavin, help me, I can't find my panties!\"\n\n\"I'm sure they will turn up somewhere, just get dressed.\"\n\nI flashed him an evil glare as I contemplated going without underwear at work for an entire day. I was going to ask him to help me again when I looked up and watched him pull on his jeans without putting anything on underneath. Quite possibly, the sexiest thing ever, is a man in nothing but a pair of jeans. The thought of our sexes only being separated by our jeans caused my pulse to quicken, but again, I forced myself to ignore it as I found my shirt and pulled it on. \n\nI bounced up and down on my toes as I waited for him to get dressed. \n\n\"Hurry up! I still have to go home and change.\"\n\n\"Relax. I'll drop you off at the hospital and you can into a new pair of scrubs there.\"\n\nI looked at my watch. He was right. If we left now, I'd have enough time to change in the hospital locker room without being late. \n\nWe left his bedroom and I slipped my boots back on, grabbed my helmet and jacket and stood by the door waiting for him. \n\nI watched as he stopped by the pool table. I was starting to get irritated. He really needed to hurry the fuck up.\n\n\"Red, you could always wear these...\" he said as he tossed me the Victoria's Secret bag. I shoved the bag in my pocket, stuck my tongue out at him and stamped my foot. His eyes darkened, but he laughed and grabbed his helmet and jacket.\n\n\"We aren't taking your car?\"\n\n\"You wanna get there fast don't you?\"\n\nI couldn't argue with that. \n\nWe zipped through the streets and made it to the hospital in only 9 minutes. That was a new personal best, and I knew the next time I was running late, I'd just call him. \n\nHe pulled up to the employee entrance and cut the engine. I jumped off and was about to make a mad dash for the entrance when he grabbed me.\n\n\"What, no goodbye?\"\n\n\"Bye Gavin.\" I turned to leave, but he kept his grip firm on my waist.\n\n\"What time do you get off?\"\n\nI kept the dirty retort for myself because I knew it would only lead to me being later than I already was, so I just told him eleven o'clock.\n\nHe lifted my helmet off my head and kissed my lips gently. I was taken aback, because for a minute there, we had slipped right back into our old routine. \n\n\"Bye Gavin,\" I said again as I tried to wriggle away from him. \n\n\"Don't call anyone, I will be here to pick you up when you get out.\" \n\n\"Ok,\" I said as I sprinted for the door. \n\nThe hospital would certainly bring back the normalcy, and here maybe I could even think through this situation. \n\nI rushed toward the doors without looking back."
