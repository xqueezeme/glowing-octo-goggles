        "Louise saw the look on Kevyn's face and stopped mid-sentence. She was almost afraid to ask what happened in the few short minutes that she and Nathan had been gone.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked.\n\n\"Barb is what happened!\" Kevyn snapped.\n\n\"Barb?\" Louise asked confused, \"She's not coming until Saturday.\"\n\n\"Yeah well, she just called, she's at the airport.\" \n\n\"What? What are we going to do?\" Louise asked.\n\n\"What do you mean what are we going to do? I've been dying to see this movie.\" Kevyn said. \"I'm not changing plans because she decided to show up early.\"\n\nKevyn took out her cell phone and dialed Barb's number.\n\n\"Barb, you're going to have to catch a cab to the hotel.... We were just leaving when you called and no we're not changing our plans to come get you, you weren't supposed to get here until Saturday... then walk! Do you have a piece of paper? I'm going to give you the address to the hotel; they'll be expecting you. Yes, yes... \"We'll call you tomorrow. Bye Barb.\" Kevyn said hanging up on Barb who was still talking.\n\nKevyn laughed, she couldn't help it.\n\n\"She is royally pissed that she has to spend money on a cab. Come on or we'll be late for the movie.\"\n\nIn spite of herself, Louise started to giggle as she imagined Barb's reaction to being told that she had to catch a cab. She covered her lips with the tips of her fingers like her mother used to do when she giggled as if she was embarrassed to be caught laughing. Nathan looked down at her, noticed the tiny dimples at the corner of her mouth, and wanted to touch them. His goal for the night was to see her smile without covering her mouth. He suspected that she had a smile and a fun loving side that that few if anyone had ever seen.\n\n\"Whose idea was it to come to a popular movie the second night of opening?\" Kevyn grumbled as they stood in line several minutes later.\n\n\"That would be you.\" Patrick teased as he pulled her back into him and kissed her neck.\n\n\"Why didn't you stop me?\" she teased back.\n\n\"Because I wanted to see it too.\" Patrick replied.\n\nLouise watched the easy manner in which Patrick and Kevyn interacted and wondered if she would ever be that relaxed around someone. She was aware of Nathan standing closely behind her but not touching. All he would have to do is take a tiny step forward and he would be as close to her as Patrick was to Kevyn. \n\nThe line moved quickly with Kevyn and Louise heading for the theater to get seats and Patrick and Nathan going to the concession stand. While they waited, Patrick talked with Nathan.\n\n\"How are things?\" He asked.\n\n\"Good, why do you ask?\" Nathan replied.\n\n\"Kevyn is having a hard time with not being able to talk with Louise about what's happening between you and Louise. I explained to her how things were and she understands but there's a lot of guilt about things that I won't go into without her permission and things that are really for Louise to tell you.\"\n\n\"What do you need from me?\" Nathan asked looking at Patrick.\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly... could you talk to Kevyn? I think that she wants to give you the if you hurt my sister I'm going to kick your ass speech. I also think it will fulfill the need that she has to protect her. Am I making sense?\"\n\n\"You're making sense and I understand.\" Nathan replied. \"I have a little knowledge of what happened back in Pittsburgh and I don't mind talking with her if it will help and I would like to know her a little better.\"\n\n\"Thank you Nathan, I appreciate it.\"\n\n\"I should be thanking you.\" Nathan said with a smile, \"You brought my mate to me although you didn't know who she was, so thank you.\"\n\n***\n\nLouise and Kevyn managed to find four seats that were far enough back that Nathan and Patrick's height wouldn't be too much of a problem but close enough so that Louise who was the shortest of them at 5'4 would be able to see the screen. They each took an outer seat to reserve the ones in the middle until the guys came and then they would rearrange themselves.\n\n\"Hey look, there's two seats there!\" someone called out. \n\nThe owner of the voice called down to Louise, \"Hey lady, can you move down two seats?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry but these seats are taken.\" Louise replied politely.\n\n\"Where are the people sitting there then? The movie's going to start in a few minutes.\" the man said.\n\nKevyn was on the phone with Barb who was still angry at having to take a cab to the hotel and didn't notice what was happening just three seats down from her.\n\nOne of the men, the one who hadn't spoken tried to climb over Louise to get to the seat next to her.\n\n\"Hey!\" Louise objected as she pushed at the man who was being followed by his friend. \"Stop it!\"\n\nHearing the commotion, Kevyn looked up in time to see Louise trying to keep two men from taking the seats reserved for Patrick and Nathan. She stood up and faced the bigger of the two men, \"These seats are saved.\"\n\nThe man seemed not to hear her and tried to push past her. The thing that amazed Kevyn was that the theater was full, there were people all around and no one was offering to help. Suddenly the man standing closest to Louise let out a howl of pain.\n\n\"Fuck! What did you do to me?\" he screamed at Louise who was as confused as he was because she hadn't touched him.\n\n\"I believe that the lady told you that these seats were taken.\" Nathan said stepping up to the man, \"You have two options, you can either find another seat or leave but if you insist on these seats....\"\n\n\"No... it's all good just a misunderstanding!\" one of the men said as he pushed his partner out of the way and rushed off.\n\nWhen they were gone, Nathan made Louise move so that he was sitting on the outside of her on her right; Kevyn sat to her left with Patrick on the outside of her.\n\n\"Sweetheart are you alright?\" Nathan asked Louise noticing that she was looking slightly green around the gills.\n\n\"I'm just really thirsty.\" she replied.\n\nNathan and Patrick looked at each other and back at Louise. Neither of them had done anything to the man who tried to take their seats, which meant it had been either Kevyn or Louise and all bets were on Louise.\n\n\"Here, drink this.\" Nathan said handing her the large plastic cup of cola. \n\nLouise took the large cup in both hands and gulped it down stopping only once for air. By the time she was finished with it, her color was much better and she felt better. When she realized that she drank the entire contents of the cup, she blushed.\n\n\"I'm so sorry....\"\n\n\"Don't be, I like a woman who can hold her soda.\" Nathan teased. \"I'll be right back with a refill.\" he said.\n\nAs he waited in line for a refill, he tried to figure out what had happened. He and Patrick had just gotten to the row of seats just as the man howled in pain. He had the feeling that life with Louise was not going to be dull in the least. He also suspected that she was much more than an empath. The question was what?\n\n***********\n\nBarb got off the plane and looked around. She had never been in such a large airport and was looking forward to the ride in the limo that Kevyn was going to send for her and wondered if it would have a stocked bar. As soon as she was able, she called Kevyn to let her know that she had arrived.\n\nShe smiled at Kevyn's shocked voice, \"You're where?\"\n\nThe smile didn't last for long, it was gone a few minutes later when Kevyn called her back and told her to take a cab to the hotel and that they weren't going to change their plans just because she decided to come earlier than planned. Her anger grew when she realized that baggage claim was at the far end of the airport and she was wearing high-heels because she wanted to look the part of a high society woman being picked up by a limo. It felt as if she had walked miles before she finally reached the baggage claim and her feet felt as if they were about to fall off.\n\nDuring her walk, she called Kevyn not once but twice asking if she could send a car for her to which Kevyn responded to by laughing at her.\n\n\"Car? What do you think this is? Take the cab and I'll call you sometime tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter the second phone call making the same request and getting the same answer, Barb gave up and made her way to baggage claim. An hour and a half later, she was standing in the lobby of a nice hotel but it wasn't anywhere near as lavish as the one in Pittsburgh. She walked up to the counter, put on her best flirty smile and announced her presence.\n\n\"Yes Ms. Simpson, Mr. Sinclaire told us that you would be arriving and asked me to give you this envelope.\"\n\nBarb looked at the envelope for a second before taking it from the clerk's hand.\n\n\"If you will sign here please.\" he said as he slid a form across the counter. \"My name is Hans and I will be personally attending to your needs during your stay. My extension is written on the corner of the card attached to your receipt.\"\n\n\"Do you live here?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"I only stay when Mr. Sinclaire has a guest that he feels might need some extra attention.\" Hans explained. \"If you're ready, I'll escort you to your room.\"\n\n\"Room? Don't you have suites?\"\n\n\"Yes we do but Mr. Sinclaire didn't authorize a suite. If you will follow me please.\"\n\nBarb grumbled but Hans appeared not to hear her and if he did, he didn't respond.\n\n\"Your room is on the third floor....\"\n\n\"The third floor? Don't you have anything higher up?\"\n\nHans ignored her and kept walking giving Barb no choice but to follow him. \n\n\"Here is your room Madame.\" Hans said as he stopped in front of the door of room 318 and unlocked it.\n\nHe carried her luggage in and gave her a quick tour of the room.\n\n\"The refrigerator is fully stocked and you may help yourself to whatever is there. When housekeeping comes they will restock if for you. Concerning any of the amenities of the hotel, you have unlimited use of the gym, pool and the laundry room.\"\n\n\"Laundry room? What about maid service?\"\n\n\"Mr. Sinclaire didn't authorize that but if you wish you may purchase it at a discounted rate since you are a guest of Mr. Sinclaire's.\"\n\n\"What about meals? Or didn't he authorize that either?\" Barb snapped.\n\n\"He has authorized a one hundred and fifty dollar a day food credit for you and you may use the spa once a week for the length of your stay and of course....\"\n\n\"I got it!\" Barb said irritably.\n\n\"Is there anything else that I can do for you?\" Hans asked barely containing his laughter.\n\n\"Is room service still available?\"\n\n\"Yes Madame, dial 6 and that will connect you to the kitchen. However I must warn you that we have a limited menu at night.\"\n\nAs soon as he was out of the room, Hans laughed. Patrick had been right about this one, she was a money hungry bitch.\n\nBarb looked around the room that was nice but nothing like the rooms that Patrick, Kevyn and Louise had stayed in back home. She looked at the menu for room service and ordered a BLT that the menu listed at $12.50 \n\n\"Damn!\" she swore as she realized that she was going to have to be careful with her food allowance unless she wanted to dig into her own pocket. Her plan to order Champaign flew out of the window when she saw that the cheapest bottle was 75.00 and it was already well past midnight. She called, ordered the sandwich and unpacked while she waited for her meal to arrive. When she was unpacked, she went to the bathroom expecting to see a lavish Jacuzzi tub with various oils and soaps lined along the side and was disappointed to see a plain bathtub that was much larger than normal but it had no jets. So far, this trip was not what she was expecting. In the end, she decided that it was only because she showed up unexpectedly that she was in this room. She relaxed fully expecting to be upgraded later in the day either to a suite or to another hotel. As much as she didn't like the food voucher limitation, she understood it. She would have done the same thing and it wouldn't have been as much.\n\nThe sandwich arrived a few minutes later. The man delivering it gave Barb a smile and asked her where she wanted the table set up.\n\n\"Anywhere!\" she snapped as she turned her back on the man.\n\nThe man glared at her back and muttered under his breath, \"bitch.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Barb asked as she turned around.\n\n\"Nothing, I said as you wish.\"\n\nThe man set up the table and left minus a tip that he wasn't going to be offered anyway, he would have to remember to tell his colleagues about her.\n\nAfter the man left, Barb took the lid off the plate and swore. The BLT looked like any other BLT that she had ever seen with its three slices of bacon. \"For 12.50 they could have at least doubled the bacon.\" she muttered as she sat down to eat. After the meal, she took a very unsatisfying soak in the tub wishing that it had the whirlpool jets in it. As she soaked, she thought about Kevyn and Louise who were soon going to be living in the lap of luxury if they weren't already.\n\nHer ire grew as she remembered Kevyn laughing at her when she asked for a car to be sent and then there was the fact that she had to pay for the cab. And finally she was in what she considered a second rate room forgetting that she usually stayed in a 'Motel 6' whenever she had to travel which wasn't very often.\n\nBy the time she was done with her bath, she had worked herself up into a jealous rage. She had half a mind to get dressed, call a cab and show up unannounced at Kevyn's apartment. The only things that stopped her were the facts that Kevyn and Louise probably weren't home and that she would have to pay for the cab.\n\nAs she applied lotion to her body, Barb examined herself. While she wasn't thin, neither was she fat. She was what she liked to call voluptuous and she considered herself the most attractive of all of the sisters.\n\n\"A lot of good that does me.\" she grumbled as she applied generic 'Nivea' to her arms. She put on her pajamas, grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and went to bed. Within minutes of lying down, she was sound asleep.\n\n*********\n\nNathan paid very little attention to the movie. His mind was on Louise and whatever it was she did to the man. She hadn't been touching him so it had to be cognitive. He also realized that she didn't know what had happened, if she did, she would be horrified to know that she had hurt someone. From his point of view he was glad that she could do whatever it was she did, it meant that she could protect herself.\n\nHe glanced over at Kevyn who was watching the movie with her head resting on Patrick's shoulder. He had known from the moment that she peeked into his mind that there was going to be an issue with her not being able to tell Louise what she knew. He understood and knew that he would feel the same way that she did if it were him but that didn't change the fact that it wasn't her place to talk to Louise what she needed to know, it was his. \n\nHe would do as Patrick requested and talk to her with the goal being making sure that Kevyn understood that he loved and would die for her sister. He felt for Kevyn. It had to have been difficult coming into the vampire world where many of the rules were different. He would try to find a time to talk to her and the sooner the better.\n\nAfter the movie, they went to a cell phone store where Patrick knew the owner who had been kind enough to open the store for them.\n\n\"Pick out any phone you like.\" Patrick told Kevyn. \n\nKevyn headed to the least expensive phones and began to look at them.\n\n\"A suggestion if I may.\" Patrick said from beside her, \"These are nice phones but why not get one that you can use for school? You'd be able to download drug handbooks and whatever else you needed.\"\n\n\"I don't even need a new phone.\" Kevyn replied. \"And a phone like you're talking about isn't cheap.\"\n\n\"No.\" Patrick conceded, \"But look at it like this, once you start school you're going to need all kinds of reference books. Why carry them around when you can carry them in your phone? I'm also willing to bet that you might be able to download some of your textbooks too.\"\n\nKevyn gave it some thought and realized that he made several valid points. She would still keep her prepaid number until she got her new number to family at home. The old phone she would give to a battered woman's shelter to use as they saw fit.\n\n\"Alright, I'm convinced but I'm buying it.\" she said and got ready for the objections to start.\n\nNathan and Louise were on the other side of the store having almost the same conversation.\n\n\"You can put your recipes on it and you can even download the recipes from the cooking shows that you watch.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Louise said, \"It's so expensive...\"\n\n\"When is your birthday?\" Nathan asked.\n\n\"October,\" Louise replied, \"why?\"\n\n\"Consider it an early birthday present.\" Nathan replied as he called the store associate over.\n\n\"No! You can't buy me that!\" Louise protested.\n\n\"Why not?\" Nathan asked, \"It's a gift.\"\n\n\"It's too expensive and you don't know me well enough to buy me something like this.\" Louise replied indicating the phone in question.\n\n\"I know all that I need to know.\" Nathan replied.\n\nLouise looked up at Nathan who met her direct gaze with one of his own.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" she asked.\n\nNathan smiled down at her, if he could get her out of her shell, she would be fun to fight with.\n\n\"Just what I said.\" he replied.\n\nLouise looked around the store and saw that Kevyn and Patrick were on the far side of the building. She turned back to Nathan who was still looking at her.\n\n\"You don't know anything about me.\" Louise protested.\n\n\"I beg to differ.\" Nathan replied, \"Let's make a bet.\" Nathan said not taking his eyes from her face. \"If I can list five things that I know about you I get to buy you the phone.\"\n\nLouise hesitated and then agreed not believing that he could do it.\n\n\"And if you can't?\" she asked.\n\n\"If I can't then you can buy the phone that you want.\"\n\n\"I agree.\" Louise said holding her hand out for a shake.\n\nNathan took her hand in his and held it as she began to list the things that he knew.\n\n\"I know that you are very sensitive and that you feel things deeply. I also know that you've felt alone and that no one with the exception of Kevyn and now Patrick and me realized how special you are. I know that you are not boring even though you think you are. I know that while shy and unassuming, you're a very beautiful and strong woman and that if pushed hard enough, you'll push back. Last of all, you want to know what I want with you. How did I do?\" Nathan asked.\n\n\"How did you know all of that?\" Louise asked.\n\n\"Intuition and it's clear that no one has told you enough just how remarkable you really are. So do I get to buy you that phone?\" Nathan asked.\n\n\"Nathan...\"\n\n\"A deal is a deal and we shook on it.\" Nathan reminded her as he gave her hand a gentle squeeze.\n\nAn hour later, Louse and Kevyn had new phones. Nathan had Louise's phone and was programming all of his phone numbers into it.\n\n\"You can call me at anytime day or night for anything and I will always answer.\" Nathan said as he handed the phone back to Louise. \"Later we can play with it to see how it works.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Louise said as she took the phone back. She would have never bought herself a phone like the one Nathan had just bought for her even if she could have afforded it. She looked at Kevyn and Patrick and again wondered if something like what they had was possible for her. She felt eyes on her and turned to see Nathan looking at her with a look in his eyes that she couldn't quite interpret. Blushing, she quickly looked away as she began to tingle and throb.\n\nNathan reached over, took her hand in his, gave it a reassuring squeeze, and was gratified when she squeezed back. That she had unconsciously returned the gesture was even better as far as Nathan was concerned, it confirmed that she was feeling the pull. He didn't turn away when she looked at him because he wanted her to see what he was feeling for her. He had the feeling that had he said it she would have taken off, it was far better to show her and have her get acclimated to him by showing her.",
        "\"I don't know about you but I'm starved.\" Patrick said. \"Louise, why don't we see what we can cook up?\" he asked when they got back to the house.\n\nNathan knew what Patrick was doing and nodded at him.\n\n\"I could eat something.\" he said.\n\nKevyn also knew what Patrick was doing and could have kissed him and after second thought, she did. She walked over to him, pulled him down to her, kissed him and then murmured her thanks. She waited until Nathan finished talking to Louise before she sat down. She watched how Nathan was with her and Louise's reaction to him; she was falling for him and didn't realize it or didn't want to.\n\nWhen she was out of earshot, Nathan sat down across from Kevyn and waited.\n\nKevyn smiled at him and began her speech.\n\n\"First of all, I want to apologize to you for peeking into your head a few days ago. You were right, it was rude and I knew better. In my defense, I was worried about Louise and I wanted to know what your thoughts regarding her were.\"\n\n\"You could have asked.\" Nathan said quietly.\n\n\"True.\" Kevyn agreed, \"But that would have been too easy.\"\n\nNathan, to her surprise smiled.\n\n\"Apology accepted and I in turn owe you an apology. I overreacted in my response to your peeking. Call it the new mate syndrome if you want but still I apologize.\"\n\nKevyn found herself liking her brother-in -law more and more by the minute.\n\n\"I assume Patrick told you how hard it is for me not to say anything to Louise?\"\n\n\"He did and I understand.\" Nathan said. \"I would feel the same way but Kevyn; you have to understand that this is a different world than where you came from. It's far from perfect but then neither is the world that you came from. In your world, you may have been able to talk to Louise about this without it causing any damage but if you tell her before I do, it could hurt her.\"\n\n\"Patrick explained it to me and I understand but still....\"\n\n\"You feel the need to protect her.\" Nathan finished for her.\n\nKevyn gave him a small smile before continuing.\n\n\"It's not that I don't trust you. That was never the issue. It's just that I didn't protect her as much as I should have and now I have the chance to do that and I want to even though she doesn't need it.\"\n\nNathan considered his next words carefully.\n\n\"Kevyn, has it ever occurred to you that maybe Louise didn't need protecting or maybe not as much as you think she did? Let's think about this, how long was she back in Pennsylvania alone with your family before she came here?\"\n\n\"A few years but I don't see what you're getting at.\" Kevyn replied.\n\n\"In order for her to have survived your family, she had to have been strong. She is shy and she is very unsure of herself but there is strength in her that on occasion shows itself usually when she doesn't think about it.\" Nathan said.\n\nKevyn thought about what Nathan said and realized that he was right and wondered why she didn't see it.\n\n\"You were and are too close to the situation.\" Nathan said answering her unspoken question.\n\n\"Can I ask a question?\" \n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Can't I say anything to her? We've never had that time where sisters talk about boyfriends and things like that.\"\n\nNathan blew out a breath before he replied.\n\n\"Alright, will it help if I tell you what I'm planning?\" Nathan asked.\n\nKevyn listened as Nathan spelled out his plan for telling Louise about the family and then him.\n\n\"I want her to know about our family before I tell her about us.\"\n\nAfter listening to Nathan, Kevyn realized that in some ways he knew Louise better than she did. She would never have thought to tell Louise things while preparing a meal, the one thing that she was most at ease with. She could now see how she could have ruined things or at least made them more difficult had she told Louise herself.\n\n\"It's fine for you to talk about men, me and things like that but please don't tell her any of the things that need to come from me.\" Nathan said.\n\n\"What do I say if she asks?\" \n\n\"Tell her the truth.\" Nathan replied, \"Refer her to me and tell her that she can ask me anything. I plan to tell her the same thing tonight.\"\n\n\"Alright and thanks for talking with me but I have something that I want to say to you.\"\n\nShe waited for him to indicate that he was listening, when she saw that he was, she continued.\n\n\"I know that you care for Louise and I know that you wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt her but I'm warning you that if you hurt her even unintentionally, vampire or not, your ass is mine.\"\n\nNathan gave her a solemn nod and then he spoke.\n\n\"I more than care for your sister, I love her and I would do anything and I do mean anything to ensure her safety and her happiness just as my uncle would do anything for you. If I fail in any way then you have my blessing to kick my ass and I will do nothing to stop you.\" Nathan replied.\n\n\"Just so you understand.\" Kevyn said, \"Louise is an innocent but she is far from stupid and more intuitive than you know.\"\n\n\"I know and that's what I'm counting on.\" Nathan replied with a smile.\n\n\"Come and get it!\" Patrick called from the kitchen ending their conversation but they had a good understanding and respect for each other.\n\n\"Snack\" consisted of a breakfast casserole that had a crust made of biscuits that was topped with bacon, onions, mushrooms, and peppers and then topped with cheese with whipped eggs poured over the top. Kevyn and Louise each ate a small piece and watched as Patrick and Nathan demolished the casserole and looked for more.\n\n\"You can't be serious!\" Louise said as she watched the men split the last piece of the casserole. \"How do you not get fat?\"\n\n\"Genetics.\" Nephew and Uncle said in unison.\n\nLouise looked from one to the other and didn't believe them.\n\nBefore he left, Nathan pulled Louise aside.\n\n\"I want you to know that you can ask me anything and I won't lie to you but be prepared to hear the truth when you ask.\n\nLouise started to ask a question and changed her mind. Instead, she thanked him for the movie.\n\n\"You're welcome and I'll call you later.\" Nathan said as she kissed her on the cheek.\n\n*********\n\nBarb woke up early, took a shower and ordered breakfast. She was more than a little disgruntled that she hadn't heard from Kevyn or Louise. She decided that if she hadn't heard from them by the time breakfast was over, she would call them and demand that they get their asses to the hotel pronto. They had some explaining to do.\n\nBarb picked at her breakfast when it was delivered, her anger ruining her appetite. Instead of finishing her breakfast, she called Kevyn's cell phone number. Her anger grew when it went to voice mail and she called Louise's number and got the same result. \n\nBarb stared at the phone in disbelief. Of the two of them Louise was the one who always answered her phone and usually by the second ring.\n\n\"Where in the hell are they?\" Barb muttered. Kevyn she could understand, she was probably still in bed with that gorgeous rich man of hers but Louise? Where would she be this early and why wasn't she answering her phone? The thought that anyone could be interested in Louise never crossed Barb's mind. To her, Louise was a little mouse whose place in the world was... she didn't really have a place. She didn't see Louise as a wife or a mother; she was just Louise.\n\nA tap at the door made Barb jump.\n\n\"Who is it?\" she called through the door as she looked through the peephole.\n\n\"Ollie ma'am, Hans asked me to stop by and see if you needed anything.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, where's Hans? I want to go out.\"\n\n\"I am at your disposal for the day ma'am.\" Ollie called back. He didn't want anything to so with the woman who already had the reputation of being a bitch and she hadn't been at the hotel for twenty-four hours.\n\n\"I'll be ready in an hour.\" Barb snapped.\n\n\"Finally...\" she muttered as she dressed for her shopping trip under the impression that she would be allowed to spend some of Patrick and Kevyn's money. She carefully applied her makeup, took out her best outfit for a day of shopping, and got dressed. Exactly one hour later, Ollie was at the door.\n\nHe led her to the front of the hotel and told her to wait out front while he got the car. A few minutes later, a blue 2009 Hyundai pulled up. At first, Barb dismissed the car thinking that it was for someone else, her mouth dropped open when Ollie got out of the car, ran to the passenger side and opened the door for her.\n\nBarb stared at the car in disbelief. The thought that maybe Patrick wasn't anywhere near as rich as she thought he was crossed her mind but then she remembered the rental car that he drove and that he had picked up all of the expenses for the funeral. \n\n\"What are you up to Kevyn Morris?\" Barb whispered.\n\n\"Ma'am?\" Ollie called.\n\n\"Coming!\" Barb snapped.\n\nOllie helped her into the car not really wanting to touch her but he reminded himself that he was being well paid to keep the woman safe and to take her wherever she wanted to go including lunch, which had a thirty-dollar price limit. From what he could see, the woman didn't even deserve a meal at a fast food restaurant but that wasn't for him to say.\n\n\"Where would you like to go?\" Ollie asked when he was in the car.\n\n\"Where all of the expensive shops are.\" Barb replied wishing that she knew where Kevyn shopped now that she had money.\n\n\"As you wish.\" Ollie said and headed to downtown LA.\n\nBarb went into the first shop she saw, browsed for almost an hour before she picked a brightly colored red scarf. As she browsed, she made sure to mention the Sinclaire name to the clerk several times. She took the scarf to the counter, set it down and waited for the clerk to ring up her purchase.\n\n\"That will be eighty dollars ma'am, will you be paying with cash or credit?\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear who I was related to?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"Yes ma'am, several times.\" the clerk replied.\n\n\"Then please but this on his account.\" Barb said, \"He won't mind.\"\n\n\"First of all, Mr. Sinclaire doesn't have an account with us.\" The woman said stiffly, \"second of all, even if he did, we would need approval from him before we would apply anything to his account, so will this be cash or charge?\"\n\nInstead of answering, Barb turned around and walked out. When she was outside, her cell phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and saw that it was Kevyn.\n\n\"Kevyn? What in the hell is going on?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"The second rate hotel, having to catch a cab from the airport, the car...\"\n\n\"What's the problem?\" Kevyn asked, \"You're the one who showed up early and if you will recall, I told you to stay home but you showed up anyway instead of waiting for an invitation. If you don't like your accommodations, you do have options. You could pay for an upgrade or you can go back home, the choice is yours and before you give me that crap about a rich white man, can it. I don't want to hear it. I only called to say that we'll see you tonight for dinner.\"\n\nBarb was speechless. She really thought that she would be wined and dined and that she could wheedle her way into staying with Kevyn and her man thus meeting the other men of the family. She bit back a retort and changed the subject to dinner.\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Seven.\" Kevyn replied, \"And don't dress up.\"\n\nBarb's hopes were dashed again. She was planning to wear the clingy little black dress that she wore only when she was hoping to meet someone.\n\n\"Fine are you coming to get me or do I need to catch a cab?\" Barb asked sarcastically.\n\n\"Patrick and I will be there at seven.\" Kevyn replied her voice filled with amusement that wasn't missed by Barb.\n\n\"Fine.\" she said and hung up. Not one to give up, she asked Ollie to take her to store where Patrick held an account. He didn't argue with her as he helped her into the car. \n\nThe bitch was in for another rude awakening.\n\nOllie pulled up to the valet parking area of ' Bloomington's', got out, handed the keys to the valet and helped Barb out of the car. She looked at the store, nodded at Ollie and went in prepared to spend Patrick's money. She shopped until she found a blouse that she liked that retailed for one hundred dollars. She then found the purse that she had seen on the website and had wanted since she first saw it. It retailed for more than the blouse did by fifty dollars. She went up to the counter and gave the clerk a polite smile.\n\n\"Hello! My name is Barbara Simpson and Patrick Sinclaire is my brother-in -law.\"\n\nThe woman didn't reply but waited for Barb to hand her the items that she wanted to purchase.\n\n\"I understand that he has an account here and I would like these things put on his account.\" Barb said as she handed the items to the clerk.\n\n\"I see, what did you say your name was?\" \n\n\"Barbara Simpson but it may be under Barbara Yancy Simpson.\"\n\nThe woman logged on to the computer, pulled up Patrick's name and read through the list.\n\n\"I'm sorry ma'am but your name isn't on this list.\"\n\n\"What? Let me see!\" Barb demanded as she tried to turn the computer screen toward her.\n\nThe clerk grabbed the screen and held on to it.\n\n\"I'm sorry but you can't see the list, it's confidential.\"\n\n\"Then look again!\"\n\nThe clerk looked repeatedly told Barb that she wasn't on the list.\n\n\"You're not on the list so how would you like to pay for these?\"\n\nBarb's face burned with fury as she demanded to speak with a manager. When the manager came out, he asked Barb what the problem was.\n\n\"I am a sister-in-law to Patrick Sinclaire! You do know who he is don't you?\" she snapped.\n\n\"Of course, but what's the problem?\"\n\nBarb explained what the problem was as she saw it.\n\n\"I want you to call him right now!\" she demanded knowing that she was being unreasonable but not caring. This was another classic case where something that she wanted was being denied her because she didn't have money. \n\nThe manager gave Barb a polite smile and looked at the computer monitor looking for her name.\n\n\"I'm sorry Ms. Simpson but your name isn't on the list and I will not call Mr. Sinclaire. He is well known to us and he always calls us in advance if he wishes to put someone on his accounts.\"\n\n\"He might have forgotten! I just got here last night and...\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" the manager interrupted, \"even if you had arrived this morning or if you had just gotten off of the plane, Mr. Sinclaire would have called me on my private number. Now, here are your options, you can purchase the desired items or you can leave them and speak with Mr. Sinclaire when you see him. Is there anything else that we can help you with?\"\n\nBarb walked away angry and humiliated, vaguely aware that she had brought the humiliation on herself. As she walked out of the store, she wondered if the manager would call Patrick and tell him what happened. She turned back and went into the store. The manager was still at the counter talking with the clerk.\n\n\"That was interesting.\" he was saying to the clerk.\n\n\"Yes, it was... do you think that she really is related to the Sinclaires?\"\n\n\"She could be but her name wasn't on that list.\" the manager replied.\n\nBarb's face burned with embarrassment but she needed to do some damage control. She cleared her throat alerting them to her presence.\n\n\"Yes? Did you decide to purchase the items?\" the manager asked.\n\n\"Ummm, yes.\" Barb said although that hadn't been her intent. \"And I wanted to apologize for my behavior.\"\n\n\"It's forgotten.\" the manager said as he retrieved the items from below the counter and began to ring them up.\n\n\"Look,\" Barb said, \"could you do me a favor and not tell Mr. Sinclaire?\"\n\n\"You have my word that this shall remain between us.\" he assured her. \"That will be two-hundred and seventy dollars. Will that be cash or charge?\"\n\nBarb took her credit card out of her wallet and gave it to manager wincing as he ran it through. Fortunately, it was paid off and had several thousand dollars left on it. The thought that she shouldn't have quit her job occurred to her especially given the way things were going but she convinced herself that things would get better once Kevyn got over being pissed that she showed up unannounced.\n\nOllie was waiting for her by the car when she came out but didn't speak to her, he didn't like this woman who thought that the world owed her.\n\n\"Take me back to the hotel.\" Barb said without looking at him.\n\n\"Bitch.\" Ollie muttered as he walked to the driver's side of the car.\n\n********\n\nKevyn hung up and laughed at Barb's reaction to hearing her options. She knew when she said it that Barb wouldn't go home but she wanted to remind her that going home was an option. Her thoughts turned to a more serious subject, Louise. The talk with Nathan had helped tremendously so that wasn't her concern; it was Louise's reaction when Barb made a play for Nathan that concerned her. Even though she couldn't directly address the subject of her and Nathan, she could address the issue of Barb and Nathan.\n\nShe knew exactly where Louise was. The scent of freshly baked bread filled the entire lower floor of the house making Kevyn's stomach growl. She made her way to the kitchen stopping just outside of it. She could hear Louise talking to someone- presumably Nathan in soft tones. Kevyn smiled when she heard Louise laugh, it was something that she knew Louise did little of but as the days passed, she smiled more easily and became more comfortable with herself. When she heard Louise say goodbye, Kevyn knocked on the door of the kitchen.\n\n\"Smells good!\" she said.\n\n\"Want a piece?\" Louise offered remembering that one of Kevyn's weaknesses was bread hot from the oven and smothered with butter.\n\n\"Do you have to ask?\" Kevyn replied as she walked to a cabinet and took down a plate.\n\n\"Nope.\" Louise asked, \"The butter's over there.\" she said as she continued to knead the bread dough for the next batch of bread.\n\nKevyn cut off a large chunk of the bread and smothered it with butter. She moaned in pleasure as the hot bread saturated with herb-seasoned butter touched her tongue.\n\n\"Oh my god Lou.\" she gushed as she took another bite and slowly chewed it. \"Why are you making so much? Not that I'm complaining.\"\n\nLouise laughed before replying, \"Three reasons, you, Patrick and Nathan. I also thought that I would take a loaf or two to Barb tonight.\" she added.\n\n\"That's nice of you, she'll like that.\" Kevyn replied and took the opening into what she wanted to talk about. \"Lou, I just want to warn you about tonight. Barb is going to make a play for Nathan you know that don't you?\"\n\nLou stopped kneading the bread and looked at Kevyn.\n\n\"I know.\" she said softly and then continued kneading the dough.\n\n\"How do you feel about that?\" Kevyn asked.\n\nLouise didn't answer for several minutes. It was as if she was debating with herself as to how much she should say.\n\n\"I shouldn't care but I do.\" she said. Her voice was filled with a combination of embarrassment and confusion.\n\n\"Why do you think that you shouldn't care?\" Kevyn asked realizing that this was how she could help and not tell Louise anything about what Nathan and his family were.\n\n\"What good does caring do me?\" Louise asked as she put the dough into bread pans so that that could rise.\n\n\"Lou, do you think that Nathan is just being nice to you?\"\n\n\"Yes and that's why I shouldn't care... he's out of my league.\"\n\n\"Oh I see.\" Kevyn said, \"and you think that Barb is better suited for him is that it?\"\n\n\"No, I mean... Kev, what does he want with me?\" Louise asked. \n\n\"I can't answer that but what I can tell you is this, trust your instincts and I'm going to tell you something else.\" Kevyn said. \"People will do to you only what you allow them. I know that when you were at home that the path of least resistance was to be quiet and to go along with the program but Lou, you aren't at home and it's time that you stood up for yourself and that means even to me, Patrick, Nathan and anyone else who tries too push you around.\"",
        "\"You say that now but what happens if you get mad?\" Louise asked as she took three loaves of bread out of the oven.\n\n\"So what if I get mad?\" Kevyn replied, \"I'll get over it but you will always be my little sister and my best friend.\"\n\n\"Best friend?\" Louise asked surprised.\n\n\"Best friend.\" Kevyn repeated. \"You and I have been through a lot together and you have no idea about how often I wished that I had found a way to bring you and mom out here. The times that we talked on the phone were the highlights of my week. What I'm trying to say is that I love you and I'm glad that you're here and by the way, Patrick loves you too so don't ever feel like you're alone, we're here for you.\"\n\nThe sisters looked at each other for several seconds and began to cry. Kevyn made the first move and hugged Louise so tightly that she yelped in protest even though she hugged her back\n\n\"I love you too.\" Louise said as she pulled away. \"How about you help me finish this bread?\"\n\n********\n\nBarb took a hot bath and carefully oiled her skin taking care to hit her elbows, knees and feet. She had gotten over her embarrassment over the incident at the store soon after the manager had assured her that he wouldn't call Patrick. At the last moment, she remembered that Ollie had been with her and swore him to secrecy as well.\n\nAfter brushing her teeth, she carefully applied her makeup, fixed her hair and debated as to what she should wear. She eyed the black dress although Kevyn told her not to dress up. Her gaze went to the blood red blouse that she had bought that day and thought that it would look nice with the pair of grey dress slacks that she bought with her. She reached for the blouse but looked at the dress.\n\nShe knew that there wasn't a chance in hell that Patrick would give her a second look but maybe someone else would. She took the dress from the hangar, looked at it, hung it back up and took the blouse down instead. She gave the dress one more look and closed the closet door.\n\nBy six-forty-five, she was ready.\n\n*********\n\nLouise was dressed casually as was Kevyn and Patrick. Nathan was supposed to pick her up and take her to the restaurant himself but he had been held up at a job site.\n\n\"Go with Kevyn and Patrick and I'll meet you there.\"\n\n\"Okay but if you're too busy...\"\n\n\"I'm never too busy for you.\" Nathan said. \"When you get there could you order an iced tea for extra lemon for me?\"\n\n\"Ok... sure, anything else?\"\n\n\"Since you're asking, a double order of hot wings the extra hot ones and whatever else you think that we'll like. I'll be there before they arrive.\" Nathan replied. \n\nHe heard the relief in Louise's voice when he asked her to place the orders. It had been his intent that she know that he was coming. He hung up and looked at the site where he was building their house and looked at the vampire in charge, his eyes filled with anger.\n\n\"Who did you buy this shit from?\" he demanded as he looked at the supplies for the foundation of the house.\n\nThe vampire took a step back. In all of the time that he had known Nathan, he had never heard him use profanity indicating just how angry he was.\n\n\"A new business that just opened up.\" The vampire replied. \"I know how much your family likes to support new businesses.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" Nathan said his anger cooling a little, \"but businesses that are honest and that sell quality material.\" he added. \"Take this back, get my money back and go to our usual suppliers. When you see the vampire that sold you this... shit... Tell him to expect a visit from me.\"\n\nNathan left the site, went home to get ready for dinner with Patrick, Kevyn, Louise and the infamous Barb Simpson. He had also come to a decision; tonight he was going to kiss Louise and begin to tell her about his family. It was important to him that he told her that first. That way it would be over and then they could move on. He showered and dressed casually in an outfit not much different from the one he wore when he took Louise to the beach. He brushed his hair and then decided to pull it back clipping it with a dark blue clip that matched the blue of his eyes and shirt.\n\nSeveral minutes later, he was on his way to the restaurant.\n\n*********\n\nBarb was waiting in the hotel lobby when Kevyn and Patrick got there. When the car pulled up, she was disappointed to see that although it was a nice car, it didn't come with a driver. She watched as Patrick got out of the car, walked over to the passenger side, opened the door and held out a hand to Kevyn. Jealousy flared as she saw Kevyn take his hand, get out of the car and Patrick kissed her on the temple as if she was the most precious thing in the world. The jealousy grew as she watched him open the back door for Louise, offer his hand to help her out and then kiss her on the cheek. It was obvious that not only did he love Kevyn, but also that he loved Louise as a brother loved a sister.\n\nBarb took a deep breath and met them at the door of the hotel lobby. She gave Louise a half-hearted hug, peck on the cheek, and repeated the act with Kevyn.\n\n\"Patrick, you remember my sister Barb.\" Kevyn said with a smile, \"and Barb I'm sure that you remember Patrick.\"\n\nPatrick assessed Barb with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. He didn't like her any more now then he did when he first met her in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Welcome to California, I'm assuming that you accommodations are suitable?\"\n\nBarb started to contradict him but there was something in his voice that gave her pause.\n\n\"Yes, they're fine. Thank you.\" she replied not understanding why she was suddenly so nervous around him.\n\n\"Good, shall we go?\" Patrick asked taking Kevyn's hand and leading her to the door.\n\n\"Wait.\" Kevyn said. \"Barb, I told you not to dress up, do you want to change?\"\n\n\"No, this is fine.\" Barb snapped and then swallowed when she saw Patrick staring at her.\n\nKevyn shrugged and followed Patrick out to the car. As they walked to the car, Barb stole a glance at Louise. She looked the same but she was somehow different. She seemed more confident in herself. Barb felt it in the hug that Louise had given her and wondered what the cause of the subtle change was.\n\n\"I made some bread today and I brought you a loaf to snack on in your room.\" Louise said when they were in the car.\n\nFor some reason that simple gesture touched Barb and she gave Louise a heart felt thank you.\n\n\"I've always loved your breads, is the kind with cheese in it?\"\n\n\"No no this time, its cinnamon raisin.\" Louise replied. \"It's in the trunk of the car so let's not forget to get it when we drop you off later tonight.\"\n\n\"So where are we going?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"To a seafood place by the ocean, Patrick swears it has the best clam chowder anywhere.\" Kevyn replied.\n\n\"Oh...\" Barb commented and looked out of the window wondering why they were so darkly tinted.\n\n\"Alright Lou, \"Patrick was saying, \"Let's go over the guidelines for our bet. Whoever accurately guesses the ingredients in the clam chowder with the most accuracy get the meal of their choice prepared for everyone by the loser.\"\n\n\"Get ready to cook.\" Louise teased back prompting Barb to look at her.\n\nThis was a Louise that Barb had never seen before and she wasn't sure of how she felt about it. The increased confidence and the easy way she teased Patrick unsettled her and made her feel like she was on the outside looking in. A memory from long ago rose in her mind, before it could take root, Barb pushed it away. If she allowed the memory to come, it would ruin the rest of the evening more than it was ruined and other memories would surface.\n\n\"We're here.\" Patrick said an hour later.\n\nLike before, he helped Kevyn out, kissed her temple and then helped Louise out kissing her cheek when she was out of the car. Barb's heart pounded with anticipation of being kissed even if it was on the cheek. Patrick came to her side of the car, opened the door and held out his hand. Barb took it and held it a little longer than necessary in anticipation of the kiss on the cheek.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Patrick asked pulling his hand away from hers.\n\n\"Fine.\" Barb said tersely and walked away without waiting for the others. She didn't stop until she was at the door of the restaurant and even then, she didn't turn around to face them.\n\nPatrick reached for the handle and opened the door, \"after you.\" he said politely. Louise followed and then Kevyn with Patrick bringing up the rear.\n\n\"Patrick Sinclaire! A voice boomed out, \"Why didn't you tell me that you were coming and bringing such lovely ladies with you?\"\n\n\"I thought that I would surprise you.\" Patrick replied hugging the man. \"Allow me to make some introductions. This beautiful woman,\" he said pulling Kevyn close to him and kissing her temple, \"is my wife of a few weeks Kevyn. The beautiful young woman next to her is her sister Louise who just moved from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and might I add that she's one hell of a cook. Standing next to her is Barb Simpson; she is a sister to Kevyn and Louise visiting from Pittsburgh. Ladies, this is Jonesy the maker and creator of the best clam chowder in the world.\"\n\n\"Welcome!\" Jonesy boomed but his eyes were on Barb who ignored him. \"I have on of the back rooms open unless you need more space.\"\n\n\"That's perfect,\" Patrick said as he slapped the man on the back. \"Its good to see you again.\"\n\n\"You too my friend. I have a couple of new creations that I want you to try out.\" Jonesy replied as he began to lead them to a room in the back.\n\nWhen they were seated, he took their drink and appetizer orders.\n\n\"Nathan wants a double order of the extra hot hot wings and an iced tea with lemon.\" Louise said softly. She was very self-conscious but became even more so when she felt Barb's eyes on her.\n\n\"That's all he wants?\" Patrick asked surprised.\n\n\"He told me to order anything else that he thought that we might like.\" she replied.\n\n\"Then go for it.\" Patrick encouraged.\n\n\"Ummm... potato skins and the blooming onion. And I'll have an iced tea with lemon too.\"\n\nPatrick ordered two of the sampler appetizer plates, a beer for him and a strawberry daiquiri for Kevyn.\n\n\"Light on the alcohol and a couple of pitchers of water with lemon in them. Barb, what would you like to drink?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"Long island iced tea please.\" Barb replied.\n\n\"Your drinks will be here in a few minutes.\" Jonesy said his eyes glued to Barb's face and then leaving it when she refused to look at him.\n\nAfter they were alone, Barb started asking Louise questions.\n\n\"Who is Nathan and why am I just hearing his name?\"\n\nKevyn started to answer but Patrick squeezed her hand and spoke to her telepathically.\n\n\"It's time for her to start standing on her own. If it gets to be too much for her then we'll step in until Nathan gets here.\"\n\nKevyn gave his hand a squeeze back but was ready to jump in if she had too.\n\n*******\n\nLouise found herself unprepared for the question even though she should have known better. She heard the curious but slightly jealous tone in Barb's voice when she asked the question and felt the emotions behind it. She was surprised to feel her own jealousy rise when she understood why Barb was asking the question.\n\n\"Nathan is Patrick's nephew.\" Louise replied. \"He's been nice enough to show me around a little.\"\n\n\"Does he do private tours of the area?\" Barb asked.\n\n\"I....\"\n\n\"Hello everyone!\" Nathan said as he walked in. \n\nBarb had to remind herself not to let her jaw drop as she looked up at Nathan. Her jaw did drop as she watched Nathan sit next to Louise, put an arm around her and pull her close to him.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I'm late sweetheart.\" he said as he kissed her temple.\n\n\"It's ok.\" Louise said, \"The drinks aren't here yet.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Nathan replied as he looked at Barb as if seeing her for the first time. \"You must be Barb, I'm Nathan Sinclaire.\"\n\nBarb was speechless, just how in the hell did someone like Louise hook up with someone who looked like and was obviously rich as Nathan Sinclaire? \n\n\"It's nice to meet you; I was just asking Louise why I haven't heard your name before now.\" Barb asked recovering from her shock.\n\nLouise felt Barb's intentions but didn't know what to do about it; after all, she had no claims on him. She watched helplessly as Barb began to flirt with Nathan in spite of what she had just seen. A thought began to form in the back of Louise's mind but she pushed it away. It wouldn't come back until dinner was almost over.\n\nAll through dinner, Barb kept stealing glances at Nathan. It was obvious to her that Louise had feelings for him even if she hadn't admitted to it and that made him fair game. She became frustrated when he dodged the questions about his personal life only telling her that he was an architect among other things.\n\n\"You must be very smart... I was never good at math or art.\" Barb cooed now completely oblivious to the fact that Kevyn and Patrick were glaring at her and that Louise was miserable. \"Are you busy tomorrow? I would love a tour of the area.\"\n\nKevyn watched the scene becoming angrier by the minute at the blatant flirtation and attempt by Barb to steal Nathan away from Louise. Once again, she almost said something and once again Patrick stopped her with a squeeze of his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I can't take you on the tour but I'm sure that we could find someone who does that sort of thing.\" Nathan replied smoothly. He was keenly aware that Louise was upset and what made it worse was that she didn't understand why.\n\n\"Oh... maybe another time then?\" Barb asked her voice filled with just a hint of a promise of things to come if he would agree to take her on the tour.\n\n\"For crying out loud!\" Louise finally snapped. \"What part of he's busy do you need to have explained to you? He said that he couldn't take you on a tour!\"\n\nAs soon as she said it, she retreated into herself; she left the table and went in search of the bathroom. Once there she washed her face with cold water grateful that she didn't wear makeup. \n\n\"Lou?\" Kevyn called as she walked into the bathroom. \"Are you ok?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with me?\" Louise asked, \"Why did I snap at her like that?\"\n\nIt dawned on Kevyn that as good as Louise was at dealing with the feelings of others, she wasn't good at dealing with her own. She hugged her and did the only thing that she could do, she offered comfort and positive reinforcement.\n\n\"Lou, you just said what all of us was thinking and to be honest, I'm glad that it was you who spoke up.\"\n\n\"But I was so rude...\"\n\n\"No, Barb was and she deserved to be put in her place.\"\n\nThey stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes longer and went back to the table to see that Barb had moved so that she was sitting in Lou's chair and that Nathan wasn't in the least bit pleased by it.\n\n\"Please go back to your own seat, Louise will be returning shortly.\" He said as they walked up.\n\n\"She can sit over there, she won't mind, it's not as if you two are involved.\" Barb replied ignoring the angry stares that were coming from Patrick and Nathan.\n\nBefore Louise knew what she was doing, she walked up to the table, looked at Barb and spoke in a firm voice that she thought only she could hear.\n\n\"Get away from him!\"\n\nFour pairs of eyes staring at her was the last thing that Louise remembered seeing as she fainted.
