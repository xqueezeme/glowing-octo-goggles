        "The morning seemed to slow down the closer the time for Nick and Hana to arrive got. Patricia was peeking outside every five minutes because she thought that she heard a car door opening. Kenji didn't stop her but watched her with an amused expression on his face.\n\n\"Papa?\" Ralph called as he watched Patricia make another trip to the window, \"Why does mama keep looking outside?\"\n\n\"She is very excited.\" Kenji replied, \"I am going to teach her how to drive.\"\n\nRalph looked suitably impressed at the revelation and then looked back at Patricia who was once again back at the window.\n\n\"They're here!\" she called excitedly as she ran to grab her purse.\n\nRalph, Marie and Kenji met them at the door. Kenji took one look at Nick's face and knew that he was bothered about something.\n\n\"Grampa Nick! Gramma Hana!\" Ralph cried out.\n\n\"Hello Ralph, how are you?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"Fine, papa is going to teach mama how to drive!\"\n\n\"I know.\" Nick replied. \"That's why me and your grandmother are here.\"\n\n\"Hello Ralph,\" Hana said with a smile. Marie was in her arms and playing with Hana's long hair. \"We brought new reading books for you.\" she added.\n\nPatricia's pending driving lesson was forgotten as Ralph took the bag containing the books from Nick's hands and carried them to the couch.\n\n\"Where is Patricia?\" Hana asked looking around.\n\n\"She is getting ready for our lesson.\" Kenji replied still watching Nick. He waited until Hana had gone up the stairs before speaking to Nick.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Nothing to worry about just yet but there's talk of Lawrence getting out of prison even sooner than we thought.\" Nick replied.\n\n\"How is this possible?\" Kenji asked shocked.\n\nNick shrugged, \"apparently he's made some friends that are in high places.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" Kenji asked.\n\n\"I don't know yet but Kenji, watch your back. Paul's been keeping me updated on what's happening at school. There are groups like the one led by Andrew Kelley popping up all over the place but they aren't calling themselves t Klan although their beliefs are the same.\"\n\nThe conversation quieted when the men heard Hana and Patricia come into the room.\n\n\"Does mother know?\" Kenji asked.\n\n\"Yes and so does Abby and Sally.\" Nick replied, \"I'm leaving it up to you to tell Patricia.\"\n\n\"I'm ready!\" Patricia said her voice filled with anxiety and excitement.\n\n\"I will talk to her about this soon.\" Kenji said as Patricia reached him. \n\n\"Talk to me about what?\" Patricia asked.\n\n\"Nothing that needs our attention right now.\" Kenji replied as he put his arm around her to guide her to the door.\n\n\"Take you time.\" Nick told them as they walked out, \"we plan to be here all day.\"\n\nAfter thanking them, Kenji helped Patricia into the car and drove them to an empty parking lot, parked, got out and helped Patricia out of the passenger side and into the driver's seat. When she was settled in, the lesson began.\n\n\"Alright Kirei.\" Kenji said, \"You already know how to start a car and to some extent on how to drive it but what you lack is the practical experience....\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Patricia said, \"I can't drive, we know that.\" she added anxious to get on with the lesson.\n\nBefore Kenji could say anything, Patricia had started the car and was trying to get it into gear.\n\n\"Kirei....\"\n\nPatricia tried to remember what she had seen Kenji do with his feet and got nowhere.\n\n\"Why am I not moving?\" she asked exasperated.\n\n\"Kirei,\" Kenji said softly, \"the brake is on and you are stalling the engine.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The brake is on and you are stalling the engine.\" Kenji repeated patiently.\n\nIt was a full hour before Patricia made any progress in getting from a stand still to moving a few feet before jerking to a stop.\n\n\"Kirei...\"\n\n\"I can do this!\" Patricia exclaimed becoming increasingly frustrated that she couldn't do something that had looked so easy.\n\n\"Kirei stop.\" Kenji said softly as he placed a hand on top of hers.\n\nPatricia stopped, the patient tone of his voice having more of an effect than the touch of his hand on hers.\n\n\"Give me your hand.\" He commanded holding his hand out to her.\n\nPatricia held out her hand to him closing her eyes as he began a slow massage of her hands that could have become sensual if the circumstances had been right.\n\n\"Close your eyes.\"\n\n\"Kenji....\"\n\n\"Kirei, please close your eyes.\" he repeated. When she complied, he led her through a series of breathing exercises. The lesson didn't begin again until Kenji was sure that she had calmed enough to listen.\n\n\"You are just beginning and it will take you some time to learn this but you will learn.\"\n\n\"I know. I just wanted to be able to do it right away.\" Patricia replied, \"It's harder than it looks.\"\n\nThey spent the afternoon in the parking lot practicing and by the time they left, Patricia could slowly drive around the parking lot without jerking around so much. When she was tempted to go to fast Kenji slowed her down.\n\n\"Patience Kirei, the speed will come soon enough.\"\n\nHana and Nick had supper made when they came in; the house smelled of baking fish and steamed rice.\n\n\"Can you drive now?\" Ralph asked.\n\n\"A little.\" Patricia replied.\n\n\"She did very well.\" Kenji said as he picked Marie up.\n\nWhile Patricia and Hana finished dinner, Kenji and Nick talked.\n\n\"I think that it's a good idea that you're teaching Patricia how to drive.\" Nick said, \"I've been thinking that I should teach Hana to drive as well.\"\n\n\"I think that is wise.\" Kenji agreed, \"I want them to be able to get away if anything should happen but what of Sally? Maybe she should be taught as well.\"\n\n\"Will just bought a car and is already teaching her... Kenji I'm wondering if we should think about moving closer together. I know that we have at least another two years before Lawrence is released but I don't want to wait until he's free to pull something together, we need to have a plan in place.\"\n\n\"He will come back.\" Kenji murmured.\n\n\"I believe so and Sally and the children will be his first targets simply because he knows where they live.\" Nick replied.\n\n\"Dinner!\" Patricia called from the kitchen interrupting any further conversation.\n\n********\n\nBecca looked out of her bedroom window regretting her decision to leave LA. She had been at her uncle and aunt's house for less than a week and was bored beyond belief. The only thing that buoyed her spirits was seeing that everyone- meaning everyone not white seemed to know their place. Aside from that, there was nothing to do except reading and church.\n\nShe called her father after three days and begged him to let her come home.\n\n\"No, you stay where you're at, you've cost me enough money and when you get back here....'\n\nBecca tuned him out, she had heard that particular speech several times before she left and had counted her blessings that her parents didn't know about what had happened at school and the rumors about her. It would kill them to know that their sweet girl was anything but.\n\n\"Becca! Come on!\" her cousin Nancy called, \"we're going to be late!\"\n\nBecca groaned. She had no desire to go to the church social. She wanted to stay in her room and brood about Andrew. Like it or not, she still loved him and if he called right now and told her to get back to LA, she'd be on the next bus home no questions asked. However, that phone call wasn't going to come, not now, not ever. That she had lost him to another woman would have hurt but it was to what her relatives politely called a \"darkie\" who happened to be very married.\n\n\"Becca!\"\n\n\"Coming!\" Becca called back as she fixed her lipstick and grabbed a sweater even though she was almost sure that she wouldn't need it. The weather was already warm and humid making her usually full-bodied blonde hair look limp. Tired of fussing with it, Becca tied it back with a brightly colored scarf and left the room.\n\n\"It's about time!\" Nancy said, \"If we're late we'll have to sit with mama and daddy.\"\n\nBecca didn't ask what would be so bad about that, she didn't care. The only thing that she cared about was that she had nine more weeks to spend with her cousin and that she had to rely on the mail for any real news of what was happening at home. They arrived at the park, located the table where Nancy's parents' were, help set out the food and took off.\n\nNancy it seemed was a social butterfly, she seemed to know everyone and everyone seemed to know and love her. She made a real effort of introducing Becca to everyone including the men that she found attractive. For Becca, the whole thing was a boring affair until she turned around to see a pair of blue eyes staring at her.\n\n\"Nancy! Who is that?\" Becca asked.\n\n\"Him?\" she asked dreamily, \"is Robert Cole and don't waste your time. Every girl here has tried to get close to him and so far no one's managed anything more than a polite hello.\"\n\n\"Then why is he staring at me like that?\" Becca asked.\n\n\"I dunno, maybe it's because he knows you came in from California.\" Nancy replied not liking the way that Robert was looking at Becca.\n\n\"He's cute.\" Becca said as she flashed a smile over at him.\n\n\"Yeah well....\"\n\n\"Nancy! Do you like him?\" Becca asked finally understanding her cousin's reaction.\n\n\"Sure me and every unattached girl here.\" Nancy replied glancing wistfully at Robert who was talking to someone.\n\n\"Does he know?\"\n\n\"NO! And don't you dare say anything!\" Nancy exclaimed.\n\n\"Why on earth not?\" Becca asked.\n\n\"I don't know how things are done in California,\" Nancy said, \"but here if a girl approaches a boy, she's considered fast if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Well I think that's stupid.\" Becca said stealing another glance at Robert.\n\n\"Alright everyone, gather around, its dinner time!\" Nancy's father Bert called, \"Robbie you want to say the blessing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Robbie\" turned out to be none other than Robert the object of Nancy's and now Becca's desire.\n\n\"Sure Bert!\" Robert called back as he bowed his head to pray.\n\nBecca bowed her head but watched Robert through half open eyes and decided that maybe her coming to South Carolina wasn't such a bad thing after all.\n\n*********\n\nLawrence had a new right hand man. This one he had checked out before giving him the position. Duke Lewis was smart but not as smart as the last right hand man had been. He would be incapable of doing what Carl had done and Duke would follow orders. It still galled Lawrence that Carl had managed to escape with not only his life but with a notebook containing everything that they had discussed. His only consolation was nothing to link him to any of the murders that he sanctioned. They were suspicious but there was no proof of his involvement. The list that Carl had was only a list of people that Lawrence wanted to visit when his term was up. He had never used the words kill, hurt or murder but even so, anyone with half a brain knew exactly what he meant.\n\nIt was time to start planning for day he walked out of the prison as a free man, two years would pass quickly and he wanted to be ready. He had more than enough places to stay while in the south, California was going to be the problem. There was no way in hell that Sally would let him stay with her but that was alright, he was going to visit her anyway. The last time he had spoken to her was when she called to let him know that his father had died. If she was expecting him to express any kind of remorse or sympathy then she got a rude awakening when he told her \"good riddance, one less to visit.\"\n\nHe chuckled at her shock and the sudden hang up. When made his visit to her, maybe he would screw her first. It wouldn't be fornication; she was still his wife until he signed the divorce papers that lay in an envelope under his mattress. When he first received the papers, he had been furious and then he calmed down. There was no way in hell he was signing those papers. , he would tell her that in person when he was finished with her.\n\nThe way he saw it, Nick Alexander was going to be his biggest problem and if there was any way to eliminate him before parole he would do it but Nick was too high profile and besides and he wanted to do it himself. Lawrence smiled to himself as he imagined Nick begging and pleading for his life as his blood ran from him. However, there was another issue, the lawyer that put him away was living with Sally. Lawrence found that out from Doc before he met his demise. He was going to receive a visit too, maybe he would make him watch the visit with Sally and of course, there were the kids to consider. He wondered how hard it would be to get them back onto the straight and narrow.\n\nLawrence mentally ran through the list of inmates that he knew were going to be soon paroled and wondered which of them he could trust to be his eyes and ears in California. The issue was going to be getting him there and then finding a place for him to live as well as providing the money for him to live on. He tucked it away as something that needed further thought and headed for what he called bible study which wasn't a lie as far as he was concerned. They read the scripture, said a beginning and closing prayer and even sang a hymn or two.\n\n\"Lawrence, you ready to start?\" Duke asked.\n\n\"Give me a minute will you? As a matter of fact, why don't you get started with the opening prayer?\" Lawrence asked knowing that it would make the big man happy.\n\n\"You got it! And Erwin is looking for you.\" \n\n\"Huh... I wonder what he wants.\" Lawrence muttered to himself. Out of all of the guards, Erwin J. Little was the one who could help him the most because he had family in California. Of all of the guards, he was also the one who was able to resist the charms of Lawrence Goodman no matter how much Lawrence and his men kissed his ass.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"By the laundry and he says for you to come alone.\"\n\n\"Alright, go on and start the meeting.\" Lawrence said, \"And if I'm not there in twenty minutes send someone to see what's going on.\"\n\nFive minutes later, Lawrence was on his way to the laundry to meet Erwin. He found the man leaning against the wall smoking a cigarette.\n\n\"Bout time you got your sorry ass here.\" Erwin said.\n\n\"My apologies...\"\n\n\"Shut the fuck up Goodman!\" Erwin growled, \"Your high and mighty manners don't work with me. I know who and what you are and I also know what you want from me.\"\n\nLawrence held his tongue; he needed Little's help and tried to smooth things over.\n\n\"Little....\"\n\n'Close your fucking mouth and listen up.\" Erwin said blowing smoke into Lawrence's face. \"I don't like you.\" he said. \"You hide behind your phony act instead of being what you are, a crazy son of a bitch but I like the way you think.\"\n\n\"Now wait a god damned minute!\" Lawrence snarled.\n\n\"Ah there he is!\" Erwin drawled as he took another puff of his cigarette, \"the real Lawrence Goodman appears.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"The same thing you do.\" Erwin replied, \"to save the white race from the niggers, homos and Jews but my question to you is this, what are you willing to do to meet that goal?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"I'm not the only one who feels as you do.\" Erwin replied, \"But we're not ass kissers.\"\n\n\"I don't...\"\n\n\"The hell you don't but then again its how you've managed to keep your little group going isn't it?\" Erwin asked\n\n\"Again, I ask what do you want?\" Lawrence repeated.\n\n\"Nothing really, I just wanted to let you know that I'm on to you and that I have the warden's ear.\"\n\n\"Are you threatening me?\" Lawrence asked.\n\nErwin smiled but didn't answer as he put out his cigarette.\n\n\"I happen to know that you ordered that government man to be killed.\" Erwin replied still smiling. \"I even know who beat him. All I have to do is go to the warden. Don't get me wrong, he agrees with your politics to a degree but believe me when I say, you'll hang if I tell him everything that I know.\"\n\nThe longer the conversation went on, the more Lawrence understood what was happening. In spite of his having the same views, Erwin Little was planning to blackmail him. Rage built up in Lawrence, to him, Ernie Little was no better than the very people he was trying to save the white race from.\n\n\"So it's blackmail.\" Lawrence said softly.\n\n\"Don't even bother to hand me that bullshit about you not having any money,\" Erwin said, \"I know for a fact that all of the men in your group give you any cash that they get from home.\"\n\n\"How do you know all of this?\" Lawrence asked as he tried to decide on what to do. Giving Erwin money was out of the question. He would need every penny that he could get his hands on for his visit to California.\n\n\"Don't matter how I know.\" Erwin replied, \"I want ten dollars a week...\"\n\nLawrence laughed, \"Are you serious?\"\n\nWhatever Erwin thought that Lawrence's reaction was going to be, amusement wasn't it.\n\n\"Ten... dollars a... week?\" Lawrence asked still laughing as he calculated how much of the twenty minutes he had left.\n\n\"What's so fucking funny?\" Erwin asked.\n\n\"That you really thought that I would agree to your stupid demand.\" Lawrence replied as in one quick move, he slipped a knife down his sleeve and stabbed Erwin J. Little in the chest. \"You're no better than they are.\" he hissed as he pushed the blade in deeper.\n\nFive minutes later, Duke himself came looking for him his eyes widening as he saw the dead body of the guard lying on the ground.\n\n\"Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Yes he's dead.\" Lawrence calmly replied, \"Now go get a couple of the others and we'll carry him over to the colored's barracks.\"\n\nAn hour later, the body of Erwin J. Little was lying behind the cellblocks where one certain black man who Lawrence despised lived. The man had done nothing to earn Lawrence's hate other than being black but there was more to it. Lawrence hated the confidence with which the man walked around the yard and the way he met his gaze unafraid. He also hated the way the man tried to encourage the inmates who could read and write to teach those who couldn't. But most of all, he hated hearing the man say that things were going to change for the better and they had to be ready.\n\n\"Be ready to hang!\" Lawrence muttered under his breath as they made their way back to their own cellblock.\n\nA black inmate discovered Little's body and immediately reported it. Because of where the body was located and because Little had been very vocal about his views and had on more than one occasion punished a black inmate unfairly or for no reason at all, suspicion immediately went to the blacks. Unfortunately for Lawrence, that while the warden shared some of his views, he also believed in separate but equal hence the investigation.\n\nIt was then that Lawrence realized that Erwin had lied about how close he was to the warden. Inadvertently, Erwin had made Lawrence dirty his hands long before he was ready to. Lawrence thought about having one of his men bear false witness against the blacks but decided against it, he had already acted rashly once and had no desire to compound the problem. Now all he could really hope for was that the warden would let it go.\n\nLater that morning, Lawrence looked up to see the black prisoner that he hated openly staring at him. The stare was a challenge of sorts, it seemed to be saying, \"Come and get me you son of a bitch!\" the man smiled and then nodded at Lawrence before going on his way. Lawrence didn't know what the man's name was and up until now, he hadn't cared.\n\n\"Duke, find out that nigger's name.\" \n\n\"I already know what it is.\" Duke replied.\n\n\"Well?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"Jacob Lincoln, he used to be a preacher and a teacher.\" Duke replied.\n\n\"Used to be?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Duke replied, \"He's here because he murdered one of the men who set fire to his house, his wife and kids were still inside.\"\n\n\"How is it that you know so much about him?\" Lawrence asked.",
        "Duke shrugged, \"I hear things.\"\n\n\"What else have you heard?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"That we're getting a new warden.....\"\n\n\"What?\" Lawrence asked alarmed.\n\n\"Yessir, I heard that Warden Simmons is being transferred to a minimum security prison.\"\n\n\"Who's taking his place?\" Lawrence asked his mind racing.\n\n\"Dunno.\" Duke replied.\n\n\"When is this supposed to happen?\"\n\n\" Duke replied. \" Word is that the warden doesn't want to leave but he was given no say in the matter.\" \n\n\"What else do you know?\" Lawrence asked.\n\n\"Nothing, but I'll keep an ear out.\"\n\n\"Fuck!\" Lawrence swore forgetting his no cursing rule for the second time in a few hours. Depending on who Simmons' replacement was everything that he had done here could be blown to hell. Escape had never been a part of his plan but it was now something worth considering. Simmons had been easy to fool and manipulate but whoever was replacing him might not be that easy but on the other hand, the replacement could be someone that he could work with. It was time to begin planning his escape but he would wait to activate the plan until he saw who the new warden was and what he was like.\n\n***********\n\nSpring break came and went faster than anyone could imagine. Andrew and Hathaway's group had grown in numbers and as Andrew had suspected, they needed to elect officers. Andrew could feel Ernie's stare on his back and knew that he had made an enemy. Ernie stayed in the group because it was the only group like it and they were the only friends that he had.\n\nNot once did Becca cross Andrew's mind, he was glad that she was gone and suspected that her leaving was a part of Ernie's anger. No man no matter how weak he was liked knowing that he had been used and it had been a bitter pill for Ernie to swallow. Andrew also knew that Ernie was waiting for Becca to come back. That he would at the very least beat her ass didn't concern him, as far as he was concerned, she deserved it.\n\nWhat he couldn't forget was what she said about him having a thing for the Jap's wife. The accusation was one that he hadn't examined to closely out of fear that it was true. Could Becca be right? He asked himself for the umpteenth time. Was it because of her that he made no moves on the little group? Maybe, but he didn't think so. The timing wasn't right and Hathaway was right, they had to exercise caution. \n\n********\n\nAndrew was in his room when Hathaway arrived. He hadn't told his parents anything about him other than to say that he was a friend from school. Whether they believed him or not he didn't know although he couldn't think of a reason for why they wouldn't. He could hear his mother asking Hathaway to wait while she called for him.\n\n\"Andrew! You have a guest!\" she called up the steps.\n\n\"Ok mom, send him up!\" Andrew called back.\n\nA moment later, Professor Michael Hathaway was sitting in the chair at Andrew's desk.\n\n\"Nice house.\" he commented as he looked around.\n\n\"Thanks but is it wise for you to be here?\" Andrew asked.\n\nHathaway smiled at him, pleased that the boy and that was how he thought of him, was thinking. \n\n\"It's fine and we need to talk.\" Hathaway replied.\n\nAndrew felt a nervous fluttering in his stomach, had Becca said something after all?\n\n\"As you are well aware, our group is growing.\" Hathaway said. \"And you've been doing a good job of leading it but you need assistance that I can't give you. I can advise you but I can't be seen meeting with the group, if that happened then we would have to disband and reform.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Andrew said.\n\n\"Pick assistants and make sure that they are people that you can trust. Now tell me what is happening with the black woman and her husband.\n\nHathaway listened without interrupting and then agreed with Andrew's decision to leave them be for the time being.\n\n\"Let them become complacent and when you do begin to act, make sure that it is covertly. You want them to know that it's you but not be able to prove it. Start with the Jew as he seems to be their weakest link.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that anymore.\" Andrew replied and filled Hathaway in on the fight.\n\n\"I heard about that but he still remains their weakest link. Tell me, how did you handle the disobeying of your order?\" Hathaway asked.\n\nHe already knew, he wasn't without his resources but he wanted to hear what Andrew had to say.\n\nAndrew took a deep breath and answered the question honestly.\n\n\"What are the chances that he will disobey you again?\"\n\n\"Slim to none.\" Andrew replied confidently.\n\nHathaway wasn't convinced especially since there was a woman involved. \n\n\"And what of the lovely Becca Cartwright?\" Hathaway asked. \n\n\"What about her?\" Andrew asked nervously. He now understood that Hathaway was telling him that he knew everything.\n\n\"Wasn't she the reason that your order was disobeyed? So in essence, the disobedience began with her, am I correct?\"\n\n\"Yes but....\"\n\n\"So how was she disciplined?\" Hathaway asked leaning forward in the chair expectantly.\n\n\"I.....\"\n\n\"Did you discipline her?\"\n\n\"No.... I warned her but she got the message and...\"\n\n\"Took a train to visit relatives in South Carolina I believe.\" Hathaway interrupted. \"So you discipline the males for disobedience but the females get away with it?\" that hardly seems fair.\n\n\"But she.....\"\n\n\"Was the one who initially disobeyed the order not to touch the... what is it that you call them? Oh yes the melting pot. She must be very talented with her mouth in order to get one of your most trusted friends to do as she asked.\"\n\nHathaway paused to give Andrew time to think about what he was hearing.\n\n\"I understand.\" Andrew replied.\n\n\"Do you?\" Hathaway asked staring into Andrew's face.\n\n\"I got it; I should have punished her as well.\" Andrew replied.\n\n\"Yes but its too late now but in the future... Well I see that you get my point so there's no need to belabor it. I'll contact you in a week to find out who you have selected as officers.\"\n\nAndrew stood when Hathaway did relived when there was nothing more said about Patricia.\n\n\"Thank you for coming Professor.\"\n\n\"You're welcome and please, call me Michael. I am no longer your instructor in the traditional sense.\"\n\nAndrew walked Hathaway down the stairs and out to his car, when he went back into the house, his father was waiting for him.\n\n\"You got a minute?\" Harlan asked in a tone that told Andrew that he had better make the time.\n\n\"Sure pop.\" Andrew replied.\n\nHe waited until his father sat down before sitting down himself.\n\n\"How's work going?\" Andrew asked.\n\n\"Fine but that isn't why I want to talk to you.\" Harlan said. \"I want to know what you're into and before you say nothing, I know better. Who was that man that was just here?\"\n\n\"Michael? He's a friend from school and I'm not into anything.\"\n\n\"Did you knock that girl up? Is that why she left?\"\n\n\"Girl? What girl?\" Andrew asked and realized that his father was talking about Becca. \"No, we're not together anymore and she's spending the summer in one of the Carolinas visiting family.\"\n\n\"What about these friends of yours, why haven't we met them? And the one that was just here seemed a little off. Andrew, you're into something, I can tell. I seen guys in my unit act the same way when they're doing something that they shouldn't be....\"\n\n\"Pop, I'm fine!\" Andrew said ending the discussion.\n\nOnce again, Harlan didn't press the issue after all, who was he to talk?\n\n************\n\n\"Are you ready?\" Kenji called to Patricia. The one day that he was dreading had arrived. The trip to Manzanar. The memory of the day that he left for the camp was etched deep in his memory; it was one of the most painful days of his life. Even as he thought about it, tears formed in his eyes. If it had been painful for him, it had to have been hell for her.\n\nThey had talked about many things but never that day and he thought he knew why, it was just too painful but if they wanted their children to know about that time, they needed to talk about it. In many ways, this day was much like that one. It was beautiful out, the sun was shining and he was waiting for Patricia to come down the stairs. That day...\n\n\"I'm ready!\" Patricia said coming up from behind him and wrapping her arms around his waist. She didn't really want to go but like Kenji, she believed that it was important.\n\nKenji turned around and hugged her tight. It took him a few minutes to convince himself that he wouldn't be staying at the camp and that he would be returning home with her and the children. Patricia hugged him just as tightly but she was crying, that day was the most painful day in her life with her father disowning her and losing Ralph almost rivaling it.\n\n\"Kirei, we don't have to go.\" \n\n\"Yes we do, I want Ralph and Marie to know what happened to you, to us.\" she replied.\n\nKenji nodded and kissed her before calling for the children.\n\nThree hours later, they were at the gates of Manzanar. Patricia and Kenji were holding hands so tightly that it was to the point of pain.\n\n\"What is this place papa?\" Ralph asked.\n\n\"This place is a place where many of us who are Japanese lived.\" Kenji replied.\n\n\"You didn't live with mama?\"\n\n\"For a few months, no and it was not because I didn't want to be with her.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\" Ralph said.\n\n\"Before you and your sister were born....\"\n\n\"They put you here because they were afraid of you.\" Ralph said when Kenji finished his explanation.\n\nKenji had never really thought about like that, he knew that the government was calling it national security but it was as Ralph had said, it was simply fear. Kenji drover through the gates, his stomach churning as he remembered the first time he entered the camp. The view of the surrounding mountains was just as breathtaking as it had been then but the buildings ruined the effect. The buildings were still the same; the hospital where he had met Paul was still there as was the orphanage.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he helped Patricia out of the car and then the children. Ralph looked around him and took Marie's hand as Patricia took her other one and Kenji took hers.\n\nPatricia cried when she saw the barracks where Kenji and Hana had lived for months and then understood why he hadn't wanted her to go with him. He had been right; this was no place in which to raise a baby.\n\n\"How did you survive this?\" she asked as she looked around the small dust caked room taking note of the cracks in the walls. The pieces of cloth that that Kenji and Hana used to try to block the dust out were still crammed in he cracks\n\n\"It is only because of you that I did.\" Kenji replied.\n\n\"No one should ever have to live like this.\" she murmured as tears ran down her face.\n\n\"You are right.\" Kenji agreed as he took out a handkerchief and dried her eyes.\n\nRalph's eyes were wide as he looked at the small hard cots, \"Gramma Hana lived here too?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes as well as many others.\" Kenji replied as he led them from the barracks to the orphanage and then to the hospital as he told them about his life at the camp.\n\nKenji was carrying Marie, already tired from the walk while Ralph held on to Patricia's hand.\n\n\"Papa? Were you scared?\" Ralph asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" Kenji replied. \"I was very scared but not for myself but for your grandmother. However, I was scared for your mama. She had you in her belly and I was so far away from her and I had to rely on others to keep you and her safe.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you just leave?' Ralph asked not understanding the gravity of the situation.\n\n\"I wanted to.\" Kenji replied, \"But it would not have been the best thing for you or your mother. Sometimes we have to do things that we don't want to because of those we love. I stayed because I love you and your mother, do you understand?\"\n\nKenji could see by Ralph's expression that he didn't really understand.\n\n\"Sometimes when you are told to watch after your sister, you do not like it, is that true?\" Kenji asked.\n\nRalph blushed but answered honestly, \"Yes papa.\"\n\n\"But you do it anyway, why?\"\n\n\"Because I don't want anything bad to happen to her.\" Ralph replied as he began to understand.\n\n\"If I had left as I wanted to, I might have gotten hurt or caught and that would have hurt your mama and you so I stayed.\" Kenji said.\n\nTwo hours after they got there, they on their way back down the mountain. They hadn't been on the road for more than thirty minutes when both Ralph and Marie were sound asleep. Patricia looked back at them and smiled, they were their babies.\n\n\"Kirei we have never talked about that day.\"\n\n\"I know, sometimes I still dream about it.\" Patricia replied. \"It always seems so real, like I'm right there watching it happen again and sometimes if I wake up and you're not there....\"\n\n\"I know kirei; it is the same for me.\" Kenji replied. \"I will never, ever forget that day.\"\n\nPatricia laid her head on his shoulder and listened to him as he sang the song about the soldier who left for war and came back to his true love.\n\n**********\n\nThe first day of class after spring break came too fast to suit anyone. \n\n\"In a few more weeks we'll be off for the summer!\" Patricia said excitedly as she packed lunches for her, Joel and Kenji for the following day.\n\n\"Any big plans?\" Abby asked.\n\n\"We haven't talked about it but I'm thinking about a big end of the semester party.\" Patricia replied.\n\n\"Sounds like fun.\" Abby replied. \"Patricia did you and Kenji ever open that envelope that I gave you a few weeks ago?\"\n\nPatricia stopped what she was doing. She had forgotten all about the envelope and apparently so had Kenji.\n\n\"No, I am so sorry!\"\n\n\"Don't be sorry but make sure that you open it.\" Abby said. \n\n*********** Later when the Ralph and Marie were in bed, Patricia got the envelope and took it to Kenji.\n\n\"Abby asked me if we looked at this yet.\" she said as she sat on the sofa next to him.\n\n\"I had forgotten all about it.\" Kenji confessed, \"Why don't we open it now?\"\n\nHe put an arm around Patricia as she opened the envelope, \"It's awfully big for just a letter.\" Patricia said as she pulled out a stack of papers. The top sheet was a letter written in Ralph's spidery handwriting. Patricia looked at the date and gasped, Ralph had written the letter shortly after she and Kenji had gotten married.\n\n\"Dear Kenji and Patty,\n\nIf you are reading this then I've met my maker. I know that you've noticed the date and seeing as I'm dead, I don't know when you're reading this. I just wanted you to know that you two kids have brought much happiness to a lonely old man not just you but Abby too. I just wanted to thank you for that. I also wanted to leave you something and you can do whatever you want with it but the house in South Carolina is yours. It's bought and paid for and the papers for it should be somewhere in the stack that one of you, probably Patty is holding in your hands. \n\nThe second thing is this, I have a little bit of money and it's yours too. It isn't much but I hope that you can find some use for it whether it is for college or whatever you need. But this is what I would like you to use if for, you two have never had a honeymoon and god knows that you deserve it so if you can and there's nothing else pressing, take a nice trip just the two of you. The account numbers are in the paperwork somewhere and all you have to do is go to the bank. If there are any problems Abby can help you, we used the same attorney and the same bank.\n\nI know that you're wondering why I'm leaving all of my earthly possessions to you instead of looking for my sons. I don't know how to answer that except to say that you two have become like my children and in many ways, you are like the children that my birth children never were to me.\n\nKenji, take good care of my Patty as you always have. Keep her safe and love her- she deserves it and boy, you had better get your ass in medical school as soon as this war shit is over! I know that I've said it before but I'm going to say it again, you're going to be one hell of a doctor.\n\nPatty, girl you were like a ray of sunshine to this lonely soul and one hell of a cook. I know how headstrong you can be but you let your man take care of you in the ways that he knows how and you take care of him too. You make sure that you go to college too; you've got the head for it and can be anything that you want.\n\nI love you both even if I didn't say it,\n\nRalph Goodman\"\n\nPatricia held the letter with shaking hands. Neither of them had had any idea of how much Ralph had cared for them even then. Patricia laid her head on Kenji's shoulder none of them speaking. After several minutes Kenji spoke. \n\n\"I think that we should honor Ralph's request for the use of the money. We will let it sit where it is until such time we can go on a honeymoon.\"\n\n\"He loved us.\" Patricia said softly.\n\n\"Yes Kirei, he did.\" Kenji agreed.\n\n*****************\n\nMonday morning the first day of class after spring break, Andrew got to class just after Kenji and Joel did. He looked over at them and didn't like what happened next. Instead of glancing away at him with fear in his eyes, Joel met his gaze and didn't look away. That Joel looked away first didn't occur to Andrew, it was the fact that Joel was even looking at him at all. \n\nAndrew took a good look at Joel and noticed for the first time how he was filling out, bulking up and exuding an air of confidence and then he looked at Kenji who was as cool as ever. The urge to throw something at both of them rose and was gone, he couldn't afford to act rashly but neither could he afford to continue to let them slide by untouched. \n\nMaybe he would give them a little parting gift on the last day of class.\n\n**********\n\nErnie glared at Andrew when he wasn't watching. Surprisingly, it wasn't the \"melting pot\" that he was angry with; it was Andrew and that bitch Becca. He was further angered when he wasn't chosen as one of what Andrew called his \"cabinet\". For weeks after the fiasco with Becca, he was harassed without mercy and had become an outcast of sorts. It wasn't until a week or two ago that the teasing was over with but no one was telling him anything. He was now an outsider looking in and all because of one blowjob.\n\nHe couldn't wait for Becca to get her ass back home; he would make her give him so many blowjobs that the thought of them would make her ill. He felt his cock stir at the thought and quickly squashed it when he saw Andrew turn around to face him.\n\n\"Something on your mind?\" Andrew asked him.\n\n\"Not a thing.\" Ernie replied with a smile that didn't reach his pale blue eyes.\n\n**********************\n\nOne night after the children were in bed and Kenji was studying, Patricia pulled out all of the notebooks that she and Kenji had exchanged while he was in the camp and began reading. It wasn't long before she was crying as she read about those first weeks that they had been apart.\n\n\"Kirei?\" Kenji called softly. She hadn't heard him come in.\n\n\"That day.... That day I felt like my heart was being slowly yanked out of my chest. That is how badly it hurt. It was all that I could do not to run to that bus and get on it, it was all I could do not to call your name because if I had, you wouldn't have gotten on and they would have taken you to prison, that was the only thing that stopped me. I waited until the bus was out of sight before.... I wanted you to be proud of me; I didn't want those people to see me fall apart. I... I never want to feel anything like that ever again.\"\n\nKenji held and rocked her as she talked and cried.\n\n\"I know Kirei, I felt the same way. I even questioned the decision no to have you come with me but it wouldn't have been the right or safe thing to do. I kept telling myself that you were only two-hundred miles away from me but Kirei; it might as well have been the moon. It was weeks before I could sleep and then when I found out that you carried our child... if Nick hadn't been there, I would have left.\"",
        "Kenji didn't study that night, they didn't even make love in the physical sense but made love in the emotional sense. They spent the evening and a majority of the night talking about the hardest time of their lives and eased the emotional pain of that one horrible day. It wasn't until that night that they realized how deeply that one day affected them and would continue to affect them for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe next morning, Kenji offered to stay home from school. His emotions were still raw and he knew that hers had to be as well.\n\n\"I'll be alright.\" she assured him, \"Just be safe and hurry home.\"\n\nThey held each other a little longer than usual and the good-bye kiss was longer and more tender than usual as well.\n\n\"Kirei....\"\n\n\"Get going.\" Patricia said as she reluctantly pulled away, \"then you can be home sooner.\"\n\nThat day was the longest day that either of them could remember having.\n\n***********\n\nFinals were over and the knowledge that classes were over gave the campus a festive feel to it. Everywhere people were promising to write or call and arranging for visits. Some of the students in their happiness spoke to Patricia.\n\n\"Have a good summer!\" A few of them called out.\n\n\"You too!\" Patricia replied even though she knew that the same people would probably go back to not speaking to her in the fall but for now the impromptu greetings were nice. It was yet another \"normal\" moment for her to remember when things got hard. She looked around for Kenji smiling when she saw him heading her way from the building where their classes where held.\n\nShe could see the relief on his face as he got closer to her. He was as glad that school was over for the summer as she was but he had something to tell her but it could wait. As soon as he reached her, he bent down and kissed her on the forehead. \n\n\"Kenji?\" she asked surprised because he had never kissed her at school before. \n\n\"I am fine Kirei, I am just happy to see you. Where is Joel?\" he asked looking around.\n\n\"He'll be back; he said something about paying for the next semester.\" Patricia replied.\n\n\"Kirei, I was presented with an opportunity and I wanted to talk to you about it.\"\n\n\"Alright, what is it?\" Patricia asked.\n\n\"There is an accelerated summer program, if I do this, I will have one less semester of school.\"\n\n\"What did you tell them?\"\n\n\"That I wanted to discuss it with you first. I know how much you have been looking forward to the summer with ....\"\n\n\"Do it.\" Patricia said cutting him off.\n\n\"Kirei you must understand that I will be here at school three days a week and our summer plans will be put on hold.\"\n\n\"Kenji, do you want to do this?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes but you and the children are more important than anything that I might want.\" \n\n\"This isn't a want.\" Patricia said, \"It's a need. You are so far ahead of the others that you're bored. You need this so I'm saying yes. So who do you need to talk to?\" \n\n\"I don't know what to say.\" Kenji replied.\n\n\"How about Kirei, I love you and thank you?\" Patricia teased.\n\n\"Thank you and Kirei? I do love you.\" Kenji said hugging her.\n\n\"That will do, so when does this start?\" She asked.\n\n\"Two weeks but I can register now since we are here.\" Kenji replied.\n\n\"Let's go then.\" Patricia said taking his hand.\n\n\"Hey! Wait up!\" Joel called. \"Where are you headed? The car's that way.\"\n\nKenji explained the summer program to Joel who was excited for him. \n\n\"That's great! I'm happy for you! Mind if I tag along?\"\n\n***********\n\nAndrew watched the entire exchange between Patricia and Kenji with a mixture of disgust and curiosity. That the Jew had become part of their happy family added to that curiosity, he just didn't get it. \n\nHe had heard about the summer program that could cut off a semester and had hoped for a spot even though he knew that his grades weren't near good enough. The fact was he was hoping that the fact that his father was a war hero would guarantee him a spot and he was disappointed when it didn't happen. It seemed to Andrew that the fact that his father was a war hero was beginning to matter less and less. It was also clear that if he wanted to graduate and get into a good residency program that he had to get his ass in gear.\n\nWhen he heard that Kenji was given a spot and the Jew was on the waiting list, jealousy reared its ugly head. It didn't matter that he knew that there was no way he could have succeeded in the program. He deliberately overlooked the fact that Kenji had passed every test with excellence and that he was near if not at the top of their class. It galled him that a man whose country had attacked this one had taken his spot. \n\nNow as he watched the three of them walk away, his anger grew. He threw down his cigarette, gave the trio one last scorching glare and walked away. It was time to make some concrete plans beginning with finding out where they lived and anything else that he could find out.\n\n**********\n\nPatricia, Kenji and Joel went to the registrar's office so that Kenji could register for the summer program. The young woman behind the desk looked up at them and gave them a sincere smile.\n\n\"Hello, can I help you?\"\n\nKenji explained to her what he wanted.\n\n\"Oh yes, Dr. Nichols said that you might be stopping by or calling in the next few days. He'll be excited to know that you're signing up. Is this your wife?\" \n\n\"Yes this is Patricia and this is our friend Joel.\"\n\n\"It's nice to meet you all. My name is Penny short for Penelope.\"\n\nThe three of them stared at her. It had been a while since they had been spoken to in what they considered normal and it was refreshing.\n\n\"It's nice to meet you too.\" Patricia said recovering first.\n\n\"So, here's the class schedule and as you know it starts in two weeks. The week before Dr. Nichols wants to have a cook out at his house for the people in the class and of course all of you are invited.\" Penny said her eyes on Joel who had turned beet red under her gaze.\n\n\"How many others are there?\" Kenji asked.\n\n\"Six counting you and me.\" Penny replied turning her gaze onto Kenji. \"The cookout is a week from Saturday and bring a dish to share. The address and time is written in the schedule and the books are already at the book store.\"\n\nPatricia looked back at Joel and smiled, he was flustered and Penny was very obviously interested in him.\n\n\"My phone number is on the schedule too, I'm the contact person for the class. Any questions?\" Penny asked her dark eyes fastened onto Joel's face.\n\n\"When does this need to be paid for?\" Kenji asked.\n\n\"The day of class is fine unless you want to do it now.\"\n\n\"I will take care of it now and then will go to get the books.\" Kenji said, \"I have an account with the school so if you will give me the paperwork, I will sign for it.\"\n\n\"Great!\" Penny said as she reached into the drawer and pulled out a stack of papers for Kenji to read and sign. \"You can use that desk over there if you want.\"\n\nPatricia liked Penny, she liked her bubbly personality that she sensed wasn't fake. She had the sense that had they all been rainbow colored that she wouldn't have cared.\n\n\"Why don't you grab a chair?\" she asked Patricia, \"I have a feeling that we're going to get to know each other rather well. You too Joel.\" Penny added with a warm smile.\n\nJoel almost tripped over his feet in his haste to get chairs for him and Patricia. \n\n\"So Joel,\" Penny said when they were sitting, \"what specialty will you be going into?\" \n\n\"I .... I... I don't know yet.\" he stammered.\n\n\"That's alright, you have some time yet. What about you Patricia?\"\n\n\"Obstetrics so that Kenji and I can practice together when I'm done. What about you?\"\n\n\"Well, like Joel, I'm not sure but I'm thinking pediatrics.\"\n\n\"Isn't that what you were thinking about too?\" Patricia asked Joel trying to help him out a little.\n\n\"Y.... yes but I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"I wonder.....\" Penny said more to herself than them. \"I'll be right back.\"\n\n\"She's pretty isn't she?\" Patricia asked.\n\n\"Very.\" Joel replied absently as he looked in the direction that Penny had gone.\n\nKenji looked up from his paper work and smiled, Joel was going be all right.\n\nPenny swept back into the office and handed Joel a stack of papers.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Paperwork, I just talked to Dr. Nichols and he agreed that there's room for one more.\"\n\n\"I... I can't, I mean I...\"\n\n\"Relax, you were one of the ones that he was considering but he had to make the cutoff somewhere so are you in?\" Penny asked.\n\nJoel couldn't speak but bobbed his head up and down.\n\n\"Great!\" Penny exclaimed with a smile that made her already deep dimples deeper. \n\nThat she wasn't fashion model thin didn't bother Joel in the least, what mattered was that he liked the warm sunshiny dark haired woman who treated them as people and with respect. He wondered if she would consider going on a date with him.\n\n*********\n\nBecca got ready for her date with Robbie. She didn't feel bad about it, after all, she had warned Nancy that if she wasn't going to go after him she was and gave her a week to think about it. When Nancy made no moves, Becca took things into her own hands and approached him. He was unprepared for her forthright manner but he adjusted. Tonight was their third date and much to Becca's chagrin, he hadn't so much as touched her although she made it clear to him that she wouldn't reject any advances that he might want to make. Instead of taking her up on the offer, he smiled at her and acted as if she hadn't said anything forward.\n\nShe could feel Nancy's glare on her back but ignored it. They had already discussed the subject as much as Becca had intended to. She had finally accepted the fact that her hair would be limp because of the humidity and pulled it back into a ponytail tied with a blue scarf. Although it was early evening, she was sweating and the cotton sundress clung to her prompting Nancy to make a comment about her virtue. Oddly, the comment stung but Becca brushed it off attributing it to jealousy.\n\nShe was ready just as Robbie knocked on the door. Becca didn't speak to her cousin as she left the room that they shared and she had no doubt that when she came back that Nancy wouldn't talk to her. \"Oh well\" she muttered as she ran down the stairs.\n\n***********\n\nThe new warden arrived three weeks after Lawrence found out about him. Duke tried to find out information that could be useful but for the most part was unsuccessful. The guard who had been his source was transferred out as well as a number of other guards who came to see some of the prisoners as friends often bringing them food from home. There were other changes coming as well and none of them in Lawrence's favor.\n\n\"Goodman! The new warden wants to see you!\" a guard that Lawrence had never seen before snapped.\n\nLawrence's stomach clenched with nerves, he had allowed himself to get too comfortable. It hadn't occurred to him that things could drastically change. As he stepped out of his cell, a guard flanked him on either side while the one who summoned him put handcuffs on him.\n\n\"There's no need for that.\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"This here is a maximum security prison in case you've forgotten.\" the guard said, \"and this is what we call protocol which seems to have been forgotten amongst other things.\" He added.\n\n\"But....\"\n\n\"Quiet! And keep your eyes forward.\"\n\n***********\n\nWarden Theodore Elliot stood in front of the window of his new office. He had one hell of a mess to clean up. Simmons had let the prison go to hell and the prisoners both black and white had forgotten that they were prisoners and nothing more. However, the prisoner who held his interest was on his way to his office. That he held some of the same beliefs that Lawrence did was of no consequence. Lawrence had crossed the line when he had Doc killed, and now Little and there were others, he was sure of it. To Elliot, certain people were off limits and that included elected and government officials including agents of the government, women and children with the exception of those that threatened the survival of the white race. He could have cared less about the eight blacks that Lawrence killed or ordered killed but he had a prison to run and personal politics weren't a part of it.\n\nWhat he was going to do with Goodman he hadn't decided, but one thing was for sure, this prison was going to be run as it should have been. If he did find a way to prove Lawrence's' guilt in the murder of Doc and several other members of the Klan... then he would be dealt with. There were ways of getting rid of troublemakers that looked legal. Elliot either deliberately or really didn't see the contradiction in his thinking.\n\nA tap on the door told him that they had come with Lawrence.\n\n\"Come in!\" he boomed his bass voice resonating off the walls.\n\nLawrence soon found himself standing in front of one of the biggest white men that he had ever seen. He had to look up to see the new warden's face. He swallowed hard as he looked into slate gray eyes that held no warmth in them whatsoever.\n\nElliot didn't speak for several minutes and then decided to lay the cards on the table.\n\n\"I know who and what you are you murdering son of a bitch and I'm not talking about the eight darkies that you were convicted of killing. I'm talking about Doc and Little just to name two and for the record, I know that you can't be directly linked to either of those murders but let me tell you something, when I find the proof you will face justice.\"\n\nLawrence waited, there was more to come.\n\n\"From now on, this place will be run as a maximum security prison is supposed to be run, there will be no unscheduled meetings, there will be no fraternizing with the guards and all curfew hours are to be observed by everyone and that includes you and your group of whatever in the hell you call yourselves. \n\nWhile you are here, it is separate but equal do you understand me? That means if you or any of your men break the rules, then you will be disciplined like any other prisoner. Questions?\" Elliot asked.\n\n\"Why do you have it in for me?\" Lawrence asked, \"We're supposed to be on the same side.\"\n\n\"Let me explain something to you.\" Elliot said as if he was speaking to a small child. \"The Klan isn't going to get anywhere if idiots like you go around killing people haphazardly. As I mentioned, I don't give a fuck about the murders you're in here for but I do care about the murders of fellow Klansmen. You're helping the other side and not us but not only that, there are people that I consider to be off limits and that includes white women and children, government officials including the FBI and other Klansmen. It's time that we become more than men wearing sheets at night and burning crosses, it we are to control things, it has to be in politics where we can legally make a difference and not guerrilla warfare although that does have its place. \n\nNow, go back to your cell and if another body turns up white or black, I'll kill you myself and I'll get away with it. From this moment on, we are not to talk about our politics, you are nothing more than a prisoner, now get the hell out of my office!\"\n\nOn the way back to his cell, Lawrence replayed the meeting with the warden in his head. No matter what the man said, this was personal, it had to be but what had he done to anger the man? He wondered. There was more to it than the deaths of Doc and Little.\n\nAs they passed the building that housed the black prisoners, a voice that Lawrence recognized and hated called out.\n\n\"What's the matter Lawrence? Trouble in paradise?\"\n\nLawrence tensed but kept walking, ignoring the sounds of laughter at the remark. He had just made two decisions, one, Jacob Lincoln was going to die and two, and he was going to escape.\n\nElliot watched Lawrence walk flanked by the guards walking back to his cell. \"Go ahead you murdering bastard, try and escape... I dare you.\"\n\n*****************************\n\nBy the end of June 1946, six prisoners make an unsuccessful attempt to escape Alcatraz prison, a 14-meter high tsunami hits Hilo and Laupahoehoe on the Big Island of Hawaii, thousands are injured, 173 die.
