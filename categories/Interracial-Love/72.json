        "Finale\n\n\"I can't believe this shit.\" Nik said downing his beer in one gulp. \n\nJames and Scott just stared at Nik as he ordered his fourth beer, \"You think you want to slow down a little?\" James asked.\n\n\"No, I'm good, just hanging out with my boys and enjoying some beer.\" Nik said patting their backs. \n\n\"And we are enjoying you too and you have 30 more minutes to enjoy us before I have to go home.\" Scott reminded.\n\n\"I can't believe this man. You guys are just going to leave me in my time of need?\"\n\n\"One, we are here for you through anything, but lately we have been spending every night here after you admitted to Dominique how you felt.\" James said ordering himself a beer.\n\n\"I just can't believe she turned me down. I'm Nik, the Italian Stallion and she turned me down?\"\n\n\"Look Nik, I understand that it...\" Scott started.\n\n\"No you don't man. I thought everything that I was feeling for her she felt too. All that time and everything that we did together meant nothing to her? I know she's the one and I can't imagine being with anyone else, but she just rejected me for someone that can't even appreciate her like I can. Now I'm sitting her sounding all pussy whipped.\"\n\n\"You are, but sometimes that happens when you are in love.\" James shrugged, \"Even though I'm the hard ass that I'm always am, I know Jade has me wrapped around her pretty little fingers. You laid your cards on the table Nik. That's what you are suppose to do. The rest is up to Dominique, she will come around.\"\n\nNik shook his head wanting to believe what James said, but every time he went home, he felt a twinge of pain looking at her door. He wished he could just walk in like normal and they have their playful banter or they would cuddle up with a good scary movie. But he couldn't now. He still had her scent in his sheets and then knowing what they did everywhere in his apartment was the hardest part of going home. He shook his head as he thought back to what James said. The rest was up to Dominique. He just hoped she makes the right decision and fast. \n\nDominique had to keep herself busy so she wouldn't think about him. She has done a pretty good job of it this past week. She registered for school, helped some clients find other therapists, finished planning Katrina's shower, and finalized everything for Jason's wedding. She was a little tired but she couldn't run into or think about Nik. Sometimes it worked, other times she found herself crying randomly. At that moment, her body shivered thinking about him. \n\n\"No, I have to prepare the vegetables for the tray. Right!\" she smiled moving to the refrigerator. \n\nShe grabbed a couple of celery stalks and carrots trying to keep it together. Jade was already in the restaurant. They hadn't talked much since; she figured she was mad at her too. Well it didn't matter, she was angrier at herself, but she couldn't harbor on that. Not when there was so much to do.\n\nShe began slicing the celery trying to get a hold of her racing heart that was intensifying so much that she could hear it. Why was she reacting this way? It's been over two weeks. Two weeks to get over it. Two weeks to move on. Two weeks to miss his calloused fingers running up and down her body.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Dominique screamed not able to hold the flood gates any more. \n\nShe looked down at her handy work and realized instead of slicing the celery, she was dicing it. She tried so hard to pull it together, but she couldn't hold it in. Jade came in and immediately noticed Dominique's red puffy eyes.\n\n\"I messed up the celery.\" Dominique sobbed. \n\n\"Well sweetie, that's certainly something we can replace, but I get the feeling that's not why you are crying.\" Dominique could only shake her head as Jade pulled her to a chair, \"What's up?\"\n\n\"I have been crying almost everyday at home, sometimes at work. There are some days where I can hold it together but I can't anymore.\" Dominique paused as Jade placed her hand on top of Dominique's, \"Why did he have to fall in love with me?\" \n\n\"You're asking why he fell in love with you?\" Jade questioned with her eyebrows raised.\n\n\"I mean everything was so much better before. I can't have him fall for me.\"\n\n\"Why not? What's so scary about him loving you?\"\n\n\"Because...\" Dominique took a deep breath, \"I think I'm in love with him too.\"\n\nJade smiled and patted her hand, \"I already knew that; my question is why you waited so long to admit it.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think I'm a little scared, plus how can I start this with him and it was built on so many lies.\"\n\n\"It wasn't built on too many lies. It's just that through everything that was going on, you two fell in love with each other.\"\n\n\"What if I'm not enough or ready for this? What if I end up messing this up or he just leaves me?\"\n\nJade paused for a moment as she noticed that \n\nDominique couldn't look into her eyes, \"Dominique, the same thing that happened to your mother is not going to happen to you. You are not your mother. No matter how much you think you are, you are not her. You will not end up like her because Nik isn't like that.\"\n\nDominique bit down on her bottom lip and swallowed hard, \"I'm scared.\" She finally admitted taking a deep breath, \"I'm scared of these feelings that I have and where this is going to go. I mean I'm scared because I don't know. Besides you guys, Nik is the only person that allows me to be myself and make me feel instead of over think it.\" Her voice quivered. \n\n\"Sometimes that's the fun part. If you would have asked me three years ago if I would fall for a guy like James, I would tell you hell no, but I can't imagine my life without him. You know how you feel about Nik and you shouldn't try to hide it. If you don't give him a chance you are going to always wonder what could have happened. Nik loves you for you and you never had to do anything extra for him to fall. I do think there are a couple of doors you need to close in order to have a happy relationship with him though.\" Dominique nodded. \n\nDominique nodded and took a deep breath. She knew what Jade was telling her was right. She needed to stop denying her feelings for him. She wanted to give it a try with Nik. She was entering a new stage and she wanted nothing better than to start everything with Nik. Dominique was going to thank Jade when she saw something glimmering on her finger. \n\n\"Is that what I think it is?\" Dominique asked pointing to it.\n\nJade looked down, \"Oh this little thing. It's nothing but a little ring that James gave me.\" \n\n\"Congratulations! When did he proposed?\" she said hugging her.\n\n\"Yesterday, James came over for lunch and we were eating in my office. We were just talking normal, nothing special. He passed me this envelope and he asked me if I could check what's in there and see if everything looks okay. When I opened it, there was this little beauty here. I looked up at him and he was just casually looking at me. He didn't say anything for awhile and I was scared he was just going to say something like 'hey you want to marry me', but he surprised me. He leaned in close to me and told me that he never thought that he would be right here again, but he knew that right now it was right and he knew that he had to go through what he did to be the man that was right for me. Then he popped the question, of course I said yes.\" Jade said beaming from ear to ear.\n\n\"Did you ever think that he wouldn't?\"\n\n\"I thought for awhile he wouldn't just because of everything that he went through with that evil woman, but I knew in my heart he was waiting for when he was ready.\"\n\n\"I guess sometimes there can be happy endings, huh?\" Dominique smiled.\n\n\"You bet and I'm pretty sure you can find yours and stop comparing it to everyone else.\" Dominique nodded as she looked off to the side thinking about what Jade just said, \"Now, let's get past this baby shower.\" \n\nDominique was more than ready; all the planning that she has been doing for Katrina and she couldn't wait to see her face. She kept thinking about what Jade said and what she has been fighting for so long. She did want to break free and be herself. That's all her friends ever want her to be. That's all Nik wanted her to be. So why has she been pretending to be someone else? \n\nThe party went by in a blur so far as Dominique was concerned. She knew what she had to do to get what she wanted. She had to let go. \n\nAfter cleaning up the party, Dominique headed to Jason's place. That's the first place she wanted to start. It was going to be easier than her next two stops; at least that's what she thought. She took a deep breath before knocking on the door. She stepped back slightly once Candy swung the door open.\n\n\"Dominique, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I just came to talk to Jason a little bit.\"\n\n\"Oh, is everything okay?\" Candy said with a look of concern.\n\n\"Yea, just want to talk to him about some stuff.\" Candy let Dominique in and sighed as she saw Jason playing his video games.\n\n\"Yea, I know what you are thinking. He still hasn't grown out of that.\" Candy whispered.\n\n\"I'm in the room, so I heard you.\" He said still keeping his eyes glued to the television.\n\nCandy smiled shaking her head, \"Anyway, we were getting ready to pick up some of my family from the airport.\"\n\n\"Oh, if this is a bad time then I can come back.\" Dominique said.\n\n\"No, you look like you have something important to say. I'll go pick them up. Baby, I'll call you on where to meet us for dinner.\" She said walking over to him and giving him a kiss, \"Love you.\"\n\n\"I'll see you in a bit baby.\" He called out.\n\nDominique waited till they were alone to sit next to him. He glanced her way and saw the seriousness in her eyes. He immediately turned off the game and sat back giving her his full attention.\n\n\"So, what's up? You look kind of down.\" He said.\n\n\"Not down, just thinking of some heavy stuff. Actually there is something I have to tell you.\"\n\n\"Does it concern Nik?\" he asked and her head immediately snapped up to him.\n\n\"Why would you think that?\"\n\n\"I don't know something about the rehearsal dinner, it kind of felt funny. Is everything alright between you two?\" \n\nShe looked down at her hands. She couldn't figure out where to start. She determined it was best to start off at the beginning. She pushed off the couch and looked down at him, gathering up all the courage in her.\n\n\"You know I thought I was in love with you, for so long. When we were growing up, you were like my knight in shining armor. I thought that when you called me, you were going to finally tell me that you felt the same way for me. When you told me that you engaged, it crushed me.\" She ended with a light chuckle.\n\nJason shook his head as if trying to shake off what she just said, \"Dominique, I didn't know that you felt that deep for me, but what about Nik?\"\n\n\"Yeah about that; Nik agreed to pretend to be my boyfriend only to make you jealous and make you realize that you love me after all. I felt real bad about it, but I thought this was the way to get you and I'm so sorry for lying to you. You didn't deserve that.\" She tried to read his face but it was just blank, so she continued, \"I know I planned the wedding even though I had these feelings for you, but I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.\"\n\n\"Besides my face, who else got hurt?\" he said with a little venom in his voice.\n\nShe swallowed hard, she deserved that, \"Nik.\" His eyebrows wrinkled in confusion, \"The night of the rehearsal dinner, he admitted that he was in love with me and that he wanted to be with me. I couldn't say it at the time.\"\n\n\"It wasn't because of me, was it?\" Jason said pushing off the couch.\n\n\"No, maybe a little but it was more because I was scared. I don't know if I'm capable of loving him like that.\" She ended in a sob, \"I'm sorry. I don't even know why I'm crying, but I've been like this for the past couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"Because your heart is hurting.\" He said softly, \"You hurt someone that you really love. \n\nTrust me, I know that feeling all too well.\" Now it was Dominique's turn to look confused, \"That day that I kissed you, I went back to Candy and told her that I wasn't sure about rushing into getting married. She tried to get out of me what the problem was and for a moment, I thought I was in love with you.\" Jason stuffed his hands in his pocket, \"She said she was going to go back home until I figure out what I wanted. The moment those words came out of her mouth, it was like something came over me and I didn't want to imagine my life without her. I begged her to take me back and her forgiveness.\"\n\nDominique nodded, \"I see that now. I see how much you love her and she does fit you perfectly. I was so stupid to make you have any doubts.\"\n\n\"Those doubts I had Dominique didn't come from you, but from my own insecurities. You know just like I do that we both didn't come from a cookie cutter family. I never had a father to show me how to treat a woman and to be man. I have been a very successful lawyer, but I never had anyone that challenged me to take on responsibilities.\"\n\n\"Yea, I had a client like you a couple years ago.\" She nodded and Jason couldn't help but chuckle.\n\n\"I love Candy, just as much as I know you love Nik. He makes you different and I see it. He makes you laugh and you have fun with him. Not to mention I see how he looks at you. He was probably in love with you before he knew it.\"\n\n\"Wow, I didn't think of it that way.\" She said wiping the tears from her face.\n\n\"So why are two people who are as smart as us, messing up good things in our lives?\" \n\n\"I don't know, I'm wondering that myself now.\" \n\nShe looked down before she continued on with what she really wanted to know, \"So, are we cool?\" \n\nHe laughed, \"I could never stay mad at you for long.\" He grabbed her hand and pull her close into a nice bear hug, \"You are my mini.\" He said calling her the nickname he gave her as a child, \"I'm always going to be your best friend.\"\n\n\"And I'm always going to be yours. I'm so sorry.\" She said wrapping her arms around his waist.\n\n\"Actually, I'm kind of flattered. I didn't think you held me in such high regards.\" He smirked and she punched his chest.\n\n\"Don't push your luck.\" She said and they both started laughing as his phone went off.\n\n\"Well, that's my future wife, I better go meet up for dinner.\"\n\n\"Yea and I have some things I have to do too. I guess I'll see you on the big day.\" Dominique smiled.\n\n\"Yep and I better see Nik there with you.\" He smiled and she nodded.\n\nIf only he will take her back after everything that happened between them. As she headed to her apartments, she paused at his door. What was he doing right now? Was he thinking of her or was he on a date with another girl? The thought of him with another girl made her want to kick the door down and inspect the place, but she thought the better of that. She shook her head and sighed. She just had to see. She walked to the door and knocked on it. She waited for him to swing the door open so she could fall into his arms and kiss him all over. She wanted to take back everything she said and release her heart to him. She knocked again as a smile crossed her lips as she thought about how he would probably take her in front of the fireplace just like he did the other day. She gave another impatient knock but nothing. He was probably gone or worse saw it was her and didn't want to open the door. No, that wasn't in his nature. \n\nShe sighed in defeat and went to her own apartment. Tomorrow, she will try again tomorrow. She would just have to wait till he wants to listen, she thought as she made her way into her own apartment. \n\nNik swung open the door looking around outside. He could have sworn he heard someone knocking on the door. He shook his head as he closed the door. He sighed to himself as he leaned his head against the door. He thought for a moment it was Dominique. \n\nThe next day, Dominique got an early start and put on her yellow sundress with gladiator sandals. She had to mentally get herself ready for her last stop. She drove all the way to her mom's house and pulled up in front. She was bound and determine for this one. She had so much that she wanted to get off her chest. \n\n\"Dominique, how are you doing darling?\" Sun said enveloping her in a big hug.\n\n\"I'm good. I'm finally thinking clear.\" He looked at her not able to hide his confusion, \"Is my mom here?\"\n\n\"Yea, she is upstairs in her sewing room.\" \n\n\"I'll go see her.\" She was about to head upstairs when she turned back to him, \"Thank you so much, Sun for being that father figure that I needed. I will never forget how you would always take time out of your schedule to be at anything that I was participating in and I love you for that.\" \n\nAfter saying that a huge grin spread over his face and he nodded.\n\n\"It was my pleasure, Dominique. You were my daughter as well, no matter what.\" She gave him a kiss on his cheek and set her sights upstairs. \n\nShe moved in a daze as a million thoughts of how this was going to play out repeated in her head. \n\nShe didn't want to attack her, but she needed for her to know everything. She needed her to acknowledge her. Dominique found herself in front of the door with her thoughts still running wild. Well, it was now or never. She opened the door and saw her sitting in front of the sewing machine holding up a light blue fabric. She turned towards Dominique and quickly turned her attention to the fabric. With that little dismissal she gave her, Dominique was ready now. \n\n\"Hello mom. I came to talk to you.\" She sat her purse down at the closest table, \"You know for years the only thing I wanted was for you to accept me and love me. You don't know how it feels to be a child and know her mother doesn't love her.\" She walked over to the window in front of her, \"I tried everything to be the daughter that you wanted. I went into a career that I thought would make you happy, especially after the big fuss you made when Eiji became a therapist. I based my life around you, wanting you to notice me. I realize now I put everything on hold just to please you. I stopped doing what I love to make you happy; well you know what I'm tired of it. I'm tired of pleasing everyone else and not doing anything for myself. I can't even really blame you for that because I allowed you to do it. I was afraid to love.\" Dominique stared straight at her, but her mother didn't waver, \"I can see that it hurts to look at me because I look like him. I actually met him and he denied me to my face, no matter how much his wife tried to convince him otherwise. You know I can forget him, but I gave you a chance because you were here. Now I see you were here in body but I wanted a mother. I wanted you!\" She nearly shouted as she felt the tears stinging her eyes, \"You know that's okay. As of this moment, I'm not doing that anymore and I'm not going to be scared anymore. I almost missed out on a chance to have someone love me because of his race. I thought the same thing that happened to you would happen to me. I'm not going to live in fear anymore.\" The deafening silence filled the room and for the first time Dominique felt the anger boiling over as her mother sat there with her face blank, \"Look at me when I'm talking to you!\" she shouted and the shrill volume in Dominique's voice finally had their eyes meeting, \"I'm going to do what I want for myself. I'm going to love hard and allow myself to be loved. I'm not going to try to get your acceptance anymore. It's not fair to me. I'm going to be happy with him, if he takes me back.\" She chuckled as she wiped face, \"You can continue hating me if you want because I'm done.\" \n\nDominique said and was heading to the door.\n\nShe grabbed her purse and put her hand on the door, vowing to make this the last time she would ever come here, but then something stopped her cold.\n\n\"I never said I hated you.\" A strained heavy accent voice filled the room and Dominique's breath caught in her throat. ",
        "Did that just come from her? Did she finally speak to her? No, she couldn't have, she was just tired. She wanted to let it go, but a part of her nagged her to ask.\n\n\"What?\" she finally said surprised by how her voice quivered.\n\nShe didn't say anything and Dominique sighed. She knew she was hearing things, wishful thinking. She turned back to the door and she heard her again.\n\n\"I never said I hated you.\" She turned to see her slowly pushing out of her chair and looking at Dominique, \"I could never hate you.\" \n\nShe was talking! She was actually talking to her! Dominique put a hand over her heart and felt just how hard it was beating. They stood in silence for awhile, just staring at each other.\n\n\"You have a funny way of showing it.\" Dominique finally said.\n\n\"Listening to you just made me realize just how selfish I have been. Kaiyo, there has been so much stuff that I have dealt with and I do know that I took part of it out on you. I fell in love with a man that I thought could love me. I was stupid enough to think about leaving my husband and starting a new life. When he never came back for me, I got so depressed and felt so ashamed for allowing myself to give up so much for him. I thought I was in love, but I admit in the beginning I did take a lot of my anger out on you by not talking to you. Then one day when you were here, I watched you sleep and you were so beautiful to me. I felt the shame over again because of how I treated you in the beginning.\" \n\nDominique pressed her back against the door as her mother walked closer to her, \"There's really no excuse for my behavior, because I should have been a better mother to you. I shouldn't let my shame get in the way of you feeling loved. I watched and took pictures of everything that you have accomplished and I pray that you do find out what you want to do, be who you want to be, and be with whoever you want to be with. I can only hope that you forgive me. Please forgive me.\"\n\nDominique stared at her the entire time wondering if this was real. Was she really talking to her like this? A piece of Dominique wanted to wrap her arms around her mother and tell her of course I forgive you but the other part didn't want to let go of the little girl that had been hurt for so long. No, she wouldn't invite her back with open arms but she wasn't going to hold any grudges. \n\n\"I forgive you.\" Dominique mumbled as she felt like a boulder was finally lifted off her shoulders.\n\nAnd for the first time, she really did forgive her. It wasn't about the fact that she tried too hard to get her attention or what she said to Dominique. She had to forgive her so Dominique can move on with her life. Her mother swallowed hard and nodded taking Dominique's hand. \n\n\"Now, I know that we would have to start off slow and I understand that. So, you can ask me any question you want.\"\n\n\"Have you talked to my father since he left?\" Dominique asked.\n\nShe sighed, \"He called me about three weeks ago a little bit after you visited him I guess. I don't know what happened after Sun took the phone when he started yelling at me. He was upset that you did come over, but I didn't care. In a way I was glad that you did see him.\" Dominique nodded, \"Again I'm so sorry, Kaiyo. I want you to know that I do love you very much and I want you to be happy \n\n\"I forgive you.\" Dominique said and she could tell that her mother wanted to wrap her arms around her, but something was holding her back, \"It's alright, you can hug me.\" Dominique smiled and she did just that. \n\nShe held on to Dominique tighter than she would expect from her small stature mother. When Dominique returned the embrace, that's when she felt her body tremble and heard her muffled sobs. She was crying? She was crying on Dominique as she hugged her. Dominique felt like a piece of her was starting to weld together. \n\n\"It's okay.\" Dominique comforted. \n\nDominique still couldn't believe what was going on here, even after leaving her mom's house she was still in awe. She actually apologized for everything that she done. Now was the chance for them to really work on their relationship and the great thing about it was that Dominique didn't have to try so hard like she always did, but she came around on her own just like everyone said. Her mother wanted her to stay a little bit longer but Dominique had to go finish her last bit of business. \n\nShe headed over to Katrina's to check on her, since Scott was going to be working all night on a case. Dominique was itching to go home and beat on Nik's door, but she also didn't like the thought of Katrina being alone so close to her date. She wanted to tell him at the right time when they were back at home and able to celebrate. She smiled to herself as she thought about what they were going to do.\n\nShe finally made it to Katrina's new place and she greeted her at the door with a hug, \"Hey girly, how is it going?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not as good as you. You look like you are about to bust any moment.\" Dominique smiled.\n\n\"Oh I know. I have been having contractions all day.\" She said as they walked back to the living room.\n\n\"Are you okay? \" Dominique immediately asked and Katrina chuckled.\n\n\"Oh girl I'm fine. I have everyone on stand by and everything is okay so far as that goes. How are you doing?\" she said as she plopped down on the couch.\n\n\"You won't believe what just happened. My mom apologized to me.\"\n\nKatrina's eyes flew open, \"You mean she actually talked to you?\"\n\n\"Yep, she told me she was sorry and that she didn't mean to treat me the way she did. It was amazing Katrina.\" Dominique said shaking her head still in disbelief.\n\n\"Wow, that's really good girl. I told you she will come around soon.\"\n\n\"I know. It may have taken me going off on her but she finally did and she told me she loved me.\"\n\n\"I knew she always did. So, what about your other issue?\"\n\n\"I'm guessing you talking about Nik?\" Katrina nodded, \"I'm going to handle that situation too. I'm going to tell him today how I feel. I don't know if he will take me back but I have to try.\"\n\n\"Feelings like what you two have won't just go away. Trust me, once everything happens, you two will be together, then you will be in the same situation that I'm in.\" she said massaging her stomach.\n\n\"You are trying to get me pregnant already?\" Dominique joked and Katrina started laughing as she grabbed her phone.\n\n\"Hey Dominique, you think you can go upstairs and grab my blanket off the bed.\" Dominique shrugged and went upstairs. \n\nShe was heading back down stairs when she heard the doorbell. It must be her mom or Ricky. He was getting ready to move out of town because of a new job at a school. He was trying to at least stick around enough to see his little niece or nephew. Dominique got downstairs and stopped at the bottom when she heard his voice.\n\n\"Katrina, what are you up to? I know Dominique's car is out there.\" She heard the familiar voice say. \n\n\"I don't know what you are talking about.\" Katrina shook her head playing dumb as Dominique finally revealed her presences, \"Oh look Dominique's here. I didn't know you were upstairs.\" Katrina smiled.\n\n\"May I add you are horrible at this?\" Nik said looking at her.\n\n\"Oh give me a break, I'm pregnant. Now you two, talk.\" She said walking back into the living room. \n\nThey stood in silence for awhile. Nik tried to look everywhere but her and she kept her eyes on him. He hadn't shaved in a few days, she thought noticing the bit of stubble on his face. It's a new look but it actually fits him. He still looked as sexy as he always did. She wrapped her arms around her body trying to think of how to start this.\n\n\"I don't hear talking!\" they heard from the living room and they both chuckled. \n\n\"I didn't know that she was doing this, for the record.\" She said and Nik nodded.\n\n\"I should have known better since she said it was very important that I get over here. I thought it was just pregnant talk.\" Then they were silent again, \"So, how are you doing, kid?\" \n\n\"I've been okay. How about you?\"\n\n\"Cant complain, been hard at work. \"she nodded as she fidgeted with her fingers.\n\n\"Me too, I've been working on school stuff and getting prepared. I have enough to where I'm going to stop cold turkey and jump right into it.\"\n\n\"So, no therapy work at all?\" she shook her head, \"It's a risk.\" He warned.\n\n\"Someone told me I should take risks every once in awhile.\"\n\n\"So you are starting to listen to me?\"\n\n\"I've always listened to you. You have been the main reason that I decided to go ahead and do this. I wanted to talk about that night and what you said.\"\n\n\"I don't really want to Dominique.\" He said shifting from foot to foot.\n\n\"It's important that you understand.\"\n\n\"Understand what, that you would rather waste your time on someone that you not even sure that you love but just want to be with because you two are use to each other. Or no, is it the black thing which I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around.\" He said shaking his head.\n\n\"It isn't just that. I know I gave you those excuses in the beginning but it was just me overanalyzing everything.\"\n\n\"You think I'm not a bit scared about how I'm feeling. This is a bit new for me too. I already told you I have never really fallen in love with anyone.\"\n\n\"Well then how do you know that you are in love with me?\"\n\n\"I told you Dominique, you are the last thing I think of before I go to sleep and the first thing I think about when I wake up. You don't know how you have made me felt, like I can be something different than what other people make me out to be.\"\n\nDominique was about to say something but Katrina walked in, \"Um I'm going to interrupt a bit because I'm not feeling any love in here and I think I'm about to have the baby.\"\n\n\"What?\" they both said in unison.\n\n\"Yep, I think it's time so can we hurry this up please.\" Katrina said starting her breathing.\n\n\"Oh shit, um let's get her to my car.\" Dominique said.\n\n\"No, I have the cop car. We can use the sirens to get her there quicker.\" \n\n\"I don't care whose car we use just get me to the hospital and call my husband.\" Katrina growled through gritted teeth. \n\nDominique and Nik helped Katrina to the car and she jumped in the back seat laying Katrina's head on her lap. Dominique immediately called Scott as soon as Nik took off letting the sirens go at full blast. \n\n\"What hospital are we taking you?\"Nik asked.\n\n\"Grady's hospital, please hurry Nik.\" Katrina cried out.\n\n\"What's going on now?\" Scott screamed into the phone.\n\n\"We are on the way to the hospital Scott, just meet us there. Everything is okay.\"\n\n\"No everything is not okay! I'm in pain and he is not here!\" Katrina shouted and snatched the phone from Dominique, \"Scott get your lily ass to the hospital now!\" and she tossed the phone back to Dominique.\n\n\"Um, see you soon.\" Was all Dominique could come up with and disconnected the call.\n\n\"Now you two talk.\" Katrina demanded.\n\n\"We currently have a direr situation Katrina, like you having a baby.\" Nik said.\n\n\"If you talk it keeps my mind off the pain now talk, damn it!\" \n\n\"Um, I didn't mean what I said the other day Nik. I know it sounded stupid and didn't make any sense but I was scared.\" Dominique finally said.\n\n\"Scared of what?\"\n\n\"Scared of what could possibly happen between us. I was scared to let you know how I really feel about you and I was even more scared of what may happen if we happened.\"\n\n\"Why are you so scared of me? I've never done anything for you to be scared of.\"\n\n\"It's not just you, it was everything that came with you. Whoa, I think her water just broke.\" Dominique said looking down\n\n\"Aww, damn I have top clean that now.\"\n\n\"Please say we are almost there?\" Katrina breathed.\n\n\"We are almost there sweetheart, just keep breathing and don't focus on the pain.\" Dominique said.\n\n\"Oh I want to push so bad, can you two speed up this make up session or do something?\"\n\n\"This is kind of the wrong moment and a private thing Katrina, let's...\" Nik said.\n\n\"DAMN IT, you love her, she love you. Will you both stop dragging out all this drama and get to making up!?\" she growled and they both just looked at each other briefly. \n\n\"Look, we here.\" Nik said pulling up to the front and shutting off the sirens.\n\nHe ran inside as Dominique tried to keep Katrina calm, \"Look it will be okay. I just need you to hold on a little bit longer.\" She said smoothing her hair out of her face.\n\n\"Dominique will you stop being such a chicken shit and tell the man you love him. Nothing will happen besides you will be together, get married and end up like me.\"\n\n\"That's not real comforting right now.\" Dominique said with a worried expression.\n\n\"You know what I mean. He's a good guy and you are a great girl. You two deserve each other and I need his Italian ass to get back here with doctors!\" \n\nAs soon as those words escaped her lips, a team of nurses rushed out to the car and helped her out of the car. Dominique followed right behind them as another car pulled right behind Nik's. Scott rushed out barely shutting off the car running to her side.\n\n\"I'm here baby.\" He quickly said.\n\n\"About time, my water broke, I'm having your baby, and I had to listen to these two beat around the bush.\" She said as the rushed her inside. \n\nDominique and Nik were following until one of the nurse held up their hands, \"We are going have to ask you two to wait in the waiting room and could you please move those cars from the front.\" And with that she closed the door in front of them. \n\nThey both stood there looking at the door before one of the nurses stuck their hand out and handed Nik Scott's keys. Dominique took a deep breath and Nik turned around heading to the front.\n\n\"Nik please, I really want to talk to you.\" She said and he stopped in his track.\n\n\"What is it Dominique?\" he sighed.\n\n\"Didn't you hear what Katrina said?\"\n\n\"Yea, I heard what she said, but I want to hear it from you. Until then, I didn't hear anything.\" He was about to walk away and something welled up in Dominique's throat and she thought that this could be the last time she had this opportunity.\n\n\"I don't want Jason. I want you.\" She finally said and he stopped in his track, \"I was afraid. I was afraid that if I allow myself to be with you that everything will repeat itself and I will end up getting hurt by you. I was even scared that the same thing that happened to my mom would happen to me, especially since I loved you so much. \"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"I'm not scared anymore. I want to start this right between you and me. I want the whole package with you. \"Dominique said and took a deep breath as he stood in that spot unmoved, \"Please, I want to be with you. I love you.\" There was that silence again.\n\nHe sighed, \"Come here, mia bella.\" He said and \n\nDominique breathed a sigh of relief and felt tears as she felt a whole weight being lifted off her.\n\nShe walked into his arms and felt them wrap around her. She felt that same secure feeling she always felt in his arms. She looked up at him and was meet with his lips. She leaned into the kiss, pulling him closer to her. \n\n\"I love you.\" She said briefly pulling away from his sinful mouth.\n\n\"I love you too. Siete per sempre nel mio cuore\" He said pressing his forehead against hers.\n\nShe sighed, \"You're in my heart too.\" She said and he looked up at her in shock.\n\n\"Someone has been brushing up on their Italian?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to have an Italian family so I might as well.\" He laughed as he kissed her again.\n\nDominique hugged him close as she finally felt her whole life coming together. She finally made some peace and got her life back in order and the best part about it was, it was the way she wanted it to be. \n\nA couple of months passed and Dominique was at the office, packing it up. There was a twinge of sadness about finally leaving the place, but she was happy that she sold it to a friend of Gale's that wanted to open up her clothing boutique here. For a moment Dominique thought about keeping the place as her new office, but she made a promise to get rid of all the old stuff and she was really looking forward to working from home. Speaking of home, she and Nik were also in the process of moving in with each other in a nice little loft that he found. \n\nShe has been letting everything flow and not overanalyzing everything with Nik. Her mom and Aunt Crystal of course loved him. Her brothers gave him a hard time but they were really liked him too. It didn't even matter, the important thing was what was going on between the two of them and she was more excited about the news she had for him. \n\n\"Hey baby.\" She heard as a pair of arms wrapped around her and she giggled.\n\n\"I hope this is someone I know.\" She joked.\n\n\"Oh you better believe you know me.\" He said slapping her butt.\n\nShe turned around in his embrace and gave him a brief kiss, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I just thought I would come for a visit and steal away a kiss.\" He said kissing her again, \"So, how did it go at the doctor?\" he asked looking through one of the boxes.\n\n\"Well, I was fine with just one little problem.\"\n\n\"What? What's going on?\" he quickly said looking over at her with concerned etched on his face.\n\n\"Well, it looks like we may have a little roommate with us in our new place.\" His eyebrows wrinkled in confusion and then they widen.\n\n\"You're kidding right?\" he smiled and she shook her head, \"I'm actually going to be a father?\" she nodded.\n\nHe rushed over to her and enveloped her in a huge hug, \"Oh baby, I can't believe that you are having my baby.\"\n\n\"You should after all those times.\" She smiled.\n\n\"Yea, well maybe you found out my master plan.\" He joked, \"Oh mama is going to kill me but it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"Why would she kill you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Hey I'm Italian, most of us believe in the whole marriage and then the babies.\"\n\n\"Oh normally I do too. Hint.\" She smiled. \n\n\"Yea, don't worry about that part. Let's get past the move in thing first and also Jade's wedding. You know she will be pissed off if you steal her shine.\"\n\n\"I can't steal her shine, I'm doing the wedding.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jason and Candi called, they want to know when we are coming to visit them.\"\n\n\"Oh, so they finally got settled in Atlanta?\"\n\n\"Yea, I told him I would talk it over with you about when we can go.\" \n\nDominique was about to say something but was interrupted her phone. Oh the last call she would take as a therapist, she thought with a smile. She picked up the phone.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hey Doctor, it's me.\" She instantly picked up on the accent.\n\n\"Mr. Adlam, what a surprise. Did you get my message about me leaving the therapy business?\"\n\n\"I did, but I wanted to call you one more time for a little more information, nothing big.\" \n\nDominique plopped down in her chair, \"Alright I guess this one can be for free.\"\n\nShe heard his hearty laughter over the phone which made her smile, \"I'm going to be coming into town soon on business and I plan on staying.\"\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\n\"I already got advice from her sister, but I need advice from a therapist stand point.\"\n\nDominique settled back in her seat, \"On what Mr. Adlam?\"\n\n\"I want to know what I need to do to get my Gale back.\""
