        "Kevyn was physically and emotionally drained. It occurred to her that two things happened that night, when her mother died a life ended but when she finally publicly acknowledged what Patrick was to her, a life had begun, theirs; but she was much too tired and sad to think beyond that thought, there was still the funeral to plan and to get through.\n\nAs soon as the papers were signed Patrick led Kevyn to the car, he would have carried her if she would have let him. The ride back to the hotel was quiet with the exception of Kevyn sniffling in an attempt not to cry anymore. Her mother wouldn't have wanted her to be sad for too long but she missed her, she would miss the Sunday afternoon phone calls while they watched the cooking channel at the same time and talked about how they would change the recipes.\n\nThe next battle would be over her belongings, \"You would thing we're the Ewing's from Dallas with the way you're all arguing over her stuff!\" She snapped during her last visit home. After that the subject didn't come up again. The house was going to Louise and she wasn't going to bend on that point. Louise was the one who lived with their mother and spent many a sleepless night sitting up with her after their father had died and if they didn't like it...\n\n\"Baby, stop thinking ahead.\" Patrick said holding her hand, \"One thing at a time.\" he added.\n\nKevyn gripped his hand so tightly her fingers were going numb. How had she gotten through her father's funeral alone? She wondered as a tear escaped and ran down her cheek. She missed him too, sometimes more times than others but especially now.\n\nShe was his girl, she was the one that would rather stay home and watch a ballgame on TV with him than go out with her friends. Tears flowed in earnest when she remembered how her mom used to complain about the two of them hogging the television on Sunday afternoons so that they could watch sports together but yet she kept them in a steady supply of soda and chips while she did her crossword puzzles. It was then that she realized that she had a connection with her parents that the others didn't. That didn't mean that they weren't loved, they were but her relationship with her parents was.... Different.\n\nAnd now they were both gone but hopefully together in heaven or another dimension. That thought gave her a small measure of comfort as did the thought that in a week or two she could go back to California leaving Clay and his secret behind. Suddenly, she wanted it all to be over with; she wanted to start her life with Patrick. The rapes mattered but didn't matter; he was no longer that man. They mattered because they were horrible and they couldn't be discounted but on the other hand they didn't matter in regards to how they felt about each other. She would stake her life on the fact that Patrick couldn't and wouldn't harm another woman like that.\n\nHer head had begun to pound again and she took a deep breath to calm her nerves, she was so tired.\n\n********\n\nGene stood staring at the phone his loyalties torn. He asked himself what was it that he owed Clay other than for the sizable investment that he was going to make and came to the realization that he was being used and that the money was his thirty pieces of silver. He then thought about Kevyn, she was his sister and that alone should have trumped any sense of loyalty that he felt toward Clay but yet he was still hesitating. He walked away from the phone confident that whatever was going to happen wouldn't happen until after the funeral. It would give him some time to try to talk Clay out of following through with his plan; if he couldn't get him to change his mind then he had a decision to make.\n\n********\n\nPuff Jefferson held the phone in his hand long after Clay hung up. He just didn't get it; Clay had been in love with Kevyn since grade school even though he had been teased as badly as she had been. He had gotten into more fights and had more detentions than any kid in their class and it was always because he was defending Kevyn. The sad thing was that Kevyn had never returned those feelings even though Clay was the only guy paying her any attention until she lost weight and then they came out of the woodwork. Hell, he wanted a taste of her himself but never acted on it, as far as she was concerned, she belonged to Clay then and she belonged to Clay now.\n\nLike Kevyn, Clay never talked about the one date he and Kevyn had. Puff wondered if Clay had gotten impatient with her and tried to force her but he didn't think so, that wasn't Clay's style. He simply was too in love with Kevyn to do that which meant that Kevyn had either seen something or heard something but what? They were on a date and surely Clay wouldn't have.....\n\n\"He wouldn't have been that stupid would he?\" Puff thought to himself, it would explain the orders that he had just gotten but why now? If she had seen or heard something and she hadn't said anything why.... It had to be the man, there could be no other explanation but why not just have the man taken care of? He wondered.\n\nBefore he did anything, he was going to talk to Clay. Of all of the people who worked with Clay he was the only one that could get him to see reason. He didn't want to hurt Kevyn, the man he didn't care about but Gene too? What in the hell was Clay thinking?\n\n*******\n\nClay lay on the bed totally nude, the hooker that he had hired for the night could have been Kevyn with a few differences; Kevyn's voice was soft and melodic where the woman that had just sucked him off had a loud, tinny almost whinny voice. Kevyn's skin was a deeper, richer tone of brown but in the dark the difference wasn't noticeable. The resemblances were all physical, personality wise this woman in no way resembled Kevyn.\n\n\"Honey....\"\n\n\"I told you not to say anything!\" Clay snapped. Her speaking had just destroyed the illusion that he was in bed with the love of his life and wife Kevyn. The illusion shattered, Clay pushed the woman off of the bed.\n\n\"Get dressed!\" he snarled at the confused woman. He reached for his wallet, threw four one-hundred dollar bills on the floor and got out of bed leaving the woman alone in the bedroom to get dressed. By the time he would be finished with his business the woman would be gone, one of his men dropping her off at whichever corner she chose.\n\nHe didn't indulge in the use of prostitutes often and when he did it was because Kevyn was somewhere in the vicinity and he couldn't have her. He didn't feel guilty about it, it was what it was but he wished that it was different and maybe it would have been if he hadn't......\n\nHe pushed the thought out of his mind; Kevyn had never loved him and never told him or given him any indication that he did. At first he thought it was because she thought that he wouldn't amount to anything but he eventually came to realize through her brother Gene that she simply didn't love him. \n\nGene tried to warn him every time he called to tell him that Kevyn was in town.\n\n\"Dude, you need to stop, she doesn't care for you like that.\"\n\nClay would always shut him up choosing to believe that at some point she would change her mind. Now she was fucking some rich white dude.\n\nIt was over.\n\nThe love that he felt for her was the only thing that kept him from making the decision that he made, she was no longer his and no longer under his protection. He still loved her, he always would and every woman he would think about marrying would have to measure up to her-an impossible task.\n\nBut love her or not, her risk to him just rose exponentially, he couldn't trust her not to say anything to her new man if she hadn't already, that's why the both of them had to go. He felt a deep sadness for Kevyn but for Patrick Sinclaire he felt absolutely nothing.\n\n********\n\nPatrick led Kevyn from the car and to the closest elevator holding her tightly against him. When the elevator stopped on their floor they exited not speaking to the people who were waiting to get on. He hurried her to the room and sat her on the bed leaving her long enough to start the bath water running and adding the lavender scented oil to it.\n\nWhen he went back to the room she was sitting in the same spot but she was crying softly and trying not to. She needed to cry and didn't understand her hesitancy to do so. He sat beside her, pulled her into his arms and whispered in her ear, \"you're safe, it's alright to cry.\"\n\nKevyn bit back a sob and then slumped against him and sobbed she knew that she was breaking her promise to her mother but she couldn't help it, she needed to cry and deal with her grief before the funeral. Patrick lifted her from the bed and onto his lap and began to gently rock her as she cried.\n\nAs he rocked her he made a silent promise to her that after this was over, there would be no more pain for her only happiness. When she quieted, he carried her to the bathroom and stripped the both of them with a thought. Still carrying her, Patrick stepped into the tub, sat down and readjusted Kevyn in his lap. His cock hardened as it pressed against her bottom but he ignored it, she needed to be cared for, his own need would wait.\n\n\"Tell me about your parents.\" he said softly suspecting that she had never talked to anyone about them in depth.\n\nShe talked throughout the bath, as Patrick dried her off and carried her back to bed and through the complete head to toe body massage. When she was finished, she was drained but she felt better than she had in a long time.\n\n\"Thank you.\" She whispered as she kissed him.\n\nPatrick returned the kiss deepening it and then pulling back. He didn't want her to think that he was taking advantage of her in her grief.\n\n\"Don't stop.\" Kevyn whispered, \"I need you.\"\n\nThat was all that he needed to hear. He kissed her again moaning when she offered her tongue to him. His mouth left hers and made a slow trail to her neck down to her shoulder and finally to his first stop on her body. A stiffened nipple that was beckoning him to hurry. \n\n\"Kev are you sure that you're ready for this?\" he asked as he salivated just thinking about her nipple in his mouth. \"There's no going back if we do this.\"\n\nThere was the briefest of hesitations but her voice was strong when she replied.\n\n\"I'm sure unless you've....\"\n\nKevyn yelped and then moaned when Patrick's warm mouth enveloped her nipple and greedily sucked on it moaning as it became even harder in his mouth.\n\nKevin wrapped some of his hair in her fingers pulling it when his tongue flicked across the tip of her nipple with just the right pressure. Patrick released the nipple and looked at it still glistening from being in his mouth and then paid homage to the neglected one.\n\nHis hands roamed and touched every place on her body except for one, the space between her legs. Kevyn felt a blast of heat as Patrick's hands explored her and her hands explored him. This is what she had been missing she realized, not just the lovemaking but the feeling of being loved and cared for.\n\nFinally Patrick's hand began to drift down her body, lightly touching in some places more firmly in others until it reached her mound. He ran his fingers through the course hair before slipping a finger between the lips and moving them up and down becoming wet with the juices that flowed from her. He took his fingers from her and brought them to his nose and inhaled deeply closing his eyes in pleasure as he took in her scent.\n\nKevyn watched as Patrick inhaled her scent from his fingers and then smiled as he put his fingers in his mouth and tasted her for the first time. \"You taste so.... Sweet, I... Kevyn....\"\n\nPatrick was at a loss for words as he tried to describe what he was feeling at that moment. Nothing that he could think of even remotely came close to what he wanted to say.\n\n\"Patrick?\" Kevyn called softly \"I love you too.\"\n\nThere it was, those three small words, \"I love you and I didn't want our joining to be when you are in much pain... if you want to stop.....\"\n\n\"I don't want to stop.\" Kevyn said and pulled him down for a kiss, \"make love to me.\" she breathed against his lips, \"please.\"\n\nPatrick knelt between Kevyn's legs and waited, he wanted to give her every opportunity to change her mind. When it didn't come, he moved forward until the tip of his leaking cock was touching her pulsing clit. Both of them moaned at the contact as Patrick massaged her throbbing nub with the tip of his cock before ever so slowly he entered her. \n\nHe had to stop several times as he felt the familiar signs that he was going to come. To distract himself as he waited he talked, telling Kevyn over and over again how beautiful she was and how thankful he was that she claimed and accepted him. When he calmed he would continue his slow entrance into her body constantly looking for any sigh that she wanted to stop or that he was hurting her.\n\nFinally when he was all the way in, he stopped to enjoy the warm tightness of her around his cock. He began to move so slowly that it was almost imperceptible except for the blazing heat that Kevyn felt from her head to her toes. Patrick grabbed her hands and pulled her up so that he could look into her eyes as he made her his mate for all time.\n\nKevyn closed her eyes as her orgasms neared, \"No, please open your eyes.\" Patrick said softly, \"I want you to see how much I love you... are you ready to receive me?\" he asked his voice strained as he fought for control. Patrick knew that she was close and he wanted her to climax first. He bit his lip hard enough that he drew blood, \"Patrick!\" Kevyn screamed as the first orgasm of her mated life washed over her. The moment she screamed his name, Patrick came with his eyes glued to hers both of them crying as their orgasms waned.\n\nKevyn clung to Patrick, she had never felt as loved as she did in that moment, the thought crossed her mind that maybe they shouldn't have done this on the eve of her mother's death but then she realized that this was exactly what her mother would have wanted for her and she let go of the feeling of guilt.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Patrick asked pushing her back so that he could see her face, \"did I hurt you?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, I promise.\" Kevyn said softly, \"so that was it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Unless you want a wedding then the answer is yes, Patrick replied.\n\n\"This is fine for now.\" Kevyn replied yawning.\n\nPatrick eased her back to the bed and slid out of her looking at his cock which was coated with the combination of their fluids. As he settle her in his arms he decided that wedding or not they were going to wear wedding bands, he wanted there to be no question to anyone that she was taken.\n\n\"Welcome to our family Kevyn Sinclaire.\" Patrick murmured against her head.\n\n********\n\nGene was awake all night trying to decide on what he should do. He kept reminding himself that it was a simple decision but he just couldn't make himself decide. The funeral wouldn't be for another two or three days depending on what Queen Kevyn decided he thought with bitterness and then stopped himself. Getting mad at her wasn't going to help anything.\n\nAs he showered and changed his clothes he wondered if he shouldn't try to talk to Clay today. He was about to decide when the phone rang.\n\n\"What time is the family getting together?\" Clay asked.\n\n\"Six but......\"\n\n\"I'll be there.\" Clay said in a tone that Gene recognized all too well, it was the business man talking.\n\n\"I don't think that's a good idea.\" Gene protested.\n\n\"The meeting going to be at the house?\" Clay asked.\n\n\"Yes but....\"\n\n\"Someone home now?\"\n\n\"Yes but Clay I don't think that you should come, it's a family thing and....'\n\n\"Is Patrick Sinclaire going to be there?\" Clay asked sharply.\n\n\"I.... I guess so; he's her significant other as she called him.\"\n\n\"Is he married to her?\"\n\n\"No...\"\n\n\"Then he isn't family, if I can't be there neither can he.\" Clay said, \"Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Well no because....\"\n\n\"I'll see you at six, food will be delivered by five.\"\n\nClay hung up before Gene could say anything. Gene knew what Clay was up to, he wanted to see the man who had managed to get into Kevyn's heart and bed. He thought of calling her to warn her but thought better of it; Clay was going to show up anyway.\n\n******\n\nKevyn spent the first half of the morning on the phone with the funeral home.\n\n\"What do you mean that she had no insurance?\" she asked shocked, \"Of course she did! It's with the same company that dad had! Let me call you back.\"\n\nKevyn called the insurance company next.\n\n\"When did it lapse?\" she asked, \"ok, thanks.\"\n\n\"Sweetheart let me help.\" Patrick said taking the phone from her hands.\n\n\"I can't ask you to do that and besides I have enough saved to pay for it.\" she replied.\n\n\"That's the money that you've been saving for your condo.\" Patrick said.\n\n\"Yeah well this is more important than that.\" Kevyn said and reached for the phone.\n\n\"Kevyn part of being married or mates is knowing that you can depend on someone to be there for you in whatever capacity that you need whether it's as a lover, friend or someone to scream at. I get the feeling that Lonnie was none of those things but I'm not Lonnie, I will never leave you to suffer alone and your family is now mine, let me help.\"\n\nKevyn blinked back tears, Patrick was right. Lonnie hadn't been any of the things that he had mentioned and he certainly was nothing like him but old habits died hard.\n\n\"I'll pay for the flowers.\" She said.\n\n\"Kevyn... alright.\" he said giving in when he saw the determination on her face. \"Let's call the funeral home back but let's not mention to the family how it was paid for, your brother already has issues with me.\" \n\nAn hour later the service was paid for except for the casket and headstone. Patrick gave the funeral director strict instructions that the insurance policy and anything financial was not to be mentioned to the family.\n\n\"I'll be covering the cost of the services.\" he said, \"yes and thank you.\"\n\nKevyn had already ordered the flowers which wouldn't cause a problem; she ordered her mother's favorite flowers, roses and carnations.\n\n\"I'll call you in the morning with the date and time of the services.\" Kevyn said before hanging up.\n\nWhile she made other calls including to her landlord who surprisingly was sympathetic telling her that she could pay the rent when she returned. Kevyn thanked him profusely and made her next call which was to work. Patrick watched her as she made her calls amazed that the beautiful woman on the phone was really his.\n\nHe dialed Ethan's number and as he waited for him to pick up wondered where Kevyn would want to live. There was also her school schedule to work out and her job....\n\n\"Patrick? Are you alright?\" Ethan asked, \"We were starting to get worried about you.\"\n\n\"I'm fine; I'm in Pittsburgh with Kevyn, her mother died last night.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, how is she?\"\n\n\"All things considered? She's alright... we mated last night.\"\n\n\"You did?\" Ethan asked surprised.\n\n\"Yes and Ethan? It was and she was and is amazing!\"\n\n\"Congratulations!\" Ethan said and meaning it, \"when can we expect you home?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure yet.\" Patrick replied, \"We have some things to take care of after the service why what's happening?\"\n\n\"The girls are mated as well.\" Ethan replied.\n\n\"The girls are mated? Ethan that's wonderful! When's the wedding?\"\n\n\"Two weeks, do you think that you'll be back?\"\n\n\"I hope to be back before then; I want you all to meet Kevyn before a big family gathering like a wedding.\n\n\"Just keep us posted and is it alright to tell everyone?\"\n\n\"Sure, but tell them not to call until after the service, we've got a rough ride ahead of us.\" Patrick replied.\n\n\"Anything that you need help with?\" \n\n\"No, we're good, look I have to go; I'll talk to you soon.\" Patrick said when he saw that Kevyn was starting to get dressed.",
        "\"What are you doing?\" as he approached her.\n\n\"Getting dressed,\" she replied not noticing the gleam in his eyes.\n\n\"We haven't made love yet.\" Patrick said taking the tee shirt from her hands.\n\n\"Yes we did,\" Kevyn said, \"before we got up.\"\n\n\"That was hours ago.\" Patrick replied as he pulled her to him by the waistband of her jeans.\n\n********\n\nGene got to his mother's house early. Louise had already started making room for the food that she knew was coming. Although she never said anything, she didn't like Clay, she never had but when he called to say to make room for food what was she supposed to do?\n\nGene's showing up early was a mixed blessing, he would help her get ready but he would also talk badly about Kevyn and her man would be added to the mix. Louise didn't know who Patrick Sinclaire was but she did know money when she saw it and wondered how Gene was handling it.\n\n\"You doing alright?\" she asked and then wished that she hadn't.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he snapped, \"We let her kill mom and now she's got this .....Man who thinks that he can just walk in her and act like king to her queen!\"\n\n\"What is wrong with you?\" Louise asked, \"She's only doing what we asked her to do and we didn't even ask. She's right when she says that we made her the family toilet....\"\n\n\"Oh I get it!\" Gene interrupted, \"You're on her side since you're getting the house...\"\n\nLouise stared at her brother; she had known that he could be petty and jealous she just didn't realize how bad he really was.\n\n\"You want the house?\" she asked heatedly, \"is that what this is about because Kevyn is giving me the damned house?\"\n\n\"No.....\"\n\n\"You know what? You can have it! I'm sick of the drama and I'm sick of Pittsburgh! After the dust clears I'm going to ask Kevyn about going back with her so take the damned house and I hope that you're happy here.\" she said slamming down a glass so hard that it shattered cutting her hand.\n\n\"Shit sis, I'm sorry!\" Gene said as he ran for a towel. Juliet arrived a few minutes later and took in the scene.\n\n\"What happened here?\" she asked not seeing that Louise was bleeding at first. When she noticed she gasped, \"Let me see.\" she said dropping her purse on the floor. \"Lou you need stitches, that's a pretty deep cut.\"\n\n\"I'll be fine.\" Louise said standing up.\n\n\"Lou.... \"\n\n\"I'm not going back to that hospital!\" She all but screamed.\n\n\"Alright just calm down.\" Juliet said softly. \"Gene there's a first aide kit in my car go get it please.\" \n\nGene met the caterer on the way out, \"Go on in.\" he grumbled. He felt responsible for Louise's accident, he hadn't realized just how on edge she was and he with his jealousy and temper had inadvertently pushed her over the edge. \n\nKevyn and Patrick arrived as he was getting the first aide kit from the trunk of Juliet's car.\n\n\"Who's hurt?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"Louise cut her hand.....\"\n\nKevyn and Patrick took off toward the house leaving Gene talking to the wind.\n\n\"Lou?\" Kevyn called as soon as she was in the house, \"what happened?\"\n\n\"I cut my hand on the glass is all, I'm fine.\" \n\n\"She needs stitches....\"\n\n\"I am not going back there! Just wrap it up and it'll be fine.\" Louise said her anxiety level rising.\n\n\"Let me look at it.\" Kevyn said removing the towel. \"Lou it's pretty deep.\"\n\n\"I'm not going!\" Louise said crying.\n\nPatrick sat next to her, \"Louise, may I look at your hand?\"\n\n\"I suppose you used to be a doctor?\" Gene asked snidely.\n\n\"No I wasn't but I was a paramedic at one time.\" Patrick replied absently as he examined Louise's hand. \"I need gauze, antiseptic and Louise it's going to burn like hell, 2x2s or 4x4s or whatever you have and some tape.\"\n\nAs Patrick cleansed and dressed the cut he gave the healing process a little boost. \"Keep it dry and change it immediately if it gets wet.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much! I don't mean to be a baby but I just can't go back there.\" Louise said.\n\n\"I understand.\" Patrick said with a smile.\n\n*********\n\nClay pulled up behind a car that was obviously a rental; it didn't belong to any of the family which meant that it belonged to Patrick Sinclaire. He adjusted his glasses on his face, picked up the huge bouquet of flowers that he bought for Kevyn and then the smaller bouquets he bought for her sisters and headed toward the house.\n\nHe tapped on the door and walked in before anyone gave permission for him to enter. He looked around the room for Kevyn and made a beeline for her when he saw her.\n\n\"Kevyn, I'm so sorry for your loss.\" he said as he presented her with the bouquet of flowers. As he bent down to kiss her cheek he felt rather than heard someone beside him.\n\n\"Mr. Robinson.\" Patrick said smoothly, \"It was generous of you to provide the food for the evening.\"\n\n\"It's my pleasure.\" Clay replied just as smoothly as Patrick, \"I'm sure that Kevyn told you that we go way back, as a matter of fact we went all the way through school together.\"\n\n\"It's always nice to meet a friend of Kevyn's.\" Patrick replied before turning to Kevyn. \"Sweetheart, are you ready to start?\"\n\nGene watched the interaction between Clay and Patrick with interest. Both men were about the same height and build, if there was a fight, either of them could win but his money was on Clay. Patrick Sinclaire was too much of a pretty boy to be any good in a fight in spite of the bravado that he was showing with Clay.\n\nKevyn watched the two men and decided to end it before it even started. She knew what Clay was up to; he wanted to know exactly where he stood with her which was the same place that he had always stood. Nowhere.\n\n\"Excuse my manners, \"she said as she stood up and took Patrick's hand. \"Clay this is Patrick Sinclaire my significant other soon to be husband, Patrick this is Clay Robinson and as he said we go way back starting in grade school. Now can we get started?\" \n\nEveryone was watching and listening waiting to see what Clay would say or do. \n\nClay was seeing red but hid his anger, not even he would be disrespectful to a family in mourning but after the funeral....\n\n\"Alright here's what I've done.\" Kevyn said, \"I've ordered the spray in mom's favorite flowers- red roses and white carnations, the ribbon will say mother on it unless someone has another idea.\"\n\nShe waited a few minutes and continued.\n\n\"I also called Pastor Brown to ask if he would give the sermon and....\"\n\n\"Excuse me Kevyn.\" Clay said smoothly, \"I'm sure that Pastor Brown is a good messenger of god but I can ask Pastor....\"\n\n\"Thank you but Pastor Brown is a friend of the family and he's already accepted.\" Kevyn said.\n\n\"When is the service?\" Gene asked.\n\n\"Today is Tuesday so it's Thursday which means that we need to get over the funeral home tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"I picked out her clothes.\" Louise said softly.\n\n\"And I have the programs made out.\" Juliet said, \"Barbara called and said that she would be here by tomorrow night.\"\n\nAs the planning continued Patrick was very aware that he was being sized up by Clay. He felt the man's anger when Kevyn introduced him as he significant other and future husband but underneath the anger Patrick also sensed another emotion, the man loved Kevyn and always had.\n\nThe planning of the funeral was over by nine, after hearing people argue for almost an hour, Kevyn put her foot down and said that they would follow the same program that they had used for their father. Patrick noticed that it was always Gene who led the discussions that caused the problem. He looked from Gene to Clay and then back at Gene again realizing that they shared a connection. Once again his gaze rested on Clay who stared at him with hostility in his eyes.\n\nSomeone was going to die.\n\n********\n\nPuff paced. He was in a quandary over what he should do. In all of his time with Clay he had never second guessed him; he had always done what needed to be done, but this.... It was wrong. He had tried to talk to Clay about it, tried to appeal to the love that he knew that Clay still had for Kevyn but to no avail.\n\n\"She's a threat!\" Clay said his tone sharp.\n\n\"I don't think so.\" Puff replied, \"She would have told about whatever it is that you're so afraid of by now.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of anything!\" Clay protested.\n\n\"Then leave her be.\" Puff advised, \"If you leave her alone, she'll leave you alone.\"\n\nBut Clay didn't buy it, \"What if she tells that rich man of hers?\" he asked \"then I'm in deep shit and I'm not losing everything because of that night!\"\n\n\"Clay, we're friends right? I mean we've been through it together.\" Puff said, \"Tell me what happened that night, maybe it isn't as bad as you think.\"\n\n\"I.... I can't.\" Clay said and walked away.\n\nPuff had to agree with Gene; Clay should have just accepted the fact that Kevyn didn't love him. The other thing that he didn't understand was Gene. How could he choose Clay over his own flesh and blood? As he struggled to understand Gene's decision he understood something else, as long as Clay lived Kevyn wouldn't be left in peace. But could he kill the man that had taken him in and sobered him up when everyone else had given up on him? He didn't know. He could only hope that Clay came to his senses and that he wouldn't have to choose between him and Kevyn.\n\n*******\n\nIt was well after two before the discussion about their mother's possessions ended. Once again Gene was at the center of the controversy throwing a wrench into the works when things were seemingly solved and once again Kevyn took charge and ended the arguments.\n\n\"This is the way it's going to happen, we go to the funeral home tomorrow morning or I guess I should say this morning to pick out the casket, come back here and start packing up her stuff, if you see something that you want take it, if more than one of you wants it work it out.\n\nI refuse to play King Solomon to a bunch of adults\" Kevyn said. \"As to the house itself it goes to Louise......\"\n\n\"Why her?\" Gene asked,\" and what about Barbara?\"\n\n\"Mom wanted Lou to have the house and I agree especially since she was responsible.....\n\nPatrick wasn't listening; he was watching Clay and not liking what he was seeing. He wished that there was a way that he could be out during the day to keep Kevyn safe but there was no way that he could do it; he had to trust someone else with Kevyn's safety.\n\n*******\n\nClay knew that Patrick was watching him and he didn't care, in a couple of days Patrick Sinclaire and Kevyn.....\n\nHe was distracted by Gene calling his name.\n\n\"Clay we have to talk.\"\n\nThere was really nothing to talk about but Clay indulged him.\n\nThe two men slipped outside and walked a short distance away from the house.\n\n\"What?\" Clay asked.\n\n\"Look, I don't care about him but I'm asking you as a friend to leave Kevyn alone.\"\n\nClay pretended to take Gene's request under consideration, \"Let me think on it.\" he said and then walked to his car.\n\n********\n\nKevyn was exhausted. She had run herself ragged trying to get ready for the services. The only real help that she had came from Patrick and Louise. She knew that Louise wanted to talk to her but she had been too busy to find out what she wanted to talk about. Of all of her siblings she was the closest to Louise simply because between the two of them they took care of their mother. When the dust was settled after the funeral, she would pull Louise aside and talk to her.\n\nNow the day of the funeral was here. Everything was set to go including where the repast would be held, there wouldn't be too many people there other than the family and the few family members that had bothered to give their condolences. Patrick did all that he could to help her relax including massages and making love to her until he was sure that she would sleep soundly but she was always awake a couple of hours later.\n\nHe knew that she was nervous about the services, she had to speak but as the time passed he realized that it was something else that was disturbing her and he wondered what it was.\n\n\"I know that you're grieving and maybe that's why you aren't resting but is there something else bothering you?\"\n\nKevyn bit her lip, for the first time she wanted to tell someone about that night with Clay but she wasn't sure if she should. She knew that she was still alive only because Clay had feelings for her but now there was Patrick. If she told him then he would be in danger too and he would want to do something about it.\n\n\"I'm alright.\" she replied.\" just anxious about the service.\" which was the truth.\n\nPatrick stroked her arm and kissed her forehead before speaking.\n\n\"I told you that part of being mates is to help each other in whatever capacity that's needed. The same goes for trust and safety. I want and need to keep you safe but I can't do that if you won't tell me what it is that you're afraid of.\" Patrick said, \"And you need to know something else, if I have to go into your head to keep you safe I will.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't.....\"\n\n\"I would.\" Patrick said firmly. \"You say that it's nerves because of the service, I'll buy that but not entirely but Kevyn at some point you're going to have to tell me about Clay.\"\n\n\"I never slept with him if that's what you mean.\" Kevyn said wanting to change the subject.\n\n\"That isn't what I meant and it wouldn't matter if you did.\" Patrick replied. \"What I do mean is this, he has feelings for you anyone can see that but he also wants to harm you and my question is why?\"\n\nWhen Kevyn didn't answer Patrick let the subject drop, she now knew that he knew that there was something she was keeping back from him.\n\n********\n\nTime was running out and Gene still hadn't decided on what to do about Clay and Kevyn. Once again he asked himself why he found the decision so hard to make. He owed Clay Robinson absolutely nothing! Clay hadn't even made the promised investment and now Gene was wondering if he ever meant to and then realized with a certainty that he hadn't. Clay had been using him all of this time as a way to get close to Kevyn and if he wasn't going to give him the investment then everything that Clay promised him was a lie.\n\nThe thought that he had been used was what tipped the odds in Kevyn's favor. Gene picked up the phone and dialed Kevyn's number and got a busy signal.\n\n*********\n\nPuff agonized long and hard over what Clay wanted him to do. If he didn't do it, Clay would get someone who would and then would send that person after him. He thought about trying to talk to Clay again but changed his mind, Clay's mind was made up and he wouldn't change it even if it was the right thing to do. It had to do with Clay's belief that to change one's mind showed weakness.\n\nPuff knew something else too, Clay was very wrong about Patrick Sinclaire. He watched him for a short while the evening before and even from where he stood he could see and feel the sheer power that radiated from the man. Patrick Sinclaire was no one to fuck with and that's exactly what they were planning to do. And if they hurt or killed Kevyn and didn't kill him there would be no place that he or Clay could go that they wouldn't be found.\n\nThe funeral services were in six hours, the planned hit on Kevyn and her man was scheduled for the next night. Clay was strict about not taking a life during a funeral service saying that it was bad karma.\n\n********\n\nClay looked at the woman who resembled Kevyn. This time he taped her mouth closed so that she wouldn't talk ruining the illusion that he was with Kevyn. A pang of sorrow hit him as the thought about what he wanted done but it couldn't be helped and he wasn't going to change his mind no matter how much he wanted to.\n\nHe wouldn't survive prison and if Kevyn had to die so that she wouldn't talk then so be it. Patrick he simply didn't like and it wasn't just because he was fucking Kevyn, it was the confidence that he Clay could only hope to emulate. Every time Patrick's blue eyes landed on his own brown ones, Clay had to fight the urge to turn away. He wanted people to feel that anxiety when he looked at them and to some extent they did but Patrick had something that he was lacking in- true power. As he told the woman to get up and get dressed, Clay found himself wishing that he could harness the power that he sensed coming from Patrick for himself.\n\n*********\n\nThe Funeral\n\nThe family gathered at the small funeral home for the private viewing before the actual service. Since it was too early for Patrick to be able to attend he hired a car and driver for Kevyn and gave the man explicit orders.\n\n\"You are not to let her out of your sight for even a moment...\"\n\n\"Does he have to go to the bathroom with me too?\" Kevyn asked exasperated. She tried to tell Patrick that she would be fine but he was taking no chances.\n\n\"He doesn't have to go to the bathroom with you but other than that you have to stay within his line of vision.\"\n\n\"Just what do you think is going to happen?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"Probably nothing.....\"\n\n\"So why the guard?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"As I was saying\" Patrick said patiently, \"probably nothing but I just want to be sure... I don't trust Clay Robinson.\"\n\n\"Patrick let me tell you about Clay Robinson, he's very superstitious, he wouldn't so much as drop a candy wrapper in the chapel without thinking that something bad was going to happen to him. A funeral is sacred to him; if you want to keep me safe just take me somewhere where there are back to back funerals.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But Luke still goes with you and I'll be there right at six.\" Patrick said.\n\nIt was now five thirty and they had all said goodbye several times when the first sympathizer walked in. Clay looked around the small chapel looking for Patrick and was surprised not to see him hovering around Kevyn. He walked toward the casket where Kevyn was standing stroking her mother's hand.\n\nShe jumped when she felt arms go around her and for just a second she relaxed back against the body behind her and then froze just as Luke seemed to come from nowhere. Kevyn pulled away and then spun around furious that Clay would lay hands on her like that.\n\n\"I was just giving you a friendly sympathy hug.\" Clay said ignoring Luke. \"Where's your man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Right behind you.\" Patrick said his rage barely concealed.\n\nClay turned to face Patrick, started to make a retort but instead walked away. He was wrong; he shouldn't have touched Kevyn like that. This was a sacred event and not one to be trifled with as he had just done. He made his way to the back of the chapel, sat down and reached inside of his shirt to pull out the cross that had been his mother's and began to pray that nothing bad happened to him.\n\nPatrick pulled Kevyn aside and looked her up and down.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm fine he just caught me by surprise.\" Kevyn replied as she stepped into Patrick's embrace. \n\n\"Excuse me Kevyn.\" Juliet said softly \"but is it alright to let the others mourners in?\"\n\n\"It's fine.\" Kevyn replied still holding on Patrick. All she could really think of was going back home to California with Patrick. After this if Gene wanted to make the family decisions he could do it and with her blessing. \n\nPatrick led Kevyn to a seat that was next to her sister Louise and sat on the other side of her. He took Kevyn's cold hand in his while she held Lou's hand with her free one. What surprised her was how many people came to the funeral leading her to wonder where these people were when he mother needed a friend just to have a cup of coffee with.\n\nIt almost nauseated her to hear the sobs coming from people who hadn't spoken to her mother or anyone in her family since her father died. The pastor made stood up front when the time came and began the service.\n\n\"Here lies a woman of god.....\"\n\nKevyn wasn't listening; she was trying to formulate what she was going to say. Clay was the furthest thing from her mind, what she knew about him was even further away as she heard the minister call her name.",
        "\"Go on baby.\" Patrick whispered fully understanding her nervousness. \"Just look at me.\"\n\nAn hour later the service was over and they were headed to the cemetery. Patrick stood watch over Kevyn and Louise as the minister began the Lord's Prayer. Soon everyone including Patrick was reciting the prayer with him; he held Kevyn's hand in one and Louise's hand in the other as they approached the casket and placed flowers on it.\n\nPatrick felt protective of Louise and he wasn't sure of why except that she looked so lost and afraid. \"It will be alright.\" he assured her when they were standing back in their places.\n\nKevyn soon found out why so many came to the service, word had gotten out about where the repast was going to be. People were using her mother's funeral as a way to get a night out at a nice restaurant. She was furious as she heard the murmurings about the food served at the hotel restaurant.\n\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Patrick said, \"It doesn't matter.\"\n\n*******\n\nClay repeated his prayer for forgiveness several times and said the Lord's Prayer in earnest but even so, he hadn't changed his mind about Kevyn and Patrick. He headed to the car planning to go to the repast too. Something warned him that he should go home but he pushed the warning aside.\n\nThe dinner was over by nine with the family and Clay being the last to leave. Gene left a good ten minutes before anyone else in the family followed by Juliet and their brother then Louise then Clay with Patrick and Kevyn bringing up the rear. As soon as they were outside, Patrick tensed and shouted \"DOWN!\" as he grabbed Kevyn and pulled her into his body as he spun around.\n\nThe sound of a single gunshot echoed through the silence of the night immediately followed by a cry of deep pain."
