        "The long drive back from my parent's farm was made even longer because Edie was miserable. She couldn't take the long-distance relationship with Kenny any longer. And though they'd had a nice Easter weekend with the family, Kenny had hesitated when Edie talked to him about their future. He had a lot to lose, including his pension. But he was on the verge of losing the most important thing, Edie herself. She was convinced he didn't love her, that she was just a fling and that she'd never see him again. I knew better. She was his queen, in the same way Shavonda was mine. But he needed to let her know that, and so far, he hadn't. Shavonda and Shaunice were already plotting on how they were going to emasculate him next time they saw him. Edie was more than just a friend, she was almost family. They'd grown up with her, shared her triumphs, nursed her through the bad times. Now she was hurt, and as far as they were concerned, the man who did it was going to pay dearly. \n\nI knew I had to do something, but it would have to wait until we got home.\n\nWe stopped for dinner in late afternoon at Aunt Baby's. It was Shaunice's first time there. The staff remembered us, and remarked that every time we stopped in, there were more of us. It was true. Our little group was now up to 9 people including the kids. After dinner, we hit the road. The food had cheered Edie up a little, and Shaunice was impressed as well.\n\nArriving back in Pittsburgh just before dark, we quickly unloaded the trailer before dropping Shaunice and Edie off at their homes and picking up the kids from James and Althea. Once we got them tucked into bed, I could put the call off no longer. I dialed Kenny's number.\n\n\"Hey man,\" I said to him, \"What did you say to Edie this morning? She's been crying all day.\"\n\nThere was a long pause on the other end of the line. \"I, uhhh, told her I couldn't quit my job,\" he said. \"She seemed to understand.\"\n\n\"Kenny, she thinks you don't love her.\" I was getting angry now. \"She thinks you were just using her for sex. You're going to lose her if you don't do something, man!\"\n\n\"I can't lose her, Jason,\" he said sadly. \"She means the world to me. But I'm in a bind here. Do I give up my friends and family to be with her?\"\n\n\"How would you give up your family, Kenny?\" I was almost yelling at him now. \"You know you'd always be welcome in all our houses. And if you did move up here to be with her, you'd have Von and me. You wouldn't be alone. Think of her, Kenny. All she's got is her mother. She can't leave her behind. Her mother has no other living family. And her job prospects are slim to nothing down there.\"\n\n\"She works for a bank, Jason. We have banks here too, you know!\" Kenny was making excuses for not making the move he was afraid to make. \"It isn't like she can't get a job as a teller.\"\n\n\"And you can get a job pumping gas, Kenny,\" I said. \"That's the equivalent of what you are asking her to do. She works as a supervisor, with several auditors under her. Kenny, that's a headquarters job. Do you have any bank headquarters where you live?\"\n\n\"No,\" he sighed. \n\n\"You're suggesting she move away from her mother, and give up a position she's worked years to get, just so she can start over at the bottom as a branch teller.\" I tried to explain the situation as simply as I could. \"All this, to move into an unfamiliar area where she knows nobody. She's not going to do that, Kenny. Would you?\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do, Jason?\"\n\n\"For starters, call her and apologize. Tell her how much she means to you. Then show her. Start looking for jobs up here. You're a surveyor with eleven years' experience, for god sakes. The city, the county, and Penndot all need people with your qualifications. And that's not counting the jobs in the private sector. Didn't you tell me last year they offered you a buyout?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, they did.\"\n\n\"Then find out if the offer still stands. Maybe you can still get a partial pension when the time comes. But that's 30 years away. And you can have enough time for a pension up here. In the meantime, wouldn't they offer you at least a year's salary to leave?\" I was starting to see a possible solution to the problem. \"You'd have enough money to move and put a down payment on a nice house for your queen and you to live in. You can't lose her, Kenny. Not only will the two of you be miserable without each other, you'll also incur the wrath of Von's family. Don't blow this, Kenny. You have a shot at happiness with a good woman. She wants you, Kenny. She wants you bad. Don't disappoint her.\"\n\nI hung up the phone, not realizing Shavonda had been listening the whole time. \"Do you think you got through to him?\" she asked.\n\n\"I hope so,\" I said. \"He wasn't trying to hurt her. I know him. He wouldn't have put the time and effort into being with her if she was just a fling. He could get that right where he is, without having to travel. No, Von, he loves her deeply. He's just scared.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Shavonda said softly. \"But it still hurts to see Edie like that.\"\n\nI hoped things would turn out well. But in the meantime, I decided to wait and see what Kenny would do. The ball was in his court now. We had a life to live, and the next month was going to be stressful. \n\nFirst up. The sentencing hearing for Officer Shoemacher. Shavonda was entitled to give a victim's statement, but since he wasn't charged with writing the false tickets and harassment he did on me, all I could do was be there for my wife. She was a very strong woman, and there was no way she would decline to give her statement, even if I weren't there. But I wanted to show my support for what she was doing. To be honest, it was yet another thing to add to the list of things I loved about her. The hearing would be the Friday before Mother's Day. It would be the final court date in a string that we had endured for almost 3/4 of the time we'd been together. Finally, the ordeal with Rose, and all its fallout, would be over. We were looking forward to peace at last.\n\nMother's Day was going to be a bit lonely. Barbara had asked if we minded her taking the kids to Muncy to see Rose. It was her weekend to see them anyway. We had no objection with them seeing their birth mother, they needed to see and understand who she was, and Rose I am sure needed to see them as well. Ironically, the kids had taken to calling Shavonda 'Mama Von' some time ago. That pleased her to no end. \"They really do love me,\" she said. \n\n\"Why wouldn't they?\" I asked. \"You've been their mother since we took custody of them. And they've come to trust you even more than they do me. I know they tell you things they'd never tell me.\"\n\nOn top of all that, we still had a party to plan. Our first anniversary, and the family reunion we'd promised to start, was less than a month away. Darren and Minnie had agreed to DJ the party, as they had our wedding reception. We also had hoped to have the instruments set up outside so we could play a few songs for the guests. But the Kenny and Edie situation was going to complicate things. If they didn't patch things up, we might be without a guitar player. As a contingency plan, Shavonda and I decided to learn a few more songs, ones that could reasonably be performed with just bass and keyboards. \n\nAfter that, in June, we had both Brittany's seventh birthday, and Shavonda's class reunion. Maybe after all that was over, we could take a week or so off and go camping somewhere. I know I needed a break. Luckily, I still had a few days' vacation time left, and the first of July, I'd get two more weeks added to that. No, make that three weeks. I'd have been on the job for five years, and qualified for an extra week.\n\nBack at work, the runs were getting heavy with the summer season fast approaching. Since I delivered builder's supplies to lumber yards, the summer season was always busy, with the truck loaded to capacity and up to 12 stops a day. That meant I would be working longer hours, and as a result I was extra tired.\n\nThursday, I did my normal run to State College, but this year a twist had been added. During the slow time of the winter, Lewistown had been added to my run. With only six or seven stops, the added mileage was no problem. But now that things were getting busier, the run over the Seven Mountains to Lewistown could be a problem. As it turned out, the added stop pushed me to the very limits of my hours of service. \n\nArriving home from work after 14 hours on the road, plus the commute home, I walked into a crisis. Edie was there when I arrived, and she was not well. She sat at the kitchen table with Shavonda, Tamika, and Shaunice, tearfully babbling incoherently, an almost finished bottle of E&J on the table in front of her. I felt bad for her. She was mourning the apparent loss of Kenny. He had tried to call her several times, but she wasn't answering either his calls or his texts. \n\nIn utter frustration, I whipped out my phone, and video recorded Edie without her knowledge. Shavonda caught me in the act after I'd gotten a couple minutes of footage, and angrily pulled me by the arm into the living room. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" she hissed.\n\n\"Somebody has got to show Kenny what he's done to that poor girl,\" I said. \"He needs to see with his own eyes what he's done to her.\" Before she could stop me, I'd sent a text to Kenny and attached the video. Shavonda glared at me. \n\n\"Why would you embarrass her like that?\" she hissed angrily. \"Hasn't she been through enough?\"\n\nBack in the kitchen, Shaunice and Tamika were plotting revenge on Kenny if he dared show up at our anniversary/reunion party. I told them to let things shake out over the next couple weeks before they took action.\n\nIt didn't take long to get a response from Kenny. As I answered the phone, I handed it to Edie. \"Talk to the man,\" I said. \"He's been trying to talk to you for days.\" We all left the kitchen so Edie could have some privacy.\n\nWe'd just sat down when we heard the crash from the kitchen. Rushing into the room, I found Edie sobbing hysterically, a broken window in the back door, and what was left of my phone outside on the back patio. Edie had thrown it through the window.\n\n\"You don't need him,\" Shaunice said to Edie angrily. \"You know all he wanted was a taste of chocolate. Now that he's had it, he's probably replaced you with some white girl.\"\n\nI was tired. Exhausted from work, I was being dragged in the middle of something I didn't want to be in. And for some reason, they were all ganging up on Kenny, when all he wanted to do was talk to Edie. On top of that, I was now out a cell phone.\n\n\"Shut the hell up!\" I snapped at Shaunice. \"All you've done is stir up some bullshit!\"\n\nThe four women all gave me a deadly stare. \"Jason!\" yelled Shavonda, \"That's my sister!\"\n\n\"I know that,\" I snapped back. \"She's also the ringleader of the kill Kenny club. That's the last thing we need here. Now I have something to say to each of you. This has gone on long enough.\"\n\n\"Von,\" I continued. \"How would you feel if I asked you to give up your shop and move to Lower Bugtussel?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do it!\" Shavonda replied.\n\n\"And I'd never ask you to. But that's what Edie is asking Kenny to do, give up everything he's worked for his whole life. Next to Edie and me, you're the one who knows him best. Have you ever known him to willingly hurt anybody?\"\n\n\"No.\" she said. \"The worst I've ever seen him do was tease you. And we do that ourselves.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said. I turned to Tamika. \"Would you ever ask Brian to quit what he loves doing, to move across the country?\"\n\n\"No,\" Tamika replied, \"but everything we need is right here. We don't need to do that.\"\n\n\"So what you're telling me is that you never asked him to make a sacrifice to be with you?\"\n\n\"Other than dealing with his family, no,\" Tamika seemed embarrassed.\n\n\"And you, Shaunice,\" I asked. \"What the fuck has gotten into you? Don't get me wrong, I love you like my sister, but you're being a total ass right now.\" I watched as her jaw dropped. She started to say something. I cut her off. \"What do you have against Kenny and Edie? Are you jealous of what they had? Is that why you're trying to destroy it? Why don't you try to find your own loving man, instead of trying to wreck somebody else's relationship?\"\n\n\"He's just using her,\" Shaunice said.\n\n\"And you know that how?\" I asked. \"I've never seen you date anybody. What makes you such an expert on relationships? How do you know what Kenny wants?\"\n\n\"What makes you think you know?\" she fired back.\n\n\"I know because he's like a brother to me. We come from the same background. In many ways, Kenny is me. That's how I know.\"\n\n\"But you never did my sister like that,\" Shaunice said. \"If you had I'd have cut your balls off.\"\n\n\"I wasn't asked to give up anything to be with Von,\" I pointed out. \"I'd already sacrificed my education for Rose.\"\n\n\"He does have a point,\" Shavonda said quietly.\n\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Now we're getting somewhere.\" I turned to Edie. \"What is it you want, Edie?\"\n\n\"I want Kenny,\" she sobbed. \n\n\"And how are you going to get him back if you won't talk to him?\" I asked. \"How the fuck did breaking my phone and the window help you get him back?\" Edie gave me a dumb look. I hoped I was getting through to her. \"Edie, you are asking him to give up everything he's ever known to come here to be with you. That's a big decision to make. If it were me, I'd want to know if I sacrificed everything for my queen, that it wasn't for nothing. I'd want to know she'd be there for me. Instead, you are giving him a reason to doubt you. He needs to know that if he makes the move for you, that you'll be together permanently. He loves you, Edie. Give him some love back, and I bet he gives it all up for you.\"\n\n\"Are you done yet?\" Shaunice said. \n\n\"Matter of fact I am.\"\n\n\"I'll have you know I can get a man any time I want,\" Shaunice continued. She was on the defensive. \"I just don't want one right now.\"\n\n\"Then how come you spend a fortune getting your hair done all the time?\" I asked. \"Pull your claws in. You'll never get anybody if you're angry.\"\n\n\"Jason,\" Shavonda said. \"Are you sure about Kenny?\"\n\n\"Sure, as I am that Edie owes me a new phone,\" I said. \"He's been blowing up Edie's phone all week. You haven't answered him at all have you, Edie?\"\n\n\"No,\" Edie said softly. \"I haven't. I didn't want to hear any more excuses.\"\n\n\"How do you know what he wants to tell you if you won't even talk to him?\" I said. I walked away, shaking my head. I'll never understand why people will destroy the best thing they have in their life, then cry for years about what they lost. I hadn't even eaten yet, and now I wasn't even hungry. All I wanted to do was take my shower and go to bed. \n\nLater, Shavonda woke me when she came to bed. \"If you didn't want to be caught in the middle,\" she asked, \"why did you defend Kenny?\"\n\n\"Because y'all were so busy trashing him that none of you saw what Edie was asking of him.\" I said. \"You should know that I try to play fair. And if nobody else is going to defend him, I will. Shaunice had y'all believing that he had a case of jungle fever and got bored. Von, did he look bored with Edie when we hung out with them last weekend?\"\n\n\"No, he didn't,\" she said. \"In fact, he looked happy to be with her.\"\n\n\"Well, he talked to me alone, and told me Edie wanted him to move to Pittsburgh. That's how I know how conflicted he is. But since he didn't tell anybody else, nobody else knows. And y'all wanted to jump to conclusions about his intentions. I told y'all that I know him better than any of you do. He's getting ready to make the jump. But Edie wanted to push him before he was ready.\"\n\n\"Do you really think he'll quit his job and move up here?\" Shavonda asked.\n\n\"I'd bet on it, unless Shaunice destroys it for both of them,\" I replied. \"By the way, what the hell is her problem? The way she's been acting it's almost like she's jealous of them. She is actively trying to get Edie to doubt Kenny.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Shavonda answered, \"But I don't like the way you treated her tonight.\"\n\n\"I said what had to be said. It's like she doesn't want them to be happy. I wonder if she thinks she'll get a crack at Kenny if they break up for good. If that's the case, I can tell you now he won't give her the time of day. All I want her to do is butt out so they can solve their problems. I can also tell you that if she doesn't leave Edie alone, your sister and me are going to have major problems.\"\n\n\"Jason, you put me in the middle of it! Don't ask me to choose between you and my sister,\" Shavonda was getting angry now. I hoped this wasn't going to turn into a fight. While our relationship wasn't perfect, and we'd had our small spats before, this would be different. And I didn't want my relatively tranquil marriage to go up in flames over Shaunice and Edie.\n\n\"Von, I ain't the one asking you to choose. Maybe you better have a long talk with your sister and try to find out what's REALLY going on with her. Oh, and, by the way, I promised Kenny if he does make the move, he could stay with us if he needs to.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't he move in with Edie?\"\n\n\"I didn't say he would move in here, just that the offer was made if he needed it.\"\n\nWe talked some more before I fell back asleep. I guess Shavonda was pissed with me, because I noticed she made no attempt to curl up to me like she normally did. And even though she was in the same bed with me, the lack of contact made for a lonely night.\n\nSince the kids were home that weekend, I took Ethan to the lumber yard, where we bought wood for the tree house we were going to build. We started construction Saturday afternoon, with Ethan helping me cut the wood. I climbed up in the oak tree, and notched the branches where the beams for the treehouse would sit. I also added a pulley higher up in the branches, and threaded it with rope. It would come in handy once we got the floor built. Brian also came over to help out with the design. As a demolition and salvage carpenter, he had a lot of exposure to how things were put together, and his input helped me avoid some major design flaws.\n\nWe resumed construction after church on Sunday, and by the end of the day, I had a makeshift ladder assembled, and had started to lay planking across the beams. Ethan and Brittany were able to sit on the floor of the treehouse by the end of the day Sunday.\n\nThat evening, Shavonda had some news for me. \"We're losing Beth,\" she said. \"She graduates the day of our anniversary party.\" That would mean the shops were down one person. We'd have to look for somebody to fill the position. Even worse, Beth was the only person who'd shown an interest in making the pendants, by far the most exacting and difficult task in the company. Once she left, Shavonda would be the only one capable of making them, which meant we'd be selling them faster than she could make them.\n\nOther than that, the business was doing well. My photographs were selling well, especially the Love Knows No Color series. The latest one, of me and Shavonda, with a smiling Miracle on my lap, was particularly popular. But the scenery and railroad pictures sold as well. Shavonda had come up with the idea of printing a bunch of the train photos and renting a table at the next train show, in July in Monroeville. Since it was only a few miles from the house, we wouldn't have to rent a motel room for the weekend.\n\nBut, back to the Beth situation. After some discussion, we knew we wanted to do something special for her. We ended up inviting her and her family to the anniversary party. We could celebrate both our love and her milestone at the same time. \n\nThe Friday before Mother's Day was the sentencing hearing for Officer Shoemacher. Shavonda was going to be there to make her victim's statement. In light of that, we let Barbara have the kids a day early. She'd wanted to take them to see their mother Rose for Mother's Day, and Shavonda had agreed. She even wrote a letter for Barbara to take to Rose. We didn't send letters through the mail, figuring that they'd be censored or at the very least read by prying eyes before Rose received them. By passing letters through Barbara, we could avoid that.",
        "The letter she wrote was as follows:\n\nDear Rose,\n\nWe hope you enjoy your visit with Brittany and Ethan. Children should spend time with their mothers on this day. Although I love them as my own, and try to provide them with a stable home, I am not, and can never be, their birth mother. That honor is for you alone. And you have our promise that we'll never stop the children from visiting you.\n\nOn our trip to see Jason's parents over the Easter break, Ethan discovered one of Jason's old treehouses from when he was a child. As a result, Jason and Ethan are building a treehouse in our backyard. He is teaching Ethan how to use a tape measure and hand saw. \n\nBrittany has been doing well in first grade. She has made the honor roll this time. And Miracle has learned to roll herself over and sit up. It won't be long until she's crawling. \n\nWe realize it must be lonely where you're at, and if there are any books you'd like to read, let us know and we'll send them on Barbara's next visit. Until then, hang in there. We are praying for you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJason and Shavonda\n\nThe letter was meant to comfort Rose, but was also written as a way to calm Shavonda's nerves before she had to confront Shoemacher for the final time. \n\nSince the hearing was at 9am, I had taken the day off from work. Shavonda wore a conservative outfit of long black skirt with a white blouse, and matching heels. While businesslike, the outfit looked stunning on her. It accented her natural elegance. My queen looked positively regal on this day, but I knew it was merely covering the apprehension she felt inside. We left the Cruze at the park n ride, and rode the busway downtown. Arriving at the courthouse, we waited in the hallway until time for her to give her statement. When she was called, I took my seat in the spectators' chairs while she took the stand.\n\n\"I am here today,\" Shavonda said, \"to give my statement to the court as a victim of Mr. Shoemacher. Anybody who has been involved in the trial, or who has read the transcript knows what he was convicted of. This man is a sexual predator who has preyed upon the weak and powerless, hiding behind his badge. Although I am the only one he has been convicted of attempting to assault, I doubt I am the only victim here. Four other women came forward to testify, and I am sure there were others too afraid to speak up. I can tell you from personal experience testifying as a victim of attempted rape is not an easy thing to do. I was fortunate to have credible witnesses to back up my testimony, something the other victims did not have.\"\n\n\"In spite of all that, I was victimized a second time by a defense that was more interested in smearing my character than in seeing justice done. This man turned what should have been one of the best nights of my life, my engagement, into a terrifying ordeal. I honestly didn't know if I'd come out of that night alive, but I did know that whatever he forced me to do, I was going to fight back. I thank the good lord that my husband and our dear friend, Officer Zigarelli, were working on my behalf to ensure I got fair treatment. It is because of them that the defendant was stopped before he could physically assault me. They are heroes in a true sense of the word. Had they not been in my corner, had I been on my own like the other women who testified, my situation would have been far different.\"\n\n\"In a sense, this trial and conviction is far larger than just the conviction of one man. It is a small step towards restoring the credibility of the Pittsburgh police. Because when people like Mr. Shoemacher are allowed to break the law with impunity, then hide behind the badge to escape consequences, the law itself becomes meaningless. Those who are sworn to uphold the law should face severe consequences when they violate that law. And because of that, this man deserves to be made an example, so that others will think twice before they do what he did. He is a stain upon the reputation of the police. Particularly among minorities like myself, there is a deep mistrust of those sworn to protect us.\"\n\n\"The saddest part of it all is that if what he really wanted was a black woman, there are plenty of us who are available for the asking. Good men, who treat their women with respect, are hard to find. And if he were one of them, he could have his choice. Instead, he chose to force himself upon those least able to resist him. In my case, he insisted on detaining me despite evidence that should have shown him I was not a prostitute. What streetwalker wears a $4000 ring while working? What john has a half-eaten engagement cake in the backseat of his car? And that ultimately led to his downfall, because unlike his other victims I had the love and support of a good man and his friends who were in a position to do something about him. His actions in my case could not be ignored, and triggered the investigation that led to his arrest.\"\n\n\"I hope that the court sees its way clear to imposing the maximum sentence upon this man, as a warning to others that this sort of conduct will no longer be tolerated, swept under the rug as a dirty little secret. Because when you look the other way when he does wrong, you are sending a message to others that what he did is somehow okay. Rape is never okay, no matter who the victim is, or what she does with her life. It is never okay to force yourself upon a helpless woman handcuffed in the back of your patrol car.\"\n\n\"I thank the court for allowing me input on this matter, and I trust that you will make a good decision regarding the fate of this man.\"\n\nAs Shavonda stepped down off the stand, and walked toward me, Shoemacher mumbled something to her as she passed. She stopped, stiffened, then turned around and said something to him. He turned red, and the defense attorney laughed nervously. \"Mrs. Waite!\" the judge thundered. \"You will not speak to the defendant! Approach the bench!\"\n\nShavonda turned and walked back to the judge. She spoke to him and I could see he was trying not to laugh. She turned and walked back to me, hips gently swaying as she passed the defendant. We left the courtroom together, and once out in the hall, she grabbed me in a tight hug. \"Thank you for being there,\" she said. The undercover cop had followed us out the door, and Shavonda gave her a hug as well.\n\n\"What just happened in there?\" I asked.\n\n\"That bastard had the nerve to ask me if there were any videos of me floating around,\" Shavonda growled. \"So I told him no, but that I was going home to make one with my husband. I told him that you were twice the man he was, plus another inch.\" The undercover cop laughed.\n\nShavonda wasn't done with the story. \"The judge threatened to hold me in contempt, then asked what I said. So I told him. Did you see how he was barely able to contain himself?\"\n\nWe talked for a while with the undercover cop, whose name was Ramona. We all ended up going to Villa Reale for lunch. While there, Ramona asked me a question. \"You didn't seem disturbed when the defense presented a magazine with nude photos of your wife. Why not?\"\n\n\"Von had told me a long time ago about the photo shoot, so it wasn't a complete surprise. And I was pissed, but not at her. If those photos would have been recent, I'd have been mad because she posed without telling me. But ones taken long before I ever met her, I can't get mad at her for. We all have things in our past we shouldn't have done. Why would I jeopardize the best thing in my life over something from the distant past?\"\n\n\"Is he for real?\" Ramona asked Shavonda. \n\n\"Yes, he is,\" Shavonda replied. \"That's why I love him so much. He's my rock. He's stood by me no matter what life threw at us.\"\n\n\"He sounds like a one in a million,\" Ramona said. 'You are so lucky. I do a lot of undercover sting operations, and I see some of the worst in people. Sometimes it's easy to forget that not all men are like the scum I deal with.\"\n\nShavonda and Ramona exchanged business cards, with Ramona telling my wife that there were victims groups out there if she needed help. And Shavonda invited Ramona to our anniversary party/ reunion in two weekends. \"Bring your husband if you have one,\" she said. \"We're a nice group to hang out with. We'll have good food, and a DJ. And Jason and I will probably play a few songs ourselves.\"\n\nAfterward, we returned to our car, riding a bus half empty during the midday lull. It was nice to actually be able to see out the windows on both sides for a change, with no crowd of standees to block the view. At the park n ride, we retrieved the Cruze, and returned home. We changed our clothes, and loaded the Jeep for the weekend trip we were taking. We intended to kidnap Edie and get her out of Pittsburgh for the weekend, or at least that's what we told her. We didn't let her know the destination was my parents farm. I wanted to spend Mother's Day with my family this year, and Shavonda and I had compromised. We'd spend Saturday with my mom, then leave early Sunday morning in order to be back home by dinner time, which we would spend with Althea.\n\nArriving home, we walked in the door, and Shavonda immediately burst into tears. \"I can't believe it's finally over,\" she sobbed as I held her. Althea watched as I comforted my wife, holding her close as she let herself crumble in a safe place. That was one thing I had come to love about her, how she put on a brave face for the world to see. To the outside world, she was the epitome of the strong black woman. But to those of us close enough to earn her trust, she let her vulnerability show. Today, maintaining her dignity and grace while facing the man who'd attempted the ultimate humiliation, Shavonda had pulled it off, giving an intelligent and impassioned statement to the court. But the ordeal had once again shaken her to her very core. \n\n\"Jason,\" Althea said, \"Take your wife to the bedroom. Let her rest, and hold her while you tell her you love her. I'll watch the baby while she gets it together.\" Thanking Althea, I led my wife by the hand to the room and helped her out of her clothes. We spent much of the afternoon in bed holding each other while she cried herself out. By this time, I'd been through this with her several times before, and knew just what to do. I ran my fingers through her curls, telling her how proud I was of what she'd done. And how much I cherished her. Finally, the tears stopped, and she kissed me passionately. \n\n\"I love you, Jefferson Waite,\" Shavonda said softly. \"I'm sorry you had to see me like this.\"\n\n\"I am here for you,\" I said. \"It took a lot of courage to do what you just did. And even when the jackass tried to rattle you, you verbally humiliated him. I don't think I could have been that strong.\"\n\nShe kissed me again, then looked me in the eye. \"Jason,\" she said, \"I'm ovulating. Make love to me. Give me that baby boy.\"\n\nWe made love passionately, each filled with the need to possess the other. Shavonda had placed the bed pillows under her ass, lifting her pelvis to me at an angle that made deep penetration easy. I slid inside her moist heat, thrusting into her as her legs wrapped around me, pulling me deep inside her. I was hers, to use as she pleased. I thrilled to the sight of her milk laden breasts bouncing to my thrusts. \n\nThe month before, we'd set the ground rules for sex during ovulation. In an effort to maximize our chances of conception, we used pillows to elevate her vagina, so that when I came, my sperm would flow down into her uterus. Afterward, I was allowed to use whatever stimulation I wanted to bring her to another orgasm, with one exception. I was allowed to lick the outside of her pussy and clit, but not allowed to put my tongue or fingers inside her. We wanted to keep as much of my seed inside her as we could, and from what we'd read orgasmic contractions helped my sperm get to where it was needed. And yes, that also meant I could touch, kiss lick or nibble her sweet spot on her inner thigh....\n\nToday was no different, as our bodies moved against each other I took her over the edge, and her orgasmic spasms hastened my own release. I looked deep into her eyes as she went over the edge. Even after two years and over 500 times having sex with her, I still thrilled to the sight of her body. I loved the look of lust in her eyes as she lost herself in passion. I was still in awe of her dark skin so unlike my own. The most beautiful woman in the world rocked beneath me, and she was mine, only mine. As I shot my milky seed deep within her womb, I thought how lucky I was. I had my dreamgirl, and she loved me just as much as I loved her.\n\nI stayed within her in the afterglow, then pulled out when her spasms died down. She'd milked me of all that I had. Now it was my turn to pleasure her. I knelt between her legs, sucking gently on her clit as I worked my fingers on her sweet spot. She looked as good as she tasted. I couldn't resist moving my mouth down to her inner thigh, licking up the juices that had leaked out of her as I worked my way to the special spot at the bottom of her ass cheek. Once there, I sucked hard on her skin, giving her a mark of my possession as her second orgasm hit her hard.\n\nWe lay there in each other's arms afterward. We must have drifted off, because we were soon awakened by Edie and Althea knocking on the door. \"Oh, shit!\" Shavonda said as she grabbed a sun dress from the clothes rack in the closet. She slipped into it quickly, not bothering to put on bra or panties. I knew this was going to drive me crazy on the trip tonight. I quickly grabbed a pair of shorts and a t shirt from the dresser drawer and soon we were both presentable. We opened the door, smiling as we did so.\n\n\"Ewww,\" Edie exclaimed, \"You two so nasty!\" Althea gave us a knowing look. \n\n\"She's feeling a little better now,\" I said.\n\n\"I bet she is,\" Althea replied. \"I hope you gave her a boy.\" Shavonda laughed. Evidently, she'd told her mother she was trying to conceive.\n\nWe put the baby and Edie's bags in the Jeep. Promising Althea we'd be back on Mother's Day we hit the road. Edie had no idea where we were going. \"Did you bring a nice outfit for tomorrow?\" I asked. She had packed a sun dress in case we wanted to go somewhere special. She was going to be in for a surprise, but we had to keep our destination a secret or she would have backed out of the trip. I wasn't going to let her do that. Too many people had worked too hard on what we had planned for her. \n\nIn order not to give a clue where we were headed, I took a different route south. Getting on the turnpike in Monroeville, we headed east to Somerset, then took 219 south to Berlin, and 160 from there to the Maryland border. We dropped down the mountain into Cumberland in the fading light and stopped to eat at Kline's, one of our favorite places in the area. After dinner, we continued south on 220, finally stopping for the night at a motel in Franklin, WV. I rented two rooms. Edie would have to sleep alone tonight, my wife and I had some baby making to do. \n\nWe hit the road early the next morning, stopping for breakfast at a diner. Shavonda was wearing a cute leopard print halter dress that nicely showed off her curves, and Edie wore a nice blue sun dress that also showed off her body. We felt every eye upon us as we walked in and sat down. But the waitress was friendly as were the customers. We'd have to remember this place, it truly showed off the best rural America had to offer. I had to admit, I did miss living in a place like this. The city just wasn't the same. I understood why Kenny was reluctant to give up living in the mountains.\n\nA little after 8 we rolled into Covington, VA, and it finally dawned on Edie where we were headed. \"Why didn't you tell me we were going to your mother's?\" Edie demanded.\n\n\"If I'd have told you, would you have come?\" I asked her.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well then you're just going to have to deal with it. By the way, you are beautiful in that blue dress,\" I replied. \n\n\"Since we're here, want to get the ice cream now?\" Shavonda asked. We pulled into the Food Lion parking lot, and I was lucky enough to find a spot close to the door that I could pull the Jeep into. When we left, we could pull straight out, instead of backing. Driving an 18-wheeler has left me leery of backup moves. In the big truck, I have some major blind spots, and if I'm going to damage anything it will be when backing up. Even in our cars, I still try not to back up unless necessary.\n\nEdie volunteered to stay in the car with Miracle, who was awake and bubbly as usual. I think Edie wants kids of her own, but for now, Miracle would serve as a surrogate child for her.\n\nThe store was not crowded this early in the morning, most of the people there seemed to be picking up things for lunch on the 9am shift at the paper mill. We quickly found our fudge ripple, and made our way through the express line. With our purchase paid for, we started for the door when I heard a voice calling my name. \n\n\"Jason Waite, is that you?\" I turned to see Randy Patton walking toward us. I'd gone to school with Randy, though we had been more enemies than friends. Randy had been a troublemaker then, I'd hoped he'd changed. At any rate, I was polite.\n\n\"Hi, Randy. How you been?\" I replied.\n\n\"Oh, not bad. Who's your friend?\"\n\n\"That's my lovely wife, Shavonda.\" I answered. Shavonda, like she usually did when introduced as my wife, held out her hand to show off her ring.\n\n\"That's a nice ring,\" Randy said. \"Too bad you wasted all that money on a nigger.\" I clenched my fist. Randy hadn't changed a bit. He still liked to stir things up. Shavonda noticed my reaction.\n\n\"Jason, no,\" she whispered. \"Not here.\" As usual she was right. Here we were in a small Virginia town, outsiders, and a nontraditional couple to boot. A fight would probably wind up with one or both of us in jail. So rather than deck Randy, which was what he wanted, I turned to him and smiled.\n\n\"Randy, you got it all wrong. Shavonda is worth many times what I paid for that ring. If you knew what she does for me and to me you'd understand. She's smart, she's beautiful, and she has the body of a goddess.\" I glanced at Shavonda, who was grinning, flattered by my compliments. \"And, she has such a beautiful smile, she still has all her teeth. Randy, how many teeth does your wife have?\" I could see Randy doing a slow burn. \"Von, let's get out of here before the ice cream melts.\"\n\nI took Shavonda's hand in mine and we started to walk through the door. Shavonda was smiling over her shoulder as we walked. \"Jason, watch out!\" she warned as I felt a hand on my shoulder. Instinctively I ducked. \n\nThe hand on the shoulder was a classic Patton move. Randy was one of four brothers and a sister, and they all fought dirty like that. They'd grab you by your shoulder, and spin you around as they threw a punch with the other arm. The unsuspecting victim would usually catch a fist in the jaw or nose, occasionally breaking a bone, before they had a chance to react. By the time they knew what was going on, they'd be too dazed by the hit to effectively fight back.\n\nI'd learned to duck when I felt a hand on my shoulder. By doing so, not only did I avoid being hit, I also turned the tables on whichever Patton decided to mess with me that day. They usually threw the punch so hard that when I ducked it threw them off balance, and they'd tumble over my back. And I'd be on them before they knew what hit them. Once I started doing that, it got me suspended from school a couple of times, but it also bought me an uneasy peace with the Patton family.\n\nEvidently, Randy had forgotten my move. I didn't even think about what I was doing, I just ducked, fully expecting Randy to tumble over me. Then I'd be on him like white on rice. After all, he threw the first punch, and anything I did after that was self-defense. But instead of feeling the weight of Randy losing his balance and tumbling over my back, I heard a sickening crack as his fist narrowly missed my wife and hit the metal door frame instead. Randy collapsed on the floor, howling in pain.",
        "\"Serves you right,\" I said. \"Saves me the trouble of kicking your ass like I did in high school. Just remember, if you'd so much as touched my wife, you'd be going out of here in a body bag.\"\n\nWe walked out the door to the Jeep, ignoring the calls from the store security. We got in the car, and I was about to pull out when the guard stepped in front of the Jeep. \"You can't leave,\" he said. \"The police are on the way.\"\n\n\"You have no right to keep us,\" I said. \"We've done nothing wrong\"\n\nEdie, bless her soul, had thought fast. Leaning out the window, she video recorded the guard. \"Could you repeat that,\" she yelled, \"I don't think I recorded it.\"\n\n\"You can't take pictures on store property!\" the guard was pissed and started alongside the car towards Edie. \"Give me that phone!\"\n\n\"No way!\" Edie exclaimed. \"I paid good money for this phone.\" She pulled her head back inside the vehicle as I put it in gear and drove away leaving a stunned security guard standing there wondering how he could have been so stupid. \n\n\"Won't they come looking for us?\" Shavonda asked.\n\n\"Probably,\" I replied. \"He probably got our license number, and will give it to the police when they arrive. But since it's a Pennsylvania plate, if they do look for us it will be at the motels or along the interstate. The last place they'll think to look is on a back road heading deep into the mountains.\"\n\n\"But won't they run the plate and find out who you are?\" Edie asked. \n\n\"I'm sure they will. But by the time they figure that out we'll be over the state line into West Virginia.\" I was pretty sure what I said was true, but that didn't keep me from looking in my mirror to see if we were being followed. \"Remember, there is no cell phone service where we're headed. Eventually, they'll track me down and call, but by that we'll be where they won't do anything to us. They'll see the security video and see we didn't do anything wrong. I'm not hanging around there only to have some cop show up with an \"arrest everybody and sort it all out while they sit in jail\" mentality. Even if they wanted to charge us with something, they won't extradite us from Pennsylvania over something minor.\"\n\n\"So, what happened back there?\" Edie sounded worried.\n\n\"One of my old schoolmates saw us and called Von a nigger,\" I replied. \"He took a swing at me. I ducked and he hit the metal door frame instead. From the sound of it, he did some serious damage to his hand. Evidently, they think we hurt him, but their video camera will show otherwise.\"\n\n\"Oh, shit!\" Edie exclaimed. \"Von are you alright?\"\n\n\"I've been called worse,\" she said. \"I agree with Jason, though. We needed to get out of there. On our first road trip, we were pulled over in a little town like this, and accused of running drugs. Just because we were a mixed-race couple from out of state. I don't know if the police here have the same mentality, but we can't take that chance. That man is going to have to go to the hospital, and if we stayed. We could have been facing assault charges, even though neither of us hit him. But we both wanted to.\"\n\nWe continued up the valley, deeper into the mountains. I nervously looked in the mirror the whole way, and didn't slow down until we crossed the state line outside of Waiteville. Soon we pulled ducked under the railroad tracks, and turned up the dirt road leading to the farm. The porch was empty, evidently Mom and Grandma weren't expecting us this early.\n\nI knocked on the door. \"Come on in.\" I heard Mom call from the living room. We entered, to find Mom and Grandma watching the television. She arose and gave us all hugs. She stepped back and admired the leopard print dress. \"Von, you always dress so well,\" she said. \"Every time you come here you are wearing something beautiful.\"\n\n\"Jason loves animal print,\" Shavonda replied. \"But I don't normally wear it. I bought this especially for this trip.\"\n\n\"You just missed your Dad,\" Mom said to me. I had figured as much. Even though we hadn't seen him, I was sure we'd probably passed him just outside of Covington, on his way to work. \"I wasn't sure when you'd get here, so I don't have breakfast ready for you.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Mom,\" I said. \"We stopped at a diner on the way here. We're good.\" I pulled Mom to the side, and we went into the kitchen to talk. \"Edie doesn't know about Kenny, so don't say anything please.\" She nodded. Whatever was about to happen between Kenny and Edie would be a surprise to Edie. I thought I knew what was going to happen, but I wasn't sure. Shavonda and I had been on the phone with him several times in the past week. We'd done our part by getting Edie down here. The rest was up to him. In the meantime, I was going to celebrate Mother's Day with Mom for the first time in years. \n\nWe told Mom about the incident at the grocery store this morning, and she shook her head in disgust. \"One of the Patton boys,\" she said. \"Why am I not surprised. They always were trash. You'd think people would try to get their own life right, before they tried to mess up somebody else's. Serves him right. But I'm a little concerned you threatened to kill him. Jason, that's not like you. We didn't raise you like that.\"\n\nShe was right. Here I was, the kid who grew up in prime hunting and fishing country, an unspoiled national forest. The kid who didn't hunt or fish, because he couldn't bear to hurt the animals. The kid who befriended the cows on the farm, when we still had them, and refused to eat the meat when one was sent off to be butchered. No matter what punishment was threatened or given out, I refused to eat a friend. \n\nShavonda had somehow changed that. Not that I was suddenly a violent person. I was still a pacifist at heart. But now I had something to fight for. And Shavonda was worth defending at any cost. Without her, I was incomplete. \n\nBack in the living room, we sat and chatted. I asked about Aunt Nora and the rest of the Duncan clan,\n\n\"Nothing has changed there,\" Mom said. \"They still refuse to accept Von as your wife. And to them you no longer exist. I think they're dead wrong, but their mind is made up. Nora went back and told them about Von, I am dismayed that even after meeting her, Nora still thinks she's beneath you. That said, we all enjoyed how you two messed with her head the whole time she was here. You two kept us all entertained.\"\n\nA part of me was hurt by the actions of my aunt and maternal grandparents, but I accepted that I'd been ostracized. It was their loss more than mine. They'd never know the joy of our miracle baby. They'd never hear Shavonda do justice to any Macy Gray or Rihanna song she chose to sing. And they'd never get to witness their grandson being truly happy for the first time in his life.\n\nShavonda was my world. She was the most beautiful woman in the world, and she was mine to have and cherish. Never mind that the baby had taken a toll on her body, that her stomach was no longer flat, that she had stretch marks and her breasts now sagged a bit. Those supposed \"flaws\" only made her more beautiful to me. She'd come into my life unexpectedly, and somehow got past my defenses and inside me. And there she would stay. I wanted her there, needed her there. This goddess, who had taken over my heart, mind and soul, had changed my life for the better. I was no longer the person I was two years ago, when we met. I was whole now, thanks to her. She'd accepted me for who I was, loved my children as her own. Her family embraced me as one of their own. And on top of that, she had presented me with the most beautiful baby girl, that we had made together. I had watched in awe as she brought Miracle into the world. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.\n\nIf the Duncan side of the family didn't want to accept us, then screw them. The Waites and the MacFarlands had accepted us without question. We still had family here, and I had gained the Jenkins family in Pittsburgh as well. \n\nMiracle was alert and playful, and Shavonda had set her on the floor with her toys, and the baby had grabbed her rattle and was shaking it, laughing at the noise it made. \"I started her on baby cereal last week,\" Shavonda told the other ladies. \"She's also been trying to crawl. Next time you see her, we'll have to bring a play pen.\"\n\nMom was impressed with Miracle's development so far. She'd only become cuter as she grew. Her hair had come in nicely, and she now sported a head full of thick, dark brown curls. Miracle had already shown a curiosity about the world around her, and I had a feeling our baby was going to be as smart as her mother. I could see her in a couple of years, asking a million questions and embarrassing the hell out of us. I couldn't wait.\n\nIt was great being with my family once again. But it was also tempered with apprehension. Because none of knew how Edie was going to react when Kenny finally got here.\n\nTo be continued...."
