        "*Sorry it took so long for me to update this story. My laptop broke a while ago and I was just recently able to purchase a new one. Anyways here's part two. I have plans to continue this series. I am also working on other interracial period pieces as well. Still looking for an editor so if anyone is interested just send a message to the email through my profile.*\n\n*****\n\nMaison \n\nShe was so beautiful laying there with the first of the morning light shining on her dark face. Maison knew that he should be getting ready to feed his animals and tend to his traps but all of that would have to wait. He wanted to be there when Beatrice awoke. Maison traced his index finger along her face as if trying to commit every feature to memory. Beatrice eyelids began to flutter and when she opened them all the way her large brown eyes settled on Maison. She smiled up at him and Maison could swear that his heart expanded in his chest at the site of it. \n\n\"Good morning darling.\" He said before kissing her. \n\nBeatrice returned his kiss and Maison's manhood grew erect. He slid on top of Beatrice and she opened her legs to give him access. His seed was still in her from last night and that made it easier for him to enter her. A soft moan came from her lips when he reached down to touch her nub. Maison made sure to go slow, wanting to savor this experience. He moved his mouth from hers and put one of her breasts in his mouth. Beatrice gasped when he began flicking her nipple with the tip of his tongue. She came then, soaking Maison and the sheets beneath them. Maison followed her soon after. His body shook from the force of it. So many years of pent up sexual tension. He kissed Beatrice once more before turning on his back. The sun was fully up now and as much as Maison wanted to remain in the bed next to her he knew that he had to get up and tend to his chores. He groaned and threw the furs off of him. Beatrice grabbed his hand as he stood up and began putting his long johns on. He turned to smile down at her.\n\n\"Come back to bed.\" She tried coaxing him with a seductive smile.\n\n\"As appealing as that sounds I have to tend to the animals. Dancer is probably stomping around right now wondering why her feed is late. I'll be back soon, promise.\"\n\nMaison bent down and kissed her one last time before he finished getting dressed. It had snowed during the night and Maison had to shovel a path to the barn and then the outhouse. Once inside the barn Dancer began snorting and bobbing her head communicating her distaste at Maison's tardiness. When Maison approached her with the bucket she tried nipping at his collar.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I got a little distracted.\" He said trying to calm her. \n\nMaison petted her snout and whispered to her until she'd calmed down more. He gave her the bucket and while she munched he fed the goat and chickens. He then milked the goat and collected eggs for breakfast. He did all of this quickly as he did not want to be away from Beatrice for very long.\n\nBeatrice \n\nBeatrice lay there listening to Maison shoveling, enjoying the warmth coming from the stove. She would have been content to remain there until Maison came back inside but she had to go pee and her stomach was rumbling from hunger. She got up from the bed and slipped her nightgown over her head before slipping on her coat and boots. She heard Maison trying to console Dancer in the barn and chuckled to herself before walking to the outhouse. After she was finished she walked back to the cabin and put water on the stove to heat. Beatrice gathered the soiled sheets from the bed so that she could wash them tomorrow. When the water finished boiling she poured half of it into the wash basin and used it to clean herself up before getting dressed. \n\nBefore coming out west Beatrice couldn't have imagined adjusting so easily to domestic life. From the moment she was born until the moment she left home Beatrice never needed to lift a finger. She was used to having maids, cooks, governesses, and chauffeurs tend to her. She had never emptied her own chamber pot, fixed a bed, or cooked a meal. Her mother had trained her to manage the affairs of a household but never actually work within one.\n\nShe didn't dislike this type of work though. On the contrary, it made her feel useful and independant. She no longer needed a servant in order to meet her basic needs and providing a nice home for Maison made her happy. She began grounding beans for coffee as Maison came in with a basket of fresh eggs and a bucket of goats milk. He put them down on the table before coming over and putting hands around Beatrice's waist.\n\nBeatrice leaned back against him as he nuzzled his face into her neck. Maison planted soft kisses from her collarbone to her earlobe sending tingles along her body. \n\n\"Maison stop!\" she giggled. \"That tickles.\"\n\nMaison didn't stop instead he moved his hand up towards her breasts. \n\n\"How about we finish what we started this morning.\" He whispered in a sultry voice that sent shivers down Beatrice's spine. \n\nBeatrice was about to protest but Maison had somehow managed to unbutton her dress and slip his hand under her chemise. Suddenly she wasn't hungry anymore and all she could think about was tearing off her dress and letting Maison devour her breasts. \n\nThey headed towards the bed not caring that it was bare. Beatrice was on her back and Maison took her boots off. He was in the process of taking off her undergarments when a loud war cry pierced the air. Beatrice's blood ran cold. Could the braves have tracked her all the way to Maison's cabin after so many weeks? \n\n\"Get under the bed and don't come out until I tell you to.\" Maison demanded.\n\nBeatrice heard him say this but for the life of her she could not move. Fear had frozen her. She thought of all the morbid things they would do to her and Maison once they managed to get inside the cabin. There was another cry and then a bang on the door. Maison grabbed Beatrice's arm and shoved her under the bed before grabbing his rifle and pistol.\n\nMaison \n\nFrom the sound of it there was only one person outside the door. This made Maison feel a little more relieved since he couldn't depend on Beatrice to help him out. The fear he had seen in her eyes sent him into protective mode. Whoever this person was would be begging for death by the time Maison was done with him. Maison positioned himself in front of the window and drew back the curtain a little before pushing it up enough to slide the barrel of the rifle through. A large, brown hand reached forward and grabbed the barrel. Maison would have shot off the guy's head but a face he recognized appeared before he pulled the trigger.\n\n\"You crazy bastard.\" Maison muttered, pulling the shotgun back. He ran outside and flung himself into the man's arms. The man was tall and large enough to swing Maison around as he let out another whoop. After he was done he set Maison back on the ground \n\n\"What the hell are you doing out this way, Bear?\" Maison asked as he slapped the man's arm. \n\n\"Come to see how you been. Surprised you ain't dead yet.\" Bear replied grinning down at Maison. \n\nFrom his peripheral Maison could see Beatrice peaking around the frame of the open door. He turned to Beatrice and took her hand before introducing her to Bear. Beatrice was still frightened of Maison's friend but she tentatively shook his hand and said hello. \n\n\"Sorry about the racket ma'am, didn't know this ole buggar had gotten hitched.\" Bear said jokingly.\n\nMaison glanced over to see how Beatrice would react to being called his wife. His heart sank when he saw her eyes go wide. She fumbled around for an explanation about their situation before Maison finally stepped in. \n\n\"Beatrice and I aren't married. I found her after her wagon train was attacked by Arapaho warriors.\" \n\nBear nodded and looked at his friend with a knowing glance. Maison wilted even more under Bear's gaze and quickly invited him inside for breakfast. Glad to have some excuse to get away from the embarrassing turn their reunion had taken. \n\nBeatrice cooked a meal of biscuits, gravy and eggs with thick slices of ham as Maison and Bear sat at the table catching up. Maison was so happy to see his old friend that he soon forgot about how Beatrice reacted to Bear mistaking her for his wife. Soon they were reminiscing on the adventures of their youth. \n\nOver the course of their conversation Bear informed Maison that he was no longer working as a scout for the army and instead had gone back to trapping and horse trading. After the meal Maison took Bear around to see his traps. Then on a whim they decided to go ice fishing in the creek nearby. Maison had plenty of smoked fish as well as ham and cured buffalo stored up in his root cellar but Bear wanted fresh fish and Maison wanted to oblige him seeing as the two so rarely had the chance to see eachother anymore. While they were fishing Bear pulled out a bladder filled with liquid and took a long swig. Once again letting out a long and loud whoop. \n\n\"Hey now, enough with all of that.\" Maison cautioned, not wanting Beatrice to get spooked again. \n\n\"Sorry brother, I wouldn't want to scare your lady. \" Bear replied handing Maison the bladder.\n\nThe two of them continued on like that, passing the bladder back and forth between each other before Bear asked Maison what exactly happened that brought he and Beatrice together. \n\nMaison took another swig before he recounted how he'd rescued Beatrice after her wagon train had been attacked. He told Bear about how after so many weeks together he had fallen in love with Beatrice and wanted to take her as his wife. \n\n\"So why don't you?\" Bear asked after Maison had finished talking. \n\n\"Things between Beatrice and I are a lot more complicated than it should be.\" Maison said finally.\n\n\"What's so complicated? You're a man and she's a woman. Both of you seem to be alone in the world.\" \n\nBear's tone was passive, almost dismissive. As if Maison's worries were silly trifles. \n\n\"It ain't that easy.\" Maison went on. \"We're different races and in this country people don't think it's right for us to be together.\"\n\nBear nodded then took another drink. There was another long stretch of silence before Bear finally spoke again. \n\n\"Why come so far out here if you were just going to live by the rules of other people?\"\n\nIt was a simple question but it stumped Maison. He had after all come out west to start a new life for himself, to get away from the old rules of the east. So why was he now holding himself to the same oppressive standards? Just as Maison began to get immersed in his thoughts about Beatrice Bear let out another loud scream and jumped from the log they were sitting on, knocking Maison off of it in the process. Maison stumbled to his feet and saw that bear had caught a yellow pike fish. It was big and Bear struggled to reel it in which explained him knocking Maison off the log. \n\nMaison quickly scrambled over to help his friend. They managed to bring it in and let it flap on the snowy bank as they congratulated each other. Then Bear found a stick on the ground and drove it through the fish's mouth. They left it on the bank and went back to drinking on the log. Lucky for the two men the bladder was still propped up on the side of the log where Maison had last placed it. \n\nBeatrice\n\nAfter dinner and a few cups of coffee the men managed to sober up. Maison played his harmonica and Bear played a flute he brought with him. Back in Chicago Beatrice had been to many operas but she had not heard any musicians play as beautifully as Bear and Maison. Their music calmed her in a way that she had not expected it to. \n\nWhen the men finished playing they all decided to retire for the night. Bear laid out a pallet on the floor and Maison hung up a curtain to give him and Beatrice a little privacy. Maison was soon asleep but Beatrice remained awake listening to the wind rustle through the trees outside and thinking about her life back home in Chicago. \n\nShe had never been happy there. Beatrice's mother was a difficult woman who spent much of her time hovering around Beatrice and Clara but finding little to be impressed with. Her criticisms were often biting and her affection infrequent. She was also like this with the servants and even Beatrice's father. Which is probably why her father invested so much time in his business ventures. The only person who was exempt from her mother's coldness was her younger brother. Her brother was dotated on, given affection and excused from every transgression. As an unmarried woman Beatrice had no means of escape since it would have been considered improper for her to live alone. This is probably why Clara was so eager to join the war effort and why Beatrice didn't hesitate when Clara and Eamon invited her to join them out west. \n\nBeatrice snuggled closer to Maison's side cherishing his warmth and his smell. She wanted so much to stay here with him but she knew that if she did that would mean being disowned by her family and shunned by everyone in their social circle. As much as Beatrice cared for Maison she didn't know if she was willing to give up all of that to be with him. Tears rolled down her cheek and she felt herself sniffle. Maison shifted then then she felt his hand in her thick hair. \n\n\"What's wrong honey?\" he whispered groggily. \"Have a bad dream?\" \n\n\"No, im fine.\" Beatrice lied feeling sorry that she'd woken him.\n\n\"Come here.\" \n\nMaison brought her face up to meet his and kissed her deeply. Beatrice returned his kiss reaching her hand up to caress his beard. Maison wrapped his arm around her waist. Beatrice mounted him and tore her nightgown off. She took Maison's hand in hers and brought them up to her breasts. She could feel his manhood pressing against her pussy and she grinded her hips against his. Maison hissed at the sensation and grabbed Beatrice by the back of the neck. He flipped her onto her back and put her legs over his shoulders diving face first into her waiting pussy. When he wrapped his lips around clit and began sucking it was Beatrice turn to hiss. She had never imagined making love to be so pleasurable. So primal. She gripped Maison's long locks in her hand and tried to pull his face closer. She came and he lapped up her juices like it was his first drop of water in days. \n\nHe kissed his way up her torso before planting his lips on her mouth. Beatrice tasted her own juices on his lips and loved it. He thrust himself inside of her and Beatrice bit into his shoulder. It was still a little painful but there was more pleasure than the night before. She reached down and touched his balls and in returned he increased his thrusts. Maison reached his hand down and began caressing her clit. Once again Beatrice felt herself cumming. Her thighs shook as Maison continued fucking her. She soon felt his seamon coat her insides.\n\nMaison pulled out of her with a wet plop and lay on his back. He pulled Beatrice into his arms and kissed her forehead. She rested her head on his hairy chest and Maison pulled the furs up over them. His breathing slowed and the sweat on his body cooled. When Beatrice thought that he was finally asleep she whispered the words that she was too afraid to say in the daylight.\n\n\"I love you Maison.\" \n\nIn the morning Beatrice cooked some of the fish the men caught the night before along with beans and fried apples. The weather had cleared up and Bear wanted to head out before it shifted as it often did in this territory. When Bear was packing up his sack he pulled a pair of moccasin boots out of his bag. He handed them to Beatrice. He told her that it belonged to his wife before she died. She was touched that Bear would give her something that obviously held so much sentiment to him. She thanked him but wish there was something more she could say to fully convey how grateful she was. \n\nMaison decided he would travel a mile up where Bear intended to go. Since he had brought her to the cabin Maison had not ventured further than his traps. Beatrice hadn't realized how much she would dred being separate from him. Even when he would stay out late hunting or checking his traps she at least knew he was not far away. She had to end this. If she let this continue on she would never have the strength to go back. Beatrice closed the cabin door and went to clean the morning dishes. When Maison returned she was drying the dishes. He stomped the snow from his boots, hung up his coat and went over to beatrice. Wrapping his arms around her waist and kissing her neck just as he had the morning before. \n\nBefore he could go further Beatrice turned in his arms. Beatrice enclosed her arms around his neck and kissed him. She laid her forehead against his chest and breathed in his scent. She loved how he smelled. The men she had known back in Chicago wore perfumes that disguised their natural smells. Maison smelled like the pine trees that surrounded the cabin and the sweet wood smoke that burned in the stove. \n\n\"We can't ever marry and when spring comes im going back home to Chicago.\" She said it matter of factly without any malice. \n\nMaison quickly pulled back and looked at her, his face a mask of confusion, hurt, and anger. He separated himself from her as if she had stabbed him in the gut. Beatrice hated seeing the pain in his eyes and knowing that she was the source of it. She felt her own heart breaking just as Maison's was. \n\nBeatrice tried to reach out to him but he stepped further out of her reach. \n\n\"Let me get this straight' he began \"You let me make love to you. You told me that you loved me!\" Beatrice hadn't thought he heard her say that last night. \"And now you're telling me we can't ever be together?\"\n\n\"No we can't.\" Beatrice's voice was still calm. This seemed to enrage Maison even more and his face began to turn red. \n\nAgain Beatrice held out her arms. Desperate to comfort the man she was rejecting. \n\n\"You're a coward.\" He said it so softly that Beatrice almost didn't hear him. \n\nBeatrice didn't try to argue or defend herself against the accusation because she knew that he was right. Beatrice hated her home in Chicago. She hated the rigidity of her upper class society that she never seemed to fit in with. But she was returning because she thought that it was the proper thing to do. She was a coward. \n\nMaison took his coat from the hook on the wall and without another word left the cabin. Beatrice sat on the bed and cried. Cried until her throat hurt. Cried until her head began to ache. Until she cried herself to sleep. \n\nMaison\n\nThe wind stung Maison's bare cheeks as well as the exposed flesh of his ears and neck. In his haste to leave the cabin Maison had forgotten to grab a scarf to cover his head with. But he was too distracted by his argument with Beatrice to care about possible frostbite. Well, it wasn't really an argument since Beatrice had just stood there nonchalantly explaining why they would never be together. Her aloofness had upset him the most because it was then that Maison finally realized that he cared more for her than she had ever cared for him. \n\nMaison felt as if he had been tricked. Maison had saved her life, taken care of her, and made love to her. He would have died for Beatrice. And now she was talking about just forgetting him and going back to her life in Chicago. And for what? She'd come out west because she hated Chicago. Why give up everything just to go back? He was right to call her a coward.\n\nOr maybe she wasn't a coward. If she didn't feel the same way he had for her why should she be obligated to stay? Maybe Maison was just a lonely and foolish man who expected too much from a young woman that lived through a traumatic experience.\n\nMaison went inside of the barn and went over to Dancer. The horse nestled her head against the crook of his neck. Almost as if it could sense his distress and need for comfort. Maison leaned in to Dancer's warmth wishing that he could forget the aching in his heart. ",
        "\"Let's go girl.\" Maison said leading Dancer out of her stall. \n\nMaison didn't usually take Dancer with him when he went to check his traps but he needed her presence to distract him from thinking about Beatrice. Dancer readily complied, excited for another chance to get out of the barn. When Maison led her outside he looked across towards the cabin. Through the window he could see Beatrice. She was on the bed with her head in her hands. It looked as if she were crying. Maybe she wasn't so heartless after all. \n\nMaison mounted Dancer and road down the path towards his traps. The wind was starting to pick up and a few icicles fell from the branches of a pine tree above him. Maison pulled the brim of his hat lower on his head to shield his ears from the wind. \n\nThe first few traps were empty but in the fourth one was a white rabbit. It was plump and would go good in a stew. The fur he would use to make a muff or shawl for a lady. In the next few traps he found another rabbit except this one was grey. Next he found a beaver in his trap near the creek. While the traps had crushed the skulls of the rabbits it had only managed to capture the hindquarters of the beaver. The poor creature squealed and thrashed around trying to free itself from the steel device. Maison pulled out a long hunting knife and drove it through the back of the beaver's head before releasing it from the trap. \n\nMaison let Dancer take a drink from the creek while he gutted all three of the animals. Once Maison had finished doing this he skinned them. Then he took a small paper bag filled with salt and generously sprinkled it unto the pelts before he hung them on a bush. He sat on a rock and lit a pipe. \n\nSnow had begun to fall and the temperature was dropping. Maison would have to return to the cabin soon but he wanted to enjoy as much time as he could before he had to go back and face Beatrice. Dancer came up to him and nuzzled Maison's shoulder. Maison reached up and patted the horse. Maison continued smoking as Dancer began munching on some tufts of grass that had managed to poked through the snow. \n\nAfter Maison finished smoking the tobacco in his pipe he retrieved the pellets and stuffed them into a sack tied to Dancer's back. He mounted her again and rode off to check more of his traps. As he got further away from the creek clouds formed blocking out the already weak sunlight. Maison had ten more traps to check but he decided that after the next one that he would go home. He wasn't prepared to get caught in a snowstorm. As Maison approached his next trap he heard a high pitched screech. He pulled out his shotgun wanting to prepare for whatever he found there. He dismounted Dancer and tied her to a tree. The last thing he needed was for her to get spooked and run off. \n\nHe approached slowly and peaked around a bush to see that a bobcat had it's jaws around the head of a beaver that had been caught in Maison's trap. Maison poured gunpowder down his rifle and pushed a couple of musket balls in. He closed the rifle and walked further around to get a better angle. As he was doing this he stepped on a twig, making it snap. \n\nThe bobcat's head shot up and he let out a screech upon spotting Maison. Maison leveled the rifle and pointed it at the bobcat's head. Just as the cat was preparing to pounce Maison put a bullet between it's eyes. The bobcat twisted and flopped around before it fell on it's back. Maison released the beaver from the trap and took the bobcat by it's legs. He wanted to gut and clean the animals right there but the snow was falling more heavy. He would have to wait until he reached the safety of the barn. \n\nMaison dragged the animals back to where he left Dancer. She was skittish from the gunshot and the sight of the dead bobcat and Maison had to sing to her to get her to calm down enough to let him strap the animal to her back. Maison was only about a mile away from the cabin but the snow was coming down quick and covering the pathway. It would be easy to get lost. \n\nMaison had a hard time even seeing the path and the wind was blowing strong enough to sway Dancer who protested having the dead animal strapped to her. Maison had to continuously rub her and whisper soft platitudes to her. When he was halfway towards the cabin a strong gust of wind blew a large icicle from a tree branch. It crashed in front of Dancer and made her rear up out of fear. Maison felt himself being thrown from his saddle. He landed on his right arm. Maison heard the bone snap even above the howling of the wind. \n\nHe clutched his arm and screamed for Dancer to come back but the horse was already running away. Maison stumbled to his feet and tried to run after Dancer but the snow blinded him and and the pain in his arm flared up with each movement. He had to keep going though. If he stopped he would freeze to death. \n\nMaison followed behind Dancer's tracks as best he could but the snow moved fast to cover them. Maison felt lightheaded and had to stop to take a breath. He fell to his knees in the snow before falling on his left side. He felt darkness creeping up on him. His last thought was of Beatrice. \n\nBeatrice\n\nIt was the wind that finally woke her. She could hear it screaming through the trees and banging against the window panes. The cabin was cold and dark. She had slept too long and the fire in the stove had blown out. Beatrice quickly got out of bed and went over to the basket of firewood. She opened the door of the stove relieved to see that there were still a few embers burning. She took some dried leaves out of the basket to use as kindling and blew on it. After a few minutes there was enough of a fire to put the remaining split logs in. \n\nThe fire she'd made would be out in a couple of hours if she didn't get more firewood. Usually by this time of day Maison would have brought in wood when he came to take his midday meal. Beatrice could only conclude that he had purposefully stayed away to avoid seeing her. Beatrice couldn't blame him. Her stomach turned just at the thought of what she had said to him. \n\nBeatrice put on the coat that belonged to Maison's first wife and wrapped a wool shawl around her head. The wind nearly knocked her off of her feet. A storm was building and it would be upon them soon. She made her way over to the woodpile stacked against the barn and put as many split logs in the basket as she could. She brought it back to the cabin and put some more logs in the stove. \n\nIt was still daytime but the clouds were blocking most of the light. Beatrice had to light a few lamps to even see in the cabin. After another hour it began to snow and Beatrice became concerned about Maison. Surely he couldn't be so angry with her that he would put himself at risk of freezing to death. \n\nBeatrice went into the barn to check and see if he was in there. He wasn't and neither was Dancer. This sent Beatrice into even more of a panic. If Maison had taken Dancer with him that could mean that he had gone further out than he usually did. What if he became trapped by the snowstorm? Beatrice took a few bundles of rope hanging from the barn walls. She went to the outhouse and tied it to a post next to it and roped it towards the porch of the cabin. It would serve as a guide if the storm lasted for more than a day. \n\nShe would save the rest of the rope in case she had to go out searching for Maison and needed to find a way back. Beatrice went back to the cabin and began to pace back and forward, debating what she should do. Soon after she thought she heard Dancer whining outside. Beatrice burst out of the cabin and saw the horse standing outside. There was a bloody sack hanging off the side of Dancer's saddle and a dead bobcat strapped to her back. \n\n\"Maison! Maison are you here?\" Beatrice shouted but it had been swallowed up by the wind. \n\nBeatrice gripped the rope that hung from Dancer and tried to lead her to the barn. The horse pulled away in protest. Beatrice slapped Dancer then. She hadn't wanted to hurt the horse but she was scared and frustrated. Maison could be lying dead for all she knew. \n\nDancer whined and tried to pull away but once again Beatrice slapped her. She gripped the rope tighter and began pulling the horse towards the barn. Although she protested Beatrice managed to tie her up on a pole next to it. She went in the barn and lit a kerosene lamp. She had to find something that would allow her to drag Maison's body back in case he was injured. \n\nNext to Dancer's stall was a crude pine table that served as a workbench. She threw it onto it's side and looked for something that would allow her to take the legs off. She searched around quickly and found a small hacet hanging on the wall that was above the table. She quickly began hacking away at the wooden legs. The animals in the shed began to protest at the noise of the wood being hacked. \n\nOnce Beatrice had chopped off all four of the legs she used a chisel and the hatchet to punch out a small hole in the top plank. Her fingers were bloody from splinters but she hardly noticed. She had to get to Maison before the storm got worse. She cut some of the rope she had around her waist and looped it through the hole she'd made in the table. She tied it a couple of times and hoped that it would hold under Maison's weight. \n\nBeatrice dragged the table out of the barn and tied it to Dancer's saddle. Then she went towards the path with the kerosene lamp. She used the remaining rope and threw it over a branch that hung directly above the middle of the path. She tied the lamp up in the rope and let it hang in the path. Her hope was that the light from the lamp would indicate that she was close to the cabin in case she managed to get turned around by the storm. \n\nIt would most likely fail. A strong gust of wind could blow it down or the oil could burn out before they got back. But she had to try something. Beatrice didn't know how she would live with herself if Maison died. She untied Dancer and began pulling her. Beatrice didn't want to ride Dancer out of fear that Maison could be lying in the middle of the path and get run over. \n\nBeatrice held her skirts in one hand and started to jog and to Dancer's credit she actually followed behind. Beatrice began calling out Maison's name. Although, with the howling of the wind she was sure that he would not hear her. \n\nThe further she moved from the cabin the darker the sky became. It became hard to move as the snow at her feet began to collect and form into drifts. But she kept going and kept calling out his name. Beatrice's nose began to run and her fingers became stiff from the cold. Just when she began to lose hope she tripped over a large lump. At first she thought that it was a large stone but it was too soft. She reached down and began brushing snow off the figure. Her heart leapt in her chest when she realized it was Maison afterall. \n\nShe wiped off he snow that gathered on his face and held her hand under his nose. It took several moments but she finally felt warm air blowing out of his nostrils. Beatrice gripped Maison's coat and began dragging him towards the makeshift sled. She tied him down so he wouldn't fall off on the way back. She turned Dancer around so that she was facing back in the direction they came in. \n\nNow she had to mount Dancer. Beatrice had never ridden a horse before in her lifetime. Her mother would have considered it unladylike and there weren't enough horses on their trip out west for her to learn to ride. Plus Dancer was also still skittish. There was a chance the horse could just take off again. Beatrice decided that if she was going to do this that she would have to make her move quickly before Daner caught on to what she was doing.\n\nWith her right hand she gripped her skirts and then she put her foot in the saddle before reaching up with her left hand to swing herself upward. Dancer protested a little but didn't try to throw her off. \n\n\"Good girl.\"Beatrice patted her head. \n\nBeatrice tried to remember what she had observed men doing. She pressed her boots slightly in the horses's side and tried to shift her waist forward. That did nothing. So, Beatrice leaned forward, gripped the reins, and then reached back to smack Dancer's rear end. \n\nThe horse took off and Beatrice nearly fell backwards. She held on though. Dancer ran so fast that it almost felt like they were flying. Beatrice glanced behind her to make sure that Maison wasn't being jolted around too much. She turned back and was smacked in the face by a low hanging branch. It tore thin shreds of skin from her right cheek. She wanted to scream but she was afraid that it would scare Dancer. \n\nInstead she gritted her teeth and held on tighter. They rode on and Beatrice tried to distract herself from the pain in her cheek by looking out for the light of the lantern that she hung from the branch. She was beginning to get afraid that she had rode right past it when she saw a faint yellow glow in the distance. Beatrice raised herself up and gripped the reins. The more they rode the bigger the glow became. When the barn and cabin came into view Beatrice pulled the reins back making Dancer stop. Once again she patted the horse and complemented her. \n\nBeatrice jumped down and untied the sled from Dancer's saddle. She quickly led Dancer into the barn and unhitched her. She ran back outside and began dragging Maison towards the cabin. Once she reached the porch she untied him and grabbed the shoulders of his fur coat. Getting him inside was incredibly difficult due to Maison's weight and the heavy coat but she managed to do it. \n\nOnce inside she began stripping him out of the layers of clothing. Next she drug him onto the bed and stripped herself. It was when she got into bed with him that she noticed his right was broken. The lower half was hanging low and the bone was trying to poke through the skin. She had to set it or else it would become infected.\n\nBeatrice began tearing her petticoat into shreds to act as bondings. Beatrice had seen Carol do it for one of the children on the wagon train that had fallen off their wagon. Beatrice had to hold the boy down as Carol realigned his bone. Beatrice inhaled deeply, mustering up the last bit of courage she had and pushed the bone in the position that she thought was correct. Maison woke up and cried out. \n\nBeatrice grabbed a long piece she had torn off from her petticoat and began wrapping it around Maison's arm. She sat on his chest to prevent him from moving. She bent his arm and put it into a sling she made. Maison was still unconscious which made this a lot easer for her. Beatrice held her hand under his nose once more just to make sure that he was still breathing. Once she confirmed that he was she got back into bed with him.\n\nThe blood from the scar on her cheek had began to dry. She knew that she needed to clean it but she wanted to warm Maison up. Just because she had gotten him back to the cabin didn't mean that he was safe. Beatrice moved her feet over his in an up and down motion to generate some friction. She also put both of her hands on the sides of his face and blew on his nose and lips. Both had turned slightly blue from the cold. \n\nThe wind from the raging storm made the door rattle and the windows shake. Beatrice being from Chicago was used to such storms but back there she had a safe home stocked with coal and blankets. There were neighbors and doctors that could help an ailing family member. Out here there was no one around for miles except the two of them and Maison was depending on Beatrice to keep them alive. \n\nMaison\n\nThere was a strange ache in his right arm and Beatrice's hair was blocking his eyes The last thing Maison recalled was falling down in the snow as he chased after Dancer. He had no idea how he could have ended up back at the cabin and his first thought was that Bear had come back once the storm started up and came across him. \n\nBut when Maison called out for Bear there was no response. Could it be possible that Beatrice brought him back here? It was hard for Maison to imagine Beatrice carrying him back in the snow. He had seen her struggle to lift a heavy soup pot. How would she have been able to lift him? However she had managed to do it she had saved his life. \n\nJust then Beatrice shifted on his chest. She raised her head up and looked down at him. Maison's breath caught in his throat when he saw the scarr and dried blood on her cheek. He tried to reach up to touch her it but the pain in his arm made him stop. \n\n\"Don't move!\" Beatrice commaded. She sat up and moved towards the wall the bed was pushed up against. That's when he noticed that she was naked. Her breasts jiggled and the nipples stuck out from the cold air in the cabin. This was possibly the worst time for him to become aroused but he couldn't help it. Beatrice covered herself in a wool blanket. \n\n\"You need to stay in the same position as long as possible so your arm can set.\"\n\n\"You still didn't tell me how you managed to get me here.\" Maison said shifting himself into a more comfortable position on his back. \n\nSo Beatrice told him how when she saw Dancer come back alone without him she became concerned that he had injured himself while checking his traps So she made a table into a sled and hooked onto the back of Dancer's saddle before going out to find him. She had scarred up her cheek when she smacked into a low hanging branch on the ride back. \n\nWhen she got to this part of the story Maison again tried reach up to touch her cheek but this time he used his left hand. He pulled her face closer to examine it. It stretched from her right jawline almost up to her eye. There were four jagged lines spread across the whole cheek. They didn't appear too deep but still it would need to be cleaned before an infection set in. The scarr probably wouldn't look so nasty after all the blood had been cleaned off but there would still be a scarr. \n\n\"You need to wash the blood off then get the whiskey from the cabinet and pour it over your cheek to clean it.\" \n\nWhen he saw how scared she was he laughed a bit.\n\n\"If you could get me back to the cabin on your own without any help im sure you can handle this.\" \n\nBeatrice hesitantly got out of bed and walked over to the water barrel. She scooped some out into the washbowl and and swirled a towel around in it. She squeezed some of the excess water out of it and began gently wiping the dried blood off of her face. \n\nAs Maison watched her clean her face wound his admiration for her grew. He was ashamed of the things he said to her before he left the cabin. The woman he loved was no coward. She was the woman who had ridden out in a blizzard to save him and had injured herself in the process. She was just confused and scared. Scared of losing her remaining family. Scared of living in a world that didn't want them to be together. And from what she had done today it was clear to Maison that she was also scared of losing him. \n\nOnce Beatrice finished she put on a nightgown and got back under the furs with him. It felt good to have her soft, warm body next to his. He used his left arm and pulled her closer before planting a kiss on her forehead. She didn't pull away but instead snuggled closer to him.\n\n\"I ain't mad at you anymore. You do what you feel you need to, I won't hold it against you.\"\n\nBeatrice raised her head and looked at him for a moment before kissing him. Soon Maison was deepening the kiss. Exploring her mouth and intertwining their tongues. He put his left arm under her waist and slid his hand down her ass cheeks. Beatrice positioned herself on top of him and took her nightgown off. \n\nMaison pressed his growing manhood against her pelvis. She moaned in response. The sound was music to his ears. Maison reached up to squeeze one of her nipples and Beatrice pulled his long johns down to his ankles. Maison liked seeing this side of her. The one where she desired him. ",
        "Beatrice raised her hips a little and positioned herself right over his manhood. As she slowly lowered herself onto him Maison made sure to savor every moment as he knew that it might be the last time they were together like this. Even without experience Beatrice was able to bring them both pleasure. When they were finished they lay tangled in each other's arms. They didn't talk, just lay there enjoying the feel of the other's skin. Each wanting the moment to never end. \n\nLater in the night Maison heard Beatrice get up to put more wood in the stove and to check on the animals in the barn. He wanted so badly to help her but with his arm broken he was useless. Would be until it finally set.\n\nBy morning the storm was over. Beatrice had to shovel a path out to the outhouse and the barn. Those first few days she had to do practically all the chores in and out of the cabin. After a while he was able to start looking after Dancer and the other barn animals but his traps and furs remained neglected. He couldn't trap with an injured arm. He could run into a predator and need to shoot his gun and he needed both hands to skin and clean an animal. But if he let his traps go he would have barely any money to live on until next season.\n\nSo he brought Beatrice along with him. He taught her how to load and shoot his shotgun How to set the traps. And much to her disgust he taught her how to gut and skin an animal and prepare their hides for fur. As the last weeks of winter passed the couple established a routine together. In the mornings they took care of the chores in and around the cabin before going out at noon to check the traps. Maison didn't get as many furs as he would have had he not gotten his arm broke but at least he wouldn't starve come spring time. \n\nBeatrice\n\nThey had one more snowstorm before winter finally ended but it wasn't nearly as bad as the last one. Then came the day where the sun shone clear and bright. Nearly all of the snow had melted by then, making the streams on the mountain swell and gush with water. Neither of them said anything but both knew it was time for her to go. \n\nMaison's arm had set by then although he still needed to keep it in a sling most of the time. Beatrice was bringing in logs for the stove one morning when she spotted Maison bringing Dancer from the barn with a cart strapped to her saddle loaded with furs. Beatrice walked over to him basket still in her arms. \n\nMaison placed his good arm on the rim of the basket and moved Beatrice closer to himself. He moved his arm to the small of her back and kissed her forehead. Beatrice sighed and put her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat. A breeze blew by them and Beatrice could smell the pine seeds starting to bud. She wanted nothing more than to stay there with him forever. Maison rested his chin on the top of her head. \n\n\"I was thinking that we could head out before noon. We could be in town by night fall.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we wait until your arm heals?\" Beatrice asked looking up at him. \n\n\"It's healed enough. Besides I don't want to wait too long to bring my furs in. Won't get a good price.\"\n\nMaison gently rubbed her back and kissed her forehead once more.. He told Beatrice empty the ashes out of the stove and pack a bag for the trip. After he had walked away Beatrice stood there trying to hold back tears. She had asked for this but she certainly didn't want it. She hated the idea of not waking up next to Maison, never being able to eat supper with him again or seeing the beautiful woods surrounding the cabin. She inhaled sharply, holding her tears back. \n\nShe turned to bring the basket into the cabin. She looked around the dimly lit room for the last time before she began packing. She only had a couple of dresses that belonged to Maison's first wife and a comb and some under things. She finished that task pretty quickly then turned to packing some food and prepping the cabin for them to leave. \n\nWhen Beatrice went back outside Maison was loading more furs unto the cart. They were piled so high that Beatrice had to help him strap them down for the trip. They set off shortly after with Maison guiding Dancer and Beatrice sitting on Dancer's back. \n\nThe snowmelt had caused a stream to swell and wash away a path way needed to get to town. They had to re-route. It would take them longer and they would have to set up camp for the night. Hardly a word was said during the trip despite how long they'd been traveling. When the sun started to dip behind the horizon they finally stopped for the night.\n\nMaison tied Dancer and gathered brush for the fire while Beatrice prepared beans and salt pork. During supper Maison finally broke the silence by talking about what would happen once they finally reached the mining town. He told her that once they got there that he would sell his furs and they would use some of the money to buy her a train ticket back to Chicago. \n\nThere was a strange fluttering in her stomach as she listened to him. She would really be leaving for good. After she was gone they would never speak again. She would never be able to speak to anybody the time they spent together. It would be a secret that she would have to carry to her grave. \n\nBeatrice couldn't finish her dinner. All of a sudden she felt nauseous. She emptied the rest into the fire and told Maison that she wanted to retire early. They set up the tent together and Maison said that he would take care of the dishes. As much as she tried Beatrice couldn't sleep. Her mind wouldn't shut off. Her thoughts kept going back to Maison, her family, and the night Clara died. She desperately wanted Maison to come in the tent with her but for some reason she was too embarrassed to ask. \n\nWhen he finally did come in for the night Beatrice wasted no time in pushing her body against his. \n\n\"You cold?\" he asked. \n\n\"Yes\" was all she said. \n\nThey slept peacefully until Beatrice got up to make water in the middle of the night. When she came back Maison was still asleep. Beatrice quickly got under the covers again but she couldn't sleep. Instead she lay her head on his chest and listen to his heart thump from within. After a while she was lulled to sleep by it's rhythm. \n\nWhen Beatrice awoke the sun was out and Maison was gone from the tent. She smelled coffee and bacon wafting into the tent from the fire outside. She poked her head through the opening and saw Maison sitting on log cracking a couple of eggs into a greased frying pan. They greeted each other and Beatrice went to sit next to him on the log. Maison handed her a plate of eggs and bacon and a cup of coffee. Beatrice drank the coffee and ate the bacon but she couldn't eat the eggs. Looking at them made her stomach turn so she gave them back to Maison. \n\nAfter they took down camp they set off for town. Since they were no longer going downhill Maison didn't have to guide the cart behind Dancer. He rode on top in from of Beatrice and for this she was grateful. She wanted to hold him one last time. \n\nThey rode into town around three in the afternoon. It wasn't much to speak of. Just the mines shafts, a church, school house and a few saloons and general stores. There was also some railroad tracks and a dispatch office. Seeing so many people made Beatrice nervous. Them staring at she and Maison mouths agape certainly didn't help. Beatrice pressed harder into Maison's back. And Maison held on to one of her hands. She peeked over and saw him scowl at a man whose mouth hung open in an almost comical way. Beatrice was glad she had Maison there as protection.\n\nMaison finally stopped and tied Dancer outside of a dressmakers shop. He fished a couple of coins out of his coat pocket and handed them to Beatrice. \n\n\"This should be enough to send a telegraph back to Chicago. I'll have enough for a train ticket after I sell the furs.\"\n\nBeatrice nodded and walked off towards the post office. Maison watched until he saw her enter the turned and went inside the dressmaker's shop. Although the post office was small it was packed with people. Beatrice had to wait in line to send the telegram. Most of the people in the office turned to stare at her and whisper to each other. It made her nervous to be around so many people without Maison there. Finally it was Beatrice's turn. \n\nWhen she approached the counter the old man behind it looked up at her from under his glasses. He appeared to be both confused and annoyed by her presence. \n\n\"You lost gal?\" he croaked out.\n\n\"No sir, I need to send a telegram back to Chicago.\"\n\n\"Hmph. It'll be 20 cent per letter. Money upfront no store credit.\"\n\nBeatrice handed the man the money Maison had given her. When the man behind the counter asked what she wanted the message to say Beatrice had to take a deep breath. Her heart began pounding in her chest and her hands became moist. \n\nMaison\n\nMaison had managed to sell his furs for a decent price but he had to really haggle with the dressmaker. Fur was just not as lucrative as it once was. In the past he had been the one tailors and seamstresses sought after. Now he had to convince him to buy his stock. It seemed like the time had come for Maison to consider other ways to support himself. \n\nWhen he left the shop he saw Beatrice sitting on a wooden bench outside of the post office. Her leg was shaking as if she was anxious about something. Maison wondered if something had happened to her in his absence. He regretted leaving her alone. Maison put the envelope of money in his coat pocket and quickly walked over to where Beatrice was. \n\nWhen Maison reached Beatrice she looked up quickly. Her eyes became big for a second and she let out a short breath.\n\n\"Did something happen to you?\" he asked looking around for a possible assailant. \n\n\"No, im fine.\" Beatrice quickly reassured him. \n\nMaison rubbed her shoulders and pulled her a little closer towards himself. Some townspeople passing by turned back to stare at the two but Maison ignored them. \n\n\"We had better get going if we want to purchase that train ticket. \n\nMason held out his hand then and Beatrice took it. As they walked people on the boardwalk parted for them. Weather it was from shock or disgust Maison couldn't tell. He certainly didn't give a damn either way. \n\nWhen they were halfway towards the post office Beatrice stopped walking. Maison turned to see what was wrong. Beatrice was taking short breaths again and looking around nervously. \n\n\"Are you sure nothing happened to you?\" Maison asked soothingly. \n\n\"No, I have something to tell you.\"\n\nMaison waited while Beatrice worked up the nerve to tell Maison what was on her mind. \n\n\"I...I told my family about Clara's passing and that I was with you. I also told them that I wouldn't be returning.\" \n\nMaison stood there letting what she said really sink in. He clutched her hand tighter to the point where Beatrice had to tell him to stop. He looked down at her dark face once more before he kissed her. He heard someone shouting at them for a moment before all the noise of the town drifted away. Then it was just he and Beatrice. His love was staying with him. They would build a life together up there on that mountain. Maison was already picturing the children they would have together and he hoped that he would have a girl that looked just like Beatrice.\n\nWhen he broke the kiss her looked down at her face. She was smiling up at him and her eyes glowed like dark amber pools. \n\n\"Let's go home.\" She said taking his hand in hers."
