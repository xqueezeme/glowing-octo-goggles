Unless I so getting a total mental block or I so hung up on other more exciting story of course. So you can thank Joeytheroo for this story coz his comment so kick-started me on story I so meaning to get round to starting on for so long time now. \n\nFor so new readers, so good idea to read Strawberry Chapters 1,2 and 3 first (even though so not being essential to enjoyment and not so emphasizing use of \"so\" before Chapter 3). Overall story so making more sense if so doing. But if not so inclined, so not to be worrying. So to be reading and enjoying. Also stating now that currently viewed Strawberry Story also has so long lead in. Sex so largely in last half of story (so sorry, not being a short stroke story. So not wanting to lead you so far astray before you starting to read). So saying this, author has so lot of fun writing lead-in. Author so hoping reader find lead-in so entertaining as preliminary to so very hot steaming sex (author so knowing that why we all here \u2013 author so disregarding and downplaying literary aspirations of so esteemed and charming self). \n\nFor readers with so blinding PC blinkers on who might be so offended by some of Strawberry's views, so sorry, story so fiction. Strawberry so fictional character. Strawberry's opinions and views on life, American politics, Chinese politics, guns, crime, capital punishment, insider trading, blackmail and both Chinese and Americans of various persuasions are stated for so purely fictional purposes. So intending laughter as result. So not tolerating so very stupid PC comments in Comments section. So stating if no sense of humor or if taking offense so easily, so please to be plucking eyeballs out and not reading so funny entertaining and so sexy steaming hot story any further. Author emphasizing this so very strongly.\n\nAs always, author so thanking you all (except for so unattractive PC persons and so scary Trolls naturally) so much for reading so charming well written little story and enjoying (author so hoping you to be enjoying). So hard work writing, so good to know you so enjoying happy little stories and so wanting more.

Author so happy getting those comments and ratings \u2013 even those so anonymous comments from so scary trolls ... author so shivering with fear in anticipation of so scary feedback from so nasty scary American trolls (Chinese trolls of course so nice and friendly to so esteemed and so charming and so beautiful author who writing so well expressed stories about so charming and beautiful Shanghai girl). \n\nAuthor also so raising eyebrow of derision in anticipation of so un-sensible feedback from PC persons so lacking in humor (so unfunny PC comments of course to be deleted so immediate by self). But really, in state of actuality, author so knowing and understanding that so nasty troll feedback so useful in letting author know all right buttons so being impacted. PC feedback of course so useless and so unwanted. PC persons so requested to so not to be wasting time of so esteemed author, who has so many better ways to spend time. Like so ongoing writing of so very sexy hot stories with so steamy endings, all to be worthy of five star ratings by so esteemed readers (author so of course not hinting).\n\nOh! And author also hoping so esteemed and valued readers so continuing to so enjoy so frequent use of \"So.\" So requesting your comments on this approach to so mutilating of English language into so funny Chinglish so as to know whether to continue or not. Esteemed author so enjoying use of so. So much fun. So many giggles. So hoping readers so sharing author's sense of what so funny. So wondering if so overdoing it. So wanting your comments on this. Now stopping so yap yap yappy introduction. Author now so eager you go ahead and read so excellent story.\n\nSo LOL ... your so charming author, Chloe-berry\n\n<p align=\"center\"> Strawberry Under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part I \u2013 I'll Keep You Warm</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"> You've got cold feet and fingers\nAnd you're thinking of home\nIf I put my arms around you\nTake you in from the storm\nFrom your autumn through winter\nDarling I'll keep you warm </p>\n<p align=\"right\">Winter Song, Chris Rea</p>\n\n\"Would you like some pizza, Strawberry? There's enough here for you if you want some.\" Ramona look up as I dash in the front door after my one and only morning class. My last class before so joyfully anticipated Christmas break.\n\n\"So sorry, Ramona, have to finish packing. Alan picking me up in half hour.\" I smiling so happily. Ramona so nice to be offering but I so not interested in food. I so wanting to finish packing. Alan coming for me soon. Such an honor to be invited to stay with Alan's family for Christmas and New Year. So nice to have somewhere to go for Christmas. \n\nAll my housemates going home for Christmas. So sad for me if I the only girl left in our house. So thoughtful of Alan to invite me to his parents home. So telling me he love me. He mentioning so wanting to take me home to meet parents. I so nervous of escalation in relationship. So explaining seriousness of visit to parents in Chinese culture to Alan. Alan so understanding. Alan so explaining seriousness of intentions to me.\n\nSo heart-stopping rapture to know Alan love me so very much. So wonderful to know Alan so dedicated to continued blossoming of so loving relationship. So nice of Alan's little sister Gwen to help persuade me to come visit family home for so extended stay. So worried about what Alan's parents will think of me. So wanting to make good impression. Alan so important to me. Alan so lovable. I so nervous about meeting Alan's family.\n\nSo dashing up the stairs to my bedroom. So busy finishing packing my suitcases. What to pack? Gwen told me they have big family dinners. Go out to parties. Visit friends. Go to restaurants in Duluth. Go to Church on Christmas Day. Wondering what Church is like? So exciting. I never go to a Church before. So mysterious place. Maybe like Bhuddist temple that Grandma take me too when I so young and impressionable? Mommy so scolding Grandma so lengthy for exposure of vulnerable and impressionable youth of so modern and progressive country to so superstitious practices. Mommy so emphasizing to Grandma such anti-social behavior never to be repeated.\n\nBut I so remembering beautiful and historic Jing'an Temple as place of so spiritual and tranquil experience. So remembering Buddha as big and fat and happy and so smiling always. Remembering expression on face of Jade Bhudda also so beautiful, so peaceful. So peaceful also the chanting of the monks. So lovely the smell of incense, so beautiful the sea of light from so many flickering candles. Now I so curious about Church. So thinking of going to Church. But now I also remembering from so limited knowledge that Church have man nailed up on cross on wall. I see photos. So horror. So not wanting to see dead man nailed to wall. Dead man nailed to wall so not creating atmosphere of spirituality and tranquility. Maybe not thinking of Church after all.\n\nGwen promise to take me skiing so to have fun in snow. That much more fun. Much happier thought. So important to look good for every occasion. One suitcase definitely not enough for nice clothes for every possibility. Also, I have to think about what to wear at night. So important to look good for Alan at night. Alan so naughty. Gwen tell me I to have the spare bedroom. Probably Alan so eager to see me he sure to visit me in spare bedroom every night. So nice a thought. Every night with Alan. So bliss. So many nights. So many cute and sexy bedtime items to wear for Alan to take off me. So big my happy smile as I pack so carefully. \n\nAlso winter clothes. So not forgetting packing of winter clothes. So not forgetting Alan's family lives up in north. So far north. Northern Minnesota. On Lake Superior. One of so enormous Great Lakes. Snow and ice. Blizzards. Probably glaciers and icebergs. Wild animals. Bears. Maybe Grizzly Bears. Thinking perhaps Polar Bears? Oh no! So shivering. Bears so dangerous. Bears eat people. Thinking perhaps need so exists for gun for self-defense against so dangerous man-eating bears. Not enough time to buy gun. I knowing how to shoot 95 Sh\u00ec Z\u00ecd\u00f2ng B\u00f9qi\u0101ng* so well from volunteer service in People's Liberation Army Militia while at High School. Not knowing if so excellent rifle available for sale in America*. \n\nSo regretting not expressing concern for defense against bears to Alan earlier. Too late now. So staying close to Alan. So trusting he protect me. Alan so big and strong. So confident Alan know what to do about bears. So thinking maybe I should get some bear spray if possible. Cathy goes hiking with her boyfriend. She knows about bears. I dash down the hallway to ask her. Knock on door. No answer. Open door. No Cathy. \n\n\"She's already left, Strawberry.\" Linda's voice.\n\n\"Oh.\" So worried now. So needing bear spray. America so dangerous. So much wildlife. Those cute little deer, like Bambi, so cute and so safe. Thinking perhaps so tasty too. But also Bears. Wolves. Mountain Lions. In far north, those big scary animals with those huge spiky things on their heads. Not to mention Minneapolis so near to where family of Alan live. Reading about Minneapolis in news. And Chicago. And Detroit. And Birmingham. And New Orleans. Los Angeles. Miami. Atlanta. Philadelphia. Pittsburg. Boston. Cincinnati. \n\nSo many other American cities. So big list. So much danger. So many bad people in American cities. Reading American news so scary. So many bad people with knives and guns and explosive devices and mental health problems running around screaming so bad expressions of violent religiosity, so similar to so uncivilized natives of remote Xinjiang who dealt with so kind and firm by so benevolent and wise Chinese Police. So thinking benevolence and firmness of Chinese Police so admirable. \n\nAlso thinking so interesting freedom of access to guns in America also so admirable. I so thinking personal 95 Sh\u00ec Z\u00ecd\u00f2ng B\u00f9qi\u0101ng so useful acquisition if available. So excellent firepower when dealing with such bad people. So excellent in repelling attacks of savage man-eating bears also. If not being available, I understanding in America so many alternatives existing. But despite so tough militia training at High School* I so not sure of appropriateness of carrying big gun. So unfashionable accessory, although Beijing Women's Militia Clang Rose unit* making look so good. \n\nI so wanting to join Clang Rose Militia unit when I in High School. Clang Rose unit so fashionable in Beijing, so many girls like me joining. Looking so good whilst displaying necessary appropriate level of support by persons in public eye for so very knowledgeable and caring Government of Peoples Republic. I not in Beijing now though. I in America. I enquiring so immediate on arrival, so surprised to be finding Militia so not fashionable here. So thinking should have thought of personal safety earlier. So not a concern in Shanghai. I always so safe in Shanghai.\n\nSo worried now about personal safety on long journey. I so wishing Americans wise enough to ask for advice from so nice friendly helpful Chinese police. Chinese police so knowing how to deal so effectively with bad people. Chinese re-education system for bad people so effective. Almost no-one in China so silly enough to re-offend. If they prove so stupid as to re-offend, so helpful Chinese police take far away to Xinjiang, never to return. Really bad people, well, Chinese Police shoot so immediate. So simple fast effective punishment. Bad people so not repeating crime after execution. \n\nChinese Police charge family for bullet. Bad people so obviously fault of parents. Only fair that bad parent's pay. In China, bad parents so feeling shame. In China, bad parents not rioting in streets and burning down buildings. If burning down buildings in China, bad parents also sent for so necessary educational experience in Xinjiang or if so irredeemable crimes against the people committed, so also shot.* People's Government so wise in ways of maintaining order and respect for law.\n\nChinese peoples government so sensible. Chinese police so capable. Chinese judges and lawyers so knowing their role in legal system and following so knowledgeable guidance of so respected people's government. So not wasting everyone's time defending indefensible and making so annoying and time-wasting appeals. In China sentences implemented so fast and in so wise manner. China so safe, proving wise policies of Peoples Government so correct. Chinese police solve America crime problem so fast if wise advice only followed. \n\nRamona and Cathy and Linda all so horrified when I say that. So scolding me. I so not understanding why they liking bad people so much. So puzzled. Surely better to send bad people far away from so civilized people or if bad people so very bad, removing from society on permanent basis? So not comprehending reasons for rejection. So not mentioning again.\n\nCathy's hiking equipment all piled up in corner of room. Cathy so messy. I step into room, look at pile of hiking equipment. Cans? I look closer. Bear Spray! Yes! So saved. Cathy not minding if I borrow. Paper? Pen. Yes. So fast to write a note, tell Cathy I borrow her bear spray, I buy her new can if I use it. Otherwise bring it back. So relieved when I add that bear spray to my luggage. Feeling so much safer now. \n\nSo concerned to see my three little suitcases all so full. So worried that Alan's car might not have room. Only two door Dodge Challenger. So big engine, so small space for luggage. I so wondering if anything missed? Gasp! I remembering I so forgetting to pack my bathroom bag. Hurry into bathroom, pack everything that might be necessary. So surprised at how many essentials a girl who wears almost no makeup has. Filling my overnight bag. Overnight for makeup, maybe. \n\n\"Strawberry, Alan's here.\" Ramona call out from downstairs.\n\n\"I coming ... I coming.\" I pick up my little overnight bag, struggle to carry downstairs. Needing both hands. Makeup so heavy! Drop bag, let crash to floor, give Alan big hug. My Alan so handsome, so wonderful. So on time. And miracle! I ready on time too! So very amazing occurrence!\n\n\"Wow, everything packed already, Strawberry? Travelling light?\" Alan picks up my little overnight bag. Looks so surprised.\n\n\"That my makeup.\" I so smiling. Alan so funny. \"My suitcases upstairs.\" I make so big eyes at him. \"So heavy for me, Alan, can you help me bring them down?\"\n\n\"Sure, let's get your suitcase.\" So happy when Alan smile at me so lovingly, follow me upstairs. So surprised when he looks at my three little suitcases and say \"Holy Shit, Strawberry! Did you pack the kitchen sink?\" \n\n\"No.\" I say, so concerned. His parents not have sink? Do they wash everything in buckets maybe, like poor peasants back in China? So heart pounding. So anxious. So stress. \"Uh, Alan, if we need sink, we could stop at Home Depot?\" Now I sweating. How to fit kitchen sink in car? Can we buy in time? I so worried. I buy Christmas presents for everyone, maybe I should have bought kitchen sink for parents earlier? \n\nWhy Alan not telling me before? Why only now, at last moment? What else do Alan's parents need? Does Alan expect me to buy everything for kitchen for parents? I so not knowing American customs. My allowance from Daddy so big, so not a problem if this customary practice, maybe like Indian dowry system I reading about, but so wishing Alan tell me earlier. Could have bought and sent by FedEx. Now is too late. Even so efficient FedEx not that fast. So heart sinking. So failing to be good potential daughter-in-law and not even close to meeting potential-parents-in-law-to-be yet. So crestfallen my expression.\n\nSo wondering why Alan looking at me and laughing.\n\n\"No, no, no, Strawberry, it's just an expression for packing so much luggage.\"\n\nOhhhh, anxiety so abated. English so strange language. Say one thing, mean another. So shaking my head. So relieved that Alan only joking. So wondering if they really do have kitchen sink? So hoping they have dishwasher in addition to sink. Surely they not expecting me to wash dishes. I not girl from farm. Washing dishes so ruin my nails. So bad for skin. Wondering if they have maid? Hoping so. If not, I hire one for stay. Must be maids available, cannot be so uncivilized place as to be lacking Filipinas or Mexicans for necessary cleaning work, even if in far north.\n\n\"I not pack very much, just essentials.\" So wondering why Alan say I have so much luggage. I look so puzzled at my three little suitcases. Bare essentials only. When I fly here from Shanghai to start College, I have twelve suitcases. Big suitcases, not so small ones like these. Airline make so much fuss. Airline want so huge excess baggage payment. So big argument. I so losing temper with intransigence of check-in clerk. I flying First Class. Surely no problem. Longwei paying so much for ticket for me. So big argument. Finally resorting to mentioning my boyfriend Longwei Wang, son of banking tycoon Chaoxiang Wang, so major shareholder in airline, standing over there looking so bored while waiting with Shanghai paparazzi to say bittersweet goodbyes to beloved girlfriend. \n\nSo expressing acuteness of annoyance. Asking First Class check-in clerk if needing to talk to Longwei to clarify situation. Airline clerk looking at Longwei and so changing mind instantly. Fortunately check-in clerk not smart enough to be asking why I not flying to America on private jet of Chaoxiang Wang. So humiliating to tell truth, that Longwei only here with me for last blowjob earlier in morning in hotel room and now being polite for reasons of newspaper publicity in gossip columns. As soon as I say I going to America, Longwei so no longer interested in me. I so knowing Longwei only here for sad and tragic goodbye photos.\n\nKnowing successor no doubt already lined up, I so taking humiliation and bad temper out on check-in clerk. Longwei so unconcerned but check-in clerk not knowing that. Check-in clerk seeing Longwei, suddenly so obsequious and helpful. Obviously my baggage not excess, so obviously all essential items only. Check-in clerk so apologizing for mistake. All so clear now. Airline initially so not understanding that a girl has to travel with her so essential clothes. And her shoes. \n\nGasp! Eyes widen. Aiiiyaaahhhh! So forgot to pack shoes.\n\n\"What are you doing, Strawberry?\" Alan watch me, sound so puzzled.\n\nI look back over shoulder, pulling out shoes and boots from racks along bedroom wall. \"I forget to pack shoes, Alan. Pass me empty bag from over there, please. No, the biggest one.\" Okay, just the essentials Strawberry. Only the absolute essentials. Travelling so light. Little black heels for restaurant. Only taking two pairs. So embarrassing to wear same shoes out more than once but I have to bite bullet. Winter boots, five pairs that I buy last week to cope with possible variations in conditions of weather in far north. ",
        "So hard to buy snow boots here in south of America where usually no snow. Online shopping so useful. Understanding from map that Canada even further north than Northern Minnesota. Understanding Canada has even more snow and even colder so making decision to buy snow boots online from Canada. Also lots of Chinese people in Canada for some reason, so correct size in winter boots so easy to find. Finding company called Canadian Tire*. So weird name. So interesting to see so impressive range of clothing and footwear for snow conditions. So buying delightful selection of winter boots. And winter clothing. So happy that FedEx delivery so fast from Canada to America.\n\nCasual shoes. Outdoor shoes. Couple of extra pairs of casual shoes. Nice indoor shoes for parties and family dinners. Okay, only two pairs, Jimmy Choo of course, for parties and family dinners. So not overpacking. Bag already so jammed full. I zip up, look at Alan. I so proud at extreme economy of packing. I so capable of self-sacrifice when necessary. \"Done.\"\n\nAlan looking so impressed at minimal luggage, I can tell. I take bag of shoes. Shoes so unexpectedly heavy. So straining to carry. Alan pick up two of my suitcases. One in either hand. Muscles bulge. Alan sooooo strong. Alan so ripped. Looking at him, I so melting. I so wanting to push him back on my bed, take clothes off, examine muscles so closely; maybe play Cowgirl's and Alan's. Such a fun game. So exciting to play.\n\n\"God, Strawberry, stop looking at me like that. Stop right now.\" Alan grins at me. \"We've got a long drive today and tonight. We need to leave right now.\" Alan so emphatic. So commanding. So much willpower. So surprised at Alan's willpower. He so strong-minded. I so admiring strength of will in man. So impressive.\n\nI giggle. \"Okay.\" My agreement so unusually meek and obedient. So not making fuss. We leaving now, Alan say he intend to drive all afternoon and all night so we get to his parents tomorrow morning. Driving more than a thousand miles. So far! So major adventure. I so excited. So venturing into the unknown. Like going to Tibet, except Tibet have so many nice Chinese people as well as so picturesque Tibetan people benefitting from so civilizing Chinese influence. So not sure who lives in Northern Minnesota besides Alan's family. So far in north, who knows? Eskimos? Indians maybe? I know we going through Minneapolis. Minneapolis has Somalis*. Gasp!\n\nI read American news so diligent to learn all about new country of residence. National Enquirer so informative, so easy to understand. New York Post so full of useful tips. Alex Jones provide so great commentary, so articulate and passionate observer of current events. From so educational news outlets, learning so much. Puzzled by so much also but no doubt deeper understanding coming as base of knowledge expands with ongoing reading and viewing. Already understanding however that Somalis in Minneapolis so obviously not benefitting from civilizing influence of American people. So scary. Eyes so wide. I so brave to go through Minneapolis, even with Alan to protect me. So courageous of me. Feeling so proud of myself going through such dangerous city. So not going to any shopping malls in Minneapolis though, even though I so brave. I not that brave.\n\nAlan tell me I can sleep while he drive through night. So not fair on Alan but so good of him. I so proud of Alan. So not wanting to make difficulties for him. I ready to go. Wearing so nice practical clothes to travel in. Jeans. Plaid shirt. So nice and warm. Carry my so nice winter jacket, Judy Hua* of course. Who else? I so proud to be wearing clothes of so talented Shanghai designer. So nice of her to design my outfits for Miss Shanghai contest. I so grateful, so wearing Judy Hua designs on all dates with Longwei. So ensuring mention of designer in gossip columns on almost daily basis. Judy Hua so thanking me, so designing nice clothes and gifting for me to take to America. So sad nobody in America know who Judy Hua is yet.\n\nPick up my winter coat, gloves, woolly hat, all bought from Canadian Tire online store so to aid in survival in remote icy fastness of Northern Minnesota. Such a wild savage place. Woods and bears and wolves and snow. So like Manchuria. So probably lacking civilized amenities like fashion clothing shops and dim sum restaurants and estheticians for manicures, pedicures and other essentials of life. Doing my own nails for whole week. No facials. No Brazilians either. I making so stunning sacrifices to improve probability of success of so blooming and beauteous relationship. I also feeling so brave and adventurous leaving civilization behind.\n\nSo thankful I have emergency Brazilian yesterday. Actually, I have complete emergency body wax yesterday along with facial, manicure, pedicure and also visiting hair stylist for little trim. Such a busy afternoon and evening. So anticipating lack of amenities in far northern wilderness. Daddy teach me to plan for all eventuality so well. I know my Daddy so proud of my foresight if he here. Although maybe not mentioning Brazilian to Daddy. Daddy so not understanding why girl needs to make herself so extremely attractive. Then again, Daddy having two wives plus mistress. Maybe Daddy is understanding need for attractiveness. But still, no intention of mentioning details to Daddy. Lots of things Daddy not needing to know.\n\nFollow Alan downstairs. Pull on winter boots. My brand new Michael Kors Wedges. So beautiful boots, so looking cool as well as warm. Warm? They so hot! My feet sweating already. Alan blink at my boots. Say nothing. I smile. So fashionable winter boots. So liking that admiring look at my boots from Alan. So kicking them off as soon as we in car.\n\nSo sad to part with housemates. \"Bye Ramona, bye Linda, see you in January.\"\n\n\"Bye Strawberry. And Alan, you make sure you look after her really really well, or you're in deep deep doo doo.\" Ramona so sweet.\n\n\"Have fun Strawberry, see you when we're all back. Bye Alan. And you know what Strawberry's like. You really take care of her, okay, really really, or we're coming for you.\" Ohhhh, Linda so thoughtful. Loving my housemates so much.\n\nI so smiling. My housemates so caring for me. So thinking of me. They hug me. Lots of hugs. Lots of goodbyes. So many Christmas wishes and Happy New Years. So wonderful housemates. While Ramona and Linda and I saying goodbyes, Alan so busy packing my suitcases and bags and boxes of presents for family and extra winter clothes in his car. So sad to leave so wonderful housemates. \n\nSo happy when Alan holds car door open for me, helps me into passenger seat, tucking me in so carefully. So looking after me. So caring. I smiling so happy, loving Alan so much. So looking forward to adventure of travel.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><bold> * * * </bold></p>\n\nSuch a long drive. Hours and hours on Interstates. Alan such a good driver, Challenger such nice car. Sound so good driving on Highway. We talk all afternoon while Alan drive. I asking so many questions. So wanting to know. Alan tells me about his family. Mom and Dad. Grandparents. Aunts and Uncles and cousins. Little Sister Gwen and Big Brother Patrick. So many friends. Growing up in remoteness of far north of state of Minnesota. Sailing in summer. Skiing in winter. Snowmobiling. Camping in snow. Working in family business of lumber. Lakes and forests and hiking and fishing and hunting. So much fun, so much adventure. So different from growing up in Shanghai where only hunting I did was for next boyfriend or good restaurant or club or karaoke bar.\n\nAlan play nice music for me. Such good music to listen to. Alan have such good taste in Cantopop. Not telling him he bought Cantonese music from Hong Kong, not Mandarin music. Not understanding Cantonese dialect but I knowing from large selection of music that Alan work so hard to make sure I happy. Understanding Alan make such effort special for me, I so happy, even listening to Cantopop. North through Illinois on I57, mile after endless mile, I74 from Champaign to Bloomington. So interesting to drive on Interstate freeways. America have such good highways. So empty compared to China. So much land, so beautiful landscape, so scenic, so few people. America such a lucky country.\n\nWe stop for gas. Alan show me how to put gas in car. So exciting to fill my first gas tank. Opening gas cap. Taking hose from pump. So heavy, almost dropping on concrete. So squeaking. Holding handle with both hands so careful, placing nozzle in hole in side of car, squeezing, listening to gas pouring into tank. So hoping gas will stop when hand stops squeezing. So reassuring to know Alan beside me to help if something goes wrong. So much gas needed to fill tank in big car. So liking look of American Muscle Car. So relieved when I stop squeezing and gas stops coming out. Alan shows me how to put hose back on pump, how to put cap back on gas tank. So exciting! So jumping up and down clapping hands at success. Alan laughing so hard at me. I so smiling. So much confidence gained.\n\nWe eat at gas station stop. Subway. American fast food so nice. So much fun to order. Girl behind counter so not understanding me but so friendly. So smiling. Everyone smiling. Everyone so friendly. Alan translates order so happily. Sub so yummy. Hot chocolate with cream and sugar so nice. So loving travelling in America. Just like in movies except better. So feeling like brave explorer venturing into wild foreign land with handsome native guide. Alan laugh so hard when I tell him. \n\nI asking man by next car to be taking selfie of me and Alan with big muscle car behind us. I so posting on Facebook. Photo will so impress my friends in Shanghai. Combination of Alan and big black Muscle Car with me looking so beautiful and charming sure to be hit. If Alan stripping to muscle shirt to show ripped muscles, maybe even going viral. \"No way.\" Alan so emphatic. Man by next car laughing, saying \"do it, dude.\" I pleading. I begging. Others at gas station offering encouragement. Alan ending up complying with request. So blushing as doing so. Everyone smiling as Alan pump up muscles and pose. I so ecstatic as cuddling up to so hunky guy for photos. I know my friends so going to be jealous like cats. End up doing group photo with guys at gas station. Americans so wonderful friendly people.\n\nEveryone waving goodbyes. So enjoying calls of \"yo, hot babe you got there, dude,\" as we climb back in car. So posting Facebook update from iPhone so immediate. So enjoying as watching Post go viral in Shanghai so instantaneous. Alan so embarrassed when I tell him already over ten thousand likes in first ten minutes from followers who so interested in life of self in America. So many comments about hunky guy. So many Shanghai girls thinking Alan so hot. I so smiling. So rude comments about what I doing with so hunky guy. So many Shanghai guys so jealous. So blushing at rudeness of wording.\n\nDarkness now falling. So dark, so cold outside now. So happy with nice warm Michael Kors Wedges keeping toes so warm and snug. I so curled up in big comfortable passenger seat with blanket and pillow Alan so thoughtful to bring for me. So warm and cosy, so sleepy as night gets darker and darker. North on I39, cross into Wisconsin, change onto I90, drive towards so dangerous city of Minneapolis. Alan drive on, hour after hour. \n\nI wake up in middle of night, still so dark, feel so sorry for Alan, wishing I could drive. Maybe when we get back I learn to drive. Cannot be too hard. Everyone here in America seem to do it. In past weeks I even see Chinese girls driving. Maybe American Chinese girls? Maybe not. I not sure. But knowing also I not to rely on Alan for everything. I in America now and needing to be independent girl, not relying on guys. So liking newfound independence. Sometimes. Maybe on return I buy own car. Maybe nice little Porsche but so thinking now that maybe not. \n\nPorsche German car. So nice car but I in America now. I should drive American car. Not wanting Muscle Car like Alan's. Wanting cute car. Maybe nice little Jeep Wrangler. Always liking little two door jeep, so cool playful outdoorsy looking car. Pink Jeep Wrangler with big fat wheels and \"Hummer Rescue Service\" sticker would be so American. All my friends in Shanghai would be so laughing at Hummer Rescue Service sticker, appreciating joke when seeing. I not outdoorsy girl but who care, all my friends back in Shanghai not outdoorsy either but they so admiring of adventurous outdoorsy spirit displayed. Not needing to actually be outdoorsy. So unnecessary to expose self to sun and inclement weather. Outdoorsy spirit displayed so more than sufficient.\n\nI knowing already all my friends in Shanghai so jealous seeing topless blonde blue-eyed Alan beside me as he sitting in passenger seat of pink jeep displaying so hunky muscles, so ripped body. Ohhhh, I so shivering with pleasure at so exciting thought. Already knowing so exciting photo no doubt going viral too. Mind so made up. So shopping for little jeep on return after Christmas Break. Little pink jeep with so hunky Alan fitting new post-Longwei media image so effective, so un-ostentatious and yet so cute. So perfect image of life in America for newly-arrived Shanghai girl. We stop again. More gas. More coffee for Alan. Walk around, stretch legs. \"Almost at Minneapolis,\" Alan tells me. \"Only a couple of hours to go.\" \n\nI scared at nearness of so dangerous city in conjunction with so lack of necessary defensive firepower. So remembering words of wise and so distinguished-looking Peoples Liberation Army militia instructor Sergeant Han. He so experienced. Our High School senior girls' militia unit so listening with rapt attention as Sergeant Han recount his part in magnificent defense against so deluded and misguided Vietnamese enemies of glorious Peoples Republic by so heroic and skilled Peoples Liberation Army. So remembering phrase he use with regard to savage war fought against invading Vietnamese imperialists so long ago in 1979* when Sergeant Han so brave and courageous young soldier.\n\n\"As available firepower increases, the situation incapable of favorable outcome increasingly approaches zero.\" Sergeant Han so erudite in explaining how heroic Peoples Liberation Army blow crap out of so deluded and misguided Vietnamese enemies. We girls all so admiring of so tough-looking Sergeant Han. I so missing availability of personal 95 Sh\u00ec Z\u00ecd\u00f2ng B\u00f9qi\u0101ng firepower with which to ensure high probability of favorable outcome of encounter with bad people if necessary while driving through Minneapolis. I so tired I sleep anyhow. Alan still wide-awake, drinking more coffee. Alan wake me if danger. Can always use bear spray if necessary. If bear spray working so effective on so horrible scary man-eating bears, must be working on bad people too.\n\nI go back to sleep, curled up in passenger seat, so tired from trip. I wake up when Alan stops again. \"Halfway to Duluth,\" he tells me. \"I need a quick nap, going to sleep for an hour or so.\" I look outside. Shiver. Ground is white everywhere. Snow. But inside car so nice and warm. I so relief at passing scary Minneapolis-city safely. I look at Alan. He look so tired. I smile. I know way to relax Alan, help him nap better. \n\nAlan eye me so suspiciously. \"Strawberry?\" he say.\n\n\"Mmmmm,\" I smile, undoing my seat belt. \"Move your seat back, Alan. Lie back, close eyes.\" He does. I smile. Reach out, undo belt, unzip jeans as his eyes fly open. \n\n\"Huh? What? Strawberry?\"\n\n\"Shhhh,\" I hush him, smiling. \"I help you relax, Alan.\" Fingers so gently ease object of desire out from within concealing boxers. So yummy looking in dim lights of gas station rest area. So gently kissing tip, flickering tongue out to lick tip as fingers ease foreskin down, hold yummy diao upright, watching it turn into di diao before my eyes.\n\n\"Magic,\" I gasp, so intrigued. \"So small one moment, so big next moment, how this happen?\" I look at Alan, my eyes so wide, so enquiring. My mouth so greedy, so slipping down length of di diao, so wanting to see how much of him I can get inside mouth. So enjoying, So delicious. So exciting. Alan think so too.\n\n\"Ohhhh Jesus,\" Alan groan so enthusiastically as my tongue swirls on him, as I slide my lips up and down his length. Alan instantly so much more excited, his hands holding my head, brushing my hair back so he can see me. So liking Alan to see me, so moving my fingers down to the base of his di diao so he can see my lips sliding down him, see my lips sliding back up as I suck on him. See my tongue as I lift my lips and lick him instead.\n\nNo wasting time, Strawberry, no teasing. Alan need nap, not exercise. My hand stroke him fast, my mouth suck on him, my head bobbing up and down so happily. Strawberry's turn to work, I tell myself. This sort of work so much fun. So enjoyable. Not possible for me to drive, but this help Alan sleep so well. I lift my mouth for a moment to smile at Alan, my hand still stroking him. So hard. So wanting more but so thinking of Alan.\n\n\"Don't stop for fuck's sake,\" Alan groan, his hands pulling my head back down. So greedy of him. \n\nSo happy to satisfy Alan's hunger. My mouth plunge down. Tip of di diao all the way into throat. I so good. Do again and again, so fast, so enthusiasm. So yummy fun. So regretting no playtime. Alan groan so loud, hips jerking on seat. He going to sh\u00e8j\u012bng, I know. He does sh\u00e8j\u012bng, spurting out so fast, so much of it. So tasty to swallow. Swallow so greedily. Swallow and swallow and swallow. Not wasting any drop. Alan spurt and spurt and spurt. So much to swallow. Have to swallow so fast. Keep swallowing until he finish. Lick him clean. He groan one last time. I lick lips. Mmmmm, so tasty. Alan look so happy as I tuck him away, so carefully zip up. Not to make that mistake I make once with first boyfriend in Shanghai. So remembering screams of pain. So awful memory.\n\n\"Strawberry, I love you.\" His hand strokes my head, he smile, his eyes close. Instantly he fast asleep.\n\nI look down at him, so big, so handsome, so caring, so mine. I smile so happy. Rest my head on his chest, close eyes. Feel so secure, so safe, so much love and happiness with Alan. So looking forward to meeting Alan's family. So nervous too, but Gwen will be there. Gwen so nice to me. Such a wonderful little sister. I so sleepy now too. So relaxed. So nice taste in mouth as sleep comes.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><bold> * * * </bold></p>\n\nWake up slowly, eyes opening. I still so tired. Lights from gas station light up inside of car. Car so cold, breath puffs out in big cloud, but I so warm and snug. Windows covered in white. Alan still fast asleep. Everything so white. Snow? Is that snow? So excited to see snow. Tiredness vanish so instantaneous. Snow in Shanghai so dirty, disappear so fast. This snow so white, so clean, so fresh, like Christmas Card snow. Ohhh, so beautiful snow. I lie half on Alan, head on his shoulder, big thick winter coats pulled over both of us to keep us warm. Not me doing that. Alan must have woken up and done that without disturbing me. So nice of Alan. I love him so much.\n\n\"Mmmm, Strawberry?\" Alan stirs beneath me, yawning. Looks at his watch. Nice watch I buy for Alan of Ali Express as little present. Fiyta Extreme Skeleton. Made in Shenzhen. So cool watch. My watch Fiyta ladies model. Not expensive but so pretty. \"Wow. That was some nap.\" He laughs. \"You sure know how to relax a guy.\"\n\nI smile, sit up, stretching. Alan right, I do. I so very good at relaxing guy. Alan relaxed proof. Look at watch. Wow. Eight am. We nap for four hours in car. So amazing. No wonder Alan so bushy-tale. Such a puzzling expression. How come a story is bushy? Why that mean you wide-awake? English so puzzling. Whatever. We park in gas station rest area. Food. Hot Chocolate. Washroom. Especially washroom. After washroom, food. Priorities. I so hungry. Also so urgently needing washroom.",
        "\"Wait one,\" Alan say. He turn engine on, turn heater on, climbs out of car, snow everywhere. Opens trunk, brushes snow of windows with big brush. Opens my door to help me out. So cold! Freezing. \n\nI jump out, stretch. Air so brisk. Brisk? \"This is fucking cold,\" I say, so carefully using correct expression I remember Alan using last night.\n\nAlan look at me. Look so startled. I smile at him. \"You tell me northern Minnesota have three types of winter weather. Cold, really cold and fucking cold. This fucking cold, right?\"\n\nHe starts laughing. Shakes his head. \"Nope, this is just cold, Strawberry. Only minus ten.\"\n\n\"Wow.\" I so startled. This feel fucking cold to me. I follow Alan into the gas station. \"If this not fucking cold, what is fucking cold?\" I ask him.\n\nThe old guy who hasn't shaved since yesterday morning standing behind the counter looks at me. Looks at Alan. Starts laughing. \"Lady,\" he say to me, chuckling. So nice of him to call me lady. \"Fucking cold is when you spit and your spit freezes before it hits the snow and when it does, it bounces. That's fucking cold, right buddy?\" He look at Alan.\n\nAlan laughs. \"Yeah, that's it, Strawberry,\" he say to me.\n\nWow. This so interesting. I go back outside, into the snow. \"What sort of a name's Strawberry?\" I hear the old guy say to Alan. The door shuts so I not hearing what Alan say. I kick the snow. It seem really fucking cold to me. A car pulls up, an old lady climbs out just as I spit experimentally into the snow and watch. No, it doesn't freeze, it just makes wet hole in the snow.\n\n\"Disgusting,\" the old lady says, just as I try spitting again. Same result. Wet hole. Spit not bounce. I say \"It not fucking cold.\" We look at each other, she shakes her head. Walks into the gas station. I need to visit washroom so I go back inside, find Alan coming out of the men's room. \"You right,\" I say, \"it not fucking cold.\"\n\nAlan and the old guy both laugh. I so puzzled. I not trying to make joke. Only simple observation of fact. Oh well, who understand American humor. So puzzling. So dashing into washroom. So bliss. Old lady washing hands when I emerge. I wash hands next to her. She not happy about something. I follow her out.\n\n\"Alan! What are you doing here?\" Old lady scream so loud. So startle me.\n\n\"Grandma! How are you! You driving up? They let you out by yourself?\" They hug so enthusiastic. So happy. Alan stands back, smiles at me so proudly. \"Grandma, this is my girlfriend, Strawberry.\"\n\nOld lady turn to me. Look so disapproving. My heart quail. I smile. So polite my smile, so artificial. Miss Shanghai contest so good training. So used to smiling at people who not liking me or not giving damn. Alan looks puzzled. I not knowing what to call Alan's grandma, she say nothing. So rude. Forcing myself to remember lessons on manners when meeting so uncivilized people. \n\nBlessing our so smart High School for anticipating such need and sending all us Senior Year girls to those classes on how to deal politely with so uncivilized and so rude western people. Of course, not all western people so rude, but some are. Teacher stressing so important to always be polite. Always to set good example for so uncivilized people. Teacher ensuring we all so knowing that benefits of six thousand years of continuous civilization and culture so needing to be inculcated carefully in peoples where veneer of civilization so very recent. \"I am so pleased to meet you.\" Remembering my lessons. Maintain polite smile, maintain eye contact instead of respectful bow. Hold out hand. Only one hand. Not using both hands.\n\nShe take my hand, very slowly. Give my hand quick shake. Let go right away like she not liking to touch me. I so upset. She so rude. \"Hello, Strawberry.\" She nod head at me, so abrupt. \n\nI so struggling to remember wise words of teacher, so struggling to remain true to traditions of so venerable sage Confucius as interpreted for modern post-feudal times by wise officials and leaders of Party. So hard though. So wanting to respond with such rudeness. So restraining self. So remembering wise proverb. \"If you are patient in a moment of anger, you will escape one hundred days of sorrow.\" So taking deep breath and practicing patience. So pleased with self. So thinking this is subject for so impressive Facebook post on challenges of dealing with foreign people together with wiseness of young people to be listening to advice of sagacious Party officials.\n\nI so thinking such good way to score brownie points with Party. Mommy so sure to forward so intelligent a post from daughter to so many esteemed Party contacts. I thinking to review contents of post with Mommy before actually posting. So necessary to ensure Party line followed correctly. Mommy so knowledgeable on Party line at all times, even when living in San Francisco. Such post bringing self to attention of senior officials, so raising awareness that self not just pretty face, so ensuring future beneficial contacts if needed. Always to be thinking of future, even if return to Shanghai currently looking so improbable for reasons so not to be discussed.\n\nSo rude Grandma look at Alan, smiles, her expression suddenly so warm. \"I'm driving up to your Mom and Pop's. Looks like you are too. How long're you staying?\"\n\nAlan nods. \"Yeah, staying until after New Year.\" He smile. Slip his arm around my waist. I forget so immediate thoughts of party line, instead so nestle in against Alan, so happy that he demonstrate love for me to rude Grandma. So smiling up at him. So conveying message to rude Grandma that Alan mine now. \"Bringing Strawberry up to meet the family.\" He kiss the top of my head. \"Strawberry and I're very serious. Wanted to introduce her to everyone.\"\n\n\"That's nice.\" Grandma not sounding happy at seriousness of relationship as communicated by grandson. \n\nI so understanding. Probably Grandma not liking beautiful Shanghai girl taking handsome local guy away from local girls. I so unimpressed. Shanghai girls so beautiful they take any guy they want. I even more beautiful than average Shanghai girl. So much more beautiful, I so knowing that. I so not worrying about competition. I so worrying about Grandma though. Old people, they head of family, their view so important. In China, if Grandma disapprove, Alan and I so toasted. Not sure if this true in America though. Western people different like that, not valuing family so much. No respect for elders. But Alan bring me to meet his family so he respect elders. He so happy to see his Grandma. So many puzzles. So many worries. So much uncertainty.\n\nAlan and Grandma so happy talking and talking and talking. I stand there listening so long time, so respectful, so hungry. So needing food and hot chocolate. So dizzy. So not interrupting happy family reunion.\n\n\"Alan. I so hungry, needing food.\" I need to interrupt at last. I feel so sick now. So very hungry. My voice so faint. Feeling so dizzy. \n\n\"Well, you better look after your demanding little friend, Alan.\" Grandma sound so snappy. So not caring I almost fainting from starvation. So heartless cruel old lady. Evil nasty rude Grandma. \"See you at home tonight.\"\n\n\"Okay, Grandma, we'll be there.\"\n\nAlan turns to me. \"Are you okay, Strawberry.\"\n\n\"No,\" I say, my head so spinning. \"So very hungry.\" I so faint. I hearing Grandma snort as she walk off. Alan sits me down, I feel better sitting down. More better after hot chocolate with cream and sugar. Lots more better after two donuts and some yummy yogurt. Alan eat with me. Pizza. Microwave Pizza for breakfast? Six pieces. So horrible. So shame that Americans not eating congee. But Alan also has plate of yummy looking biscuit things to go with so strong black coffee. Alan looking so wide-eyed. Me? I feeling so much better now. Sugar in blood back to normal level. Looking at yummy biscuits with so much alertness.\n\n\"What are those?\" I ask, so interested. So scrumptious looking.\n\n\"Those? These are Krumkake* Strawberry,\" he say. \"Local Minnesota delicacy, they're delicious. Try one with your hot chocolate.\"\n\nI pick one up. Nibble. So delectable. So tasting lovely in mouth. Like a waffle cookie filled with whipped cream and dusted with powdered sugar. I eat it all, then another. So full now. Feeling so much better. Still so worried about nasty rude old Grandma but so not asking. Wondering if she always so rude. So hoping rest of Alan's family nicer. I know little sister Gwen is nicer. Such a wonderful little sister. So looking forward to seeing her again.\n\n\"We better hit the road, Strawberry,\" Alan says at last. \"Still got another three hours to go from here.\"\n\nWhy we hit the road? Is this some kind of weird American ritual before driving? It not something I see before, but guessing it would be like back home, where you beat effigies of your enemies and curse them to drive away bad luck. Maybe something to do with driving in winter weather? Beat the road and curse away accidents? I guess that make sense. I follow Alan outside, so curious now. So intrigued. So wanting to see strange new custom. Nothing happens. Alan opens my door, helps me inside car, brushes snow of car, climbs in, we drive off. No hitting road?\n\nI decide to ask. \"Why we not hit the road?\" I so curious.\n\n\"Uhh, we are.\" Alan glance at me.\n\n\"No, we no hit road. We climb in car and drive off.\" \n\nAlan looks at me. Face say he being so patient with me. \"It's an English expression, Strawberry. When we say hit the road, it means we're going to drive off.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" I feel so small. So silly. So stupid. Nothing to do with beating road accident devils after all. Just stupid language. Nasty rude horrible grandma, so horrible silly language. Everything so horrible. So wanting to cry. So tired. Outside so cold and white and scary looking. Nothing but snow and fields and trees. No buildings. No people. So empty. So lonely. Unknown so horrible and scary. So wanting to go home now. Tears trickling down my cheeks. So wanting to be brave and confident. So not succeeding. I sob, just a little.\n\nAlan look at me. Looks so concerned. \"What's wrong, Strawberry?\"\n\nNow I can't stop crying. \"Your Grandma, she so rude to me, Alan. She not like me.\"\n\nAlan reaches over, holds my hand while he drives down so snowy highway. \"She just met you, Strawberry, once she gets to know you, she'll like you.\"\n\nNow I cry harder. Alan just confirm my fears. His Grandma not liking me. Alan know. I so sad. So unhappy. But so not wanting to ruin Alan's Christmas. So long since he's visited his Mom and Dad. So trying to stop crying. So trying to be brave, so trying to shrug of cruel heartlessness of horrible rude Grandma as big muscle car powers way through so snowy winter wastelands.\n\n\"Don't cry, Strawberry,\" Alan says. \"That's only Grandma. You've met Gwen, she's flying up tomorrow morning. She likes you. And Mom and Dad are great. I've told them all about you. They're really looking forward to meeting you. So's my big brother. And all the rest of the family. Everyone is. They're all going to love you.\"\n\nI sniffle, wipe tears away. Think of Gwen, not nasty rude Grandma, I tell myself. Gwen and I can have lots of fun with Alan and Gwen's friend. She promised to teach me cross country skiing. And snowshoeing. Take me dog sledding. Camping overnight in snow. Go to church on Christmas Day. I always wondering what church like. I know, I mention before but still, finding perseverance of so strange archaic customs so fascinating. Church buildings looking so quaint and picturesque.\n\nSo wondering about strange practice of ritual cannibalism I read about. So shivering when remembering. So bloodthirsty a ritual. So scandalous that so terrifying primitive custom so redolent of savage past still practiced by so many otherwise civilized people. So not understanding continuation of so olden day's custom. No wonder Chinese government frown on so strange and un-chinese practice. Cannibalism, even of ritual sort, so not acceptable in China. So wondering why ritual persisting in America. Chinese government of course so sensible to discourage.\n\nMaybe I not go to Church. Not wanting to see so horrible ritual. Thinking instead of going to Chinese restaurant in Duluth. Duluth has Chinese people? I wonder if they do dim sum. Must do. Where Chinese people go, dim sum go. Dim Sum in Duluth? My friends in Shanghai will be so curious when I do Facebook update from Duluth from Chinese restaurant in such remote foreign location. All sorts of adventure to look forward to. I smile at Alan. Wipe away tears. \n\n\"Not minding me,\" I say. \"I so silly, Alan. So scary to meet so many new people. So worried I not make good impression to your family.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Strawberry,\" Alan pats my leg, \"everyone's gonna love you.\" Now his smile really warm. Smile make me hot. \"And you're so beautiful and so smart, all my friends are gonna be so jealous.\"\n\nNow I smile so warm back. So nice to be told I so beautiful. Especially by Alan. Liking that so much. Of course, he right. I know I so beautiful, but still, so nice to be told. \"Thank you, Alan.\" I hold his hand up to my cheek, kiss his fingers. I so bad to cause Alan concern. So wanting just to love him and make him so happy. So bad of me to cause him concern.\n\n\"Why don't you have another nap, Strawberry, there's nothing much to see. I'll wake you up when we get close to home.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I adjust seat back, tuck pillow in between headrest and window, rest head, close eyes. So tired even after earlier nap in car. Such a long long drive. So stiff and sore. \"Tell me about your house, Alan.\" So happy to listen to Alan talking.\n\n\"We're thirty miles five north of Duluth, on the lake outside of Two Harbors.\" His voice so soothing, so happy when he talks about home. \"My father built it when I was little, the house is all log and stone, you can sit there all year round and look out over the lake...\" I drifted off to sleep listening to Alan talking so delightful about the house and his family...\n\n<p align=\"center\"><bold> * * * </bold></p>\n\n\"Wake up, Strawberry, we're almost there.\" Alan's hand patting my leg. He sound so happy.\n\n\"Oh.\" I jerk awake, open eyes. Look around. We on a four lane expressway with lake to our right. So much water. So cold and grey looking. \n\n\"Coming into Two Harbors soon,\" Alan smiles, \"almost home, not so far to go now.\" He look so cheerful. So smiling even after such long drive. So wonderful guy.\n\nI so much better after that nap. Also, I a lot more nervous. Soon I meeting Alan's parents for first time. I check clothes, make sure I okay. True Religion Jeans. Helen Lee plaid shirt. My jacket look okay, not too formal, exceedingly elegant yet sufficient casual. A really nice Judy Hua design. So nervous I mentioning that again. Thinking I still so passable after so long trip. I find handbag on back seat, brush my hair out, make sure hair just so. Lips not quite okay, adding just a little lipstick. Check myself in mirror. Yes! I look so good. Alan smiles. I know what he thinking, but a girl should always look her best. Always. I so need to make good first impression on Alan's parents.\n\nRoad narrows. No more expressway. A harbor on right. Takeout place with so strange name. I glance at it. Butterburgers? Frozen Custard? Oh? So strange sounding food. So wondering what butterburger taste like. Burger made from butter? So weird? Surely melting when cooked. Drive into small town. Houses now. Shops. Small office buildings. \"This is Twin Harbors,\" Alan say.\n\nI smile so nervous. Town so small. So empty. No people in streets. So grey and deserted looking. So like small eerie town in so scary American horror movie. We through in minutes, out the other side. Sign say Highway 61. Cross over Silver Creek. Pass Loop Road turnoff. I feeling more and more nervous as we drive on and on. Arms itching. Sweating. Swallowing saliva. So increasingly worried about meeting family. Will they like me? Maybe they won't? What if they all like so nasty rude Grandma? So awful thought. \n\nSo swallowing and swallowing. So much saliva. Feeling sick. So wanting air. So panting. Wiping sweat of forehead. So trying to rehearse english-language phrases to use on meeting potential parents-in-law for first time. So forgetting everything I intending to say. So anxiety. At last we turn off the highway. Experiencing such feeling of sickness as we drive down a small side road, snow pile high on either side. Drive down towards the lake, turn into a long driveway that winds through forest. Sudden entry into clearing in forest is surprise. I see large log and stone house on a small point, low cliffs overlooking so-grey water of lake, a rocky beach below. Snow everywhere.\n\n\"Here we are, Strawberry. This is home,\" Alan say, smiling. Stopping in front of large four door garage building behind house. Turning engine off.\n\nSilence. Ominous scary silence. Car instantly feels so cold. Grey sky. Grey lake. Snow-covered trees. Snow covers ground everywhere. Show covers roof of house and garage. Snowflakes in air. Wind whistles through pines. Crashing of waves on shore. So scary. Listening for wolves howling. Maybe they silent because hunting? Perhaps man-eating bears watching so noiselessly and invisibly from deep woods? Like so scary horror movie. I so nervous I can't control breathing. My hands shaking. I sweating. Panting. Feeling nauseous. So not remembering a thing to say to family on formal greeting. \n\n\"Strawberry, are you okay?\" Alan looking at me.\n\n\"Air,\" I pant, struggling with my door. \"Need air.\" It not opening. I need to get out. Need to get out. Need fresh air before meeting family for first time. Grandma so scary. What if Alan's Mom and Dad so scary too. What if wolves in woods. What if bears watching? So panicking. Need to get out of car, breathe in cold air, calm down, relax, make way to house and safety. Forcing door open. Pushing myself out, feeling so panicked, stumbling away from car.\n\nBreathing in cold air. So freezing cold air. Even smells cold. Nose burning from cold. Cheeks so immediate numb. Face so burning. Cold so from extreme. So shaking with cold so immediate. Jacket to thin, so incapable of keeping cold out. Vision so blurry from tears. Someone comes out of house, walks towards us. Oh no! So soon. Too soon. My stomach lurches. Bile in my throat. Can't breathe. Need to breathe. Go away. Go away.\n\n\"Strawberry.\" Alan's voice sound so remote, so far away. \n\nI double over, feeling of sickness turning so sudden to nausea, so overwhelming me. I throwing up onto the driveway again and again, feeling Alan's hands holding me. When I finally make out what I'm looking at, its two woman's shoes, half covered in fresh vomit. I push myself up, gasping, throat raw. \"Sorry ... I so sorry.\"\n\nI feel so bad. Awful. So disastrous first impression. So wanting to disappear of the face of the earth. So wanting to just curl up and die. So struggling to breathe. So shivering. So shaking.\n\n\"Strawberry, are you okay? ... Strawberry?\" Alan is holding me. Sounding so concerned. Not caring that I've just vomited everywhere. That it's getting on his clothes. \n\nI so wanting to cry. This just so horrible. So embarrassing. What will his Mom think of me? \"I sorry, I sorry,\" I half-sob, pushing myself the rest of the way up.Shaking. Looking into his Grandma's face. \n\nGrandma looking even more disgusted and disapproving than when we met earlier, at the gas station. She say nothing for a long moment. Just looking at me. \n\nThat look. It too much. I burst into tears, bury my head against Alan's chest. Cling to him, crying my eyes out. So cold and frightened.\n\nAlan's arms go round me, holding me. \"It's okay, Strawberry,\" he says. \"It's okay, it was a long drive, don't worry about it, it could happen to anyone.\" His hand strokes my hair. I hear him over my sobs. \"Stop scaring her, Grandma.\"\n\nI'm not, I'm not scared of her, I want to sob, but I can't stop crying. It's not rude Grandma that's scary. It's meeting a whole new family. Alan so important to me. I so terrified of making a mess of everything and I have. I making a total complete utter mess of everything. Everything so strange and scary and I so totally stressed. I unable to stop panting. Not enough air. Hyperventilating. Hiccupping. So bad. This so badly awful. So no control over situation. No control over self.",
        "\"You better take your little drama queen inside, Alan, get her cleaned up,\" Grandma say. \"Feed her some tranquilizers or something. Rest of the family's in town shopping, ran into them at the supermarket, they said they'd be back soon. Your Mom's doing dinner tonight. Everyone's coming over to meet your new girlfriend. Better get her cleaned up and calmed down before they turn up.\"\n\nOh no. No! Not just Alan's Mom and Dad? Everyone? To meet me? Tonight! So terror! So panic! I start to shake. Blllaaaaggghhhhhhhh. I throw up again, right on Alan's shirt, throw up so fast I don't even have time to turn my head, it just comes up. On Alan's shirt. In my hair. So horrible.\n\n\"That's just disgusting,\" I hear Grandma. \"I need a drink. After I clean my shoes.\"\n\n\"Grandma, will you shut up.\" Alan finally lose his temper with nasty old witch. \"Strawberry's nervous enough about meeting everyone, you're making it worse. You promised not to do this again. Just leave her alone and go away.\"\n\n\"Alan,\" Grandma sounded totally disapproving. \"Your girlfriend spits in public, she swears like a trooper, she throws up like a sick puppy and she's a drama queen on top of that. Honestly, boy, you'd have had to work hard to have made a worse choice.\"\n\nI cling to Alan, crying my eyes out. I so insulted. Disaster. This so utter disaster. I going home. I so going home, right now. As soon as I stop crying I going to Duluth Airport and getting a plane home. If Alan not take me, I calling a cab. Awful. This so awful.\n\nEngine noises. Crunching of tires on snow. Another car on the driveway coming closer. Parking. Doors. Voices. Ohhh no, this just so humiliating. So catastrophe. This so worse than not placing in top three in Miss Shanghai contest.\n\n\"Alan, you're here already? How wonderful. Is this Strawberry?\" A woman's voice. So happy. So enthusiastic.\n\n\"Hi Mom, she's not feeling well, and Grandma's been scaring her.\" Alan holds me tight. \"Hi, Dad.\"\n\n\"Alan's girlfriend's been puking like a sick puppy.\" That horrible nasty rude old woman. She sound so satisfied. Evil nasty horrible rude old woman. I so in despair.\n\nA man's voice. \"Mom, that's enough. You did this to Gwen's girlfriend last time. Strawberry doesn't look well and I don't blame her, that's a long drive and you being a bitch doesn't help anyone. Here Alan, use these to clean Strawberry up, you and your Mom get her inside, everything's ready for her in the spare bedroom. We'll bring the luggage in. She needs a shower and a rest and a nice hot drink. Pat, you give me a hand bringing everything from the cars into the house. Mom, you stop being snarky, keep a civil tongue in your head and make some of that jasmine tea we bought for the poor girl.\"\n\n\"Hot chocolate,\" Alan say, \"she prefers hot chocolate with cream and sugar.\" \n\nThat so nice of him to remember. He lift my face of his chest, starts wiping my face with a handful of wet wipes. I keep eyes closed so tight, so crying. Not wanting to see anything. Only planning on opening eyes when I at airport waiting for plane home.\n\n\"Come on, Strawberry.\" Alan's mom's voice again. So friendly. So gentle. \"Let's get you inside, don't mind Mom, she gets bitchy when her meds get out of whack. We're all used to her.\"\n\n\"Strawberry isn't used to her,\" man's voice say. \"You just ignore her, Strawberry. She's like this to everyone. Alan should've warned you.\"\n\n\"She promised she'd behave after last time with Gwen,\" Alan say. I tell he so angry. He so tensed up. \n\n\"Yeah, well, you didn't tell me she spat everywhere and she swears like a trooper,\" so evil nasty Grandma mutter. \"And she pukes like a sick puppy.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ, just shut it up, Mom,\" man's voice say. \"Keep this up and it'll be me spitting and swearing like a trooper.\"\n\nI so not feeling any better. I shivering. My eyes squeezed shut so tight, so not wanting to see anything. Shivering and clinging to Alan and sobbing so hysterical. \"I want to go home, I want to go home.\"\n\n\"Let's get her inside, Alan,\" the woman's voice say. \"You carry her. Mom, if you say another word, you're going to have to go stay with Louise and Fred for the rest of the holidays.\"\n\n\"I've got you, Strawberry.\" Alan lift me up, carry me easily in his arms, my face pressed into his shoulder. Walk with me inside, walk and walk, ease me through what must be a doorway, sit down, still holding me. I so not letting go of Alan. Alan only place of safety in so terrifying hostile place.\n\n\"What on earth did Mom say to her, Alan?\" His mom's voice. I feel hand on my shoulder. So gentle. \"It's okay Strawberry, Mom can be a complete bitch sometimes, it's her meds, but the rest of us are really nice, we've all been looking forward to meeting you so much. We've heard so much about you, Gwen was so excited that Alan was bringing you home. I'm so sorry she upset you.\"\n\nI want to stop crying but I can't, I can't. I so unhappy. So scared. So nasty cruel Grandma. So clinging to Alan. So not letting go of Alan. \"I drama queen,\" I hiccup, \"I drama queen, she hate me, she hate me. So rude, she so rude to me, I go home, I want to go home Alan, take me home.\" I so crying even harder now. So sad. So many tears. So heartbroken. So disastrous introduction to family. So humiliation. So alien country. So scary people. \n\nCannibals. Bears. Wolves. Somalis. Probably trolls somewhere too. Hearing about American trolls. So scary, those trolls, all over internet. Maybe real trolls here in far north. All too much. I so wanting to be back in so nice safe Shanghai and staying so safe with my Daddy. My Daddy take care of me. No wolves. No bears. No cannibals. No nasty grandma's. So definite no Somalis. No trolls. American Trolls so nasty and scary. I always so looked after in Shanghai. So nice Housekeeper. Cook. Maids. Driver for car when needing to go anywhere. So tough bodyguard when necessary for keeping self so safe from nasty bad people. So wanting to be back in Shanghai. So knowing not possible. Knowledge so adding to sadness and despair.\n\n\"Here're all the bags and boxes and things, Alan.\" Big brother's voice?\n\nAlan's dad's voice. \"Why don't you leave her with your Mom to get cleaned up?\"\n\n\"No .. no ... \" I cling so desperately to Alan. The only familiar thing in this scary alien place. \"Alan not leaving me ... Alan not leaving me...\"\n\n\"Jesus, I'm gonna kill Mom,\" his Dad's voice say. \"She promised after last time she wouldn't do this again. ... Strawberry, you just relax, okay. Alan and my wife're going to stay with you, okay, help you get cleaned up. You take as long as you like and I'm sorry about Mom, she can be a real bitch sometimes, specially when her meds get screwed up, we didn't realize she was coming up today, we thought it was gonna be tomorrow. Alan, you just take care of Strawberry, okay, we're putting your bag in your old room.\"\n\n\"Thanks Dad,\" Alan say. \"Mom, can you get some washcloths to help me wash Strawberry's face.\"\n\n\"Of course, dear,\" his Mom say. That hand give my shoulder little squeeze. \"I'll be right back, Strawberry.\"\n\n\"You stay with me, Alan,\" I sob, curling my fingers into his shirt. Holding Alan so tight. \"Not leaving me.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Strawberry,\" Alan kiss my head. My so messy head pressed to so messy shirt. He not care. I know he love me but still I feel so awful. So humiliation. So embarrassment. \"I'm staying with you, okay. Breathe in slowly, breathe out, breath in ...\" \n\nI do what he say. Breathing slows. I stop sobbing, stop hiccupping. Stop panting. His Mom come back with warm wet washcloth. Wipe my face so gentle, like my amah when I little girl. I feel so bad now. So exhausted. So drained. I so drama queen, I knowing. So pathetic silly behavior. So not being an independent American girl looking after self. \"Sorry,\" I whisper, \"I so sorry, sorry to make so much trouble, so sorry to be so inconvenience, I sorry, I sorry.\"\n\n\"That's okay, Strawberry, you aren't trouble at all and I'm so dreadfully sorry about Mom,\" Alan's Mom say. \"Why don't I take you into the bathroom, help you get cleaned up? You take a shower, put some clean clothes on, have a little nap, okay.\" \n\n\"No ... Alan not leaving me ... Not leaving me.\" I cling tighter to him. Not wanting to lose hold on him. Not wanting to be alone in strange house, so many people I not know. Bears in woods outside. Wolves? Grandma worse than Chucky. What if crazy old lady bursts into room? We in woods. Americans using chainsaw in woods to cut down trees. So remembering so terrifying horror movie with chainsaw. Oh no! So nightmare. So scary here, like horror movie except this so real. So not movie. So shivering with fear. So clinging so tight to Alan.\n\nHis mom pause. I feel Alan move. I know him and his Mom looking at each other. \"I think ... I think you should help her if that's what she wants, Alan,\" his Mom say at last. \"She's frightened enough, already.\"\n\nAlan take a deep breath. Suddenly he so tense. \"I'll help her, Mom. Can you bring my bag and some extra towels in here?\"\n\nPause. Long pause. \"Okay dear,\" his Mom say at last.\n\nAlan breathe out, he relax. His Mom pat my shoulder. \"Don't worry Strawberry, Alan'll look after you, dear,\" she say to me. \"You take your time, I'll go get you some of that hot chocolate for when you're ready.\" Another long pause. Alan hold me. She leave the room. Alan holds me, holds me tight for a long time. Slowly, so slowly, I relax. Still feeling awful, only sniffling now though. Holding tight to Alan. Now I want that shower but so scared to open eyes. Not wanting to let go of Alan. Still so shivering. Not wanting to see mess I in. Mess I make all over Alan. Ohhhh, so shame.\n\nHis Mom comes back in. \"Here you are, Alan. You take good care of her, okay. I talked to your Dad, we think maybe you should just stay in here with Strawberry while she's staying if that's what she wants.\"\n\n\"Thanks Mom.\"\n\nThe door shut again. Alan stroke my so messy hair. I so shame. \n\n\"Come and have a shower, Strawberry.\" Alan not waiting for answer. He so caring for me. He stand up with me in arms, carry me so easy through doorway, carry me like I feather. Door shut behind us. Lower me to feet. I keep eyes closed so tight as Alan undo my so messy jacket, not wanting to see damage. Ohhhhh, I throw up all over wonderful designer Judy Hua jacket. So needing emergency dry cleaning right away. \n\nAlan unbutton my shirt, take it off me. Unhook my bra. Take bra off me. Eyes still closed but now so wanting to open as Alan unzip my jeans. Pull them down. Socks off. Jeans off. Alan take my panties off. I so naked now. Naked with Alan in bathroom. Feeling better a little. Not panting anymore. I not shivering. Bathroom so very nice and warm. Starting to want to pant again though. So different reason.\n\n\"I'll turn the shower on.\" Alan hold me close with one hand, move around, leaning away. I hear water. \"This way, Strawberry.\" I open eyes so brief time as I step into shower. So nice big shower, warm stone walls, tile floor and glass. Bathroom so big. Water so warm.

Oh, he so caring. \n\n\"Yes please,\" I whisper, closing eyes again as Alan tenderly massage shampoo into my hair, massage my head, his fingers so gentle, so strong, so working away tension and stress.

I so wild, so crazy, so pushing self back on him, pleasure so overwhelming and he keep going. On and on, moving in me as I hang there, in heaven, so moaning my pleasure, my love, my happiness, my exquisite surrender to what he do to me.\n\nGolden exquisiteness of climax slowly fades, Alan no longer inside me. I so empty, so gasping for breath as Alan lift me, turn me to face him, sink to floor of shower, taking me with him so I kneeling astride Alan's legs. Alan so vision. Rippling muscles, so ripped. So enjoying hardness of body against mine as we kiss. So enjoying hardness of di diao as my hand clasp him. So hard, so ready to keep going. I so happy to oblige.

So impossible to believe so huge di diao all in me, but evidence has disappeared before very eyes. Evidence is all inside xi\u01ceo b\u012b.\n\n\"Ohhhhh,\" I moan, sitting there, so helpless. \"I so fucked.\"\n\nAlan kiss nose. Kiss lips. Hands squeeze butt. \"Strawberry, you're so fucked.\" I happy Alan in full agreement. I so happy Alan fucking me. I so happy I here now for so lovable Alan to fuck so good.\n\n\"Fuck me, Strawberry\" Alan breathe. Strong hands lift me. Let me slide down again. Head arch back, eyes close, water running over face, through hair, down over body as I started to move myself on so wonderful di diao. So best di diao in whole wide world. I loving this so much. Loving Alan so much.\n\n\"I love you, Strawberry.\" Big blue eyes look deep into mine as di diao slide deep into xi\u01ceo b\u012b. \"I love you so much little darling.\"\n\n\"Alan,\" I moan, riding him so enthusiast. \"Alan ...

So blade of grass caught up in maelstrom of overwhelming tidal wave of love.\n\nSo sinking self down and grinding against him as xi\u01ceo b\u012b goes wild for second time. So losing control, bouncing round like helpless toy. So enjoying control exerted by hands of Alan as he pumps di diao up into me while golden pleasure overwhelms me. Feeling his dia diao pulse, throb, spurt inside me. Wanting to scream with added pleasure as I feeling Alan sh\u00e8j\u012bng inside my xi\u01ceo b\u012b. He sh\u00e8j\u012bng so hard, so furious.

Xi\u01ceo b\u012b so welcoming hot spurts, feeling so flooded inside, so delicious feeling as Alan collapse onto back on shower floor, hands holding me so I lying on him, head on his shoulder, so glowing happy.\n\nSo exalted feeling. So one with Alan. So loving Alan.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><bold> * * * </bold></p>\n\nFinally open eyes so much later. Alan lying on back on shower floor, I on top of Alan, breathing so hard. Alan breathing so hard too. So satisfied hard breathing. I so much better now. Alan look up at me. Kiss me. So gentle kiss. So loving kiss. So not-caring-I-not-yet-clean-teeth-with-toothpaste kiss. I loving Alan so much. So resting head on hunky shoulder of Alan as hot water pour down on us. So relaxed. So happy. No more stress. No more panic. Only contentedness.\n\n\"God, I love you so much, Strawberry.\"\n\nI lift head, smile down at so wonderful Alan. So not caring about horrible Chucky-Grandma. Knowing Alan love me so much all that important. Knowing I so safe and loved with Alan. \"I love you, Alan.\" I say it so happy, so smiling. So kissing my Alan. So enjoying lying on him while he wash me again. Alan so naughty. So washing me long time. Washing me so thorough. I so enjoying thorough washing. Climb out of shower at last. Stand there while Alan dry me so tender with so fluffy warm towel. Feeling so pampered. We walk out into bedroom together, holding hands.\n\n\"Oh! So nice room!\" First time I seeing bedroom. Last time I in here, eyes closed so tight. Never opening. Now I looking. So wonderful room. So big room. Big? So huge room. Beautiful log walls. Big round logs. Never seeing log-built home before. So fascinating. Windows on two sides, big windows looking out over lake. Stone fireplace in corner. Wood stacked next to fireplace. This is real fireplace, big stone fireplace and chimney, not just electric or gas imitation. So wonderful. So looking forward to fire. Never seeing real fireplace before. Floor of room is beautiful wood with so nice rugs. Big closet for clothes. Lovely big wooden dresser. Huge wooden bed with nightstands either side, looking so inviting, so comfortable. \n\nAlan's suitcase sit next to mine. Alan look at it. Look at me. \"Would you like me to stay with you in here, Strawberry?\"\n\nI look at his suitcase. Look at him. So doubtful. So not wanting to be alone in so large strange house. So big windows. Woods outside. Bears. Wolves. Chucky-Grandma. So afraid of being alone. So wanting Alan with me. So not wanting to make wrong impression on parents. So quandary.\n\n\"My parents don't mind, Strawberry, Mom said it was okay for me to stay in here with you if you'd like me too while we're here together.\" Alan take me in arms. Hold me. \n\nWe both so naked. Bed calling our names. I so happy. Alan loving me so much. So much commitment. So willing to display commitment before parents. \"Are you sure, Alan? Sure they not mind? I not wanting to cause upsetness.\" I still so anxious. I know if I take Alan home, my Daddy so angry if I share bedroom with him, even if Daddy knowing seriousness of relationship. I know Americans so different, but so hard to decide if really okay.\n\nAlan kiss me, hold me. \"It's okay, Strawberry. I know my Mom and Dad, if they said it's okay, it's okay. Okay?\"\n\nDeep breathe. \"Okay.\" I make decision. So nervous. Fear of making bad impression overwhelmed by desire to have Alan with me in bed whole time we staying with parents. Ten days. So bliss to share bed and room with Alan for ten whole days. So never doing anything like this before. Ever. So big step. So wanting to make big step with Alan. So radiant happy. So putting arms around Alan's neck and kissing so wonderful guy of mine so happy, so enthusiastic. So wanting to move to bed and make noises of so happy and willing excitement and surrender.\n\n\"Tonight, Strawberry,\" Alan kiss me back so enthusiastic. I know he want to as well. \"We better get dressed, my Mom and Dad, they'll be really worried about you if we take much longer.\" He grin at me. \"We were in the shower a really long time, Strawberry.\"\n\nAlan right, I know. Not to be keeping his Mom and Dad waiting too long. I so wanting to rectify awful first impression. Hastily open suitcases on floor. Scamper round room, unpack clothes, hang up in closet, put away in drawers. Alan watch. I can tell he so fascinated. He look at lingerie so interested. He look at me, so much more interested. He blush when I look at him. I smile. So forgetting no clothes on in excitement of unpacking. \n\nPick up sexiest little black g-string panties. Slip into so sexy and so tiny g-string panties. So very slowly. So enjoying Alan's interest as I carefully adjust panties to fit just so. Adjustment take so long time. So needing to check fit so carefully, adjust so many times. So enjoying raptness of attention from Alan. He no doubt performing own check to ensure so perfect fit. So good to know fitting of little panties being so carefully monitored.\n\n\"God, Strawberry, you're so beautiful.\" So enjoying Alan's words. \n\nSo smiling when I give him handful of lingerie. \"Put in drawer please, Alan.\" I so making sure Alan have vision of me in mind for rest of evening before so happy bed time. Bed time together. So wanting to dance and sing. So looking forward to bedtime joy now. No lonely night. No scary night. No worrying about wolves and bears howling in woods. Worrying now about Strawberry and Alan howling in bedroom. So giggling at thought.\n\n\"What?\" Alan say when I giggle.\n\n\"I tell you at bedtime.\" I giggle again. I so naughty. I so planning much more naughtiness for tonight.\n\nClothes put away. Now need to decide what to wear tonight. Dinner with family. Everyone coming over to meet me. Needing to implement shock and awe strategy. Remembering my Miss Shanghai contest coach. Dress for success so important, those first impressions count. Needing to do makeup first. Retrieve overnight bag with only bare essentials, take into bathroom and unpack. So little storage space in bathroom. So filling everywhere. So shooing Alan out. Guy not to see how girl makes herself look so good. \"Wait in bedroom Alan, get dressed, I not long, okay.\"\n\n\"Okay, Strawberry. No rush.\"\n\nI leave bathroom door open though, hear him unpacking his suitcase. He putting his clothes away with mine. We sharing bedroom. I so happy. His parents so nice, so understanding that Alan mine now. I apply makeup so carefully. Best makeup is so invisible makeup, look so natural no one know a girl wearing it. I good at that. Summer fashion school in Shanghai, so many weeks learning. So useful. Not take so long. Really quick. Taking only thirty minutes. \n\nI walk out of bathroom, Alan sitting on bed waiting so patient, looking so good in designer jeans and linen shirt I buy for him from Nordstrom. He look at me. Blue eyes so big and round. Expression so impressed. I know, Alan never see me do shock and awe makeup before. Alan never see my Miss Shanghai contestant look before. Even I impressed and I not easily impressed. I look so good that if I not me, I fall in love with me. And I girl.\n\n\"Wow, Strawberry.\" He shake his head. \"Wow, you look ... you look just ... stunning ... amazing ... wow ... How do you do that?\" He sound so stunned. Look so stunned. So perfect reaction.\n\nI so smiling, so pleased. \"Girl secret,\" I say. Plus weeks and weeks and weeks of training and practice. Practicing so hard. So long. All one long summer. Every day. All day. Day after day. So not saying that. Girl secret.\n\n\"You don't even look like you have makeup on,\" he say, sounding so stunned, \"but wow, just ... wow, you look so ... you look more beautiful than ever and you were gorgeous before.\"\n\nI smile even more happily. He right of course. I gorgeous. Of course I even more gorgeous with makeup. Shock and awe work so good. I in Miss Shanghai contest for very good reason, even if not winning. Even if beaten by cheating girls who all sleep with contest judges. So cheap of them. So unfair. I so not prepared to win that way. Of course, I know if I do, I win. But I so not cheap girl. Of course I not complaining now. If I sleep with judges back then, I not winning Longwei. Longwei so not wanting girl who so cheap as to sleep with judges for silly little prize. \n\nAlso, if I win back then, I not winning now, with Alan. Alan so lovable. Alan to die for. \"You love me, Alan?\"\n\n\"God yes, Strawberry.\" He take me in arms, look down at me. So in love, I can tell. I so in love with him. So wanting him to be proud of me. \"I love you so much,\" he add after long pause. Looking into eyes pause.\n\n\"I love you, Alan.\" We gaze into each others eyes some more. Star-crossed lovers. We so adorable couple. Alan just hold me tight. So nice to be held. So much love. So growing erection. I so giggling. \"Bed-time later, Alan.\" I stroke him through jeans. So much anticipation for tonight already. \"I get dressed now, take care of this tonight, okay?\"\n\nHe kiss me so gentle. Hand stroke my back, my butt, oh so nice stroking. I so purring like cat. Ohhhhhh so much enjoyment. \"I pussy cat,\" I smile. \"Your loving little pussy cat, Alan.\" Or maybe I wolf. Lady wolf who likes to howl. Maybe I play at Princess Mononoke* later tonight? Have to think on appropriate level of naughtiness for first night in home of potential parents-in-law. Not to howl to loud either. Not knowing yet how sound proof house is. So blushing when housemate Ramona ask to keep noise down after Alan stay overnight first time. Ramona so nice, so smiling. But still, I so embarrassed. So intending not to be experiencing that embarrassment in family home.\n\nAlan so purring. I smiling. Everything so much better now. I not scared anymore, not panicking. Not dressed either. So needing to get dressed. Slip into little black bra to match panties. So cute little bra, so lacey, so pretty, for Alan's eyes only. Open closet, examine clothes. Decide on casual but also so formal little black dress. That dress show off figure and legs so well, but not exposing skin. Not too much skin, anyhow. So very suitable Judy Hua design. Judy Hua designs so good for every occasion. Especially when meeting potential parents-in-law. Slip dress on, brush out so silky black hair. Hair stylist did so good cut. So worth big tip.\n\nEye self in mirror. So satisfied with look. See Alan behind me. He so satisfied with look too. He smiling so happy.\n\n\"I look okay?\" I ask, using tone of slight anxiety. Of course I know so well I look okay. I look a lot better than okay, but so nice to hear Alan say so too. So liking that.\n\n\"Oh yeah, Strawberry, you look way better than okay,\" he smile. \"You look totally stunning. Like a supermodel.\" He hold out hands. \"Are you feeling good to go out now and meet Mom and Dad and Patrick?\"\n\nI so satisfied. Supermodel comparison good. Still thinking I far better looking than Fan Bing Bing though. She so striking. But striking not same as beautiful. I not striking original, but I so beautiful. My smile so shy, so happy. \"I good now, Alan. So sorry for bad behavior when we arrive. I just so nervous. So scared of Grandma. So sorry to make so big fuss. I so silly.\"\n\nAlan squeeze my hand. \"No problem, Strawberry, that wasn't silly at all. Now let's go out and meet the folks, Mom said the rest of the family's coming around.\" He check the time. \"In another couple of hours, so we have plenty of time for you to get used to my Mom and Dad and Pat.\"\n\n\"And Chucky,\" I say, so not thinking.\n\n\"Chucky?\" Alan look so puzzled.\n\n\"Ohhhh,\" I squeak. So blushing. So embarrassment. So bad manners of me. Cover mouth with hand, eyes so wide. \"So sorry, Alan, I mean Grandma. So sorry for rudeness.\"\n\nAlan grin. He laugh. He laugh so hard he let go of me and sit down on bed, head in hands. \"Chucky,\" he gasp, \"Chucky, I love it. I love it. I love you, Strawberry.\"\n\nI love Alan too. I not love saying Chucky by accident. Not at all. So rude of me. I so embarrassed. Also so relieved Alan not offended. \"Not telling your Mom and Dad I say that, okay?\" I so emphatic.\n\n\"Okay, okay, no problem,\" he say, still laughing, standing up, taking my hand. \"Chucky!\"\n\nHe lead me to bedroom door, open door, lead me out into big wide hallway with so lovely wooden floor. More log walls. So big logs. All so lovely golden color liked bedroom. House smelling so nice, like pine trees and wood polish and faint trace of incense. So beautiful house. So warm inside. We walk down hallway, through another doorway into huge room looking out over lake. High arched ceiling, huge wooden beams, large stone fireplace with fire burning, flames so warm. Huge glass windows. So beautiful view over lake. So beautiful room.\n\nHis Dad look up when we walk in. His Mom turn and look. His big brother look up. Scary nasty Chucky-Grandma look.\n\n\"Herregud.\"* His Dad look like somebody hit him on head. He looking at me, so wide-eyed. I smiling.\n\n\"Oh my!

I liking Alan's Mom so immediate.\n\n\"How in hell did you do it, Alan?\" His big brother sound so stunned. He looking at me and looking at me. His big brother also say \"Owwww\" when his Mom hit him. I smiling more.\n\nScary nasty Chucky-Grandma say nothing. She scowl.\n\n\"I'd like you all to meet Strawberry,\" Alan say so proudly, smile down at me so happy, his arm around me so possessive. I smile so sweet, so happy, so demure smile. Smile that say I so happy and pleased and honored to meet parents and family of so wonderful boyfriend. I nestle into Alan's arm, movement that say I so belong to Alan. Reach up, hold his hand with mine. Gesture that conveys message Alan so belong to me.\n\n\"I so happy to meet everyone,\" I smile so pleased and happy smile, then switch to so serious and apologetic look. \"So apologize for arrival behavior, so bad of me, so asking Grandma to excuse sudden illness.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Strawberry,\" his Mom say to me, smiling so friendly, walking over to me, giving me nice hug. \"It was a long trip and you were so tired, it's perfectly understandable. I do hope you had a nice rest.\" She smile again, stand back, hold both my hands in hers. Look at me so smiling. \"You just look so beautiful, I'm so glad Alan brought you up here for Christmas, we're so happy to have you here.\" She smile again. \"And please, Strawberry, call me Ingrid.\"\n\nI smile back so happy for warm welcome.

I so happy and confident now. So in element of happy socializing. So not nervous and panicking.\n\nSo happy to hug Alan's dad. Such a big guy. Bigger than Alan. So strong. So not worrying about bears now. Bears should so worry about Alan's dad. \"Call me Sven,\" he say.\n\nI try. Se-ven not easy to say. So much laughing by everyone. I so giggling and practicing so many times before I get it right. Well, not right. Close. Maybe. Se-ven so much fun. Such a happy dad. Alan so lucky.\n\nPatrick shake my hand. \"I'm Alan's older brother,\" he say to me. He as big as his dad. Hand like dinner plate. So enormous. Okay, bears here in so big trouble. I so safe. If wrestling match between bear and big brother Patrick, I place bet on Patrick. He almost as hairy as bear too. Big blonde bear. \"So you have to respect me, okay.\" He look so serious. Make me so nervous.\n\nHis Mom hit him. His Dad hit him. Alan hit him. Even Chucky-Grandma laugh at him. I so understanding now. He being funny. \"Okay,\" I say. I give him very formal handshake, use both hands and bow head so low. I look so serious. Everyone laugh again. I smile. I so funny. Joke so successful. Self-confidence so soaring. Only having to deal with scary Chucky-Grandma now.\n\nI turn to Grandma, look so hopeful, so shy, so sweet. So respectful of esteemed and respected family elder. \"I so pleased to meet you, Grandma,\" I say, so very careful picking words. So lying through teeth. So giving face to so rude Grandma. \"I so sorry for early mis-under-standing, so apologizing, so asking for forgiveness.\" I so groveling too.

        "\"Did Alan show you around the house?\" Inga-rid ask me.\n\n\"No,\" I shake head. \"I love to see house. So beautiful.\"\n\n\"Let me show you round. Alan, you sit down, have a beer with your Dad and Pat.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mom,\" Alan say, so immediate. He already holding beer. So obedient respectful son. So obviously anticipating Mom's wishes. As Confucius say: \"In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life.\" I so approving of such filial piety. Respectful son making so excellent life-long partner. \n\nInga-rid take my arm. Lead me out of big room. We do the tour. Dining room, breakfast room, family room, kitchen, huge sunroom, round through foyer and down hallway. Laundry, mud-room, home office, big library room with fireplace and couches and so many books. Right opposite is spare bedroom where Alan and I to sleep. Upstairs. More bedrooms upstairs. So large and beautiful house. \n\nInga-rid so happy I like house. So happy I like Alan. She ask so many questions over course of tour. How we meet. How long we know each other. What we do together. My family. Family background. Where I from. What I studying. How I afford to study in America. Visa status. So many questions. Endless questions. Asked in so nice way. So obliquely diplomatic wording. I so respecting skillfulness of interrogation by concerned mother.\n\nOf course I tell her how Alan and I meet. First day at new College in America. I so lost, not able to find way back to new home. So crying. Alan so gallant, rescuing poor lost foreign girl, taking so good care of her, showing her home, taking her to Chinese restaurant I so unable to find by self. So immediate attraction we feel. So rapid we begin dating. I tell her some of what we do. Some of what we do so not for talking about, naturally. \n\nExplaining to Inga-rid important details of family background. Daddy so distinguished industrialist and businessman. Mommy so important in Party in Shanghai, senior cadre, so connected. I of course only girl but with one little brother. I explaining I attending so good High School but wanting American university degree. Daddy permitting my brother and I to go to America to study. Mommy coming to care for little brother on west coast where so many Chinese people already live. All these things I so able to mention in passing.\n\nI of course not mentioning unimportant details such as Daddy actually sending Mommy to America so as to reduce probability of ongoing disturbance with second wife and mistress. Mommy so not appreciating second wife but initially accepting as so natural event in course of relationship with so wealthy husband. Mommy so furious about mistress. So not accepting Daddy needing so young mistress in addition to so charming and beautiful second wife. Mommy so very reverting to Party cadre dogmatism in matter of size of family and number of wives and mistresses. So uncomfortable the family atmosphere. Daddy so concerned Mommy discussing unamicable family situation with senior Party colleagues.\n\nSo glad to know Daddy reaching so satisfactory financial agreement with Mommy. Family harmony so restored. Mommy so happy to move to San Francisco, she so looking forward to new lifestyle with Daddy to visit on occasion. I so glad to leave Daddy in Shanghai and Mommy and little brother on west coast. Daddy so grateful to me for extent of growth in ongoing business with consortium of Chaoxiang Wang over past twelve months of so intimate and passionate relationship with Longwei Wang. I so grateful to Daddy for so large allowance guaranteeing complete independence of lifestyle. So not mentioning to either Mommy or Daddy additional very substantial sum in personal bank account deposited by lawyer of Chaoxiang Wang on so sad but amicable termination of relationship with Longwei.\n\nChaoxiang Wang so shocked at revelations of deviancy by beloved son communicated by self in private over concern that Longwei so overstepping bounds of bad behavior permitted by Party for fuerdai*. I so uncomfortable even communicating synopsis of deviant acts with so illegal substances and unsavory persons to Chaoxiang Wang but feeling sad duty to do so before fleeing relationship due to fear of implication and exposure by so diligent and annoyingly persistent Shanghai paparazzi. Chaoxiang Wang so thanking me for bringing sad state of affairs and photographic evidence of only son's personal lifestyle issues to a loving father's attention. \n\nChaoxiang Wang so expressing his distaste at attentions of paparazzi to so beloved son's personal affairs. We so expressing mutual distaste for involvement of paparazzi in personal life of beloved son, so agreeing that such interest so very unhealthy. Chaoxiang so expressing need for reassurance regarding details of acts of depravity by only son. I spending so much time reassuring Chaoxiang Wang that I having to call Daddy and advise staying overnight with so grief-stricken father. Chaoxiang so emotional and overwrought at thoughts of depravity of only son. So needing to assure Chaoxiang that such depravity so understandable in such energetic young man. So only needing a father's firm guiding hand to restore filial obedience and ensure acceptable behavior.\n\nNot stating further details as memories of very long weekend subsequently spent with Chaoxiang Wang now so unwelcome. Suffice to say Chaoxiang Wang so good at ensuring obedience. Also so knowledgeable regarding acts of so shameless depravity. So unnecessary for anyone except Chaoxiang Wang, his lawyer, myself and my lawyer to know further details of so deviant behavior as everyone sign papers to say so following deposit of additional very substantial sums into personal bank account. So not saying more. So unnecessary for Alan's Mom to know so minor and trivial details behind discrete but more or less permanent move of self to America. So not necessary for my Daddy and Mommy or Alan to know either of course. Only personal lawyer knowing.\n\nInga-rid take me back downstairs after giving self third degree worthy of so experienced Chinese Police. I so pleased at ability to handle so thorough interrogation. So pleased to reassure Inga-rid I not some farm girl taking advantage of gullible American boy to gain US citizenship. Thanks to so highly influential assistance of Chaoxiang Wang, I already have Green Card, as do little brother and Mommy, all granted so immediate same day on application in Shanghai. So casually also mentioning something of financial status to Inga-rid in passing, enjoying so wide-eyed appreciation of investment knowledge.\n\nOf course, I also not mentioning weekly family dinner with Longwei and Chaoxiang Wang over extended twelve month period so educational. Weekly dinners so resulting in so useful inside knowledge over so lengthy period of relationship. Men always believe they talking over girls head. So silly of them. Girls always understanding lot more than letting on. I so good at being beautiful airhead with Longwei and Chaoxiang. I knowing I so not airhead, but no need for Longwei and Chaoxiang to share same understanding. I so smiling every week after family dinner. Daddy's Broker so helpful in advising on discrete application of such knowledge. Daddy's Broker so grateful for asking of advice in so confidential manner. So expressing his gratitude in so many little ways. Personal trading account so benefitting as result. Shanghai stockmarket gains so mind-boggling. \n\nCashing out so much fun. Now finding NYSE and Chicago Board of Exchange so boring. Watching movement of stocks on Canadian Venture Exchange so interesting but not yet understanding Penny Mining, Oil and Gas Stocks so well. Seeing potential, but not yet having sufficient knowledge of players and pitfalls. So putting funds in nice safe boring deposits while working to gain sufficient knowledge of foreign markets before taking new plunge or going into own business. Finance so much fun. So rewarding. \n\nI so respecting diligence of Inga-rid in ensuring well-being of beloved son. So pleasant and reassuring to know potential parents-in-law so dedicated to ensuring family well-being. So good to know some aspects of American culture so similar to Chinese. We going back into kitchen. Kitchen smell so nice. Smell like lots of yummy food cooking. So delightfully hunger-making. Now I looking around kitchen, examining so closely. Yes! Big kitchen sink exists. Big dishwasher confirmed. Nails are safe. Hands are so safe. Not at all necessary to hire maid. So relief. Not showing relief though. Alan so bad to cause concern. Bad Alan. But I so happy parents not poor. Obviously not, house so nice. So large. So beautiful.\n\nInga-rid pause, her hand on my arm. Look at me. \"Strawberry,\" she say, \"Alan has his own bedroom but if you two want to stay together, it's perfectly okay with Sven and I as long as that's what you both want.\"\n\nI nod so happily. \"Yes please.\" I shiver. \"I so scared without Alan, everything so strange.\" I look at his Mom. \"America so scary sometimes, Alan so nice to me, I love Alan so much, I so worried I not making good impression. So nervous.\" I peek sideway at Alan's mom, so shy. \"As long as you and Se-ven not mind?\" I ask, my cheeks pink. So embarrassing topic. \n\nShe smile at me so friendly. \"Of course not, Strawberry. My husband and I were living together at College back before we got married.\" She blushed herself. \"But back then, our parents ... Well, things've changed, thank goodness.\" She shook herself. Smiled at me. Patted my hand. \"Of course you and Alan can stay together if that's what you both want. I'm just so happy Alan's found a wonderful girl like you, Strawberry.\"\n\nThe look she give me so happy. Her hand reach out, take mine. Hold mine. \"I know my boy, Strawberry, he's so serious about you. I'm so happy you feel the same way about him. I was so nervous that you didn't.\"\n\nI squeeze hand. Hold Inga-rid's hand with both of mine. True confession time. \"I so serious about Alan, Inga-rid. He mean so much to me.\" My smile so watery now. So hard not to cry from happiness. \"I so very happy when Alan invite me to meet family for Christmas. In China, so big deal to invite girlfriend to meet family, invitation has so much meaning. I explain to Alan, he understand how much this mean to me.\"\n\nAlan's mom stop holding my hand. She hug me, one arm around me. \"Ohhhh Strawberry, I'm just so happy for you both.\" She look like she want to cry too. We do the huggy thing again. I forced to wipe wetness from eyes. Eyes must be so tired. I smiling so happy when we walk back into big room. So offering to help Inga-rid get everything ready for guests. So wanting to help. So wanting to feel part of big happy family. So happy to run around kitchen and dining room carrying plates and dishes and knives and forks and spoons. So feeling part of family when doing so.

Understanding now that most Americans never use chopsticks. \n\n\"You go back out now, Strawberry,\" Inga-rid say at last. \"Everyone'll be arriving soon. Alan can introduce you to the rest of the family as they arrive.\"\n\nThey do start to arrive. Alan and I so busy saying hello, so busy meeting so many uncles and aunts and cousins. So big family. Aunties go out to kitchen to help Inga-rid. Uncles stand or sit around drinking. Children run around making so noisy. Teenagers everywhere.

So wanting tidal wave to break and bring experience of so amazing climax to body. So sensing growing excitement of so beloved Alan\n\n\"Oh god,\" Alan groan, \"Strawberry ...

I not to be too demanding. So much time to enjoy ourselves while we staying with Alan's so wonderful family. \n\nAlan shrinking inside me now. Di diao no longer so hard. Now softening, getting smaller. I knowing I greedy wanting again, but have to think of sleep. Alan need sleep so as to satisfy desires in morning before dim sum.

I do love writing Strawberry so I do hope you enjoyed reading this one as much as I enjoyed writing it. You may have noticed I've changed the writing style a little from #1 and #2. Playing around. Would love to know if you prefer the \"so\" style of this chapter or the earlier ones. Also, some of Strawberry's backstory has changed here and there, but nothing too major.\n\nThe yet to be written Prequel\n\n#0 \u2013 \"Hello, my name is Strawberry\"\n\nSo far\n\n#1 \u2013 \"Strawberry's Halloween\"\n\n#2 \u2013 \"Strawberry Loses Face\"\n\n#3 \u2013 \"Happiness, Your Name is Strawberry\"\n\n#4 \u2013 \"Strawberry under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part I \u2013 I'll Keep You Warm.\"\n\nNext up: \n\n#5 \u2013 \"Strawberry under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part II \u2013 Dim Sum in Duluth\"\n\n#6 \u2013 \"Strawberry under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part III \u2013 So Dreaming of White Christmas\"\n\n#7 \u2013 \"Strawberry under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part IV \u2013 Call of Wild so Scary\"\n\n#8 \u2013 \"Strawberry under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part V \u2013 New Year Nytt\u00e5r\"\n\n#8 \u2013 \"Strawberry under the Mistletoe \u2013 Part VI \u2013 So Sad My Farewells\"\n\nThere's a few more planned but that's all I'm sharing right now. Because by the time I get this far it'll have changed for sure.\n\nSome followup notes on bits and pieces from the story if you're interested\n\n*95 Sh\u00ec Z\u00ecd\u00f2ng B\u00f9qi\u0101ng: The QBZ-95 (95\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u6b65\u67aa; literally: \"Type 95 Automatic Rifle\") is a bullpup style assault rifle manufactured by Arsenal 266, part of Norinco and Arsenal 296, under Jianshe Corp, for the People's Liberation Army, the armed forces of the People's Republic of China, People's Armed Police (para-military police), and other Chinese law enforcement agencies. Strawberry would have trained with this rifle when she was in her High School Militia unit.\n\n*Is the 95 Sh\u00ec Z\u00ecd\u00f2ng B\u00f9qi\u0101ng available for sale in the USA? In short, no. In 1993, the import of most Norinco (Chinese manufacturer) firearms and ammunition into the United States was blocked under new trade rules. In August 2003, the Bush Administration imposed sanctions on Norinco, leading to a prohibition on imports into the US of the remaining types of firearms and ammunition not covered by the 1993 ban. You can buy Norinco-manufactured guns in Canada through. On April 28, 2013, Norinco's new EMEI T97NSR (a civilian version of the QBZ-95) was classified as a non-restricted firearm by the RCMP and became legal for dealers to import. It went into retail stores on September 17, 2013 and costs about $1,000 CAD. It's chambered for the .223 Remington cartridge and fed by STANAG magazines. Still can't buy it here though.\n\n*High School Militia training in China: The 1984 Military Service Law stipulated the combination of the militia and the reserve service system. Military training for senior middle-school and college and university students commenced in 1984 as China sought to provide additional qualified reserve service officers. Strawberry's militia training would have been on this basis.\n\n*Beijing Women's Militia contingent: dubbed the \"clang roses,\" are a mini-skirted phalanx of the Beijing Women's Militia Police, whose trendy, figure-flattering pink outfits, white berets, calf-length white boots and immaculate in-step marching draws plenty of applause in parades - and even a rare smile from the normally dour Hu Jintao (back in 2009 when he was still President). Search for \"Chinese Beautiful Pink Army\" on youtube and you'll see what Strawberry means.\n\n*bad parents also shot: In a word, no. Strawberry is obviously incorrect here and possibly being overly dramatic, probably misled by incorrect and sensational Shanghai newspaper reporting. Death sentences in China are mostly enforced only for murder and drug trafficking, and since 2007, an appeal is conducted automatically to prevent the awkward circumstances in which the defendant is proved innocent after the death penalty has been administered. Since 1980, the state's security apparatus has initiated various \"strike hard\" campaigns against specific types of crime. Critics have however noted that the campaigns lead to the streamlining of capital cases, where cases are investigated, appeals heard, and sentences carried out at rates much more rapidly than normal.\n\n*Canadian Tire:If you're ever in Canada, check them out. The border's not that far from where I live (okay, a few hours drive...) and we go up to Canada every now and then. Only in summer (those polar bears in the streets, you know). Canadian Tire's a great store for winter and outdoor stuff. Great website too. Very \"Canadian\" eh. LOL.\n\n*Somalis in Minneapolis: Somalis are a major ethnic group in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul (Twin Cities) urban area. As of 2013, there were around 25,000 Somalis in Minnesota, probably the largest Somali ethnic enclave in the USA. I so not commenting about actual crime stats. Look for yourself if you're that interested. Strawberry's opinions are stated for so purely fictional purposes. So intending laughter as result. So not tolerating so stupid PC comments in Comments section. So stating if no sense of humor, so please plucking eyeballs out and not reading so funny entertaining story. So emphasizing this.\n\n*...savage war fought against invading Vietnamese imperialists so long ago in 1979: The Sino-Vietnamese War (Zh\u014dng-Yu\u00e8 Zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng), also known as the Third Indochina War, was a brief border war fought between the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in early 1979. China launched the offensive in response to Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Cambodia in 1978 (which ended the rule of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge). Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping saw this as a Soviet attempt \"to extend its evil tentacles to Southeast Asia and...carry out expansion there\", which reflected the long-standing Sino-Soviet split. The PLA entered northern Vietnam, capturing some of the cities near the border. On March 6, 1979, China declared that the gate to Hanoi was open and that their punitive mission had been achieved. Chinese forces retreated back across the Vietnamese border into China. Sergeant Han would have been a young soldier in this war.\n\n*Judy Hua: Shanghai designer Judy Hua (\u534e\u5a1f) established her fashion label in 2004 and has built up a respectable following as one of Shanghai's most promising home-grown talents. In addition to designs for corporate clients, Judy Hua creates haute couture pieces, mostly for well-off Shanghainese women, one of whom is Strawberry. Not Chloe, unfortunately.\n\n*Princess Mononoke: Princess is a 1997 Japanese epic historical fantasy anime film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli and produced by Toshio Suzuki. Princess Mononoke is set in the late Muromachi period (approximately 1336 to 1573) of Japan with fantasy elements. One of the main characters is a girl named San, self-dubbed Princess Mononoke, who was raised by the wolves as one of their own. The was a critical and commercial blockbuster, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and the highest-grossing there of all time until Titanic was released later that year. It was dubbed into English and distributed in North America by Miramax. No sex in the film, but it's a great anime movie, as are most of the movies from Studio Ghibli. Strawberry is obviously familiar with the movie.\n\n*Fuerdai: A Chinese term that means \"the second generation of the rich\". Fuerdai are sons and daughters of the Chinese nouveau riche who emerged from the formerly socialist society. While such wealthy individuals may have reached their new socioeconomic position either through their own initiative and efforts or by becoming powerful members of the ruling party, their children often enjoy a comfortable lifestyle and have a much easier and obstacle-free life path. Most wealthy Chinese send their children abroad to get a better education. This is especially true in the United States and parts of Canada where it is very common to see well-off Chinese students attending universities, driving expensive cars, wearing brand name clothing and carrying gadgets which have price tags that are out of reach for the vast majority of American students. Universities look favorably on this kind of international students as they generate more revenue and tend to pay more in fees. Strawberry is also of course one of the Fuerdai but does not regard herself as in the same league as Longwei, who is one of the children of the super-rich, as opposed to the merely wealthy like her Dad.\n\n*Krumkake: One word. Okay, two words. So Yummy! Norwegian waffle cookie made of flour, butter, eggs, sugar, and cream and really popular among Norwegian immigrant descendants in the American Midwest and in Minnesota (where there are lots of descendants of Scandinavian immigrants). Like Italian pizzelle, a special decorative two-sided iron griddle, similar to a waffle iron, is traditionally used to bake the thin round cakes. While hot, the krumkake are rolled into small cones around a wooden or plastic cone form. Krumkake can be eaten plain or filled with whipped cream or other fillings. Just delicious. I'd never heard of these until I lived in Minneapolis and ohhhhhh, they are just sooooo yummy.\n\n*Herregud: Norwegian: \"my God\". Used to express admiration and surprise (\"wow...\"). Many Norwegian/Swedish expressions continue to be used by Scandinavian-Americans.\n\nLutefisk: Two words. Acquired taste. Hear that gagging sound? It's Norwegian-Americans attempting to connect with their heritage. To make lutefisk, catch yourself a cod. Take out the bones, skin it, salt it, hang it out to dry for several weeks until it hardens and smells like a dumpster. After a few months or years, bring it inside and soak it in lye for several days. Yes, lye \u2014 a substance defined as \"a strong caustic alkaline solution of potassium salts, obtained by leaching wood ashes. It is much used in making soap, etc.\" Et cetera indeed. After several days in lye, you soak it for several more days in cold water, changing the water daily. To make it \"edible\" you understand. Steam cook for 20 minutes or so. Lutefisk prepared from cod is somewhat notorious, even in Scandinavia, for its intensely offensive odor. You get a gelatinous blob that slithers down your throat and makes you wish you'd cooked a turkey for Christmas dinner like a normal American. Far more lutefisk is consumed in the United States than in Scandinavia, much of it by Scandinavian Americans in Lutheran churches and fraternal lodges misguidedly attempting to connect with their heritage. I ate it once after I'd drunk far more than I should have back when I was at College in Minneapolis. There are worse culinary traditions in the world. Some of them Chinese. But not that many. And believe me, I'm open to eating almost anything as long as it's not moving. And just so's you know, the Wisconsin Employees' Right to Know Law specifically exempts lutefisk in defining \"toxic substances.\" That's how bad it is. ROTFLMAO if you try it after this. Go for it, she says enthusiastically. Video it and send me the clip. I wanna watch.",
        "Jello salad: Hair so standing on end when I first encountering Jello salad in Minneapolis. I so startled. So asking \"is this food?\" Jello salad is made with flavored gelatin, fruit, and sometimes grated carrots or more rarely, other vegetables. Other ingredients may include cottage cheese, cream cheese, marshmallows, nuts, or pretzels. These salads were popular in the 1960s and for some reason have survived in Minnesota (although it's not exclusive to there). It's (usually) what people in Minnesota mean when they say they'll bring \"the salad\" to your potluck (I found that out too). Once you get past the psychological shock, it's kind of not bad. If you like vegetable jello.\n\nFrozen custard: \"What IS Frozen Custard, anyway?\" Well, ice cream is simply a base of cream, milk and sugar. What makes ice cream into \"frozen custard\" is the addition of egg yolk to this base. Also, when ice cream is made, air is whipped INTO it. When custard is made, air is whipped OUT of it, which gives frozen custard the smooth, velvety rich texture that makes a frozen custard-believer out of even the most die-hard ice cream fans. True frozen custard is a very dense dessert. Soft serve ice creams may have an overrun as large as 100%, meaning half of the final product is composed of air. Frozen custard, when made in a proper continuous freezer will have an overrun of 15\u201330% depending on the machine manufacturer (an overrun percentage similar to gelato). Air is not pumped into the mix, nor is it added as an \"ingredient\" but gets into the frozen state through the agitation of liquid similar to whisking a meringue. The high percentage of butterfat and egg yolk gives frozen custard a thick, creamy texture and a much smoother consistency than ice cream. Frozen custard is usually prepared fresh at the place of sale, rather than stored. I've only ever seen it in Kansas and Minnesota myself and okay, I love it. L.O.V.E. Yup!\n\nKransekake: Another Scandinavian recipe that's big in Minnesota. Made with almonds, egg white and sugar. Quite nice but not something I'd personally go out of my way to chase down and eat.\n\nLefse: A traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. Made with leftover potatoes, flour, butter, and milk or cream. Cooked on a griddle. Many Scandinavian-Americans eat lefse primarily around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Family members often gather to cook lefse as a group effort because the process is more enjoyable as a traditional holiday activity. Apparently. All sorts of ways to eat it.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><bold> * * * </bold></p>\n\nOkay, so ending additional notes. So interesting doing research. So stopping now.
