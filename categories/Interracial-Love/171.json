        "Thanks to all who have read this story this far. Your encouragement has propelled me through some painful moments. This part has been the most difficult to write thus far, and as result I had to take a break from it and start on part 9 instead. Some of the plot twists here came to me spontaneously, and with this part and the next one, sometimes writing it felt like I was tearing the scabs off old wounds I'd forgotten I had. Life can be rough, but that's what makes it interesting. \n\n I hope you all enjoy this part. The next one should be up in a few days.\n\n\n\n\n\n It broke my heart to have to leave Ethan in the hospital overnight, but there was nothing we could do. Rose had truly thrown a wrench into things this time. But she didn't realize in the end she'd only made things worse for herself. When the hearing officer had granted us emergency custody after Rose was arrested, visitation by Rose was not mentioned. That meant we controlled her access to the kids, until the hearing for the permanent order. And that was a couple months away. The way I felt right now, I couldn't trust her around the kids. I was not inclined to grant that access. \n\n Shavonda drove Brittany and me back to her house, where we spent the night. I was pretty upset about everything. No, I was livid. After we put Brittany to bed in the storage room we'd turned into a bedroom for the kids, she held me close trying to calm me. \"It's going to work out. You'll see.\"\n\n Once I calmed down, my mind started working. The gears turned and I devised a plan. I knew exactly what we were going to do. I ran it by Shavonda for her input.\n\n \"First thing we do,\" I said, \"is to remove the kids from the place Rose works at. Obviously, they are not safe there. Next, we deny her visitation until the hearing.\"\n\n \"Don't do her like that,\" Shavonda said. I knew it pained her to say that. \"She needs to see those kids. We should let her. But we do it in a way that we control her access. Removing the kids from her daycare is a good first step. We can find another place and send her the bill. After all, the courts said she pays for child care. They didn't say where that child care should be.\"\n\n Shavonda had a point. Once again, she was thinking on her feet, taking my plan and improving on it. In the permanent hearing, it would probably work against us if we denied Rose all access to the kids. But if we controlled when and where she could see them, we could make sure that one of the family was always present when Rose was there. There would be no more unsupervised visits with the kids.\n\n I called off work, yet again, so we could get arrange for different child care. We found a facility not too far from the Carson Street store. Shavonda could drop the Ethan off there, and visit him at lunch. She didn't normally take a lunch break while working, but she was going to start. Brittany would ride the school bus to kindergarten as usual, but she would be dropped off at the new daycare. \n\n I also paid a visit to Brittany's school, armed with a copy of the court order. I told them that under NO circumstance was Rose to pick Brittany up, unless I said so. Shavonda and I were the only ones able to do that. Just to be on the safe side, we also set up a password anybody picking her up from school would have to give. The password: love knows no color. It would take several days for the change in bus routing for Brittany to take effect. Since Friday was the last day before Christmas break, Shavonda would have to pick Brittany up at school for the next couple of days.\n\n We walked into Rose's facility, and kindly informed them that we were moving Brittany and Ethan out of their care. \"That's because we can't trust you with our children's well-being. We are moving them somewhere they'll be safe,\" I told them icily. The woman in charge was upset and tried to talk us into leaving them there, but we were adamant. I also told them I was seriously considering calling my lawyer to sue them for negligence. \n\n Rose smirked at us from her office on the way out. She had no idea what we'd just done. I wished we could have been there when they informed her the kids wouldn't be coming back.\n\n Suddenly, Shavonda turned and started back towards Rose's office. \"Swear to god I'ma smack the taste out that bitch's mouth. She gonna be spittin teeth fore I'm through with her.\"\n\n \"No,\" I hissed through clenched teeth, grabbing her by the arm. \"There's cameras here. You wanna go to jail for assault? Who's gonna help me raise the kids right?\" Reluctantly she followed me as I hustled her out of the building. Protecting your queen isn't easy. Sometimes, you have to protect her from herself.\n\n Last stop was the hospital. Ethan was ready to come home, and the caseworker brought him to us. Ethan seemed to be afraid of me. Not good, I thought. The last thing I need right now is for my own child to be afraid. The caseworker was watching us carefully for signs we were abusing the kids. Ethan had never acted like this around me before. \n\n Shavonda intuitively understood the situation. Ethan ran to her and held her tight, looking at me the whole time. \"Shhhh,\" she said to Ethan. \"Daddy's not mad at you. Nobody's mad at you. We love you. Nobody here is going to hurt you.\" Ethan calmed down, she picked him up, and handed him to me. The caseworker watched intently. I felt uneasy as I took hold of my son, but he was no longer afraid of me.\n\n \"Ethan,\" I asked, \"Why would you be afraid of me? Have I ever hit you?\"\n\n \"No.\" he replied. I left it at that not wanting to traumatize him further. We could explore why he was afraid later, preferably in one of those counseling sessions child welfare was having us attend. But I'd made my point. The caseworker could see that Ethan was terrified of something, or someone, but it wasn't me.\n\n \"Were you able to check the surveillance from the preschool?\" I asked the case worker.\n\n \"Yes,\" she replied. \"It showed Ethan walking into the school with Ms. Jenkins in the morning. It also showed your ex-wife leaving in the afternoon, with Ethan crying in her arms. He wasn't walking then.\"\n\n \"Mr. Waite,\" she continued, \"It seems obvious to me Ethan is afraid of something. HE seemed afraid of you until Ms. Jenkins told him you weren't mad and still loved him. But after that he's fine with you. That tells me you didn't hurt him. We still need you to go to counseling so the child psychologist can observe your interactions with Ethan, and Ms. Jenkins you should probably attend as well. That is all a formality. If he observes what I've just seen, you will be fine.\" She turned to Shavonda. \"Ma'am, it is obvious that you and this child adore each other. I wish you all the best of luck. Oh. And just so you know, we're going to be investigating that daycare, and trying to figure out who got Ethan to lie about what happened. That's probably who he is afraid of.\"\n\n With that, she left the room. We were free to take my son home. \n\n On the way, we took him to a toy store and let him pick out what he wanted. He chose a remote-controlled Jeep. In blue. Just like mine.\n\n Once home, we took Ethan's pants off and looked at the bruises. They were on the left side of both his legs, just above the knees. Angry purple bruises, round in shape, like a donut, with uninjured skin in the middle. Whatever it was a mystery. But it looked like it had hit with enough force to knock him to the ground. Whatever happened there, Rose knew what it was. My decision was easy. She'd have no access to the kids until I was sure she posed no threat. Shavonda put up no protest this time. She knew how protective I was of mine. She'd better, she was now one of them.\n\n Shavonda had decided to have a Christmas party for her employees at her house, after work one evening. Everybody came. We all sat around the living room, 3 of us on the couch, the rest on chairs borrowed from the kitchen. Shavonda left the room and returned with a stack of envelopes. \"I want to thank you all for coming here tonight,\" she said. \"We've had a very good year, we doubled our size. Sales at the Carson Street store are taking off better than I had expected, which means I hope to break even on the store sometime next year. We hired 3 new employees, Nykole, Ebony and Andre. Thanks guys for coming aboard, and if I haven't told you before, welcome. We couldn't have opened the second store without you.\"\n\n She handed out the envelopes, one to each employee. \"To show my appreciation for all the hard work you've put in, I've given each of you a bonus. Hopefully this will help out a bit. Merry Christmas.\"\n\n She still held one envelope. \"This last one is for somebody who has been indispensable to me this past year. He helped me prepare the Carson Street store for the grand opening, he helped out with the festivals last summer, he built our little Christmas village at the new store. Last, but not least, he has taken over some of the menial tasks on the weekend, leaving the rest of us to concentrate on things that increase our profits. Through all of this, he has refused to take a paycheck. Jason, this is for you.\" Smiling she handed me the final envelope. Inside was a check for $1000.\n\n \"Shavonda,\" I said. \"I can't take this. It's too much.\"\n\n \"I insist,\" she said. \"It's a lot less than another employee would have cost, and you've done so much for me in other ways as well. It's the least I could do.\" If I was going to have to take her money, I knew exactly where it was going. The money would go a long way towards paying off her engagement ring.\n\n We all gathered in the kitchen where the pizzas Shavonda had ordered sat on the kitchen table. Everybody ate pizza and Christmas cookies she'd baked the night before. I know, I got to lick the spoon. Or one of them anyway. Shavonda had three spoons so the kids didn't feel left out. Having work the next day, I turned in before the party ended. I felt Shavonda crawl into bed later on, and snuggled up in her warmth.\n\n As she'd told me she would earlier, one day Shavonda bought some brightly colored beads and put them in Brittany's hair. She looked so cute with strings of beads in her hair, but odd at the same time. You usually don't see pale white children with blonde hair wearing beads.\n\n Christmas came too soon. We had set up a Christmas tree at Shavonda's house but not at mine. We were spending most of our time over there anyway, so it seemed appropriate. Christmas eve, after the kids were asleep, we set out the presents. Given all that had happened, and the unforeseen expenses, the gifts were a little thin around the tree. I felt bad about it but that was life. Some years were prosperous, some were not. For me, the past few months were not prosperous.\n\n \"You wanna open ours now or in the morning?\" I asked.\n\n Let's do them now,\" Shavonda said excitedly. I retrieved two presents from under the tree. \n\n \"These are for you,\" I said modestly. \"They're not much but I hope you like them.\"\n\n Shavonda excitedly tore the wrapping paper off the first box. Inside was a sleeveless V neck dress. Gold, a color I knew looked great against her dark skin. She looked at it, then tore the wrapping paper off the second box. Inside were a pair of stilettos that matched the dress. \"Jason, they're beautiful!\" she exclaimed. \"I can't wait to wear them tomorrow.\"\n\n \"I figured that if gold looks good on a UPS truck it would look good on you too,\" I joked, ducking the play punch she threw my way.\n\n Shavonda reached into the pile and selected a long, narrow present. She handed it to me saying, \"I hope you like it.\" Tearing off the paper, I looked at the box. Inside, visible through the plastic window, was a blue and yellow locomotive. Chesapeake & Ohio 3310. How did she know?\n\n \"Von, baby, you know that's the locomotive I got a ride in at Clifton Forge when I was 2 years old? My dad had a friend who worked in the diesel shop, and he arranged for me to ride one of the locomotives on the turntable.\" I was excited. \n\n \"Your father told me all about it when I asked him. I remembered seeing the photo on the wall at your parents' place with you in the window of the engine. I looked online and they had that particular number in model form.\"\n\n \"Wait, you've been talking to my dad? When did you get their number?\" I was confused now.\n\n \"They gave it to me and told me to call anytime. I've been chatting with your family for a while now.\" Shavonda was full of surprises. I was touched that she'd gone to so much effort to find a model of a specific locomotive. One that meant so much to me.\n\n We sat on the couch, drinking black cherry rum and Dr. Pepper, with the big light off, and the soft, multicolored blinking Christmas tree lights the only illumination. Macy Gray played softly on the stereo. Our first Christmas together, and we got to spend it with the kids. Christmas just isn't the same without kids.\n\n \"Jason,\" Shavonda whispered, holding a piece of mistletoe over her head, \"Kiss me.\" I bent forward until our lips touched, sending a shock through both of us. Damn static electricity. Or was it our chemistry providing a spark for our passions? Either way, it was nice to know we still had the spark. I let my hands roam her back, feeling her body through the red sleeveless shirt she wore. With one hand, I found the clasps on her bra and popped them open. \"You're bad,\" she giggled. Great. She was in a playful mood.\n\n I remembered the first time we'd made out on this couch. When Althea had caught us in the act, with Shavonda's bra stuffed in the couch. I reached under her shirt and slid the bra cups off her breasts, feeling each one drop free of its restraint. \"We really need to take that thing off,\" I said. \"It's getting in the way.\"\n\n Shavonda pulled the red shirt over her head and flung it across the room. She did the same with her black bra. Her dark tits hung there in all their glory, nipples erect and waiting for my touch. \"Von, why'd you fling that bra? I wanted to stuff it in the couch for your mother!\" I exclaimed in mock irritation. Althea and the rest of the family would be over in the morning for Christmas dinner. \n\n \"You so nasty,\" Shavonda laughed. \"Turnabout's fair play.\" She slid her hand down my stomach and quickly undid the button and zipper on my jeans. \"Well, what have we here?\" She reached in my boxers and ran her hand along my shaft. \"Is that a Scottish sausage? It's all nice and firm.\"\n\n \"Aye, tis.\" I said in my best Scottish burr. \"Dinnuh be touchin me sausage unless ye intend to eat it. Tis a treat fit for an African queen.\" We both laughed. \n\n \"I almost forgot,\" she said. \"I have something else for you.\" Rising, she stepped over to the tree, and after searching the gifts pulled a small box and handed it to me. I opened it. Inside was a pendant, with a pattern made of polished stone. It said S heart J. The letters and heart were red, set in a background of tiger's eye. Beautiful did not begin to describe this piece.\n\n \"I've been working on this for a month. I've never tried to cut letters out of stone before, so it took me some time to get it right. I hope you like it. Now, you'll always know I love you,\" Shavonda said softly. \n\n She stood and quickly stripped off her jeans and panties. \"Now for your final gift. Get out of those clothes, Jason. Make love to me on the couch. Just like we started to do so long ago. This time, nobody will stop us. No foreplay. I'm ready. So are you. Just take me, and gently, sweetly make love to me.\"\n\n I had my clothes off in a heartbeat. She pulled me in for a kiss. As our lips met, she lay back and pulled me on top of her. \"No hands. Let them find each other. They want this as bad as we do.\" She spread her legs around me and pulled my hips into her moist crotch. My penis throbbed as I rubbed against her. The head found and parted her slick outer lips. I thrust forward, forcing it to rub against her clit. She gasped. \"No, not there. You know where. Don't tease me like that.\" I pulled back a little, the head sliding off her clit and down her moist slit. It found her opening. \"There, That's the spot.\" She pulled me into her with her legs. I slid easily inside her tight warmth.\n\n She felt so tight tonight. So good. I had to stop or I'd have flooded her right there. I raised up on my arms and stared at her deep brown body, a buffet laid out beneath me. The multi colored lights danced across her body. They lit up the sparkle in her dark brown eyes. \n\n \"You have the most amazing eyes,\" I said. \"They reach right into my heart.\"\n\n She thrust up against me. \"Then show me how much they mean to you. Let me watch your eyes as you make love to me.\" She rolled her hips beneath me. \"Don't worry, I won't take you over until you tell me to.\" She continued her slow gentle roll beneath me. I thrust against her, slowly. We were in no hurry. We had all night.\n\n She would take me to the edge, then hold me with her legs while my urge for release passed. Then she'd start the roll again. During this time, her vagina walls caressed me, massaged my manhood. How I held on, I'll never know. But she knew my body's reactions, and anticipated my release every time, stopping just before the point of no return. Shavonda had several mini orgasms while doing this, but through sheer willpower retained control of herself, and of me too. Finally, my dick tired of her games. It started to go soft in the slow, easy strokes we were using. That was my cue.\n\n \"Now,\" I said. \"I need to go for it now, baby.\" I thrust into her faster. The increased stimulation got me hard again, but still I was nowhere near release. I heard her moan and felt her orgasm around me. She worked her hips up into mine, meeting me thrust for thrusts as her legs pulled me deep within her. I didn't know how long I could keep the pace up, but still no release. My hands were now clutching her hips as I pounded away at that heavenly ebony pussy. Her tits bounced wildly as I watched. Damn she was beautiful. The best I ever had, or ever would have.\n\n I looked deep into her eyes as I pounded her. Even though she was by now moaning my name, \"Fuck me Jason, Fuck me good. That's it boy. Just like that.\" The look of pure lust I saw in those eyes at that moment is what did it. Suddenly, the feeling of impending orgasm welled up inside me. That's it. It was back. \n\n \"Ohhh, Von, I'm gonna come baby.\" I moaned as I made the final few thrusts. I felt her clench tightly around me as I let loose a torrent of manly juices deep inside her womb. \"Ahhhhhgh,\" I roared as I let her muscles squeeze me. She arched her back against me. \"Jason, I'm so close. Don't stop. Take me over the edge with you.\" Though I had shot my load, I continued to thrust inside her until she got her own release. We laid there on the couch until I softened and slipped out of her tight wet pussy. \"Merry Christmas,\" I said sleepily.\n\n \"Jason,\" Shavonda whispered beneath me. \"Do your legs work? Can you walk?\"\n\n \"No,\" I said. I could feel her legs still trembling and I knew she was in the same predicament. \n\n \"Baby, we can't sleep on the couch. The kids will find us,\" Shavonda had a point. We had to get to the bed. WE ended up crawling down the hall, our legs still too weak to stand. We crawled into bed and were soon fast asleep in each other's arms.\n\n I awoke during the night to find her bobbing her head on my shaft, licking the results of our swirl from my aching manhood. She raised her head, \"Just lay back and enjoy. Let me do this. I want your nut.\" In a half awoke, half dream state, I let her coax another warm load out of me with her tongue and mouth. After, milking me dry, she crawled up next to me. \"Thank you,\" she said, kissing me deeply. She tasted of my essence, and a hint of cherry rum. We fell asleep again, Shavonda curled up into me, arms and legs thrown across my body, my hand on her breast.\n\n \"Daddy, wake up! It's Christmas!\" Brittany was shaking me violently, excitedly. Shavonda was gone from the bed. I sat up groggily. I could hear her singing in the living room. ",
        "\"Give me a second, babygirl. Go see Ms. Von, I'll be out in a second.\" As Brittany ran off to the living room, I searched for and found a pair of pants to put on. I wandered out to the living room. \"What the...\" I started. The number of presents under the tree had multiplied. I didn't know presents were like rabbits, that they could reproduce overnight.\n\n \"Morning, sleepyhead,\" Shavonda teased. \"I got the kids a few things. I hope you don't mind. This is the first Christmas I've ever bought for my own kids.\" Brittany and Ethan excitedly stared at the pile. Shavonda started handing out presents to the kids. Soon the living room was strewn with toys and wrapping paper.\n\n The phone rang. It was Barbara. I put my cellphone on speaker, \"I know I am spending Christmas at your house, but Rose would like to see the kids for Christmas. Can I bring her along?\"\n\n Shavonda looked at me questioningly. \"No,\" I replied. \"Rose doesn't know where Shavonda lives. In light of all that happened I'd like to keep it that way.\"\n\n Shavonda whispered, \"Jason it's Christmas, let her see the kids.\"\n\n \"Here's what I can do,\" I said into the phone. \"Have Rose drop you off at my house. I will be there with the kids. She can visit them for about an hour.\" Shavonda nodded her head in approval. Good thinking, she mouthed at me.\n\n \"Kids, wanna go see Mommy,\" I asked.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yay,\" Brittany jumped up and down excitedly, beads clacking in her hair. Ethan looked fearful.\n\n We got them dressed and ready, and I took off in the Jeep with them in their carseats. Shavonda stayed behind. The relatives would be over soon. Somebody needed to stay at the house to let them in. Besides, there was no point in antagonizing everybody by having those two face off Christmas morning.\n\n Arriving at my house, we opened up and the kids ran around the house. Soon there was a knock on the door. I opened it to find Barbara and Rose on my porch. \"Come inside,\" I said. \"Kids, Mommy's here!\"\n\n Rose entered and sat on the couch. \"Mommy,\" Brittany hollered as she ran to Rose. The expression on Rose's face when she saw the beads was priceless. She looked absolutely horrified. Ethan ran to me and clung to my leg, eyeing Rose warily. Barbara stood by the TV, taking note of the kids' reactions. \n\n \"Ethan,\" I said. \"Go say hi to your Mommy.\"\n\n \"I'm scared,\" he replied, clinging harder to my leg. This was the first time he'd seen his mother since the hospital. His reaction told me all I needed to know. Barbara shook her head sadly. She knew too.\n\n \"Rose,\" I said coldly, \"Why is Ethan afraid of you?\"\n\n \"How the hell should I know?\" she snapped. \"Maybe you poisoned his mind.\" Really? I poisoned his mind? I'm the one trying to find the truth here.\n\n \"Rose,\" I said, more insistently this time, \"What did you do to my son? He's afraid of you. He never used to be this way. Now he is. What the hell did you do to my son?\"\n\n \"Ethan, you come here and see your Mommy,\" Rose yelled at him. Ethan clung tighter to my leg. He started crying.\n\n \"Rose,\" I said in a chilling voice. \"You're scaring him. I think you should go now. You are NOT going to ruin Ethan's Christmas. Against my better judgement, I agreed to let you see them. He's deathly afraid of you. You did something to him. You'd better leave. Now! Before I call the cops.\" Barbara grabbed Rose's arm and pulled her toward the door. \"Oh, and everything here better be in the same condition when I get back home. If it isn't, the police will be knocking on your door. Again. Stop digging yourself deeper. You're already in enough trouble. Stop making it worse.\"\n\n Barbara escorted Rose to her car. She said something I couldn't hear to Rose, who drove off in a huff. We waited a few minutes to see of Rose would return. When she didn't, Barbara helped me strap the kids in their carseats, and we locked the house up. I drove them back to Shavonda's house.\n\n The guests had already arrived. The house was packed with people. Luckily, Shavonda had gone to Family Dollar a few days earlier and bought a bunch of cheap stackable plastic chairs. At least everybody would have a place to sit. Velma and Tamika were there. Tamika had brought Brian, evidently, they were developing into a serious relationship. I was happy for her. Brian was a good dude, from what I could see. \n\n Everybody hugged Barbara and me. They seemed genuinely glad to see her. I was glad. Althea and Shavonda pulled me to the side. We went into the bedroom to talk. \"Jason, why didn't you let the kids' mother come over?\" scolded Althea. \"It's Christmas.\"\n\n \"Trust me,\" I said coldly, \"You wouldn't want World War Three. Let me tell you about our visit. Ethan was afraid of her. He clung to my leg the whole time. Wouldn't go over to see her. Cried when she yelled at him to come see her. I kicked her out of my house. She did something to that boy. He was terrified. Why would I let a child abuser come over and have free access to my queen's house?\" They looked at each other and smiled when I said the word queen.\n\n \"You got yourself a good one,\" Althea told her daughter. \"He's protective of you.\"\n\n The rest of the day was fun. I'd wondered why Shavonda hadn't been up cooking the night before. Now I knew. The family had brought all the food over. Everybody brought a covered dish. There was a feast laid out on the kitchen table and counter. There was ham and turkey, mashed potatoes, an assortment of greens. It was almost the same spread as Thanksgiving at Althea's, except that Christmas cookies and brownies had replaced the pumpkin and sweet potato pies.\n\n Shavonda had earlier explained the reasoning behind having the get together here, and I agreed wholeheartedly with her. The kids shouldn't be dragged away from their new toys to go visit relatives. Let the relatives come visit us instead. Everybody had brought presents for the kids.\n\n James handed me a heavy box, gift wrapped. He said, \"Shavonda told me you were studying to be an engineer. I thought you might find these interesting. Seeing how you're into railroads and all.\" I opened the box. Inside were a variety of documents relating to the railroad and its signal system. There were track charts, which showed the locations of curves, gradients, signals, culverts, overpasses, and track configurations. This was a civil engineer's dream. Also included were sheets explain the meaning of various signal indications, a Pittsburgh Division timetable, and various wiring diagrams for signal circuits. I was going to be busy for months soaking up all the information in this box.\n\n \"Thank you,\" I said. \"I don't know that I'll be able to understand the electrical stuff right away, but the track charts alone are pure gold,\" I said gratefully. James noticed the pendant around my neck. S heart J. \n\n \"Did Von make that for you?\" he asked. \"She really loves you, you know that? We haven't seen her this happy in a long time. Thank you for giving us our old, bubbly daughter back. Keep treating her the way you are, son, and everybody in the family will love you back.\"\n\n All too soon, the day was over. We saw the guests out one by one. The kids were curled up asleep on the couch. I carried them to bed and tucked them in. Together, Shavonda and I attacked the mess in the kitchen, putting leftover food in the refrigerator. Doing the mountain of dishes, bagging up the garbage and setting it outside. That done, we wearily headed for the bedroom. Though we kissed and our hands roamed, we were too tired to make love. \"Thank you for making this Christmas special,\" Shavonda said. \"The house seemed so alive with the kids running around all day. Their laughter brings joy here. It reminds me of when I was a little girl, and we'd visit Grandma and Grandpa in this very house for Christmas.\"\n\n After the holidays, our life settled in a new routine. Our lives had changed so much since Rose's arrest. We were now custodial parents. Nights out were few and far between. We had to take the kids everywhere we went. Not that Shavonda minded. She happily adjusted to motherhood as if she'd done it all her life. She was kind, yet firm with the kids, reeling them in gently when they got out of hand. \n\n We went shopping the week after Christmas. We bought a new bed and furniture for the kids' room, and a tall chest of drawers for the bedroom. My clothing now had a permanent place to stay. We spent less and less time at my house, I had effectively moved in with Shavonda. The only consistent time we spent at my house was train night on Wednesdays, and then only because there was no train layout at Shavonda's. I'd have to find a way to rectify that.\n\n Shavonda's friends took to the kids as well. The card games were somewhat toned down with the kids running around. They weren't as boisterous, but there was more laughter.\n\n All in all, we were coming together as a family rather nicely. \n\n Even Rose seemed to be leaving us alone, or so we thought. We had no idea of the sneaky plot she'd put into play.\n\n While we were at the mall shopping, I left Shavonda with the kids while I snuck off to put the $1000 on the ring. Only$800 more to go. At this rate, I'd have it paid off by the end of January.\n\n One thing that did set in after the holidays was seasonal depression. I'd always had it, always hated the long dark dreary days of winter. Hated the cold, the lack of sunlight. It turns out Shavonda suffered from it as well. One of the things I'd done at my house to help cope was to use daylight spectrum light bulbs in the house, as bright as I could find. The train layout was especially brightly lit. The bulbs helped counteract the lack of natural light. I invested in more of these light bulbs, and slowly replaced all the bulbs in Shavonda's house. This seemed to help us a little.\n\n In mid-January, my truck broke down, leaving me stranded on the highway for hours. I ended up running out of hours of service in Bellefonte, Pa. The company put me up in a hotel to get my rest, and sent somebody to get me in a rental truck. We hooked the new tractor to my trailer where I'd dropped it the night before in the parking lot. It was nice to have company on the 4-hour drive back to the warehouse. We stopped for lunch at a truck stop diner when we stopped for fuel. \n\n One thing about rental trucks. They don't have drive cams. They didn't film the actions of the driver in the cab, and therefore the company didn't know whether or not I had a passenger. When my truck still wasn't back from the repair shop by the next Thursday, I asked Von if she wanted to ride along for the day. It was my State College-Bellefonte day, and I figured she'd enjoy the mountain scenery. \n\n The truck cab had two seats, one on each side of the cab, with floor space and a gear shift between them. When we stopped for our lunch break at a rest area off 80, we discovered that we sat high enough nobody could see into the cab from the ground or other trucks. We had each other for lunch. First, I knelt in the area between the seats while Shavonda, who'd worn a skirt and no panties, threw her legs over my shoulders. I licked her sopping pussy, taking her through a couple of orgasms until she begged me to stop. Kissing me she said, \"My turn now.\" She proceeded to give me one of her deep throated blow jobs. I leaned back against the side window and let her work her magic with her tongue until she teased a mouthful of creamy white cum out of my rock-hard dick. Putting him back and zipping up my pants, she licked her lips, gathering up the little bit that had seeped out of the corner of her mouth. She looked so damned sexy. \"You know, this is just foreplay for later when we get home.\" She purred sexily.\n\n That night, after we put the kids to bed, we made mad, passionate love. It was a perfect day.\n\n As I had guessed, I was able to get the ring out of layaway by the end of January. It was a nice gold and diamond set, with separate engagement and wedding rings, that locked together but could be worn separately. It set me back almost $4000. Ring in hand, in early February, I secretly paid James and Althea a visit early one morning while Shavonda was still asleep. James took me into a room for a private conversation. I didn't want Althea knowing just yet.\n\n \"James,\" I said. \"Your daughter means the world to me. She is the air I breathe, the water I drink. She is the mother to my children. I am here to ask your permission. I'd like to marry your daughter.\" I showed him the ring set. \"I've been paying on these for months now, and the only reason it took me this long to ask you is that it took that long to pay for the ring.\"\n\n He looked at me long and hard. Finally, he spoke. \"Son,\" he said. \"We've been waiting a long time for the right person to come along for Shavonda. She means a lot to us. In spite of all the trouble that has come your way, your devotion to her has never wavered. She is happy now. That's what we wanted for her, somebody who would respect her and make her happy. You are that man. You have my blessing. Take good care of my baby girl. When do you plan on popping the question?\"\n\n \"I was thinking of taking her out to a nice dinner on Valentine's Day,\" I replied. \"It seems appropriate.\"\n\n \"How about we do this: I know a nice restaurant that has a banquet room. I will rent the room and you act like you are taking her to dinner. We will hold a surprise engagement party in the hall. I will be happy to pay for it.\"\n\n This was going far better than I had hoped.\n\n \"Althea! Come here! Jason has something to show you!\" James yelled as he opened the door to the room. She came rushing in. I handed her the box containing the rings. Opening it, she looked at the rings, then at me with tears in her eyes. \n\n \"Does this mean.....?\" she asked. I nodded my head, smiling at her. \"My baby's getting married!\" she screamed joyfully, pulling me into a tight hug. \"I knew you'd do right by her.\"\n\n The first week in February, we had the hearing in Small Claims Court about the damage to my vehicle. When Rose claimed she didn't do it, I presented the photos Mrs. Zucchero had taken of Rose in the act of spray painting my car. She turned white as a ghost. She knew she'd been beat. I also showed the police report from the break-in at the Carson Street store. Even though we hadn't requested it, the court ordered Rose to pay me the full $5000 allowed by law. \"If I had my way, I'd award more. It's obvious you intended to intimidate Mr. Waite and his lady friend. But the law limits me to $5000. In addition, I order you, Rose Waite, to provide the court with a list of all assets you have, including those sold or traded within the last six months. You will make your first payment of $1000 by the end of the month, or your assets will be frozen. We will also take steps to recover any assets you have transferred to another entity since the file date of this case.\" The judge ordered. \"If I may give some advice, Mrs. Waite, you need to let this go. I cannot throw you in jail, but I would if I could.\"\n\n Rose looked crushed. She stormed out of the courtroom. Shavonda hugged me. \"We won another round,\" she said, eyes aglow. I wondered if we'd ever see any money. In Pennsylvania, wages can't be attached for a civil court judgement. If she decided to violate the court order, we'd be forced to take further action, including a lien on her car or possible sheriff's sale. \n\n On Valentine's Day, I worked my usual run, getting back to the house by 7pm. Shavonda was already getting ready for our special dinner date. I quickly jumped in the shower, and changed into the outfit she's picked for me. She wore the gold dress and heels I'd bought her for Christmas, along with the hoop earrings. She'd painted her nails and toes red, and wore red lipstick as well. God, she looked good. I wore a button down white shirt with black dress pants and belt. A red tie and black dress shoes completed my outfit. She knew our first Valentine's Day together would be special, and picked the outfit accordingly. She had no idea how special our dinner was to become. \n\n The weather was unseasonably warm for a Pittsburgh winter. Since the temperature was, even after dark, in the upper 60s, neither of us wore a jacket. We arrived at the restaurant just in time for our 9pm reservation. I'd put in for a vacation day for the following day, a Friday, so we could stay out late. \"Waite, party of two for 9pm,\" I told the headwaitress.\n\n \"Right this way,\" she said, leading us down a hallway away from the dining room. Shavonda looked at me as I followed her, eyes questioning. She knew something was up. The waitress opened to door to the banquet room. Shavonda stepped inside, noticing all of our friends and family gathered at the tables. There was a vacant table, set for two, at the head of the room. A cake was on one of the tables, red hearts on white icing. It was inscribed, 'Will you marry me?'\n\n Shavonda turned to me, bewildered. I was down on one knee with the ring box in hand. \"Shavonda Jenkins,\" I said as I took the engagement ring out. \"In the short time I've known you, you have come to mean everything to me. You are the air I breathe, the water I drink. You are the best thing in my life. Will you marry me?\"\n\n \"Yes!\" she sobbed as tears ran down her cheeks. She was smiling. Her eyes were pure love. \"Oh God, yes! Yes, I will be your wife. You make me so happy. You are my joy. Of course I'll marry you.\" I slipped the ring on her finger, and rose to hug her. Our lips found each other. Everybody applauded, the sound of their clapping echoing in our ears. \n\n \"Slip her some tongue!\" I heard Danny yelled out. I would have to kick his ass later.\n\n \"How long have you been planning this?\" she asked.\n\n \"I've been paying on the rings since August,\" I replied. \"See, they are a set. One is an engagement ring, the other a wedding ring. They lock together as one combined ring.\" I showed her, just as I'd showed James a couple of weeks before.\n\n \"August?\" she asked. \"You've known all that time. Why so long a wait?\"\n\n \"Those rings cost a fortune,\" I told her candidly. \"We've been snowed under with unexpected expenses, and I couldn't pay them off until now.\"\n\n We dined on prime rib. Shavonda also ordered her favorite crab legs as well. We sat at our table for two, while everybody crowded around us and congratulated us. Shavonda sipped a flute of champagne. \"So I'll let you pick the date. When would you like your wedding day?\" I asked.\n\n \"May 18th. Our first anniversary. It should be a Saturday,\" she whispered. \"I can't believe you did this. I love you so much.\"\n\n After everybody had eaten, we cut the cake. It was marble. James said, \"I thought you two would enjoy the mixture of flavors. I chose it in honor of you two, and your undying love for each other.\" Yes, the cake looked just like us.\n\n The party broke up a little after 11pm. We loaded what was left of the cake into the rear seat of the Jeep. It would be such a shame to waste good cake. \n\n On the way home, at Shavonda's insistence, we stopped at the convenience store/ gas station on Brownsville Road near the end of my street. We were going to spend the night at my house, because the kids and babysitter were at Shavonda's. She went to the cooler in the back of the store, and grabbed a can of whipped cream. In one of the aisles, she found a bottle of Hershey's syrup. \"I feel like a sundae tonight,\" she cooed. \n\n We put the items on the counter and were about to pay the clerk, when the door to the store opened. In walked Rose. She stopped dead when she saw us. She looked at us, then at the whipped cream and chocolate syrup on the counter. \"Awww HELL no!\" she screamed, and stalked out of the store. We paid for them, and left the store before she could start any trouble. I looked around for Rose, and found her talking on a pay phone by the street. Good. We wouldn't have to come anywhere close to her. ",
        "We walked to the Jeep, hand in hand, and I opened the door for my queen. Out of the corner of my eye I kept watch on Rose to make sure she didn't try anything. She hung up the phone, but stood there staring at us as we left.\n\nI decided not to park the Jeep on the street, in case Rose wanted to cause mischief. So, instead of taking my street off Brownsville, I turned into the alley instead, opting to drive the seven blocks back to my parking spot and avoid the stop signs on the street itself. About halfway down the alley, a cop car swung in behind us, following us down the alley. I'd noticed a lot of them patrolling this neighborhood lately, so I paid it no mind. I pulled into my parking space as the cop continued down the alley.\n\n \"Mmmm, baby. I can't wait to eat. You. Alive,\" Shavonda whispered sexily. She leaned over for a kiss. Our tongues entwined. Neither of us wanted to come up for air. My hand was on her leg and I slid it up her inner thigh. Something was telling me to stop, and get out of the car and into the house, but I couldn't resist my queen's passionate embrace.\n\n A knock on the window startled us. We turned to see the cop, light out, knocking on Shavonda's window. She rolled it down.\n\n Id's, license and registration, please,\" said the cop. He wore a smirk that said 'gotcha.'\n\n Shavonda reached in her purse and gave him her driver's license, while I gave him mine. I reached over Shavonda into the glove box for the registration and insurance information for the Jeep, and handed it to him. This sucked, being pulled over by a cop, in my own driveway. He walked back to his car to run our info. Evidently, he'd circled the spot when he saw us pull in my parking spot.\n\n After a few minutes, he returned to the Jeep and handed us back our id's. \"Out of the car, ma'am.\" He ordered Shavonda. When she complied, he patted her down, and placed her in handcuffs. \n\n \"Hey, what do you think you're doing,\" I protested. \n\n \"You really should find somewhere else to pick up a whore,\" he said. \"People in this neighborhood call us all the time.\" Turning to Shavonda, he said, \"Your luck just ran out. We've been looking for you for a month.\"\n\n \"I ain't no whore,\" Shavonda said through gritted teeth. \n\n \"That's my fianc\u00e9,\" I protested loudly. \"Our engagement cake is on the backseat.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well somebody just called in a vehicle with YOUR license plate, picking up a woman meeting HER description, right down to her clothing, in this here alley. I followed you and watched you pull into a dark, secluded parking spot. When I knock on the window, your hand is up her dress,\" he said coldly. \"She's coming with me. You're lucky I don't haul your ass in with her.\"\n\n \"This is MY house,\" I gritted. He walked Shavonda back to the patrol car and pushed her into the back seat. I could see her sobbing. My heart was breaking. He sat in the front seat typing on his computer.\n\n I got out of the car and approached him. \"Sir, get back in your vehicle,\" he ordered.\n\n \"Jason, do as he says,\" Shavonda pleaded tearily. She looked up to me and motioned her head toward the car. \"No sense in both of us going to jail. I'll be okay, I promise.\" I could see the fear in her eyes. \"Call Ziggy and tell him what happened.\"\n\n Fuming, I walked back to the Jeep and sat down in the front seat. In a minute, the cop walked over and handed me a ticket for running 3 stop signs in the alley. This was bullshit. There were no stop signs in the alley. \"Since there was no penetration, I can't arrest you. You're getting off lucky.\" He looked at me coldly. \"You got something to say?\" he asked.\n\n \"Hell yeah, I got something to say,\" I snapped. \"Did you notice the address on my driver's license? That's this house. You're on private property. Get the hell off my land!\" I thought he was going to arrest me, but he shrugged and walked back to the patrol car. He drove off, with Shavonda crying in the back seat.\n\n I felt so helpless. He'd taken my queen. He'd purposely ruined the happiest night of our lives, with trumped up charges against Shavonda. There was going to be hell to pay. He'd taken my queen, the one whose father I'd promised to protect. NOBODY takes my queen. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo be continued....."
