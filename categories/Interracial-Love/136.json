        "\u201cOh my God!\u201d Rose screeched as soon as she entered the foyer.  \u201cWes Roberts is in my house!\u201d\n\nHer hazel eyes went perfectly round and her gray backpack slid off her shoulder to hit the floor.\n\nPatrick, earbuds in and head down didn\u2019t realize his sister had come to a complete stop in front of the door.  He ran into her back when he tried to enter the house.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d he squawked.\n\nHe finally looked up and his expression changed to match his sister.  \u201cBloody hell!  You\u2019re Wes Roberts!\u201d\n\nWes smiled and gave them a slight wave.\n\n\u201cHow did you\u2026when did you\u2026what are you doing here?\u201d stuttered Rose.\n\n\u201cYou must be here to see Uncle Vic!\u2019 Patrick exclaimed.\n\nTabitha opened her mouth to say something but her nephew had dropped his backpack and pumped both fists in the air.  \u201cUncle Vic is sooo cool!  I can\u2019t believe this!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d Tabitha said waving her hands, \u201cAunt Tabby here\u2026another person in the room.\u201d\n\nNeither child acknowledged her.  They had pulled their mobile phones from their pockets and began dialing.\n\n\u201cLizzie won\u2019t believe this!\u201d Rose muttered to herself.\n\nTabitha was struck.  How did they know Wes and why were they so freaked?\n\n\u201cLamar is coming over right now!\u201d Patrick laughed.  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Tabitha said with her hands planted on her hips.  \u201cHow do you guys know Wes?\u201d\n\nThey both gave her incredulous looks.  \n\n\u201cEveryone knows Wes Roberts.  He was the original drummer for Falling Line!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have all their CDs upstairs!\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle Vic is sooo cool!\u201d Patrick exclaimed again.\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know your uncle,\u201d said Wes.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Rose.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wes asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s here to see me!\u201d Tabitha said crossing her arms.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse us, we were just headed out!\u201d Tabitha said tugging Wes away from her niece and nephew.\n\nThey walked toward the back of the house, through the kitchen and into the back garden.  \n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Wes muttered when they walked out into the garden.  \u201cThat house is unbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great,\u201d Tabitha said dismissively as she pulled him into a white wood gazebo.  \u201cWould you mind explaining to me why Rose and Patrick know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, they\u2019re British tweens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d\n\nWes smiled down at her and moved to kiss her but she stepped back, out of his reach.  \u201cWesley!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just so happy to see you.\u201d\n\nShe glared at him. \n\n\u201cOkay, okay.  Have you ever noticed that the people that say, \u2018Oh my gosh!  I used to love the Spice Girls!\u2019 are approximately the same age?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they are.  There\u2019s a certain age range that is prime for marketing.  Preteens have a death grip on their parents\u2019 purse strings.  If they want it, they get it, and if a record company can catch their attention, they\u2019ve got the market locked.  So people like Logan pander to the preteens and make money hand over fist.\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded.  \u201cFalling Line was the other band\u2026the one that didn\u2019t go world-wide.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly, they\u2019re still together and a big deal over here.  Most people that know the band when it first started remember me as the original drummer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, wow.  So you\u2019re kinda like a big deal.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled and snared her arm, pulling her to him.  Tabitha bumped against his chest and laughed.  \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\nShe put her head on his chest and listened to his heart for a few beats.  \u201cI just realized that can\u2019t really be seen in public with you either.  We might actually make the front page over here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, just so I\u2019ve got this straight, you\u2019re not sleeping with the rich and famous soccer star, well on your way to joining the ranks of Britain\u2019s most stylish W.A.G.S.?\u201d\n\n\u201cTabitha snuggled against his chest.  \u201cYou can\u2019t believe everything you read.\u201d\n\nWes leaned down to drop a kiss on her forehead.\n\nTabitha watched Dion make her way down one of the paths from the house to the gazebo where they stood in comfortable silence.  Dion smiled at them for a moment before she spoke.  \u201cI\u2019ve had your things relocated to the third floor, South Wing.  There is a king-sized bed in there and two armoires, plus a sitting area, and an amazing bathroom.\u201d\n\nTabitha freed herself from Wes and faced her sister.  \u201cLady Solomon, shouldn\u2019t you be more concerned with the propriety of our sleeping arrangements?\u201d\n\nDion rolled her eyes.  \u201cOh, please\u2026like I don\u2019t know how far he\u2019s gotten!\u201d\n\nTabitha felt her face heat.  \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t want to stay here?\u201d\n\nDion turned to Wes.  \u201cSurely you wouldn\u2019t refuse the chance to be a guest in our home?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never,\u201d said Wes, \u201cbut at present my luggage is in a hotel in Birmingham.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me which and I\u2019ll send someone to collect it.\u201d  \n\nHe did just that as Tabitha made her way back to the house.  Things were spiraling out of control.  What was supposed to be an extended visit to see her sister and the new baby was turning into a cataclysmic event, Wes had come to tell her that he loved her and she was almost ready to admit the same to him.  Vic was returning in a few days to see her and Wes would be staying at the house.  Things were getting messy.\n\nTabitha replayed the conversation she\u2019d had with Vick on the phone that morning as she walked back to the house. \n\n***\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she answered after picking up the phone in the kitchen.  She\u2019d been surprised that the customary greeting wasn\u2019t more colloquial, but evidently only the business lines in the home were answered with any pomp and circumstance.\n\n\u201cWell, hello love!\u201d Vick\u2019s voice boomed through the line.\n\n\u201cHey Vick, how was the game?\u201d she asked as she stirred her tea.  \n\n\u201cWonderful, it was a win.  I scored three out of the five goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d said Tabitha with genuine excitement.  For one player to score three goals in a professional soccer game was quite a feat.\n\n\u201cI know\u2026highest scoring game of my career.  I believe you are my lucky charm!\u201d\n\nShe smiled.  \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m stopping in for another visit after the game in Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup, I\u2019ve got to get all the luck I can before you hop back across the pond.\u201d\n\nTabitha didn\u2019t know if she was should feel flattered or used.  \u201cWell, we\u2019ll look forward to seeing you...uh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThis weekend,\u201d Vick finished for her.  \u201cOh, and tell Dion that mum will pop \u2018round for a visit on Thursday.  She wants it to be a surprise, but its only fair to give warning lest my dear sister be caught unaware and unprepared.\u201d\n\nTabitha swallowed hard. Lady Evelyn Charlotte Walter-Solomon was going to \u201cpop round\u201d for a visit?  Her insides twisted with anxiety.  How did her sister deal with her ladyship coming over to hang out?\n\n\u201cOhhh,\u201d she groaned placing the phone in the cradle.  \n\n\u201cYou look a bit sallow, Tabitha.\u201d\n\nShe grabbed Rick\u2019s arm as he tried to walk past her.  \u201cYour mom is coming for a visit on Thursday.\u201d\n\nHe smiled.  \u201cBrilliant, the two of you can finally have a proper introduction.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, brilliant,\u201d she muttered after a sip of tea.  \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotta find something to wear.\u201d\n\n*** \n\n\u201cTabby!\u201d said Wes snapping her out of her mind and back into the present.\n\n\u201cDion\u2019s mother-in-law is coming for a visit tomorrow,\u201d she said to him.  \u201cI\u2019ll be expected to be here to meet her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said with a shrug.  \u201cI\u2019ll have to dress for the occasion then.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need to go shopping?\u201d she asked.  \u201cWe can take a car to the Bullring and find your suit.\u201d\n\nHe draped an arm across her shoulders.  \u201cBelieve it or not, I do own a couple suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, um\u2026okay.  Wait\u2026I\u2019ve never seen you in a suit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had the occasion to wear a suit around you.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you owned one\u2026but I guess I should have known, a man can\u2019t live his entire life in t-shirts and jeans.\u201d  Tabitha stopped walking and stepped from under his arm.  \u201cWait a minute\u2026you were a bonafied rock star.  Why are you working at the music store?  Did you lose all your money, you know, gambling, drugs, Enron?\u201d\n\nWes chuckled.  \u201cNo, I\u2019m flush.  I\u2019ve got plenty.  I wouldn\u2019t give my dad the satisfaction of blowing all my money.\u201d\n\nTabitha frowned.  \u201cSo you work at Life Sounds because\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy and I love Mr. Dennis like a father.  He\u2019s a great guy and his life\u2019s work is no less important than anything I\u2019ve done.\u201d  \n\n\u201cWhy did you let me think you were\u2026you know\u2026a salesman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t let you think anything\u2026I am a salesman.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d snapped Tabitha.\n\n\u201cI told you that I wasn\u2019t broke.  I just didn\u2019t tell you that I\u2019ve got more money than most in my savings account.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry for what?  I mean, you didn\u2019t tell me something that\u2019s a pretty big deal.  You could have mentioned that you\u2019re famous and well-off.\u201d\n\nWes frowned, his gold eyes darkening.  \u201cWould that have changed anything?\u201d\n\nTabitha sighed.  \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, then,\u201d he said curtly.  \u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t have changed anything back then, it doesn\u2019t have to change anything now.\u201d  He turned and walked into the house, leaving Tabitha outside.  \n\n***\n\nThat night, Tabitha had been in the bathroom for almost an hour.  She was delaying bed as long as possible.  Wes was in there and as much as she wanted to have reunion sex, his little lie of omission was weighing on her mind.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t care that he was loaded.  Did he really think her so shallow?  Why would he let her believe he was a salesman eking out a living while financing the upgrades on a house willed to him by his grandparents?  Bank accounts certainly weren\u2019t first date conversation but a few million dollars would be worth mentioning at some point in the months they\u2019d been together.  \n\nShe huffed a sigh and spun away from the mirror.  Marie.  Okay\u2026so Wes had been hurt in the past.  Logan\u2019s comment at the listening party made sense now\u2026but she was nothing like Marie.  For starters, she wasn\u2019t French\u2026and she didn\u2019t go for girls.  For another thing:  she never considered fame or fortune a dating requirement\u2026not that she\u2019d had extensive experience in relationships.\n\nFinally, she took a deep breath and left the bathroom.  She walked slowly to the bed and let out a relieved sigh at what she saw.  Wes was asleep, his ink black hair across the pillow, his chest rising with slow, even breaths.  She slipped into the bed beside him and let sleep take her.\n\n***\n\nThe next morning, the house was in a bustle.  The servants had never been more visible.  They were cleaning, rearranging, cooking, and inspecting every room and surface.  Tabitha trudged to the kitchen and brewed her tea.  Lady Solomon\u2019s name was floating off everyone\u2019s lips around the house.  \n\nAfter her cup of tea and a pile of scrambled eggs, Tabitha showered and dressed for the day.  Wes was still asleep, recovering from jet lag.  Quiet as she could, she dressed in a floor-length summer dress covered with pink, yellow, and green flowers.  After slipping on her flip-flops, she made her way downstairs and came upon Dion\u2019s sister-in-law in the parlor.  \n\nPosie was model tall and ballerina slender.  She wore a blue and white paisley tea dress, short enough to show off a set of mile long legs, with cap-sleeves to show her slender, toned arms.  Her skin was fair but with evidence of a slight tan.  She had gold, silver, and copper bangles up one arm, a set of diamond drop earrings that hung to her shoulders, and wide blue eyes.  She favored her brothers with the blonde hair and high cheek bones, but she was feminine and far less imposing.  \n  \n\u201cPosie?\u201d Tabitha asked when she entered the room.  \u201cDion didn\u2019t tell me you were coming.\u201d\n\nAt this rate every one of Rick\u2019s family members would be in that house.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned.  She told me that Vic was coming and then mum was to come here, along with you and I knew I had to fly straight from Milan to complete this happy reunion!  I can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t seen each other since the wedding!\u201d  \n\nPosie leaned down to breeze a kiss on both Tabitha\u2019s cheeks.  \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault; I\u2019ve only been stateside once since the wedding and I didn\u2019t stay very long.\u201d\n\nTabitha shrugged.  \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m busy dodging playboys!\u201d\n\nThey both laughed.  \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came for an extended visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, did your mother arrive with you?\u201d \n\nPosie laughed.  \u201cNo, mum is coming in from Paris this afternoon.\u201d\n\nTabitha sat on a couch and pulled a book from the nearest end table, History of the British Isles.  \n\nPosie wrinkled her nose at the book.  \u201cStudying?\u201d\n\nTabitha shrugged.  \u201cI guess.  I just don\u2019t want to be caught off guard.\u201d\n\nPosie sank gracefully into a chair and folded one long leg over the other.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about discussing the origins of the royal family with mum.  She\u2019s not into such droll conversation.\u201d\n\nThe day went on in a similar vein.  She and Posey talked until lunch.  Wes woke up in time to eat lunch but went straight back to bed.  Tabitha was relieved he was so tired.  She still wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted to say to him about\u2026well, everything.  Rose and Patrick were infatuated with him, Dion liked him, but Tabitha didn\u2019t know what the hell to do anymore.  How could she be in love with someone that she didn\u2019t even know\u2026and why was the thought of being in love at all so damn scary.\n\nAn eerie stillness came over the house at around three o\u2019clock.  It was as if the entire house drew in a collective sigh and held their breath.  The babies didn\u2019t even cry since they were both down for naps.  Tabitha was in the suite reading when the pewter grey Rolls Royce Phantom pulled in to the estate.  The sound of slamming doors drew her from the love seat to the window.  Tabitha watched as the driver opened the back door.  There was a woman with dark hair rushing around the vehicle to the trunk.  She talked to one of the maids, their heads close together.  A small hand extended from the car and allowed the chauffer to help her out.  The hand was attached to a narrow arm that was followed by a neatly dressed, white haired woman, small in stature, but big in presence.  \n\nTabitha stepped back from the window so she wouldn\u2019t be caught staring.  This was it, then, the moment of truth.  She hurried over to the vanity to brush her hair and \u201cput on her face\u201d as Dion would say.\n\nWes walked into the room and she turned to look at him.  He wore a black button up shirt, open at the collar, slim fit khaki pants, and square-toed black slip-ons.  Her breath caught when she saw that his hair was combed back, no longer in his face, leaving his squared-jaw on display.  He was clean-shaven, his eyes traveled over her before he smiled. \n\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she huffed.\n\n\u201cYou look scared as hell,\u201d he teased coming up behind her.  He slipped an arm around her waist and dropped a kiss on her shoulder.  \n\n\u201cI am,\u201d she muttered wriggling from his grip.  \u201cI have to get downstairs, are you coming?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be down soon, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s expecting me,\u201d he said with a laugh.  \n\nTabitha glared and walked out of their room.  She had to get it together and stop being mad at Wes long enough to make a good first impression on her Ladyship.\n\n***\n\n\u201cLady Solomon,\u201d Tabitha said as she shook hands with Rick\u2019s mother\u2026Dion\u2019s mother-in-law.  The woman was a walking Chanel ad.  Her suit was fitted perfectly to her slim frame, her hair was coiffed, and her makeup was flawless.  She had porcelain complexion, and delicate bone structure.  \n\nShe smiled.  \u201cPlease call me Evelyn.  I\u2019ve heard many good things about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll lies, I can pretty much guarantee,\u201d Tabitha muttered before she could stop herself.\n\nLady Solomon laughed.  \u201cYes, I was told that you\u2019re quite funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as I thought, my humor is about as dry as a Tyrannosaurus femur.\u201d\n\nEvelyn laughed again.  \u201cPlease have a seat.  I was also told that you are a wonderful conversationalist.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s actually true.  I love to talk!\u201d\n\n\u201cAs do I, maybe we should have someone join us so there\u2019ll be someone who will actually listen.\u201d\n\nTabitha glanced around the parlor.  It was suspiciously empty.  \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have a habit of disappearing when I come around.  Dion has gone to feed Ash.  The nanny has the older children upstairs\u2026making them presentable I assume. Rick isn\u2019t home from work, my staff is unpacking, and Posie has a nasty habit of avoiding me until it\u2019s a hair from being rude.  You\u2019d think I was an axe murderer.  I\u2019m not that frightening, am I?\u201d\n\nTabitha swallowed.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say frightening.\u201d\n\nLady Solomon lifted a perfectly arched brow.  \u201cWhat would you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cIntimidating.\u201d\n\nLady Solomon smiled.  \n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go with intimidating.\u201d\n\nWes walked into the room as Lady Solomon laughed aloud.\n\n\u201cOh my!\u201d she said standing.  \u201cYou\u2019re that rock star Patrick and Rose have been gushing about since yesterday!  They\u2019ve sent me at least twenty texts about you being in the house.\u201d\n\nWes smiled.  \u201cI\u2019m Wesley Roberts, Lady Solomon; it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\nTabitha blinked at him.  Why did he sound so\u2026so un-Wes-like?\n\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine, Mr. Roberts.\u201d \n\nWes kissed her hand and Tabitha thought she\u2019d swallow her tongue in shock.  Luckily, the children entered at that moment and Lady Solomon was too enraptured by her grandchildren to notice the way Tabitha stared at Wes like she\u2019d never seen him before.\n\nHe sat beside her and kissed her cheek.  \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cYou know exactly who I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking I don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.  \u201cYou\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you rather me show her my tattoos and chase you around this room trying to get your clothes off?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if you ever get my clothes off again,\u201d she hissed before almost leaping off the couch and walking over to join Lady Solomon and the kids.  \n\nPosie entered the room and gave her mother a polite kiss.  \u201cMum, Vick has just arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he wasn\u2019t coming until the weekend!\u201d Tabitha almost screeched.\n\nPosie shrugged.  \u201cHe\u2019s just pulled up.\u201d\n\nTabitha\u2019s stomach fell to her feet.  She wasn\u2019t ready for Vick.  She\u2019d just gotten over her fear of his mother, and she was hoping Wes would be gone by the weekend so he wouldn\u2019t run into Vic.  Her luck was really going to shit lately.\n\n\u201cTabitha!\u201d Vick boomed when he entered the room.  He enveloped her in a hug and bussed her cheek.  \u201cMy good luck charm!\u201d\n\nTabitha laughed and patted his arm.  \u201cHi Vic, congrats on the win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to you, love!\u201d\n\nTabitha stepped away from him.  \u201cI\u2019m sure I had nothing to do with it\u2026just a coincidence.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences.\u201d  \n\nShe winced as he turned to greet the rest of the family, including Dion who\u2019d just walked into the room holding the baby.  Vic took Ash in his large hands and looked him over with a serious expression.  He handed the bundled baby back to Dion and smiled.  \u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d he said with a nod.  \u201cYou never cease to amaze me, sis.\u201d\n\nDion blushed and handed the baby to Lady Solomon.  \n\n\u201cWhose this, then?\u201d Vic asked walking toward Wes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Wes Roberts, Uncle Vic!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!  The pop singer.\u201d\n\nTabitha cringed.  \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a drummer,\u201d Patrick said rolling his eyes.\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nThe apology didn\u2019t seem genuine.  The two shook hands and Wes set his gaze on Tabitha.  His expression was drawn and his jaw was clenched.  Tabitha tried to ignore the daggers coming from his dark gold eyes.  Vic slipped an arm around Dion\u2019s shoulder and kissed her forehead.\n\nTabitha was so distracted watching Lady Solomon coo at Ash, that she didn\u2019t notice when Wes got close enough to slide an arm around her waist.  She stiffened, but didn\u2019t pull away\u2026not in a room full of people\u2026especially these people.  He leaned over to whisper close to her ear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you naked again tonight, bet on it.\u201d\n\nTabitha gasped and felt her face flush.  \n\nVic noticed their close embrace and smiled.  \u201cYou two look quite cozy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing each other for months,\u201d said Wes, his voice a low growl.",
        "Dion raised both eyebrows at Tabitha.  Her sister\u2019s subtle gesture made Tabitha blush harder.  A clock on the mantle struck six and Lady Solomon finally looked up from cooing at Ash.  \u201cIs dinner served?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dion.  \u201cIt\u2019ll be served in the large dining hall since there are so many of us.\u201d\n\nEveryone filed out, leaving Tabitha and Wes.  She slipped out of his grasp and planted both fists on her hips.\n\nWes glared at Vic\u2019s retreating back.  \n\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Tabitha hissed.\n\nWes tried to compose himself when he turned back to her.  \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes.  \u201cYou might as well have lifted your leg and peed on mine!\u201d Tabitha snapped.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay.  I just\u2026he\u2019s just\u2026ugh.\u201d\n\nTabitha ran a hand over her hair.  \u201cOkay, okay!  Just stop acting jealous!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not acting, Tabby.  I am jealous.  He\u2019s been here with you while I\u2019ve been at home eating my heart out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you leave under false pretenses.  When he met you, you and I were supposed to be just friends and I don\u2019t want to be friends with you.  I want more\u2026much, much more.  I just need you to know that.  I understand if you don\u2019t feel the same about me.  I let you believe that I didn\u2019t want strings so I wouldn\u2019t scare you off, but I do want strings.  I want lots and lots of strings.  I\u2019ll be a fucking marionette puppet if you ask.\u201d\n\nTabitha laughed.  \u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d she whispered just before she wrapped her arms around his neck.  \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Wes said pulling her closer, \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, we have to go have dinner with her Ladyship, so we\u2019ll have to talk about this later.\u201d\n\t\n***\n\nAfter dinner Rick, Wes, and Vic went into the study.  Dion took the younger children upstairs for bath and bedtime.  Evelyn excused herself to go upstairs and get some rest.  The older kids retired to their rooms; leaving Posie and Tabitha in the parlor.  \n\n\u201cYou gentleman friend is very attractive.\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded.  \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026he\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nPosie rolled her eyes.  \u201cYou\u2019re over the moon.\u201d\n\nTabitha wanted to protest, but decided to just stay quiet.  Posie was entitled to her opinions, and she wasn\u2019t going to try to convince her otherwise.  \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Tabitha sighed.\n\nPosie smirked.  \u201cThat\u2019s what people say when they\u2019re not willing to admit the truth.\u201d\n\nTabitha wanted to walk right out of that room.  What would Posie Solomon know about complicated relationships?  She\u2019d grown up with anything she wanted, and was hot enough to have any man she wanted.  Tabitha set her jaw and became very interested in a painting on a far wall.  Two girls drifted in water, it was a vaguely familiar impressionist painting.  She let her eyes unfocus so the colors bled together.\n\nPosie cleared her throat.  \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.  Life is complicated for all of us.\u201d\n\nTabitha didn\u2019t respond, instead putting the painting back in focus with a long blink.\n\n\u201cFor example, while everyone thinks I\u2019m some posh princess that does charity work while waiting for a random prince to notice me and propose marriage, nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nTabitha looked at Posie.  She couldn\u2019t be serious.  \n\nPosie laughed.  \u201cI see you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\nAgain, Tabitha found herself without a response.  \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say, I\u2019d take a princess over a prince any day.\u201d\n\nTabitha\u2019s eyes went wide.  \n\n\u201cAh, now I\u2019ve got your attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Tabitha muttered.  \u201cYou\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nPosie nodded.  \n\n\u201cBut what about\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLady Solomon and the family reputation?\u201d Posie finished for her.  \u201cBetween the two of us, she loves it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves it?\u201d Tabitha parroted.\n\n\u201cOh, yes.  She\u2019s the first of her friends to have a kid out of the closet.  It\u2019s like she\u2019s got a couture dress that no one will ever have.  If one of her friends come up with a homosexual kid of their own, it\u2019ll be like they\u2019re copying her!  The media is a horse of a different color, however.  We can\u2019t have those vultures speculating about my sexuality.\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded.  \u201cMakes sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it, though?\u201d  Posie laughed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the second lesbian I\u2019ve met in the past month.\u201d\n\nPosie\u2019s eyebrow arched.  \u201cReally?\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded.  \u201cShe\u2019s pretty much in the closet to avoid media attention too.\u201d\n\nPosie was quiet for a while.  \u201cYou must mean Dravyn, the lead singer of that band.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to verify.  I\u2019ve heard rumors and I know Wes was the drummer for that band a while back.  They used to be in the papers all the time.  I just put the facts together.\u201d\n\nTabitha swallowed.  She couldn\u2019t affirm Dravyn\u2019s sexuality, but she didn\u2019t want to deny it and be a bold-faced liar. \n\nPosie wrinkled her nose.  \u201cDravyn\u2019s not my type.  She\u2019s scandalous.  Half the time she\u2019s out with these horrid Pete Doherty types with their pale skin and greasy hair.  I mean what kind of beard is that?  She could at least run them through a wash and comb their hair before the paps snap their photos.  Not to mention her few female associates weren\u2019t much better.\u201d\n\nTabitha smiled.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious.  The slags she parties with make Lindsay Lohan look like a school marm.\u201d\n\nTabitha laughed out loud.  \u201cI guess you know about complicated after all,\u201d she told Posie.  \u201cI know I\u2019ve got issues when it comes to men and Wes is a great guy.  I just\u2026I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d Posie asked leaning toward Tabitha.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t put myself out there to get hurt.  It\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nPosie nodded.  \u201cLove is scary, isn\u2019t it?  Would you rather be safe and alone forever, then?\u201d\n\nTabitha frowned.  She didn\u2019t exactly want to be alone for the rest of her life. \n\nPosie didn\u2019t wait for an answer.  She hitched her narrow shoulders into a very French shrug.  \u201cIf you love him, it\u2019s worth the fright.\u201d\n\nTabitha was still chewing on that thought when Rick walked into the parlor.  Vic followed close behind, but Wes was nowhere to be seen.  \u201cGood news, sisters,\u201d Rick said, his voice booming.  \u201cI\u2019ve decided to have a dinner Sunday evening.  We\u2019re all here and I have some clients that want to come \u2018round.  Plus, mother will adore being admired for a few hours.\u201d\n\nPosie jumped up.  \u201cThat\u2019s fab!  It\u2019ll be like the ones father used to have when we were kids.  Well-dressed suits drinking scotch and glittering wives pretending to eat solid food.  Meanwhile, is Dion ready to assume mother\u2019s station of hostess while mother is actually here?\u201d\n\nRick chuckled.  \u201cDion was born ready.  I discussed it with her after we knew mother would be here and she didn\u2019t even hesitate.\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded dumbly.  She\u2019d actually get to see her sister in society?  Speaking of scary situations! \n\nVic walked over to the fireplace and leaned on it.  \u201cYour friend doesn\u2019t say much, eh?\u201d\n\nTabitha realized her was talking about Wes and immediately glanced at Posie.  The blonde smiled back at her.  \u201cI\u2019m sure he was nervous just meeting everyone.  It\u2019s very intimidating, I can say from experience.\u201d\n\nVic laughed.  \u201cWell, he\u2019ll get to know us soon enough.  Good kid, though, not spacey or hazy like most musicians.\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded.  \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d she said heading for the door, \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can find him.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTabitha found Wes staring out the window of their suite.  His back was to her when she entered the room and he didn\u2019t turn around when she shut the door.  \n\n\u201cEver had one of those days that took you from deliriously happy to murderous and back again over and over?\u201d\n\nShe kicked off her shoes and joined him, watching a rabbit hop across the knoll.  \u201cI\u2019ve had a few of those\u2014yes.\u201d\n\nWes sighed, took a few steps back and dropped onto the couch.  He shoved his hands into his hair and ran them back and forth a few times.  As a result, his hair fell forward again and he looked much more like himself.  \u201cThis didn\u2019t work out quite right,\u201d he mumbled.  Tabitha watched his face settle into a look of concern.  He shook his head slowly.  \u201cYeah, not quite right.  I should probably just go.\u201d\n\nHer heart clenched.  \u201cNo!\u201d she said a bit too loudly.  \n\nHe looked at her with his eyebrows pulled together.  \n\nShe crossed her arms and tried to replicate the shrug Posie had done earlier.  \u201cI mean, you should stay.  Rick is having a dinner party on Sunday.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like you there.\u201d\n\nWes rolled his eyes.  \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d she said quickly.\n\n\u201cTabitha,\u201d he said on a sigh.  \u201cDo you want me here or not?\u201d\n\nShe nodded.  \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re done being mad at me?\u201d\n\nShe sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m not mad about you keeping the being rich thing a secret.  I liked you when you were a salesman in a music store and your past doesn\u2019t change that\u2026neither does your available balance.\u201d\n\nWes nodded.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you thought I was being dishonest or something.  I just\u2026don\u2019t think of myself in terms of decimals and dollar signs.\u201d\n\nTabitha dropped onto the couch beside him.  \u201cI know that and for the record, I love you too.  I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to be in love, but it\u2019s too late now.  I love you and I like your sister and your nephew and most of your crazy friends.  I like that you think I\u2019m innocent and that you didn\u2019t even flinch when my family gave you the third degree.\"\n\nWes laughed.  \u201cYou should have heard Rick after dinner.  I thought he was going to make me hand over a DNA sample.\u201d\n\nTabitha laughed.  \u201cHe adopted me as his second sister when he and Dion were dating.  He\u2019s the father I never realized I wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cool,\u201d Wes said smiling.  \u201cI feel sorry for any guys that try to date his daughters.\u201d\n\nShe nodded.  \u201cBetween Rick and Dion all suitors will have to approach the front door in full armor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to mention Vic, he\u2019s an imposing figure.\u201d\n\nTabitha nodded.  \u201cHe seems to like you.\u201d\n\nWes shook his head.  \u201cI still think you\u2019re the one he really likes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start the jealousy thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to now, do I?  You finally admitted to loving me.  That gives me the advantage over Mr. Football.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still seem a little green to me.\u201d\n\nWes gazed at her for a moment.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put me out of my misery, Tabby.  Slide over here and prove to me that I don\u2019t have a reason to be jealous.\u201d  He patted the space between them on the couch.  \n\nShe slid over until their legs pressed against each other, and then decided to climb into his lap.  She put a hand in his hair and began unbuttoning his shirt.  \u201cSo you want make up sex?\u201d she whispered, her mouth less than an inch from his.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take whatever sex I can get,\u201d Wes groaned.  \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, baby.\u201d  His hands drifted down her sides and rested on her ass before giving it a good, hard squeeze.\n\nTabitha pressed her breasts against his chest and gently kissed his slightly parted lips.  \"I missed you too Wesley.\"  Her hands busied themselves in his dark locks and his eyes slid shut.  She wiggled on his lap and laughed when his raging erection pressed into the back of her thigh.  \n\nHe growled and grabbed her waist, lifted her up and settled her facing front on his lap.  \"I didn't want to do this on the couch.\"\n\n\"Then let\u2019s go to the bed.\"\n\n\"Can't move.\"\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tabitha said trying to get off his lap.\n\nWes held her hips in a vice grip.  \u201cIf I can\u2019t move, you sure as hell can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTabitha stopped struggling and stared at him.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?  I thought you wanted make up sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop moving on my fucking dick, I\u2019ll blow a wad in my shorts and neither one of us will be having make up sex or any other kind of sex for that matter.\u201d\n\nTabitha laughed.  \u201cAre you that hard up?\u201d\n\nHis bright eyes searched her face for a few moments.  \u201cWhat you don\u2019t seem to realize, Tabby, is that you\u2019re my wet dream come true.\u201d\n\nShe rolled her eyes.  \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.  You\u2019re amazing.  You\u2019re ass, your tits, and\u2014holy hell\u2014you have the most amazing fuck face and those noises you make\u2026fuck Tabby.  You drive me insane.\u201d\n\nTabitha pushed his dark hair out of his eyes and gave him a gentle kiss on the forehead.  \u201cYou sweet talker,\u201d she teased.  \n\nHe grinned \u201cIf you could see how amazing you look when you\u2019re on my dick, you would have flown across the Atlantic too.\u201d\n\nTabitha laughed and leaned back.  She tugged open his pants, plunged her hand into his boxers and wrapped her hand around his erection.  \u201cDon\u2019t go early, Wes.  I want to play with you.\u201d\n\nHis laugh was thick, heavy with need.  \u201cCareful with that, its loaded.\u201d\n\nTabitha\u2019s pussy clenched but she nodded.  She took her hand off his member and carefully unhooked the clasp of his trousers.  Wes shoved them down with one hand, using an arm around her waist to keep her from moving off his lap.  Tabitha was glad the underwear had gone down with the slacks.  His large, rough hands pushed the thin gauzy material of her yellow dress up, past her thighs.  She held her hands up so he could take it off completely.  Down to her under things and still on his lap, Tabitha felt her nipples go rigid in anticipation.  One hand tugged aside her thin lace underwear and the other guided his stiff cock home. \n\n\u201cOoh,\u201d Tabitha groaned when he filled her. \n\nWes shut his eyes and let his head fall back.  \u201cHome again,\u201d he muttered.  \n\nTabitha placed both her palms against his chest and began to move on his dick.  His head dropped back, he bit his bottom lip, and growled.  His hands settled on her hips.  \n\n\u201cSpeaking of fuck faces,\u201d Tabitha whispered.  \n\nWes made a sound between a chuckle and a gasp.  His eyes crept open, only half-way.  \u201cWhat you do to me,\u201d he grunted.\n\nTabitha smiled.  She was about to say something else but Wes gripped her hips and angled her pelvis forward, his cock began to rub against that sweet spot and she was struck dumb.  Her breathing became labored and her eyes began to drift shut.  The sensations of her tight nipples dragging against the hair on his chest and his dick nudging that bundle of nerves sent spirals of pleasure all over her body.  \n\nTabitha came with a sharp cry and Wes leaned forward to cover her mouth with his.  Her tongue greeted his hungrily.  Their kiss stole her screams but seemed to drive him over the edge.  He held her hips still as he grunted his release.  Then buried his face in her neck as they both struggled to breathe normally.\n\n\u201cI love you, Tabby,\u201d he whispered against her cool, damp skin.  \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed.\u201d\n"
