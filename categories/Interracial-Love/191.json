        "The days after the rescue:\n\nBy late evening the day after the rescue, Kevyn was beside herself. She didn't know what to do or say to help Patrick. They still hadn't talked about the past and they needed to if only because it so profoundly affected the present and she could see how it could and would affect the future and now there was whatever it was that Patrick was going through to deal with.\n\nShe knew that Patrick was holding himself personally responsible for what happened because the vampire had been the mate of one of his victims. For several hours, she had been frightened because Patrick had seemed almost suicidal. It wasn't anything that he said but more the way that he acted. He was trying to push her away. When she tried to touch him, he moved away from her, when she tried to talk to him, he walked away.\n\nThe only thing that got his attention was when he heard her crying. She still hadn't completely grieved over her mother and within hours of returning to California there was another emotional upheaval.\n\n\"Kev?\"\n\n\"You, Patrick Sinclaire are a jerk!\" she yelled at him not caring if the entire household heard her.\n\n\"Kev, you don't.....\"\n\n\"Don't you dare say that I don't understand!\" she hissed. \"You're right! I don't understand but you won't talk to me. And what about the mates are supposed to rely on each other spiel that you gave me not more than a few days ago? Do you remember telling me that or is this a one sided thing where I'm supposed to spill my guts to you but you get to keep things to yourself? Are you planning to kill yourself?\"\n\n\"What!?\" Patrick asked shocked.\n\n\"You won't let me touch you, you won't talk to me so what in the hell am I supposed to think?\" she spat at him.\n\n\"Oh god... Kevyn, no I'm not going to kill myself.\" Patrick replied understanding how she could have gotten the idea. \"I just didn't want your sympathy and to be honest, I didn't think that you would want to be around me after what happened. I'm sorry that I scared you.\"\n\n\"Scared me? Patrick I was beyond scared! I was going to call someone from your family because I didn't know what to do! Look, I don't profess to understand anything of what happened here and that includes that thing with Louise but I do understand this, I love you and as you've told me on more than one occasion, I've got you. I'm not leaving.\"\n\nPatrick could only look at her, she had just addressed one of his biggest fears and she was right, he had to talk to her and not shut her out. He thought that the hard part was over, it wasn't. Telling her his complete family history was going to be the hardest part but she was here and she wasn't leaving.\n\n\"Is it alright to touch you now?\" she asked as she wrapped hr arms around his waist.\n\nPatrick didn't reply but wrapped his arms around her and cried. He didn't deserve her any more than Martin deserved Rachel or Ethan deserved Katrina. \n\n\"Talk to me.\" Kevyn urged as she rubbed his back, \"I promise I won't leave.\" she repeated.\n\nPatrick tightened his hold on her and then released her, \"Let's sit outside in the gazebo.\" He said taking her hand. He didn't want to taint the tranquility of their home by talking about the past there. For once, the house felt like more than a house. It had become a home the minute Kevyn and Louise walked through the door.\n\n\"Wait, what about Louise? Is she alright?\" he asked concerned.\n\n\"She's confused about a few things but she's alright. Nathan has been talking with her throughout the day and evening.\" Kevyn replied.\n\n\"Let's go check on her before we go out to talk.\" Patrick insisted, \"I need to see that she's alright.\"\n\n*********\n\nLouise jumped at the light tap on the door. She had been just as worried about Patrick as Kevyn had been and her assurances that it would be all right had helped only a little. Her heart hurt for him when she felt his pain and despair and wondered what the cause of it was. Even at her worst, her mother hadn't hurt as Patrick was. But it wasn't just Patrick, all of the men of his family carried some collective burden but it was more so with the brothers. Nathan carried a little of the burden to but of all of them Patrick was suffering the most. Even the women seemed to carry some hurt and she wanted to know what it was but would never ask. The one thing that she did notice was that even with the collective feeling of pain there was love.\n\n\"Come in!\" she called.\n\nPatrick and Kevyn went into the room and Louise let out a mental sigh of relief. While he was still hurting, the feeling of despair wasn't as intense.\n\n\"I am so sorry about all of this... are you alright?\" Patrick asked as he walked over to Louise and hugged her.\n\n\"I'm fine but are you?\" she asked returning the hug.\n\n\"I'm going to be alright thanks to your sister and Lou? I really am sorry that your first night was so traumatic and thank you for your help.\" Patrick replied.\n\n\"You're welcome and its like you told me, we're family and family helps each other right?\" she asked.\n\nLater when Kevyn and Patrick left the room, she would have time to think and realized that she really did belong with them.\n\n***********\n\nKevyn and Patrick sat in the gazebo for several minutes before Patrick spoke.\n\n\"She's special.\" he said meaning Louise.\n\n\"She always has been.\" Kevyn replied, \"no one really paid enough attention to her to realize just how special she is.\"\n\n\"If my guess is right, I think that changed last night.\" Patrick replied. He was stalling and he knew that Kevyn knew it. \"Kev, before I start telling you everything, will you try to remember something as I tell it?\" \n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"Try to remember that I am no longer that man who raped and hurt women and that I love you.\"\n\n\"If I thought for one second that you were that man would I be here? Would I have brought my sister here?\" she asked as she took his hands in hers. \"I know that this is hard for you and I won't lie, it's going to be hard for me too but if we're going to be together and have babies... you have to tell me and I have to listen. I want you to remember something too, I love you.\"\n\nPatrick took a deep breath and started at the beginning, by three am he wasn't even halfway though. He kept looking over at Kevyn expecting to see revulsion and fear on her face whispering a silent prayer of thanks when he didn't.\n\nBy five, he had just begun to tell her about his first rape and now that he had started, he wanted to finish it.\n\n\"I need to finish this but not in the house, we have a gate house in the back, can we go there?\" he asked.\n\nKevyn was almost overwhelmed as she listened to the story of Patrick's family but she like him wanted it done so that they could move on. However, she needed a break even if he didn't.\n\n\"That's fine but I need a break and a little time to process what you've told me so far, can we do that?\"\n\n\"Of course we can.\" Patrick replied. \"The gate house has a fully stocked kitchen and I would love to make you breakfast.\"\n\n\"You cook?\" Kevyn asked realizing that there was a lot that they didn't know about each other.\n\n\"I sure do although I haven't in a long time.\" Patrick said looking at her intently.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"Nothing, I'm just amazed that you're still here.\" he said kissing her. \n\nHe would always consider what happened to Veronica his fault and wasn't anything that anyone could say or do that would convince him that it wasn't, not even Kevyn but he added it to the list of things that he would always regret and feel remorse for. He would never tell Kevyn that, he didn't think that she would understand but what he didn't know was that she did. She was already beginning to figure out the mindset of the Sinclaire men, him in particular and was beginning to wonder if he had a 2x4 around somewhere.\n\nShe watched as he moved around the small kitchen and knew that the storm wasn't over no matter what he said. He was trying to appease her. For the moment, she let it pass but it they were going to talk about it before the day was over. She wondered how the rest of the family was doing especially Veronica. She could see that of the twins, Veronica was more like Patrick in that she would try to suffer through her ordeal alone but Vanessa had the same sensitivity as she did.\n\nAn hour later, breakfast was over but what alarmed Kevyn was that Patrick ate nowhere the amount of food that she was used to seeing him eat.\n\n\"You didn't eat much.\" she commented.\n\n\"I'm not very hungry.... Are you ready for me to finish this?\"\n\nIt was early evening by the time he had finished telling her everything.\n\n\"That's all of it.\" he said softly.\n\nKevyn shook her head, \"no one helped you?\" she asked.\n\n\"You're asking the same questions that Katrina did.\" Patrick asked, \"And it's only because of her that laws have been added to protect our children. We also have the equivalent to the human child protective services, again that is because of Katrina. She may be quiet but she's got drive.\"\n\n\"What happens to the children after they leave the homes?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"Sometimes they are returned to their families but they are carefully monitored. As soon as there is a sign of trouble, someone goes to visit the family and if the problem continues, the child is taken from the home and there are no second chances. Martin, Rachel and Nathan have set up an adoption agency if sorts and some of the children are adopted.\"\n\n\"The parents don't fight this?\"\n\n\"Sometimes... I want you to understand that children aren't just yanked out of their homes. Sometimes the problem is lack of education on the part of the family and that education is provided at no cost to them if they can't afford it. If there is a financial need, then that need is met as well. Contrary to popular belief, not all of us are rich and some of us have the same issues as humans.\"\n\n\"Patrick, why didn't Ethan stop when he figured out what he was doing was wrong?\" \n\nPatrick hesitated before answering, \"That's something that you'll have to ask him and if you do, he won't lie to you or try to make it out to be more or less than it is.\" \n\n\"Why didn't you stop?\"\n\n\"We were all under the impression that it was alright, that it was genetic and that once we found our mates that it would end. I truly didn't realize that it was wrong until Ethan came forward after he raped Katrina and almost lost her and the girls. I went for help and up until Melissa Hunter; I hadn't touched another woman consensually or otherwise since the last rape.\"\n\nThere was silence as Kevyn tried to understand the family that she had become a part of, They made her own family seem reasonable.\n\n\"How do we get past this?\" she asked.\n\n\"We keep talking and you keep asking me the hard questions.\" Patrick replied.\n\n\"Patrick, I know what you're doing.\" Kevyn said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"You're not alright and you know it. You're trying to appease me by pretending otherwise and I don't appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Kevyn, that's not true.\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" Kevyn shot back, \"I guess we'll see won't we?\"\n\nWithout saying another word, she stood up and left the gatehouse leaving Patrick sitting alone.\n\n***********\n\nPatrick cleaned up the kitchen before heading back to the house. As much as he wanted to find Kevyn and try to convince her that he was all right, he didn't because she needed time and he wasn't sure that she was completely wrong. He conceded that to some extent that he was trying to protect her from the ugly part of him but a martyr? He didn't think so. \n\nHe looked at the phone. He hadn't talked to Veronica or anyone else since the rescue. It wasn't that he didn't want to but it would be a reminder of what he had done. It didn't occur to him that the mate of the vampire could have been the victim of any of them Jesse included... in his mind, what happened was completely his fault.\n\n\"Ronnie I am so sorry.\" he whispered as he sunk back into despair and not making the call.\n\n***********\n\nKevyn sat in the library at a loss as to what she should do. This whole thing was totally out of her realm of experience and nothing in her life had prepared her for anything like it. She thought about calling Katrina but didn't know if she should. She was new to this world. Did people talk about the problems in their relationships? She wondered.\n\nShe sighed and rested her head against the back of the chair. Dealing with her siblings had seemed easy compared to this. She was almost sure that Patrick wasn't suicidal and if he had been, it had passed... for now. It was that thought that made her realize that she needed to find him and stay close.\n\nShe found him sitting in the gazebo with his head in his hands.\n\n\"Patrick?\"\n\nHe looked up at her, his eyes filled with misery telling her all that she needed to know. He needed more than she could give him.\n\n\"Hi.\" he said offering her a weak smile.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I left you like that... this is all new to me but maybe you should talk to someone from your family.\"\n\n\"Sweetheart, I'm fine or I will be, I promise.\" Patrick assured her as he hugged her.\n\nKevyn wasn't convinced but didn't say anything. She snuggled closer to him and hoped for the best.\n\nThey sat out in the gazebo until Patrick's stomach started to rumble. \n\n\"How about I take you and Louise out to dinner?\" He asked kissing her.\n\n\"Ok but have you spoken with your family today?\" \n\n\"No, but I will later.\" Patrick replied a little too quickly.\n\n\"You could call before we....\"\n\n\"Later.\" Patrick said interrupting her, \"I'm hungry. Where do you think Louise would like to go?\"\n\n*************\n\nAs it turned out, Louise was already making dinner when they went into the house.\n\n\"I hope that it's alright, I've always wanted to cook in a kitchen like this.\" she said sheepishly.\n\n\"Lou,\" Patrick said using her pet name, \"this is your home so there's no need to be nervous about making use of anything here. What are you cooking by the way? It smells great.\"\n\n\"It's really nothing special, just baked chicken with herbs, potatoes and peas.\" Louise replied.\n\nKevyn laughed when she saw Louise's expression when Patrick heaped a third helping of food on his plate.\n\n\"Yes, he really eats like that.\" Kevyn said.\n\nDinner passed quietly but Kevyn kept a watchful eye on Patrick. He showed no signs of the despair that she saw earlier and she breathed a little easier, maybe he was going to be all right. \n\n\"Patrick?\" Louise called softly.\n\n\"Yes?\" \n\n\"Do you play scrabble or any other word games?\" she asked shyly. \"I usually play against the computer but that gets boring but if you don't that's ok...\"\n\n\"Lou, its fine and I would love to play.\" Patrick replied and then looked at Kevyn. \"I suppose you like word games too?\" he asked.\n\n\"Guilty.\" Kevyn replied with a smile as she relaxed even more, he really was going to be alright.\n\nThe evening was spent playing scrabble and boggle with Louise being the first one to retire to her rooms.\n\n\"Why didn't she go to college?\" Patrick asked and then remembered the financial circumstances that they came from. \"If she wants to go, she should... it'll be taken care of.\" \n\n\"Lou's big dream is to go to cooking school and to open up her own place.\" Kevyn said, \"But the money was never there. I was going to give her the money that I was saving for my condominium so that she could pay for school. I even started collecting brochures so that she could choose a school once she moved out here.\"\n\n\"You're a good big sister.\" Patrick said.\n\n\"Not really.\" Kevyn replied, \"I shouldn't have left her back there to take care of mom. I should have found a way to stay or to bring her with me.\"\n\n\"You did the best that you could under the circumstances and I don't sense that Louise is angry with you. I think that she understood more than anyone gave her credit for... Kev, do you know what an empath is?\"\n\n\"An empath is someone who can feel what others are feeling.\" she replied.\n\n\"That's part of it.\" Patrick said. \"Empathy can come in a variety of strengths ranging from being what people would call being compassionate to actually being able to experience what the other person is feeling and being able to comfort that person with just a touch or a word.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that Lou is an empath?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"That's exactly what I'm saying and sometimes when they are as strong as Lou is, they need to be cared for emotionally.\"\n\n\"And?\" \n\n\"I know that you don't know much about our world but Lou has a mate.\"\n\n\"You mean Nathan?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"Yes and you cannot talk to her about this, it's for them to work out without interference. It will be up to him when he decides to tell her about us and that includes telling her what we are but it my hunch is right, she already knows that we're different.\"\n\n\"Could she tell what you were feeling?\" Kevyn asked.\n\nPatrick hesitated; he had been deliberately blocking himself not only from Louise but from Kevyn too. She was an empath as well but to a much lesser degree.\n\n\"Yes because she's been through enough without me adding to it.\" he replied.\n\n\"Are you still hiding from me too?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"I'm trying not to.\" Patrick replied.\n\nKevyn wasn't convinced.\n\n**************\n\nKevyn laid on the bed with her eyes closed as Patrick had requested.\n\n\"Are your eyes still closed?\" he asked as he settled on the bed next to her.\n\n\"Yes, can I open them now?\" she asked.\n\n\"In a minute.\" Patrick replied as he made a lazy circle around one nipple and then the other smiling as he watched them rise into dark hardened peaks. He bent down, took one of the nipples into his mouth, and began to suck on it as a hand rested on her mound. \n\nKevyn's eyes flew open and then closed again in pleasure as Patrick sucked on her left nipple and slid a finger between the lips of her pussy and began a to move it up and down. He released the nipple from his mouth, took the neglected right one in, and sucked on it a little harder than he had the other.\n\n\"That feels good.\" Kevyn breathed. She was getting more comfortable with talking during making love and with making her needs known. It was something that she was never into but Lonnie was and he was what she considered vulgar about it but with Patrick, it didn't feel that way.\n\nShe trusted him and it hurt to know that he didn't trust her enough to talk to her.\n\n\"Kev?\" Patrick asked, \"Baby are you alright?\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\" she assured him.\n\nHe resumed the light and then hard sucking on her nipple as he tapped lightly on her clit until it was throbbing. Instinctively, Kevyn opened her legs even wider in invitation for him to do whatever he wanted. Her moans of frustration when he stopped sucking on her nipple was replaced with a moan of surprise and pleasure when Patrick took her swollen and throbbing clit into his mouth and sucked on it taking long hard pulls while he flicked his tongue across it.\n\nKevyn cried out and began to pull on her nipples pushing herself closer to the orgasm that was so close to happening and then it was upon her. She screamed and frantically bucked her hips urging Patrick not to stop. When he did, it was to slide into her and to begin a desperate pounding in and out of her.\n\nKevyn held him as he pounded into her, the feeling that he wasn't all right came back stronger than ever. All she could do now was love him.\n\nPatrick came with a moan that was part physical release and emotional pain. He clung to Kevyn, his chest heaving and his heart pounding as he whispered to her how much he loved her. He knew that he was making her nervous but he didn't know how to stop.\n\nFor the first time since finding her, he regretted it. He felt Kevyn tense beneath him and then push at him.\n\n\"Get off of me!\" she said crying.\n\n\"Baby? Did I hurt you?\" Patrick asked immediately moving off her.\n\n\"You regret finding me?\" she asked jumping out of bed the moment he moved from off top of her.",
        "\"What? No... I\"\n\n\"You just thought it! I heard it!\"\n\n\"Let me explain, you didn't hear all of my...\"\n\n\"You chased me until I agreed to be with you! You got me here.... You know what? Go to hell!\"\n\n\"Kevyn! Wait!\" Patrick called out to her but she was already gone. A few minutes later, he heard the door to one of the spare bedrooms slam closed.\n\n***********\n\nKevyn took a hot shower and crawled into bed. She was exhausted emotionally and physically. Too much had taken place in too short a period for the both of them. They both had issues she realized but now, she was too tired to think about it anymore. \n\nAs she closed her eyes, she thought about how horrible it must have been to find out that the rapes weren't necessary and they had been lied to for centuries. She felt not just for Patrick but the whole family. She also wondered how the raped mates had gotten to the point where they were able to forgive enough that they married and raised children with their rapist. In her mind, that made them stronger women than she could ever dream of being.\n\nShe missed feeling Patrick pressed against her but she refused to go to him, she didn't want to be with a man who regretted being with her. She finally fell into a fitful sleep with the thought that she should have let him explain in the back of her mind.\n\n***********\n\nLouise felt the tension in the house increase and knew the cause or thought she did. Patrick and Kevyn were having problems that would be solved if they just talked to each other. She heard the door of one of the spare bedrooms slam shut, knew that it was Kevyn and resisted the urge to go to her. Whatever the problem was, they had to work it out and besides, she had some things to work out for herself.\n\n**********\n\nPatrick lay on his back staring up at the ceiling mentally kicking himself in the ass. He had hurt Kevyn without meaning to. He should have known better than to think what he had been thinking and she had completely misunderstood what he meant. He glanced over at the phone and wondered if Ethan or Martin were up and then decided against calling them. This was his mess and he had to figure out how to clean it up himself, the question was how to go about it.\n\nAs soon as it was dark enough, he went outside, picked flowers from the yard and put them in a vase. The next thing he did was to cook dinner, place it on a tray and carry it up to the room where Kevyn had been since she left their bedroom earlier in the morning.\n\nThe door opened without him touching the knob and he went in setting the tray on the dresser by the door. The room was completely dark but his eyes easily adjusted and made out her form in the bed curled on her side and facing away from him.\n\n\"Kev?\" \n\nShe didn't reply at first but rolled over and looked at him.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked she asked after several seconds.\n\n\"I made dinner.\"\n\n\"I don't want it.\"\n\n\"Fine, but I need for you to listen to me.\" Patrick replied.\n\nHe took her silence as consent, made his way across the room and sat down on the side of the bed.\n\n\"I hurt you and I'm sorry. I ... all I can think about is that this happened because of what I did. It was bad enough that it was Veronica but that could have been you!\"\n\n\"But it wasn't...\"\n\n\"But it could have been! When you heard that I regretted finding you, it wasn't what you thought I meant. I meant that I hate that I brought you into this, that you would have been safe if I hadn't found you. If there was one like him, then there are others and I have endangered you and Louise both. I don't regret being with you but I do regret the circumstances that I brought you into.\"\n\n\"Why do you insist on taking personal responsibility for what happened?\" Kevyn asked.\n\n\"She was one of my victims! That makes it my responsibility and if anything happens to you because of what I've done, I'll never forgive myself.\"\n\n\"Have you changed your mind about wanting me here and you're too chicken shit to say it?\" Kevyn asked. \n\n\"I told you that this was forever.\" Patrick replied.\n\n\"So now I'm here so that you can keep your word, is that it?\" Kevyn asked angrily. \"You know, once I caught on to Lonn....\"\n\n\"Don't you even compare me to that bastard!\" Patrick interrupted her now as angry as she was. \"You're not the only one who can read thoughts!\" he snapped.\n\nKevyn's face burned, she hadn't thought about the fact that Patrick could read her. \n\n\"Unlike him, I love you and I will grant you that I'm really fucking up here but don't you ever, ever doubt that I love you!\"\n\n\"Then why won't you talk to me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Kevyn, I think that we've got two separate issues here that need to be dealt with, Lonnie and this.\" Patrick sighed, \"This is so far from how I envisioned us beginning our lives together. Sweetheart I'm sorry that I yelled at you and I'm sorry that I haven't been talking to you. I've been hurting you although that wasn't my intent. I keep thinking that this is part of the consequences that Ethan and Martin keep talking about, the suffering alone I mean.\"\n\n\"But they talk to their mates don't they?\" Kevyn asked. \"They don't keep things from each other, that's how they make it work and if this is going to work, we've got to trust each other enough to talk.\"\n\nPatrick moved so that he was lying next to Kevyn and put his arms around her, \"tell me about Lonnie. I want to know what he did or didn't do to take care of you and I mean everything.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I compared you to him.\" Kevyn said quietly.\n\n\"It's alright, just tell me about him.\" Patrick urged.\n\nAt the end of three hours, Patrick had a good idea of what Kevyn's life with Lonnie had been like. Lonnie had expected her to take care of him in everyway possible and had gone outside of the marriage for the things that she wouldn't do. He had expected her to please him orally while refusing to reciprocate going so far as to \"gag\" when he \"tried\" the bottom line was that he tried to change her into something that she wasn't and never had been, a subservient woman.\n\n\"Why did you wait so long to leave?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"My parents loved each other.\" Kevyn replied, \"There wasn't anything that they wouldn't do for each other and that's what I wanted. They had been married for thirty years when dad died. He never so much as looked at another woman. My mother was his world. When I met Lonnie, I was young, stupid and na\u00efve. He promised me everything that my parents had and well, you know me well enough to know that I'm not a quitter so I hung with it giving him chance after chance until I just couldn't do it any more and so I left.\"\n\n\"Lonnie was a fool and he isn't the only one.\" Patrick said, \"I'm making the same mistake that he did, in spite of what I've seen, I keep underestimating your strength and to a degree, you were right about something, I didn't trust you but not because I didn't want to. You've been through so much and I didn't know how much more you could take but at any rate, let's finish with Lonnie. I will never ask you to do anything that I am not willing to do myself and it doesn't matter what it is. I also want you to know that I will do whatever it takes to make you happy. I promise to do my level best to make you as happy as possible. I won't promise you that I won't screw up but I'll try not to, you have my word on that. And there's one more thing, I will never invade your privacy by listening in on your thoughts unless I have no other choice. When I heard you thinking about Lonnie, it was an accident and once again, I'm sorry that I yelled at you like that.\"\n\nKevyn sat up, \"it's alright and I'm sorry that I keep running whenever there's a problem but Patrick, you can't tell me that mates share everything and then pick and choose what you tell me. You carried not only me but also Louise when we were in Pennsylvania and I couldn't have survived last week without you, it's my turn to carry you. So please, talk to me. Tell me why you insist that you're solely responsible for what happened.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I can.\" Patrick replied intertwining her fingers with his.\n\n\"Try.\" Kevyn said and then waited.\n\n\"That woman was someone's mate and I took her from him. I didn't kill her but I might as well have... She took her own life. The reasons why I raped don't matter, what does is that I did it. I never really understood what Ethan and Martin meant when they said that they didn't deserve their mates and now I do. I guess in a way, I was trying to push you away and if you had wanted to go, I wouldn't have stopped you. Another vampire and family almost lost someone because me...\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" Kevyn shouted. \"Just stop it with the poor me bullshit! You weren't the only one in your family who raped. It was the luck of the draw that the vampire was a mate to one of your victims. And until Victoria relayed the message that you knew the woman, you had no idea of whom we were dealing with. For all you knew, that woman could have been a victim of your dead brother Jesse!\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't feel guilt because you always will but I am saying that you shouldn't take the entire thing on your shoulders, it's a shared guilt. As far as Veronica and Vanessa, they weren't chosen to get at you. Bradford or whatever the hell is name was had no idea which one of you raped his mate, he was aiming at the Sinclaire family as a whole. It just happened to be Ethan's family that he chose but let's think about that, who is it that publicly announced that he was responsible for anything that happened after he realized that the rapes were wrong? Ethan wasn't it? Who was in the forefront of the stopping the rape campaign? Ethan! Therefore, if he was after anyone, it was Ethan because he by his own admission could have ended the rapes. That doesn't let you or anyone off the hook but the blame isn't entirely yours either.\n\nIn addition, not only that, that vampire had other options! He didn't have to stalk your family! All he had to do was ask for a meeting but he didn't! He involved innocents when he didn't have to, why didn't he say who he was and demand to meet with the men of the family? His issue was with the men of the family and if you ask me, it was mainly Ethan because he is the one most seen and heard.\n\nAnd speaking of Ethan, why haven't you called him or any of your family for that matter?\n\nOh yes, it's because of guilt that you insist only belongs to you. Patrick Sinclaire, you are a fucking coward! You're too afraid to call your niece and to ask her for forgiveness because it's easier to wallow in self pity...\"\n\nKevyn stopped talking realizing that she was sounding anything but sympathetic.\n\n\"I... I'm sorry... I didn't sound very sympathetic did I?\"\n\n\"No but you told me the truth.\" Patrick said quietly. \"There's this part of me that feels as though I need to suffer through this alone and there's another part of me that is so glad that you're here and recognizes that by not talking to you, I'm hurting not just you but us.\"\n\n\"So what happens now?\" Kevyn asked, \"Do you keep hurting us or do we go through this together?\"\n\n\"I call my family, and we start going through this together.\" Patrick replied.\n\n*************\n\nVictoria was beating Ethan in a game of scrabble when Patrick called. Since she was closest to the phone, she answered it.\n\n\"Uncle Patrick! Are you alright?\" \n\n\"I'm fine pumpkin, how are you?\" \n\n\"I'm good, I'm beating papa in scrabble.\" Victoria replied, the pride evident in her voice.\n\n\"Why am I not surprised?\" Patrick asked with a chuckle, \"but guess what? Both of your new aunts like scrabble and have already beaten me.\"\n\n\"Really? That's cool! The playing scrabble I mean.\" \n\n\"I knew what you meant pumpkin.\" Patrick said laughing. \"I want to tell you something else, I am very proud of you. You were very brave in a frightening situation and sweetheart? It wasn't your fault that he took Veronica.\"\n\n\"But she went to get me cookies.\" Victoria replied softly. She couldn't even bring herself to say the name of the cookies.\n\n\"Yes she did but Victoria, it wasn't your fault.\" Patrick reiterated, \"Alright?\"\n\n\"Okay and Uncle Patrick? I love you.' Victoria replied.\n\n\"And I love you, is your papa around?\"\n\nEthan was on the phone a few minutes later.\n\n\"Patrick? Are you all right? We were beginning to worry about you.\"\n\n\"I'm better... I ... I guess I was feeling too guilty to call.\"\n\n\"Katrina was right then.\" Ethan replied, \"She said that you would make what happened your fault when the fault lies with all of us.\"\n\n\"Kevyn just gave me a good talking to and pointed that out to me... how are the girls?\"\n\n\"As well as can be expected... you should call Veronica, she's worried about you probably more than the rest of us.\" Ethan replied.\n\n\"I'll call her after I'm through with you.\"\n\n\"Good and Katrina wants to know when we'll officially meet Kevyn and Louise.\"\n\n\"In a few days, I have some serious making up to do.\" Patrick replied.\n\n\"Ahh yes, the life of a mated Sinclaire man.\" Ethan replied chuckling, \"call us in a couple of days and we'll have an official welcome to the family dinner.\"\n\nPatrick hung up, looked at Kevyn and dialed Veronica's number.\n\n*********\n\nVeronica paced back and forth concerned about Patrick. Of the remaining brothers, he was the most sensitive one. It hadn't really struck her as odd that he hadn't been able to remember what his victims looked like and she was sure that he was beating himself up over her abduction and attempted murder. She had decided that if no one had heard from either him or Kevyn in the next day or so, she was going to call or go over to their house.\n\nShe heard the phone ring and then Rik's soft voice talking to someone. They were having their own issues and were finally getting to the point where he was letting go of some of the guilt about letting her go into the kitchen alone that night. It was finally sinking in that had it not been her it would have been Vanessa, Katrina or worse yet, Victoria. She still maintained that of all of them, she had been the one best suited to take Bradford on and while the first day or two after it was over were rough, she was all right. The nightmares were already diminishing and she didn't wake up trying to loosen chains that weren't there.\n\n\"Veronica!\" Rik called to her, \"telephone!\"\n\nShe sighed in relief when she heard Patrick's voice.\n\n\"Uncle Patrick? Are you alright?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"I'm better but how are you?\"\n\n\"I'm getting there... you do know that this wasn't your fault don't you?\" she asked in her typical straightforward manner.\n\n\"Maybe not personally but collectively.\" Patrick replied\n\nVeronica didn't contradict him, she knew that every male in their family felt the same way and she couldn't deny that they were right.\n\n\"I understand... how are Kevyn and Louise doing? They were just phenomenal!\"\n\n\"They're good and as I told Victoria, they love scrabble and other word games.\" Patrick replied.\n\n\"So when do we get to officially meet them?\" \n\n\"Soon.\" Patrick replied, \"I'll let you know.\"\n\n\"Will you thank both of them again for me?\" Veronica asked relieved that Patrick seemed to be all right.\n\n\"I'll do that... Ronnie, you were amazing and I'm glad that you're home unharmed.\n\nThey talked for a few more minutes and then he called Vanessa.\n\n\"That wasn't so bad was it?\" Kevyn asked when he hung up.\n\n\"No... you were right and they're all wondering when they will get to meet you and Louise.\" Patrick replied tightening his arms around her. \"I told them in a couple of days... do you think that Louise will be alright alone for a couple of days? There's someplace that I want to take you.\"\n\n\"I suppose so but I have to do something about work and class.\" she replied.\n\n\"Tomorrow is Sunday and class is on Tuesday, when are you due back at work?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"Wednesday and I have to take care of my apartment too.\"\n\n\"How about this? You call your job on Monday and see what you can do about your schedule. You want to work part time right? You're way behind in the reading for class so we'll work on that together and I'll have someone pack up your apartment.\" Patrick said.\n\n\"What about this place that you want to take me to?\" \n\n\"We'll go the next weekend you're off and caught up with school. If you're off on Thursday, we can get together with everyone then. What do you think?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"I think that it sounds like a plan. Are you going to tell me about this place?\" \n\n\"No it's a surprise. Are we good?\" Patrick asked hugging her.\n\n\"We're good but let's not do this again.\" Kevyn said. \"We have to keep talking or else we'll be miserable.\"\n\n\"Agreed, I'm hungry... How about Del taco?\"\n\n**********\n\nLouise gently closed her door breathing a sigh of relief. The house had settled again and felt the way a home should feel, peaceful. Whatever the issues had been between Kevyn and Patrick seemed to have been resolved at least for the time being. She jumped when her cell phone rang, she knew who it was even before she answered it, and he had been calling her several times a day.\n\n\"Hello sweetheart.\" a deep masculine voice said. "
