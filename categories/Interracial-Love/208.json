        "Since it is one of my short days, Wednesday has become train night. Doing local Pittsburgh deliveries usually has me home by 3 or 4 in the afternoon, giving me time to have friends over. We gather to run my model railroad. It is a guy's night, like a poker game only with trains.\n\nMy two regulars, Danny and Ziggy were over, and we fired up the railroad to move freight. They were longtime friends, both of whom I had met while out taking train photos. We'd known each other for years and they were my two best friends. For some reason, the rest of the crew was unavailable that night. Danny drove a city bus, and had the rotund build to prove it. He had shoulder length brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard. Ziggy was a city police officer in Zone 3, who regularly patrolled my neighborhood. He had the bulky, muscular build of somebody used to working of a bouncer, and wore his hair in a marine cut, shaved on the sides, jar lid up top.\n\nDanny looked at me and said, \"You look happy these past two weeks. Rose giving you some?\"\n\n\"Rose is gone for good,\" I said. \"There's a new sheriff in town.\"\n\n\"I've got to meet her!\" Ziggy said. \"Is she blonde like Rose?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Redhead?\"\n\n\"Try again.\"\n\n\"Brunette?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you could say that. \"\n\n\"Call her up! I've got to meet her.\" Ziggy looked pleased. \n\n\"Yeah, tell her to get her butt over here.\" Insisted Danny.\n\nI called Von on my cell. \"Von baby, are you doing anything tonight?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"But it's your guys' night. They stand you up?\"\n\n\"They'd like to meet you. Can you come over? We have a Zucchero pizza.\"\n\nShe seemed delighted. \"I'm on my way. I miss you.\"\n\nI told the guys she was coming over and they laughed. \n\n\"You got her wrapped around your finger already?\" Danny said.\n\n\"No, she has me wrapped around hers.\"\n\n\"Whipped already?\" Ziggy laughed.\n\n\"Wait until you meet her,\" I replied. \"She's a goddess.\"\n\nDanny was working the train yard, sorting cars according to a computer printout. Ziggy was bringing a load of coal over the mountain. I was getting a high priority freight ready to leave the yard, waiting on Danny to give me a push up the mountain. We had the stereo on, with a nice selection of older classic and progressive rock playing randomly from the 6 disks inside.\n\nSoon I heard the key in the door, and the sound of heels on the living room floor.\n\n\"Jason?\" she called.\n\n\"Down here, baby\" I called up the stairs.\n\n\"She's got your key?\" Ziggy looked at me incredulously.\n\nShe slowly made her way down the cellar steps trying not to trip in those red heels I'd first seen the night we met. She looked ravishing in her red dress. \"Sorry, I didn't have time to change from work,\" she apologized.\n\n\"Damn,\" said Danny.\n\n\"Dude, I didn't know you went that way,\" said Ziggy. \n\n\"Guys, this is Von. She's my new lady. Von, this is Danny and Ziggy.\"\n\n\"You weren't kidding,\" said Danny in awe. Turning to Von, he said, \"Jason told us you were a goddess. He sure raised his standards with you.\"\n\n\"Von would you like to run with us tonight? Danny, what you got ready to go?\" I asked.\n\n\"All I have for now is an Allen turn.\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" Von seemed ecstatic. \n\n\"Honey, that's the roughest train on the line. This is your first time doing this, maybe you'd better wait for something else,\" I warned her.\n\nNo,\" she insisted. \"That's what's ready. That's the one I want.\"\n\nZiggy stared at her. Danny looked at me with raised eyebrow. \"Give it to her,\" I said.\n\nAllen was a town on my railroad. The track was laid out in what's in known in model railroading as a time saver, a devious compact tangle of switches and sidings designed by the late John Allen to frustrate his friends. The problem is that there simply is no room to move. All cars must be spotted on predetermined tracks, but in order to spot one car you have to move one or more others out of the way. Von had no idea what she was getting into. This was going to be interesting.\n\nBecause of the lack of room at Allen, only small locomotives can be used. Every inch counts, and the size of the locomotive can mean the difference between solving the puzzle and getting hopelessly stuck. The task as we ran things seemed simple on the surface. You took 6 cars and caboose to Allen, and took the 6 cars already there back to the yard. I explained the switch list, showing which cars went where, as she left the yard. With such a small locomotive, Danny had to give her a boost up the mountain to Spruce Bridge with the yard engine. From there it was all downhill. As the train dispatcher, I cleared the way for my queen, making Ziggy get into the siding at Magee to let her pass. \n\nArriving at Allen with her train. She looked at the town and said to me, \"You bastard.\" The guys laughed.\n\nI told her that since her train was off the main, she'd have to ask permission from the dispatcher, me, any time she needed to use it. She could also use Magee siding, and the coal mine there, if she needed. But if any trains needed to use those tracks, she would have to get out of their way.\n\nSizing up the situation, she asked to use Magee and the coal mine. She quickly stuffed the 6 inbound cars in the mine tracks, and headed back to Allen with just engine and caboose. I was impressed. Consulting the switch list, she was able to pull all 6 outbound cars and get them in order with the caboose properly positioned for the return trip. Her train was ready to go back to the yard. Problem was, those 6 inbound cars still had to be spotted on their respective tracks. \n\nShe asked to use Magee again, and pulled her train in the siding, stopping just past the mine. She disconnected the locomotive, and asked to use the main track to run around her train to get to the inbound cars at the mine. She was making child's play of this difficult run.\n\nI decided to mess with her, to see how she'd think on her feet. Ziggy was coming west with another load of coal, I had just left the yard and was grinding it out on the mountain below Spruce Bridge, eastbound. My original intent had been to duck into the siding at Hawthorne, halfway down the mountain, and let Ziggy by. \n\n\"Ziggy,\" I said. \"I'm going to change the meeting point. I want you to take the siding at Magee. Von, you'll have to clear your train up on the Allen branch.\" She was busy pulling the 6 cars out of the mine. Danny looked at me with a smirk on his face. He'd been watching the goings on at Allen out of the corner of his eye. Ziggy caught on to what I was doing.\n\n\"You know that's just wrong,\" he laughed.\n\nVon said nothing. She pulled the 6 cars out of the mine, and backed them into her train. The 6 outbound cars were still in the proper order; the caboose was now in the middle of a 13-car train. And headed for the Allen branch. \n\n\"You know you have to get all that train off the main. It has to go into Allen,\" I said.\n\nShe looked at me and sweetly said, \"I know what I'm doing.\" Danny turned and looked at her inquisitively. \n\nShe pulled the entire train off the main onto the Allen branch. It fit, with about 3 car lengths to spare. She quickly disconnected the 6 inbound cars and set about the task of placing them in the proper spots. I was impressed. She'd seen she had just enough room to maneuver, and made the most of what she had to work with. What I'd done had made the job exponentially harder. I'd expected her to wait until we cleared Magee, then set her train on the siding like she had before. She didn't want to wait. She decided she didn't have to. By the time I got down to Magee with my train, Ziggy was already there. We quickly passed and Magee was ready for her use again. \n\n\"Permission to use Magee and the main line to run around my train?\" she asked as my train rolled by. Danny was staring at her in amazement. She'd done it. While waiting for us to play our little game, she'd placed all 6 inbound cars in their proper spots. All she had to do was push her train of outbound cars into Magee, and run her locomotive around to the front and she'd be ready to head for the yard. She'd solved the puzzle. It was then I realized my goddess was a genius.\n\n\"I guess she showed you!\" Ziggy laughed. \n\nOnce we got her train back to the yard, we decided to shut down for the night. There was nothing more to prove. My friends looked at her with respect. She's easily won them over. We all sat in the living room chatting for a while, eating cold pizza and drinking Pepsi.\n\nAfter they left, she turned to me. \"Boy you know you weren't right,\" she scolded. \"I know what you did. You're gonna have to pay for that.\"\n\n\"I am counting on it,\" I smiled. \"But you earned their respect by thinking on your feet. They know that you are both beautiful and smart now.\"\n\nShe kissed me. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I missed you. Now it's payback time.\" She ran her hand down between my legs and rubbed my rapidly stiffening rod through my pants.\n\n\"Or a rehearsal for this weekend,\" I said, hands squeezing her ass, pulling her into me. \n\n\"I can't wait,\" she purred.\n\nI unzipped the back of her dress. She stepped back and let it fall to the floor. She was naked underneath. She stepped back and undid my belt, pulling my pants and boxers down as I quickly pulled my shirt over my head. We kissed, as I ran my hand through the coarse texture of her recently straightened hair. I could feel a hint of hair grease as I stroked it. I love her hair. I will always love her hair.\n\nTaking her hand, I led her upstairs to the bedroom. We crawled on the bed. \"I want you so bad. But you've been a bad boy. I have to make you pay.\" She positioned herself straddling me. She raised up on her knees and guided me into her warm moist folds. \"Don't you dare come.\"\n\nShe thrust herself forward and back, up and down, riding me. My hands found the nipples and lightly pinched them. \"OOOH that feels so good. You feel so good inside me. Don't you dare come.\"\n\nI took a nipple in my mouth. I was addicted to her body. It felt so good to be inside her again. I could feel myself getting close. Von's pussy was gently, sensuously squeezing me as I moved inside her. My hands moved to her hips and I squeezed them hard. \n\n\"Uhh Uhh,\" she said as she rose up off me. \"I told you not to come.\" \n\nMy rock-hard manhood was pointing straight up at her hovering pussy. I craved penetration. I longed to plunge back into her depths. She wouldn't let me. She lowered herself until her pussy lips just came into contact with my head, then raised back up out of reach. \n\n\"I told you that you were gonna pay for this. I know you want me bad, I know you want to flood me with your juice. I'm not going to let you. Think about that,\" she said. \"But I'm going to get mine.\"\n\nShe slid forward, knees went under my arms as she worked her way up my body. She had lowered herself into my belly as she slid, leaving a trail of her juice on my skin. Her crotch slid forward towards my mouth. \"Eat me good. You know you want this black pussy.\" \n\nI slid my tongue deep inside her, nibbling, sucking. She shuddered in pleasure, working her hips to slide her slick womanhood over my lusting tongue. I love the way she tastes, the way she smells. I have her scent. It's driving me wild. My hands grab her hips, then begin a slow slide to her asscheek, I work my fingers toward that spot I know drives her wild, the one where cheek meets inner thigh.\n\nShe slaps my hand and pulls it away. \"No you don't she says. You're not getting off that easy.\" She continues to ride my face, hips moving in a circular swirl. I continue to lick and suck her juicy folds, but she has grabbed my hands, holding them in her own so I cannot touch her body. I feel her tempo speed up as she races toward the inevitable hear her moaning my name. \"Oooh Jason.\"\n\nSuddenly she stops. \"This is too easy,\" Shavonda whispers ominously. She swings one leg over my head, tearing herself away from me completely. She turns her body around, swinging her other leg back over my body. Backing her heart shaped ass up, she says, \"Eat me, white boy. Don't you dare come.\"\n\nMy hands spread her wide. My mouth and tongue seek to devour her. My face is soaked with her juices. I feel her warm hand encircle me as she bends forward. I feel her hard nipples scrape along my stomach, then her breasts crush against me as she leans further forward. Her mouth engulfs me. We are feeding off each other in a sixty-nine position. Those soft full lips are wrapped around me now, taking me inside her warm mouth. I am so ready. I have been ready for a while. She is too.\n\n\"Oh shit. Oh shit,\" I hear her moan. She takes me into her mouth again, sucking harder and faster now. I feel her head bobbing on my shaft as her whole body tenses up. Her inner muscles squeeze my tongue. Moans send vibrations of pure pleasure through my dick. \"Mmmmf mmmf\" I hear and feel her moan around my shaft as her head bobs faster. I feel the shudder go through her body as her back arches into me. Her head bobs up but does not leave my head as she moans in orgasm. I can take no more. \n\n\"Von, Von,\" I moan as I flood her mouth with my pent-up desire. She does not jerk away. She does not move her head. Her hand moves up and down my shaft, milking me of every last drop, as our orgasm subsides.\n\nShe raises her head, climbs off me. She looks at me with those big brown eyes as she turns her body and towers over me. My head is sunk back in the pillow. \n\n\"Jason!\" she scolds, but there is no fire in her eye. There is merely a twinkle of mischief. \"Boy. I thought I told you not to come. We're going to have to find some other way to make you pay.\" She is so beautiful, dark skin shiny with sweat in the streetlight. Finger raised to point at me as she scolds me. \"But not tonight.\" Her tone softens. \"You need your sleep. You have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.\"\n\nShe snuggles up next to me, arm thrown across my chest. My arm encircles her, we kiss deeply, each sticky from the other's fluids. I love the way she tastes. She tastes like us, together. We are meant to be together. She is my queen. \n\nThursdays, more than any other day, are my mountain day. I spend the day making the rounds in central Pennsylvania. I send her a photo text. Greetings from Pleasant Gap, PA. In the photo Nittany mountain looms large over the town. \"I wish I were there with you,\" comes the reply.\n\nI pick her up the following evening at her home, in my blue Liberty. She is wearing hot pink shorts and a matching top. The color glows against her chocolaty skin. I watch her climb in the front seat, hips swaying sensually as she opens the door. I throw her two bags in the back, Next to the bucket, grill and bag of charcoal. As I climb in the driver's seat, I reach in the cooler on the back seat and offer her a cold pop. Dr. Pepper. The bottle of black cherry rum is beside the cooler on the seat. It will have to wait until we get to the motel.\n\n\"Jason, there's been a slight change of plans,\" she says, turning to accept the opened can. \"We will have to cut the trip short by a day. My family is having a cookout on Monday, and Daddy insists you be there.\" I am a little disappointed, I want to meet her family, but I have reserved 3 nights in the motel.\n\n\"What time?\" I ask. \n\n\"Any time after 2,\" she says. \"Mama told him about how you stood up to her, and he wants to meet the man who had her speechless. She's told him good things about you.\"\n\nOK, this can work. We can sleep in Monday morning, have breakfast, and still leave Bedford early enough to make the cookout. \"Not a problem,\" I reply \"We are still going to spend the next 3 nights out of town.\"\n\nI reach for the aux cord, asking her, \"Did you bring your iPod?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she says, \"But for the room. On the ride, I want to listen to your music. Show me something new.\"\n\nI plug mine into the aux cord, and make my selection. Tonight, it's Porcupine Tree. Their entire catalog, on shuffle play. Maybe tomorrow I'll introduce her to Mars Volta.\n\nWe head east, taking 22 as far as New Alexandria, then using 981 to drop down to 30 at Latrobe. We take 30 east to Bedford, under the light of a full moon. The mountains are aglow in the silvery light as we press eastward. I always take 30 when I make this trip. The turnpike is faster, but 30 is more beautiful and traffic free. We climb over Laurel Mountain, with the windmills blinking off in the distance as we descend the mountain. \"This is so beautiful, so romantic,\" Shavonda sighs in awe as we make our way down the mountain. Twenty miles later, we pass the windmills, their blades spinning in the blinking red lights of their warning beacons. We top the Allegheny front at 2900 feet, then begin the long winding descent to Bedford. I pull over where the ship motel once stood, and we stand there alone in the moonlight gazing out over the valley spread out below us as far as the eye can see. Distant mountains loom as shadows in the moonlight. \n\n\"See that one there, the one that comes to a point?\" I tell her, \"That's where we are going. Our motel is at the bottom.\"\n\nWe continue our descent, past the horseshoe turn carved out of the steep mountainside. Past Shawnee State Park. Under the turnpike bridge, Around the base of the pointed mountain and into the town of Bedford. At the light, we turn left and soon are at our destination. I pay for the room, the Indian clerk handing me the key to room 15. I love this place. I have been here before, always alone. It's time to share it. It's time to share my world.\n\nWe park the car and move our bags to the room, right off the balcony on the backside of the motel. It takes a couple of trips. I have brought the rum, the cooler, the bag of snacks, the cd player, the iPods and aux cord. We have everything we need. But first I need to wash off the road dirt. 10 hours in a Kenworth plus a 2 \u00bd hour drive have taken their toll.\n\nI strip off my work clothes. It feels so good to be out of those heavy steel-toed boots. Shavonda hangs my clothing up as I walk naked to the shower. I hear the r&b playing again as she plugs in her iPod. A moment later, she has joined me, a beautiful ebony apparition in the steam. \"You need your back washed,\" she says. She grabs the bottle of liquid soap and a wash cloth telling me to turn around. I feel her massage me as she scrubs my back. Her hands feel good as the knead my muscles. I am blessed every day I spend with this woman. I can feel her naked breasts rub my back as she squirms against me. \"You needed a titty massage\"\n\nI turn to face her with my back under the shower head. I can feel her hair starting to kink back up as I run my hands through it. I've never loved to play in anybody's hair the way I love hers. It feels natural. This whole relationship feels natural. I grab the soap bottle and squirt a little in my hands, as she washes my front. Rubbing in in my hands I lather her body. I don't need a wash cloth. I want to wash her with my bare hands. I need to feel her soft soapy skin, to hear her moan as I rub my hands over her body. A wash cloth would just get in the way. I rub her body parts as I clean her. I linger a little extra on the sensitive areas. I know she enjoys our shower dates as much as I do. I can't help playing with her titties. I squeeze them, cupping them as I run my thumbs over her soapy nipples. \n\nWorking my way down, I rub the space between her legs, working myself between her lips. She has been lathering my dick and balls. I rub her clit for a little bit, hearing her appreciative moans as she strokes me. I kiss her and say, \"I still have to get your legs and feet.\" \n\nReluctantly, our hands leave each other's sensitive areas. I squirt more soap in my hands, and kneel before her. Her legs are spread, one leg bent and on the tub rim. I lift her leg off the rim, kneading her foot as I do. Then I lather her other foot. She is unable to lift her foot for me, or she'd lose her balance, so I do the best I can. Slowly I work soapy hands up her shapely legs. She feels so good. Reaching the top of her thigh, I switch to the other leg, the bent leg, and lather it as I did the first one. This time, as I get to the top of her thigh, I stop. There it is, staring at me, dark brown lips spread in arousal, dripping soapy water, with just a glimpse of the of the pink treasure inside.",
        "I can't take this. I need her now. I need to feel her squirm against my tongue. \"You have the most beautiful pussy i.ve ever seen.\" I tell her. She wiggles her hips seductively but doesn't close her legs. She knows where this is going, where it is destined to go.\n\n\"Talk like that would get you some,\" she whispers.\" If I weren't already going to give it to you.\" She puts her hands on the back of my head, drawing me in. I feel her leg lift off the tub rim and work itself over my shoulder as I dive in. I run my tongue over her clit. She moans. She tastes like soap but I don't care. She is my queen. \n\nI continue to lick her clit as I work two fingers into her waiting hole. I can feel her grasp them as the pleasure takes over. She is sensually working her hips into my hand and tongue, moaning a soft string of cuss words \"Fuck, Shit, damn, shitfuck...\" I continue to work my fingers into her, meeting her thrusts aa she gets closer. \"Shit Jason don't stop.\" She wants this. I want her to have it. It feels so right, there in the shower, licking soapy water from her labia as the water cascades over my head. \n\nHer orgasm comes suddenly. She is not holding back. Her hand h=mashed my face into her crotch as she arches her back and lets out a deep growl. Her head is thrown back, her thighs tighten. Her leg on my shoulder draws me in deeper to her. Her walls clench my fingers as she hisses through clenched teeth. I can feel her clit pulse under my tongue as her passion breaks loose. I stop not because we are sated, but because I don't want her to lose her balance and fall in the tub. I hold her, offering what support I can as she rides out her orgasm,\n\nGasping for breath, legs trembling, she looks down at me. I smile up at her, removing my fingers from her pussy. \"Damn boy, you sure do know how to make a girl squirm.\" We laugh. We are in love. \n\n\"I still need to wash your back,\" I tell her. Her trembling leg comes off my shoulder as she turns around. I grab another handful of soap as I stand. She thrusts her big booty back into me as I lather her back. I work my hands up and down her back and ass, massaging as I go. I quirt some soap in her booty crack where my penis has nestled itself soap lubricates us as I we grind into each other. My hands grab her hips as I pull her back into me. She leans forward as I slide my member up and down her soapy crack, seeking entrance. \n\n\"NO, Jason,\" she stops me. \"Not like this. I want to look into your eyes,\" She turns to face me. Leans backward and pulls me down. We slide down into the tub, with me on top of her, water cascading over us. It is tight but doable once she throws her leg over the tub wall. Her leg has pushed the shower curtain out of the tub, and water is now flowing onto the bathroom floor. We don't care. We are together.\n\n\"Make love to me. Jason,\" she whispers hoarsely, arms around my neck. She kisses me deeply as my manhood finds the entrance it seeks. I push inside her as our tongues entwine. The water pounds my back as I thrust into her writhing pelvis. She is more than ready. She's had her first orgasm, and others will quickly follow. I've made love to her enough times now to know the first one primes her, opens the floodgates to the rest.\n\nIt is hard to move in the shower. Knees and hips bang against hard porcelain, there is little room to move. But it is undoubtedly erotic, almost like making love in a rainstorm. A warm steamy rain, not a cold one. We continue thrusting. I am tired from the long day at work, tired from the drive here. The shower has re-energized me, but only temporarily. I can feel the pleasure building in me, and Shavonda is rapidly approaching another orgasm. She senses me holding back.\n\n\"It's ok Jason. Let it go. I'm there. You'll take me over.\" Her voice is reassuring, calming. She moans sexily as her body begins to peak. I am there. Looking deep into her eyes, I let it go. We spasm into each other. I fill her with my seed. I collapse on top of her in exhaustion. She strokes my hair, strokes my back as I lay there. As uncomfortable as it must be, laying there on hard porcelain with my weight on top of her, she is stroking me lovingly. She loves me.\n\nI wished she could have a baby. I want her to have my baby. I want to watch her belly and breasts grow with new life. I want to be there to witness the birth, to watch him or her take her first breath, to hand the baby to Shavonda for the first time. I want to see the look on her face as she sees the life we created for the first time. It can never be. And that's a shame.\n\nWe help each other out of the tub, turn the water off, dry each other with towels. She grabs a washcloth and attempts to wipe herself. I stop her. \"No,\" I say. \"Let it run down your leg. It turns me on.\"\n\nI followed her back into the room. We lay on the bed and cuddled in each other's arms. I lay on my back, one arm around her, hand cupping her breast, while I stoked her hair with the other hand. I had my one knee raised off the bed, and she had one leg thrown over me, one leg under mine. I could feel the stickiness of our passion on my leg as she rubbed her crotch into my leg. Without meaning to, we fall asleep, feeling contented and safe.\n\nIn the morning, I awake to a soothingly cool breeze. The door to the room is open. I pull on my pants and wander to the door. Shavonda is there, leaning on the balcony rail in a thigh length sun dress, hips cocked to one side as she stares at the view. I am enjoying a different view, and grabbing my Nikon I can't resist snapping a photo of her. She is unaware I have done so. \n\nI snuggle up behind her, feel her push back into me as I wrap my arms around her. \"This place is gorgeous,\" she whispers breathlessly. The pointed mountain looms across the valley, a mile away, keeping watch over the town. \"Can you take me to the place with the rocks and the view? The one in the photos you took.\"\n\n\"Dolly Sods?\" I ask. \"Of course, but it's 7 so we have to get going. We load the cooler and my camera into the Liberty and lock up the room. I take her to the diner for breakfast, and on the way out of town we stop at the grocery store for a couple of steaks and some ice for the cooler. Shavonda pulls me down the spice aisle, where she picks out an assortment of small glass jars. \n\n\"We want those to taste right,\" she says.\n\nWe leave town on 220 heading south. About 20 miles later she sees a sign saying welcome to Maryland. Grasping my hand, she says, \"For luck.\" She doesn't know it, but she started a new tradition for me. From now on we will never cross a state line without holding hands.\n\nWe wind our way through Cumberland, she is amazed at the narrows just west of town. \"I've never seen rocks that big,\" she exclaims.\n\nWe hold hands as we cross the Potomac river into Keyser, WV. \"Is this where you're from?\" she asks.\n\n\"No,\" I tell her. \"I was much further south. We'd need more than a day to go there.\"\n\nContinuing south, I make a detour and take her through Greenland Gap. She is amazed at the boulder fields on either side of the creek, where chunks of rocks have broken off the cliffs above for eons. She wonders how the pine trees could grow up through the boulders without being crushed.\n\nLeaving the gap, we make our way over back roads. In a valley with powerline towers, I stop the car. I show her the hillside; clusters of prickly pear cacti grow wild out of the loose shale. I grab the bucket from the back and a trowel, and dig up one of the cacti as she watches. \"For you,\" I say as I present her the bucket. \"Make sure it gets lots of sun, and don't give it a lot of water.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says. Tears in her eyes.\n\nWe continue over back roads to Petersburg, where we turn west. A giant mountain looms up in front of us like a wall. There is a narrow, cliff lined gap in the mountain which we follow through. \"This gorge is 2000 feet deep,\" I tell her. That mountain in the background is where we are going.\"\n\nWe turn off the main road, and climb on a dirt road, winding our way up to the top. We've climbed 30000 feet, and though the jeep can take it, it has started to overheat a little. We press onward, along the ridgetop, through the heath bogs and flag spruce forests, until we come to a small dirt parking lot. \n\n\"We're here,\" I tell her. We leave the car and I lead her by the hand through the jumble of Pottsville conglomerate and spruce trees, to the edge of the mountain. It is noticeably cooler up here, at 4000 feet above sea level, with a constant breeze. But the day is warm enough that we are not cold. We find patches of snow among the rocks, and soon we have a little snowball battle. \n\nWe continue to pick our way over and around the rocks, looking for that one special spot with a completely unobstructed view. I step back to take her picture admiring the world spread out below us, endless mountain ridges receding off into the distance. She bends herself over a rock, elbows leaning on its hard sandy surface. She hikes her dress up, and devilishly drops her panties around her ankles. \"Jason, do you want this?\" she asks, looking over her shoulder at me. \"Come get you some. Be quick about it.\"\n\nHere we are on a mountaintop, I an area frequented by hikers, photographers and rock climbers, where anybody could walk up on us. She wants me. I can't say no. I come up behind her and drop my pants. She is wet and ready, and I slip inside her with ease. Her hair has kinked back up since the shower last night, and she looks the way she did when I met her just two short weeks ago. I love watching her body move in front of me as she responds to my thrusts. I am here, with my beautiful woman, surrounded by beauty. The experience is overwhelming. It is primal.\n\nWe don't try to hold back. This is a quickie. We don't want to be caught, but being caught is part of the thrill. We are breaking many taboos at once, yet it feels so natural. She comes with cries lost to the wind, pushing back into me. I feel her convulsing around my hard penis, but I am not quite there yet. She is trying to milk me of what I am not yet ready to give her. \"Ohmygod Jason,\" she cries. I am tearing her up. I am not gentle. The animal passion is welling up in me, I will possess her. I will tear that pussy up.\n\nMy climax comes on me suddenly. I am not expecting it. I can't hold it back because I didn't know it was there. I pound into her from behind, my balls are slapping her pussy lips, I have ahold of her hips so she can't move. I am trying to drive her body into the rock. Brown butt cheeks ripple beneath me with a slap slap as I drive my way deeper inside her. I let loose with an animalistic groan, shooting come inside her with such force I am sure I am going to put a hole in her. \n\nI collapse on top of her as my climax subsides. I am spent. She, and this place, have drained the energy from my body. I am trying to control my breathing, to slow by heartbeat, but I am gasping for air as well. \n\n\"Wow,\" Shavonda gasps. \"You about to give a girl a brush burn.\"\n\nI can only gasp in reply. My legs are weak. I need to sit down. Reluctantly I pull my still rock hard penis from her clutching pussy. \n\nShavonda looks back at me with those eyes. Staring at me. Staring at my dick. \"You're still hard.\" She says. \"Let me take care of it.\" \n\nShe helps me lean against the rock, then drops to her knees in front of me. \"it's been a while since I tasted the swirl,\" she says tenderly. I lean there against the rock as she cleans me with her mouth. I know I am not going to come again. She knows it too, but she keeps on sucking anyway. I am enjoying this. So is she.\n\nI hear voices, and spot a flash of bright blue through the trees. \"Von!\" I say, \"Somebody's coming!\" Quickly I pull up my pants as she flips her dress down. She had stepped out of her panties during our escapade and there is no time to put them on. She quickly grabs them off the ground and hands them to me. I ball them in my fist. I am lucky, nobody will be able to see them in my hand. Grabbing me by my other hand, she starts to lead me back to the car, my seed running down her thigh. An older white couple emerges from the trees. We exchange greetings as we pass each other.\n\nBack at the car, Shavonda laughs hysterically. \"You wonder if they saw noticed my leg?\" she was out of breath now. \"Jason, that was amazing! This place is amazing! Is this what you meant when you said it had to be experienced in person?\"\n\n\"Sorta kinda,\" I replied. \"But I never had sex here. You added a whole new dimension to this place.\"\n\nThe day was early, so we decided to push further south. I told her about the volcano I had heard about in geology class. There was an extinct volcanic cone just south of Monterrey, Va. It is probably the only one in the east. I had never seen it. She was game so we headed toward Virginia. We descended the mountain, me driving in low gear like the truck driver I am. At the main road, we turned right, and headed south. Shavonda was enthralled with Seneca Rocks, so we pulled over. I took her picture with the jagged rocks towering 800 feet in the background. \"They're beautiful.\" She said. \"This whole area is beautiful.\" \n\nWe turned east on 33, climbed North Fork Mountain through Germany Valley, and descended to Franklin, where we continued south on 220. Soon we were at the Virginia line, and we clasped hands again. We headed through Monterrey, where she marveled at the buildings. They looked like the set of a movie about the deep south. In a few minutes, I spotted the volcano, Trimble Knob. It sat off in a farmer's field, a small round hill about 200 feet high. It stood out in an area dominated by long mountain ridges oriented north-south like corduroy. We snapped a few photos there, of each other and the cone in the background, then I turned the car around. \n\n\"Do you think we could get some pictures of the town,\" Shavonda asked.\n\n\"I don't see why not,\" I replied. We turned the Jeep around, and headed for the town. Parking the car, we walked around the small downtown taking photos like any normal sightseeing couple. We got a few stares, including one from a passing cop, but I thought nothing of it. \n\nBack in the car, we headed back north on 220. The cop was behind us, but not following closely. We were within sight of the welcome to West Virginia sign when he put on his lights and pulled us over. I stopped the car in a pull off about 100 yards from the border. He asked for both of our id's plus the insurance and registration for the car, we weren't speeding, so I was curious and a little pissed as to why he'd pulled us over. I noticed Shavonda was quiet, she seemed afraid of something.\n\nHe walked back up to my window, handed me back the documents, \"You wouldn't happen to be running drugs through here would you?\" he asked. \n\n\"Of course not,\" I replied. \"We were just sightseeing.\" Shavonda slouched down in her seat.\n\nLooking at my windshield he said, \"Is that cocaine?\" I looked. He was pointing at a salt packet that had somehow wedged itself between the windshield and dashboard. Shavonda was visibly shaking now.\n\n\"No, that's table salt,\" I calmly replied. WE hadn't done anything wrong. I had nothing to fear.\n\n\"Do you have something you could use to get that out?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have a screwdriver under the seat,\" I said. I was now starting to get worried too.\n\n\"Can you get it out for me?\" the cop asked. With his watching me, hands at his side, I reached under the seat and pulled out the screwdriver. I quickly used it to remove the salt packet, and handed it to the officer. He ripped it open and tasted it, then threw it on the ground. \"Yup, that's salt all right.\"\n\nI said, \"I told you so.\" Shavonda hissed something at me through clenched teeth.\n\n\"Would you mind if I took a look inside your car?\" the cop asked. Shavonda looked like she was about to cry.\n\n\"Be my guest,\" I said, and immediately regretted it. What if he plants something on us?\n\nHe rummaged around in the back for a few minutes, he also looked in the cooler and my camera bag. Satisfied, he told me, \"Y'all are free to go now. Have a nice day.\" Shavonda breathed a visible sigh of relief.\n\n\"Just a second, sir.\" I said. Shavonda stiffened in her seat.\" Can I give you a little advice?\"\n\nThe cop turned to me. \"Sure, he said.\"\n\nI continued. \"As you can see we are not drug dealers. But if we were, when I reached under the seat there would have been a gun there, and one or both of us would be dead now.\" The cop stiffened, his face turned white. \"Next time you stop a car, don't let them reach under the seat. And keep your hand on your gun when you talk to people. I may have just saved your life.\"\n\nThe cop turned away red faced and walked back to his car. Shavonda looked at me and said, \"Welcome to my world.\"\n\nWe started north again, holding hands over the border. I was pissed. \"He had no right to do that!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Jason don't you get it?\" Shavonda was almost in tears. \"They don't like me. They don't even know me and they don't like me. To them I am a dumb nigger bitch. They don't care to find out differently. You're with me so they don't like you either. You're a nigger lover. They don't like US. We're not supposed to be together. You see a couple out for a drive. They see drug dealers. You grew up around this. You can't say you didn't know.\"\n\nShe continued, \" I envy you. You can drop me off and go back to your normal life any time you want. This could happen to me anytime, anywhere. This guy didn't plant anything on us. But that doesn't mean the next one won't.\"\n\nI was still pissed, and said so. \"Look, Jason, don't let it get to you. It will eat you up if you dwell on it. Just be aware that it exists and we'll be ok.\" Shavonda was doing her best to calm me down. I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. Why were they that afraid of my queen?\n\nWe pulled into a park right outside of Petersburg, and cooked our steaks. The seasonings Shavonda bought made them extra delicious. My queen is teaching me things. She's made my life so much better in just the short time I've known her.\n\nLater that evening, back in Bedford, we went to see a movie. We shared a drink and popcorn drenched in butter. I don't remember the movie. I was too busy making out with Shavonda.\n\nBack at the motel, we made slow, sweet love to Angie Stone. After the day we'd just had, there was no desire for intense feelings. We just needed to hold each other. We comforted each other. I reassured her that I was not going to step out on her and go back to white ladies. I was in love. If other people didn't like her, that was their problem. I did, and I was going to be with her through thick or thin. The cop in Virginia, and the things Shavonda had said had hardened my resolve. Nobody was going to take my queen from me.\n\nI had plans to take her to Horseshoe Curve the next day. I put those plans on hold so we could stay back in our motel room, decompressing, holding each other, comforting each other, making slow sensual love. It had turned into a lazy weekend.\n\nMemorial Day, we got up early, packed the car, and started back to Pittsburgh. We stopped on the way for breakfast at a diner. The steak and eggs was excellent. We headed west on 30, retracing our route Friday night in reverse, so that Shavonda could see it in daylight. On the way, we made a quick stop at the Flight 93 memorial, paying homage to the heroes that had prevented a plane from crashing into the US Capitol by running it into the ground in the mountains of southern Pennsylvania. \n\nWe went straight to the cookout without unloading the car or changing clothes. I was wearing jeans and a tee shirt with a 12-point buck on it. Probably not the best choice, with my drawl and that shirt I had to come off as a redneck. I wasn't. Shavonda wore another of her sundresses. She seemed to prefer dresses to shorts and tee shirt. She also wore the ever-present sandals I've come to think of when I picture her. ",
        "They were looking for us when we drove up. The whole family was waiting to meet the white boy who'd stolen Shavonda's heart. Althea met us at the car. She hugged Shavonda, then said to me, \"C'mon. You too.\" We embraced. Following Althea down the steps was her father, James. We said hi, we shook hands. Like Althea, he had an air of quiet dignity to him. He also had an authority about him that reminded me of James Earl Jones. Or better yet, Denzell Washington in Unstoppable.\n\nOne of the cousins loved to deejay. He'd set up a stereo and table in the backyard, hip hop music was playing and some of the people were dancing in on the patio. I made the rounds with Shavonda introducing me to everybody. Velma was there, so was Tamika. \n\nOne of the men about my age confronted me. \"What are you doing with my cousin. She's not a toy.\"\n\nAlthea rushed in to my rescue. \"Robert! You leave Jason alone. HE's our guest.\"\n\n\"I just don't want to see white boy here leave her high and dry once he gets tired of playing on the dark side.\" He glared at me. They were protective of Shavonda. \n\nAlthea hustled me away from Robert, saying, \"Don't mind him. He'll come around.\" She steered me into the kitchen, where Shavonda was happily telling a group of older ladies about our weekend. She was telling them about the cactus. They didn't believe her so I retrieved it from the car and showed it to them. \"You're so sweet,\" one of the ladies said. \"I can see why she likes you.\" Turning to Shavonda she said, \"He's a keeper, that one is. Don't you dare let him get away.\"\n\nJames found me and steered me away from the women. \"I thought I should rescue you,\" he said. \"Besides, we need to talk. Tell me about yourself, son.\"\n\nI told him about who I was, my outlook on life, my intentions toward his daughter. He told me about the family. How his grandparents fled Birmingham in the 1960s. One of the girls killed in the church bombing was close family. In Pittsburgh, James's father had found work in the steel mills. He worked his way through night school emerging with a degree in electronics, and was promoted to electrician in the mill. That was a lucky break. When the mills shut down in the 1980s, he had enough seniority in the mill in a craft that was in demand that he retained his job. The laborers he'd started out with were not so lucky, and were all laid off. He was able to put James and his brother through school. James followed in his father's footsteps and became an electrician, maintaining signals for the railroad.\n\nJames's father retired from the mill with over 40 years of service, around the time Shavonda had graduated college. Within a couple of years, he was dead of a massive heart attack.\n\nJames had done well with the railroad, putting two daughters and a son through school. The son was working in California and couldn't make the cookout. The daughter, Shaunice, had been sitting at the table with Shavonda. She was several years older than Shavonda.\n\nJames told me the story of Shavonda's boyfriend Tony, and the baby he'd fathered. He confirmed what Althea had told me two weeks earlier. Tony's race was never mentioned. To this day I don't know it. All that matters is that he'd killed her baby, and made it so she couldn't have any more. \n\nI could sense the guy liked me. Finally, he asked me what music I listened to. I told him what my favorites were.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Do you like funk, soul, r&b, hip hop?\"\n\n\"I always liked Parliament, Heatwave, War and Sly and the Family Stone.\"\n\n\"Now we're getting somewhere. What's your favorite P-funk?\"\n\n\"Maggot Brain,\" I replied. \"That is one of the best guitar solos I've ever heard. It's not virtuoso, but it is way more powerful than anything most of the guitar gods did.\"\n\n\"You like Stevie Wonder?\"\n\n\"Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants, and Innervisions are my favorite albums.\"\n\n\"I'm impressed.\" He turned to me with a mischievous look that reminded me of Shavonda in her playful mood. \"The young bucks have had enough air time, let's go pick out some cd's and show them what real music is.\"\n\nI was in my glory. We worked our way through the cd rack in the living room, picking out about 20 disks. I followed him out to the backyard where he elbowed aside the deejay, saying, \"You've had your fun, now it's time for some grown folk's music.\"\n\nShavonda was up on the patio dancing when her dad made the switch. When Atomic Dog started blasting from the speakers several of the younger members of the family left the patio, groaning, \"Oh man!\" and \"Turn that shit off!\" Shavonda stayed on the patio, her graceful movements a pleasure to watch. She was in her element.\n\n\"Let's see the white boy dance!\" somebody yelled.\n\nA female voice called out, \"Hey Von, you better go get your man!\" Shavonda looked at me, motioning me to the patio.\n\nJames said to me, \"You better get up there before somebody else grabs your woman\" I walked to the patio feeling good about myself. It wasn't \"my daughter,\" it was \"your woman.\" He'd accepted me. This was going to be fun.\n\nI started to dance with her, my movements jerky. Somebody laughed. \"I knew white boy couldn't dance.\"\n\nShavonda grabbed me by the hands and led my movements, saying, \"I know you know how to feel the music. You do it all the time when we make love. This is just like making love. Let the music flow through you. Let it guide your movements.\" She gyrated in front of me. \"Do what I do,\" she said. I copied what she did, how she moved. I could feel the music. My movements became fluid. I was doing it.\n\nWe danced that way for a while. Then a slow tune came on. I started to sit down. Shavonda put her arms around me and pulled me close. \"What you worried about baby?\" she asked. \"Them seeing you rub up on me? Don't worry. You're family now.\" \n\nShe put her arms around my neck, we were slow dancing in a warm embrace. She kissed me. \"I love you Jefferson Waite,\" she cooed.\n\n\"I love you too, Shavonda Jenkins.\"\n\nTo be continued..."
