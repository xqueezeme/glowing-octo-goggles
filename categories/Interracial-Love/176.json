        "The house was abuzz on Saturday with the preparation of the evening meal. The activity brought back sweet but painful memories for Joel, he missed his family many of whom had died in the concentration camps. He watched the ease in which Kenji and Patricia interacted with each other, their children and family. It occurred to him that it was quite a mixture, Japanese, white and black and some of the whites were from the south but yet, here in this house, none of that mattered. It didn't take him long to realize that they weren't pretending, these people really loved each other and would die protecting each other. A tear slipped down his thin, pale white face, in that moment, he had never felt so alone.\n\nA tugging on his baggy pants distracted him. He looked down to see Marie tugging on his pant leg with one hand and holding a book in the other.\n\n\"Read?\" she asked with a smile that lit up her plump little face.\n\nJoel stooped down, picked the little girl up and carried her outside. A few minutes later, he was reading to her changing his voice for the different characters and making her laugh. It wasn't long before Niko was sitting with them with a stack of books and the three of them were lost in their own make believe world.\n\nPatricia stood at the window and watched with a smile on her face. She was glad that they convinced Joel to come for the weekend; he needed a respite from whatever it was that was hurting him on the inside. Kenji came up behind her, put his arms around her and watched with her. Before the weekend was out, he was going to have a talk with Joel; he wanted to find out what happened to make him so timid and fearful.\n\nBy ten, everyone was gone and the children in bed sound asleep leaving Kenji, Patricia and Joel alone.\n\n\"I want to thank you for everything.\" Joel said softly.\n\n\"You're welcome here anytime.\" Patricia said, \"You're our friend.\"\n\nJoel swallowed a lump in his throat and coughed to clear it. The thought that he had only one more day of heaven before returning to his own private hell weighed heavily on his mind.\n\n\"I'm going to make some tea,\" Patricia announced, \"anyone care for any?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you kirei.\" Kenji replied, \"Joel?\"\n\n\"If it isn't any trouble....\"\n\n\"No trouble.\" Patricia replied as she kissed Kenji on the cheek and headed for the kitchen.\n\n\"Do you realize how lucky you are?\" Joel asked as he watched Patricia head to the kitchen.\n\n\"I have been blessed.\" Kenji replied softly, \"Joel, where is your family?\"\n\n\"Many of them are dead at the hands of the Nazis.\"\n\n\"Your parents?\" Kenji asked.\n\n\"We had been here in the states for about fifteen years when the war broke out. My mother died four years ago and my father died shortly afterwards.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for your loss.\" Kenji said softly, \"It is difficult to lose loved ones no matter the manner of their death.\"\n\nPatricia came in with the tea and served each man beginning with Joel.\n\n\"Where's yours?\" Joel asked alarmed thinking that he had taken the last of the tea.\n\n\"I changed my mind.\" Patricia said with a smile, \"I think I'm going to take the opportunity to read something other than my school books and leave you two to talk about whatever it is guys your age talk about.\"\n\nKenji gave her an appreciative smile, her intuition to the needs of others never ceased to amaze him. Paul set his cup of tea down and stood when Kenji did, \"You don't have to leave.\" He said.\n\n\"I know but I have this book that I've been dying to get started on so I'll see you in the morning.\" Patricia replied, \"Sleep well Joel.\"\n\n\"Thank you Patricia and I mean for everything.\" Joel replied.\n\n\"Joel, \"Kenji replied, \"Will you excuse me for a moment?\"\n\nWhen they were alone in their room Kenji hugged Patricia tight, he wanted nothing more than to be going to bed with her but he and Joel needed to talk.\n\n\"Thank you kirei.\" he breathed as he kissed her.\n\n\"You're welcome and if I'm asleep when you come to bed wake me up.\"\n\n\"I promise. I will see you later.\" Kenji said kissing her again before he went back down the stairs.\n\nJoel was staring off into space when Kenji got to the living room. Joel jerked to attention and gave Kenji a weak smile. When Kenji was sitting and sipping on his now comfortably warm tea Joel hesitated and then asked a question.\n\n\"How do a Japanese man and a black woman find each other and make a life together?\"\n\nHe listened as Kenji gave him the condensed version of his and Patricia's time together leaving out the escape from the camp.\n\n\"You survived all of that and yet you still love each other? Didn't you ever want to leave her because of the difficulty?\" \n\n\"I will admit that there was a time or two that I thought about it but not for my benefit but for hers,\" Kenji said, \"the thoughts didn't last but a few seconds and it is because of her that I survived.\"\n\n\"But your lives would have been so much easier had you not gotten married.\" Joel said.\n\n\"Perhaps in some ways but not in others.\" Kenji replied, \"Both of us had very difficult choices to make and what it came down to was what was right for us. In the end we decided that we were going to fight for what was our right and that was for us to be together as husband and wife.\"\n\n\"If you had to do it again knowing what you do, would you?\" Joel asked.\n\n\"I would.\" Kenji replied without hesitation \"as would Patricia. Joel, sometimes you have to fight for what you want and I wanted Patricia. What is it that you want?\"\n\nJoel sat down his teacup and looked away, \"what do I want?\" he asked himself.\n\n\"I... I want to be strong and confident like you and Patricia are, I want to know what its like to not to be afraid of my own shadow, I want a wife who loves me the way that Patricia loves you and I want children.\" Joel stopped himself realizing that this was the first time that he had verbalized any of his wants.\n\n\"Who made you so unsure of yourself?\" Kenji asked, \"Where did all of this fear come from?\"\n\nKenji listened as Joel talked about his life, his childhood and the loss of his parents.\n\n\"You have always been persecuted.\" Kenji stated.\n\n\"Yes but I was encouraged to turn the other cheek.\" Joel replied, \"And of course being the smallest kid in school didn't help any.\"\n\n\"Your father, he didn't teach you how to defend yourself?\"\n\n\"No, he said that the teasing was the way of children and that it would get better as I grew but it didn't, if anything it was even worse.\"\n\n\"Did you not get angry?\" Kenji asked. Niko as small as he was could defend himself against those much bigger than he if he had to but he also knew that violence was a last resort. Kenji looked at Joel, a grown man who in many ways was more defenseless than Marie whose training would start soon.\n\n\"Of course I did!\" Joel snapped and then became contrite, \"I'm sorry....\"\n\n\"Don't be.\" Kenji said, \"Anger is not always a negative emotion. Joel, would you like me to teach you some basic defensive moves? I can also teach you meditation exercises that will help promote relaxation and build confidence.\"\n\n\"You would do that?\" Joel asked interested and surprised.\n\n\"Of course.\" Kenji replied, \"We can start in the morning if you like.\"\n\nThat night when Joel went to bed, he felt something that he hadn't felt in years.... Hope that his life could be better.\n\n*******\n\nAndrew sat staring off into space thinking about Kenji and Patricia Takeda, he still had no plans to hurt Patricia but he wasn't opposed to using her to get to \"the Jap\". Joel no longer interested him for the time being as he presented no challenge to him but Kenji on the other hand.... That cool demeanor both intrigued and angered him, how he could be with a black woman also intrigued him but not necessarily angered him.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Mark one of Andrews closest friends asked.\n\n\"Nothing.\" Andrew replied lying, he wanted \"the Jap\" all to himself and would only include someone else if he had to. For the moment, \"the Jap's\" wife was off limits therefore eliminating the need for any one else to know his thoughts. For that matter, \"the Jap\" and \"the Jew\" were off limits too, he would watch them but wouldn't bother them. None of his friends would bother them either; they would take their cues from him.\n\nNot for the first time, Andrew wondered why his hatred centered on Kenji. After all, he wasn't the only Japanese on campus but he was the only one that got under his skin without even trying. \"Why is that?\" he wondered as he tuned out the conversation around him, \"What is it about him that makes me see red?\"\n\nAndrew didn't fool himself, he hated all things Japanese, they attacked this country, and almost killed his father and now they were taking over the classroom. That his father harbored no ill will toward them didn't matter, that it was war didn't matter, that he could have continued to leave Kenji alone wasn't taken into consideration. \n\nThere was one thing that Andrew could admit to himself, he was jealous of Kenji, jealous of the self-control and cool demeanor that he displayed, jealous that Kenji would make a far better doctor than he could ever dream of being. He was jealous of....\n\n\"Hey baby!\" Becca Cartwright said as she slid into the booth and sidled up to him. \n\nAndrew looked over at her and gave her a small smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. Becca was beautiful, a tall blonde-haired woman with sparkling blue eyes and full luscious lips that Andrew's anatomy knew intimately.\n\n\"Hey yourself.\" he greeted with false cheerfulness. He wasn't in the mood for her tonight, in fact, he wasn't in the mood for anything.\n\n\"Are we going for a drive later?\" she asked. The question was her code for, \"am I going to get to suck your cock?\"\n\nSurprisingly, he wasn't even in the mood for that. When she slid her hand under the table and rested it on a cock that would have been hard as soon as she asked the question, Andrew stopped her.\n\n\"Not tonight, I want to spend the evening with my dad.\" he lied smoothly.\n\n\"We don't have to be gone long.\" she insisted.\n\n\"Tomorrow, how's that?\" he asked saying anything to get her to forget about the ride tonight.\n\n\"I'll pack a lunch, what time?\"\n\n\"One, I'll see you then.\" Andrew said and gave her a peck on the cheek.\n\nAs he left, he heard someone mention Kenji's name and suddenly he wasn't so sure that he could trust his friends to leave Kenji alone. He doubled back to the table and waited until they were all looking at him.\n\n\"Leave the Jap and his woman alone, if any of you do anything to either of them without my say so, I will kick your ass so hard you won't be able to sit for a week.\"\n\n\"What about Jew boy?\" someone asked.\n\n\"Leave him alone.\" Andrew replied.\n\n\"What's with you?\" Mark asked, \"You changing your mind about them?\" His voice held a note of challenge that set Andrew on edge.\n\n\"You don't get to ask me what I'm thinking or feeling is that clear?\" Andrew hissed, \"I want them left alone until I say otherwise, got it?\"\n\n\"I got it,\" Mark said backing down, \"just calm down will ya?\"\n\nAndrew stared at each face at the booth for several seconds before leaving the diner, he was confident that he had made his point.\n\n*******\n\nWilliam hung up the phone and sighed, he had just spoken with his contact at the federal prison where Lawrence was still an inmate.\n\n\"We found an inmate dead.\" the contact said, \"from what we can tell, the man was a part of Goodman's group and had somehow been labeled as a traitor.\"\n\n\"Let me guess,\" William said, \"You don't have any proof that Goodman or any of his group was involved.\"\n\n\"You got it.,\" the contact said.\n\n\"I'm confused though, how did you find out about the traitor thing?\" William asked.\n\n\"A note.\"\n\n\"A note? From who?\" William asked.\n\n\"We don't know, it didn't say much except that the man was supposedly a traitor and to look at Goodman.\"\n\n\"How was he killed?\" William asked.\n\n\"The poor bastard was found hanging in the showers.\"\n\n\"Does this poor bastard have a name?\" William asked.\n\n\"Yeah... Dwayne something or another. Why?\"\n\n\"Just curious.\" William replied letting out a sigh of relief that it wasn't their undercover agent. \"Do me a favor, keep me posted and if you hear anything about Goodman being released, call me and I don't care if it's the middle of the night and if you can't reach me, call Nick Alexander.\"\n\n\"I can do that but the word is that Goodman will be here for the next two years, nine months.\"\n\nWilliam hung up after making sure that the man had Nick's telephone number. An uneasy feeling settled in the pit of his stomach.\n\nLawrence Goodman was coming back to California and more than likely, there would be a trail of bodies behind him. \n\nHe looked at the time and decided that it wasn't too late to give Nick a call. They would have just gotten home from the party at Kenji and Patricia's house and would still be up.\n\nNick answered on the first ring and listened carefully as William told him about the death of the inmate.\n\n\"Will, you've got to get your man out of there before Goodman realizes that he's the real informant.\"\n\n\"You're right.\" Will said, \"I'll call the FBI office on Monday and let them know.\"\n\n********\n\nLawrence looked around the prison yard; his group was growing to the point where he could afford to be more selective about who he let in. He had begun interviewing anyone who showed an interest choosing those who were educated and had skills that he thought would be useful and of course he chose a fair number of those that he called foot soldiers. They were necessary to any war and they had to be willing to obey any order without question, for that reason, he chose those whom he considered to be inferior.\n\nHe stole a look at the man that he was grooming to replace him and felt unease. Something about Carl had been nagging him for weeks but he hadn't been able to pinpoint it. He was as attentive to detail as he always was, made sure that anyone joining the group understood the rules and their roles but still, something wasn't right.\n\nCarl looked up, saw Lawrence looking at him and nodded in greeting. Lawrence returned the greeting and turned toward the inmate sitting next to him.\n\n\"Watch him and don't get caught doing it.\" Lawrence said as he stole another glance at his second in command.\n\n******\n\nCarl knew that his time was getting short, he had known it for weeks but he wanted just a little more time. He knew his time was up when he caught Lawrence watching him. He only had to make it until Monday, one more day and he could leave this hellhole. He knew that he had to watch his back and wondered which inmate Lawrence had assigned to watch him.\n\nHe mentally ran over his options to get what information that he had to the outside. Up until now, he hadn't written anything down deeming it too dangerous but now it looked as if he might not have a choice in the matter. After he finished interviewing the latest recruit before sending him over to Lawrence, he excused himself to his cell watching to see if he was being followed.\n\nAs soon as he reached his cell, he looked behind him and pulled a notebook from a slit in the mattress and as quickly as he could began to write the names of Lawrence's known targets, the addresses to the safe houses as well as any other pertinent information while keeping an eye out on prying eyes. When he was finished, he slipped the notebook back into its hiding place and left the cell.\n\nOn the way back to the yards, he stopped by the warden's office which in and of itself wasn't unusual. He often stopped in to smooze with the man to help keep things easy for Lawrence. This time however, he gave the warden a small piece of paper.\n\n\"If anything happens to me, call that number,\" was all he said.\n\n\"What is this about?\" the warden asked.\n\n\"I have a notebook that I want my family to have if something happens to me.\" Carl said, \"That number will reach my attorney, make sure that he checks for all of my belongings.\"\n\nHaving done all that he could do, Carl left the warden's office and headed back to the yards fully aware that he was being followed.\n\n********\n\nSunday morning Joel was up bright and early. The glimmer of hope that he had fallen asleep with had grown into a bright light. Part of it was the sense of well being that he felt at having friends and part of it was the resolve that he was going to start standing up for himself. He had no doubts that he would get his ass kicked but it wouldn't matter, the only thing that would matter was that he stood up for himself.\n\nHis stomach rumbled as he smelled breakfast cooking. He had eaten more in the last three days than he had in a month and he felt better. As he dressed, he thought about the store and his attachment to it, maybe it was time to let that go as well. The money that he would get from selling it would allow him to rent a room somewhere and would allow him to eat better. He couldn't deny the correlation between a full stomach and his mood, decision made. He would sell the store.\n\nAfter breakfast, Kenji took the children and Joel out into the back yard. He paired Niko with Marie and he partnered with Joel.\n\n\"We will start with meditation.\" he said and began to teach Joel basic meditation, \"Do not worry if your mind wanders, it takes time and practice.\"\n\nWhile not very successful with the first lesson, Joel thoroughly enjoyed himself and couldn't wait to try it on is own.\n\nWhile Patricia and Kenji played with the children, Joel made a phone call. By the end of it, he had sold the store. After class on Monday, he was meeting the buyer of the store and would find a cheap hotel close to school.\n\nFor the first time in years, he felt good and more importantly, he felt as if he was in control.\n\n*****\n\nMonday morning came quickly; Abby and Ralph were on baby sitting duty. \n\n\"Watch your back's.\" Ralph admonished as they kissed the children goodbye and headed out of the door. \n\nKenji walked Patricia to her first class and then went to his own. He was pleased to see that Joel wasn't sitting in the back of the class but had occupied a seat next to where he usually sat. When Andrew and his friends came in, Joel tensed and then forced himself to relax. His left hand still hadn't completely healed and throbbed at the sound of Andrew's voice. He resisted the urge to look over at Kenji and kept his eyes facing forward, for just a moment, he thought that they were going to be accosted and experienced a strange mixture of relief and trepidation when they weren't.\n\nKenji didn't react at all; he sat in his seat completely at ease although he knew that they were being watched. Kenji was as surprised as Joel was when Andrew and his friends didn't so much as speak to them. When the class ended, Andrew and his friends left, they didn't even spare Kenji or Joel a second glance.\n\n\"What do you suppose is happening?\" Joel asked.\n\n\"Trouble.\" Kenji replied softly, \"this is the calm before the storm.\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" Joel said his voice filled with hope, \"Maybe they're done with us.\"\n\n\"I do not think so.\" Kenji replied as he gathered his books and stood up. \"I must go meet Patricia; you are welcome to join me.\"\n\n\"Thank you but I have a couple of things to do before next class, I'll meet you there.\" Joel replied as he lifted his bag with his right hand.\n\nKenji watched as Joel walked away. He had the thought to ask if he needed someone to go with him and thought better of it, he had to learn to rely on himself and coddling him wasn't going to do that.\n\n******\n\nProfessor Hathaway looked at Patricia with disdain as he checked the answers to yet another pop quiz. It galled him that she passed every single quiz and with flying colors. He couldn't accuse her of cheating because she was one of fifteen or so that passed the quiz and then there was the fact that he didn't make up the quiz until the day of class.",
        "There was another issue as well; she had some staunch supporters including the dean and Paul Mynt. The fact of the matter was that he couldn't do anything that would get her put out of school without it looking suspicious. There were too many people on the faculty who were aware of his politics and it would come back to bite him in the ass if anything happened to her academically in his class. From what he heard, she was doing equally as well in the English Comp class she was taking therefore eliminating any chance of getting rid of her.\n\nHe had to consider her a necessary evil that he had to use to his advantage but in the meantime, he would pretend to make amends, if anything happened; they couldn't accuse him of racism. He swallowed his bile and plastered a fake smile on his face when Patricia looked up at him.\n\n\"Well done Mrs. Takeda!\" he exclaimed. \"You've passed yet again with flying colors.\"\n\nPatricia looked at him warily and said a polite \"thank you\".\n\nShe watched him teach the rest of the class and wondered what was happening. She did not trust him. Her experiences taught her that change didn't occur that quickly and that Professor Hathaway really hadn't changed his opinion of her.\n\nAfter class, he approached her.\n\n\"I would really like to know how you manage to pass my quizzes.\"\n\n\"I pretend that I'm you.\" Patricia replied. \"When I read, I ask myself, if I were Professor Hathaway, what would I ask?\" \n\nIn spite of himself, Hathaway was impressed.\n\n\"What do you really want?\" Patricia asked suddenly, \"for weeks you deliberately mispronounce my last name, you glare at me when you think no one is watching and suddenly that's changed.\"\n\nHe was unprepared for Patricia's bluntness. No one, not even his wife spoke to him the way that Patricia had just spoken to him. He jammed his hands in his pockets so that he wouldn't slap her as he wanted to. Instead, he kept his tone light. \n\n\"I must apologize for my earlier behavior.\" He said, \"I'm afraid that I was caught up in the whole post war mentality of having the enemy in our midst.\"\n\n\"You consider me the enemy?\" Patricia asked.\n\n\"What I meant was the Japanese; your last name surprised me...\"\n\nPatricia remembered Kenji's advice to choose her battle carefully and let it go even though she didn't believe a word of what Hathaway was saying.\n\n\"I'm glad that you've gotten over your post war mentality.\" Patricia said with a slight smile, \"if you will excuse me, my husband is waiting for me.\"\n\nAs soon as he was gone from the classroom, Professor Hathaway swore, \"black bitch!\"\n\n****** \"You are late.\" Kenji said as soon as he saw Patricia.\n\n\"I know, I'm sorry but Professor Hathaway kept me after class.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Kenji asked concerned.\n\n\"Some hogwash about getting over the post war mentality of having the enemy living amongst us.\" she replied.\n\n\"You do not believe him.\" Kenji stated.\n\n\"Not one single word of it,\" she replied, \"how was your class?\"\n\nPatricia listened silently as Kenji gave her his impressions on what was happening.\n\n\"I would like for you to join Niko, Marie and I for the self defense lessons, you may not be able to defeat an attacker but you will be able to provide more time to escape.\" he told her.\n\n\"Do you really think that it's necessary?\"\n\n\"Yes kirei, I do.\"\n\n******\n\nJoel met Kenji in time for the next class looking quite pleased with himself. He had sold the store and put the money into his bank account. The only thing left to do was to go pick up his meager belongings from the store and to find a cheap hotel close to the school.\n\nJoel sprang his news on them during lunch.\n\n\"You owned a store?\" Patricia asked.\n\n\" I used to.\" Joel replied, \"I sold it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"And you were living there without electricity? Why?\" \n\n\"It's a long story but basically, it belonged to my parents and it was the last place that I had good memories of and felt safe.\" Joel replied.\n\n\"Where will you live?\" Kenji asked.\n\n\"I'll stay at a hotel close to school until I find a room to rent.\" Joel replied.\n\nPatricia and Kenji looked at each other and then at Joel.\n\n\"Joel,\" Kenji said, \"come stay with us, you can keep the room in the basement.\"\n\n\"I can't do that!\" Joel exclaimed.\n\n\"Why not?\" Patricia replied, \"We have room and we'll have you fattened up in no time.\"\n\nBy the end of lunch, it was decided. Joel would move in with them under the condition that he paid rent and contributed to the food budget.\n\n******\n\nAndrew watched the trio as they shared lunch and talked. What it was about that scene that made him add Joel back to his list he didn't know and he really didn't care. Maybe it was the fact that Joel had lost a little of the perpetual fear that was usually on his face, but whatever it was, he would pay for it.\n\n******\n\nBy the end of December 1945, John H. Johnson published the first issue of the magazine 'Ebony', Charles De Gaulle is elected head of the provisional French Government, Harry S. Truman, Clement Atlee and Mackenzie King call for a U.N. Atomic Energy Commission, the United States imports 88 German scientist to help in the production of rocket technology, the movie 'The lost weekend' starring Ray Milland is released , the Nuremburg Trials begin- 24 Nazi war criminals are tried, the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia is declared and General George S. Patton dies from injuries sustained from a car accident.\n\n******\n\nKenji and Patricia's household adjusted quickly to Joel's moving in. Niko and Marie loved having him there because he was another adult that would read to them and didn't mind playing with them if he had time. All of them, children included were looking forward to the Christmas break. There would still be things to do for school but there wouldn't be the drive back and forth and the days spent away from home.\n\nPatricia looked out of the kitchen window watching Joel, Kenji and the children play with a ball. She noted with satisfaction that between eating good meals and working out with Kenji that Joel had begun to fill out. She thought him rather handsome with his dark hair and dark expressive eyes. He was shorter than Kenji by a good six inches and would always be slight of build but one day he was going to catch some woman's eye. \n\nThe other thing that she noticed was that little by little, the haunted look and reticent demeanor was disappearing and a more fun loving, confident man was appearing. Every one was noticing and commented on the change making Joel blush furiously. \n\nKenji looked up and saw Patricia watching them, smiled and then waved at her before motioning for her to come out to join them. Patricia waved back, shut off the oven that was preheating for the sugar cookies that she was baking to be decorated and packaged as Christmas gifts and went outside.\n\nKenji, she realized several weeks before was very concerned about Andrew Kelley and his friends and was serious about the self-defense classes. She remembered quite a bit from the lessons that he gave her a few years ago and like then, found that she really did enjoy the lessons.\n\nAs she walked toward them, Kenji's heart sped up. Coming toward him was the woman who had been to hell and back with him, his lover, his wife, the mother of his children; his kirei. Even after all of this time, his mouth went dry when he saw her, he almost felt like that tongue-tied man who first saw her in 1939. Had six years passed already? He thought as Patricia closed the distance between them. He walked toward her forgetting that Joel was watching them, for just a few moments it was as if no one or anything else existed. He had experienced the sensation before and loved it every time it came.\n\nWhen they met, Kenji pulled Patricia into is arms, bent down and kissed her deeply. He experienced one of those times when love wasn't a strong enough word for what he felt for her but was the best word that he could come up with.\n\n\"What was that for?\" Patricia asked when he broke the kiss.\n\n\"For no other reason than I love you.\" Kenji replied and kissed her again before releasing her.\n\n\"I love you too.\" Patricia replied, \"But I think we'd better pay attention to our children and housemate.\"\n\nKenji turned to look behind him and saw Niko, Marie and Joel watching them. Without the slightest hint of embarrassment, he took Patricia's hand and led her back to the waiting group.\n\n******\n\nAs Joel watched Patricia and Kenji, he felt a pain in his heart. His parents had loved each other in the same way that Kenji and Patricia loved each other and like them, they weren't afraid to show it. His fondest dream, other than being a doctor was to have a marriage like that. He could only hope that now that he had filled out and didn't look so... frightened and lost that he would become more attractive to the opposite sex.\n\nIn his heart of hearts, he found himself hoping that she-whoever she was would be like Patricia, a woman full of grace, courage and intelligence. He was also aware that if he wasn't careful, he could fall in love with his best friend's wife. As far as he was concerned, it would be the ultimate betrayal and one that he wouldn't allow to happen under any circumstances. She was the wife of his best friend and his friend as well and that is where it ended.\n\n******\n\nHarlon was growing more and more concerned about Andrew. He acted as if he understood about hate and the uselessness of it but Harlon was no longer sure that he did. He couldn't quite put his finger on it but Andrew was changing and it wasn't for the better. Even Evelyn noticed and commented on it but neither of them said anything to him.\n\nHarlon looked across the lunch table at Andrew, trying to understand where the hate that he knew his only child was harboring came from. He himself didn't consider himself a bigot although he had used racial epithets freely while at the same time preaching respect for all people especially women. It hadn't struck him until then how contradictory he had been.\n\nHe had used the \"N\" word freely as well as the names used for the Hispanics and the Orientals not thinking about how it would sound to a child. To Andrew, it probably did sound like hatred and then Pearl Harbor happened and Harlon like every other enraged American ranted against the Japanese and at one point had joined in on the vandalizing of Japanese owned businesses. \n\n\"What's up pop?\" Andrew asked when he caught Harlon looking at him.\n\n\"Nothing son,\" Harlon replied having decided that he had no room or the right to preach to Andrew about hatred.\n\n\"You sure?\" Andrew asked, \"You look like you got something on your mind.\"\n\n\"I'm sure... hey, I was thinking, it's been awhile since we cooked out back, what about tonight?\"\n\nAndrew hesitated but then agreed, it had been awhile since he and his father spent an evening together.\n\n*******\n\nCarl Tucker wheeled himself across his office in his wheelchair. He had barely made it out of the federal prison of South Carolina with his life. It would have been of no consequence if he had died as long as the information he gathered on Lawrence Goodman and his merry band of followers reached the right people. \n\nHe only had hours to go before he was going to walk out but somehow, Lawrence figured out who and what he was. It had to be someone from within the agency, there was no other explanation but who? He wondered. It was a mystery that he planned to solve no matter how long it took.\n\nThe thing that galled Carl the most was that even with all of the information that he had, they couldn't pin any of the murders that happened in the prison on Lawrence. he always took great pains to distance himself and Carl never once heard him say anything that could be even remotely construed as an order to kill or hurt someone other than the names of the people that he said that he wanted to \"visit\" after he got out of prison.\n\nIt didn't take a genius to know what he meant by \"visit\" but there was no way to prove that he meant other than what he said. Carl consoled himself with the fact that he had managed to gather as much information as he had and the safe houses were under surveillance. As of yet, none of them had been infiltrated by agents which was probably a prudent move. Since he had been discovered, everyone who showed an interest in joining the group was carefully scrutinized and to ensure loyalty, the names and addresses of family members were taken, the threat unspoken.\n\nCarl rubbed his now useless legs as he looked out of the window. As of yet, no one knew why he risked his life to go into the prison and it was going to stay that way until the day he died and he hoped that day came after Lawrence Goodman had taken his last breath.\n\n********\n\nSally was making cookies when the phone rang. She quickly wiped the flour from her hands and answered the phone.\n\n\"How are you darlin?\" a deep voice resonated in her ear.\n\nSally froze. Her mouth had gone dry.\n\n\"You still there darlin?\" Lawrence asked his voice filled with amusement at the reaction that he knew he as getting.\n\n\"Lawrence?\" Sally whispered.\n\n\"It's me.,\" he said cheerfully, \"how are you and the babies?\"\n\n\"Fine... how are you?\" Sally asked not knowing what else to say.\n\n\"Good and looking forward to seeing you and my kids in a couple of years.\" Lawrence replied.\n\nSally felt her stomach drop; she read between the lines and knew what he meant. He had just threatened her but covertly, she would never be able to prove anything.\n\n\"How is it that you can call me?\" she asked.\n\n\"I've been a good boy, staying out of trouble and all.\" he replied, \"Calling you is a little gift from my friend the warden. Merry Christmas darlin'\" he said and hung up.\n\n*******\n\nLawrence hung up and chuckled. He had enjoyed his little game with the cheating bitch known as his wife. He knew all about the man that lived with her, it was none other than the man who had put him prison. He didn't know if she was fucking him or not but it didn't matter, she was giving food and comfort to the enemy. He almost told her that he knew about the man but decided to save it for another time; it would give him something to look forward to the next time he called her.\n\nIt saddened him that he had to consider the mother of his children a traitor and that she would have to die a traitor's death. However, it was war and he had to rescue his children from the type of thinking that was threatening the country. He only hoped that he wouldn't be too late, \"I should have listened to you Kenny.\" he murmured as he walked back to his cell.\n\n********\n\nWilliam found Sally still gripping the phone and shaking.\n\n\"Sally? What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"La.... Lawrence, he just called. He wants to kill me.\"\n\n\"Did he say that?\" William asked.\n\n\"No... he just said that he was looking forward to visiting me.\"\n\nWilliam took the phone out of Sally's hand and placed it on its cradle.\n\n\"Sally, listen to me,\" he said softly, \"I won't let anything happen to you or the kids, and you have my word on that.\"\n\nShe nodded and wiped the tears from her cheeks with her hands.\n\n\"I'm scared.\" Sally confessed as she felt William's arms go around her.\n\nAfter she had gone to bed, William called Nick.\n\nIt was time to be proactive.\n\n********\n\nAbby looked over at Ralph, he just didn't look quite right to her although he insisted that he was fine. She offered to take him to the doctor and wasn't surprised when he refused.\n\n\"I'm not taking no for an answer you stubborn old coot!\" she snapped, \"Now get your jacket and lets go!\"\n\n\"Abby, I'm....\"\n\nThat was all he got out before he stumbled and fell to the floor. \n\n\"Ralph!\" Abby screamed.\n\nHe looked up at her with panic in his eyes and tried to speak but all that came out was gibberish, the left side of his face had a marked droop to it.\n\nAbby tried to help him up by grabbing his left arm and was horrified to find it completely flaccid. Not knowing what else to do, she called Kenji and hysterically tried to tell him what happened.\n\n\"Abby, calm down and tell me what is happening.\" Kenji said.\n\nAs soon as he had the whole story, he calmly assured Abby that he and Joel would be right over.\n\n\"Keep him comfortable until we get there.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Kenji and Joel were at the house and examining Ralph.\n\n\"He had a stroke,\" Kenji said, \"We have to take him to the hospital.\"\n\nBetween the two of them, they got Ralph to the car and laid him in the back seat. Kenji laid a hand on Ralph's right arm and gave a gentle squeeze before getting into the driver's seat and taking off. Abby made several quick phone calls before getting into her own car and following.\n\n\"Don you dare die on me you old fool!\" she whispered as she drove off.\n\n*******\n\nNick and Hana went to Kenji and Patricia's house to wait with Patricia and the children. By the time they got there, Patricia was a basket case. Ralph was like another father to her, she didn't want to lose him, and as much as she wanted to be at the hospital, she knew that the children shouldn't go and forced herself to wait for word from Kenji. \n\n\"He's a tough old man, he'll be fine.\" Nick assured her.\n\nPatricia wasn't so sure about that. She looked in Kenji's medical books and read that if Ralph didn't die, he could suffer permanent damages from the stroke. Knowing Ralph as she did, she knew that he would rather die than have someone take care of him or live as an invalid.\n\nShe offered up a silent prayer for him that if he lived, the damage would be minimal and if the damage was severe, that god be kind and give Ralph what he would want.\n\n******\n\nPaul Mynt met them at the hospital and was able to expedite things by getting Ralph seen immediately and into a room. He confirmed Kenji's diagnosis.\n\n\"He's had a massive stroke, how much damage will be permanent? It's too soon to tell but there will be some damage of that I'm sure.\"\n\nKenji put an arm around Abby, he was thinking the same thing that Patricia was thinking and the same thing that Abby was thinking, Ralph would sooner die than be dependent on someone for his care. That all of them would gladly take care of him wouldn't matter.\n\n\"Can we see him?\" Abby asked.\n\n\"Sure but don't stay too long, he needs to rest.\" Paul said gently.\n\nAbby, Kenji and Joel went into the room to find Ralph already asleep. Each of the men touched Ralph's arm lightly and then left Abby alone with him. She bent down and kissed his right cheek, her tears wetting it, \"Come on you old fool, fight this... I... we love you.\"\n\nAs soon as she left the room, Ralph opened his right eye and let the tears fall freely, \"I love you too,\" he thought not wanting to hear the garbled version of the words and then he closed his eyes."
