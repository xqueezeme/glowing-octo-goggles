        "The next few days were a challenge for Paul. Life continued on as if nothing had happened. He slept, he ate, he worked, he drank, but beneath it all, his mind was constantly distracted.\n\nAt any given moment, he'd find himself lost again in those unexpected encounters. His thoughts would wander back to the feeling of Craig cumming hard, deep inside of him, or the taste of his cock in his mouth.\n\nHe was obsessed. The sex he'd had during the last couple of weeks was unlike anything he'd ever experienced. His mind was suddenly open to a world of new possibilities. There was no point denying what had happened. He enjoyed it. Immensely!\n\nAt the same time, though, he was very deliberate about how he processed these thoughts. He enjoyed the physicality of it all. The way the particular combination of touches and sensations made him feel was incredible. His body was responding to a set of stimuli.\n\nIt didn't mean anything about his sexuality. He had no control over what his body liked. A set of inputs resulted in a particular response. Any man must feel the same way given the same set of inputs. It definitely didn't make him gay!\n\nThe continuation of their 'clothing optional' dress code, though, made this a difficult line to hold. The morning after their last encounter, he'd climbed out of bed on a sweltering hot day, reached to grab his clothes and then stopped himself. What did he have to hide now? There was no reason to feel embarrassed by his body. Craig had already seen literally every part of it now.\n\nHe stepped naked out of his room only to pass a similarly bare Craig in the narrow hallway. Their brief nod and muttered 'morning' did little to mask the palpable electricity that passed between them as their bodies nearly touched. In 2 steps, he was hard as a redgum trunk and desperate for a place to hide his arousal. This was going to be difficult!\n\nBy the middle of the week, Paul was desperate to get a load off. A simple breeze blowing past his groin was enough to have him hard and leaking, and he was pretty sure his efforts to hide his arousal had been unsuccessful.\n\nNeither of them had mentioned what had happened though. The intensity of their last sexual encounter had shocked them both. To talk about it would be to acknowledge that they'd both enjoyed it and that seemed to be a step too far.\n\nTheir conversations were stilted and their interactions uncomfortable. They still went through the motions of their usual cohabitation with beers, gaming and banter, but it felt somehow fake.\n\nThe result was that Paul felt reluctant to initiate another encounter. He didn't want to seem too keen, and by extension too gay. He watched Craig for some sort of invitation, but it was hard while they were also mostly avoiding eye contact.\n\nGetting into bed on Wednesday night, cock hard and balls aching once again, he finally admitted defeat. Reaching down with his faithful right hand, he started to rub one out, searching his internal spank bank for something other than his cock sliding into Craig's arse.\n\nStartled by the opening door, he froze, turning his head towards Craig's backlit naked figure in the doorway. He watched as Craig walked wordlessly towards his bed, climbing on to the end.\n\nCraig pulled the sheets slowly off him, exposing his naked form. Eyes locked on Paul's, he leaned down and grasped Paul's cock in his right hand, stroking him with a firm grip.\n\nContinuing to lean in, his mouth drew closer to Paul's glistening cock, opening his lips and finally taking him inside.\n\nPaul moaned as Craig's lips slid along his shaft, the blissful friction such a welcome sensation. He absently played with his nipples as he lay back and accepted the unexpected blow job.\n\nCraig cupped his balls with one hand, his other wrapped around the base of Paul's cock, stroking him in time with his oral stimulation.\n\nPaul looked down. The dim light coming through the door was just enough to see Craig's head bobbing up and down in his lap. He rested an encouraging hand on the back of his head.\n\nCraig worked his jaw, sucking hard on the turgid cock as he stroked. Paul could already feel an orgasm approaching as he began to push his hips forward to meet Craig's advancing lips.\n\nHis moans grew with intensity, audibly sounding out his pleasure as he was stroked by his mate. Craig's hand massaging his balls seemed to readying them to explode. The familiar flame was lit inside his pelvis, stoked with every thrust into Craig's mouth.\n\nWith arms spread wide, he gripped the mattress cover as he began to writhe around. Craig followed wherever he went, relentless in his stimulation.\n\nPaul thrust up into his mouth again and again, finally bringing the orgasm to the surface. With a cry he exploded with a thrusting push deep into Craig's mouth. His balls unloaded for the first time in days, filling Craig's mouth, and overflowing, seeping out between his lips, and dripping into his lap.\n\nFinally the tide receded once again, and his muscles slowly relaxed, one by one. With a slurping suck, Craig slid up and off his cock, swallowing with a satisfied smile and a lick of his lips.\n\nWithout a word, he crawled forward towards Paul's post orgasmic form and took his own cock in hand. With one hand stroking a nipple, he jerked himself hard and fast, clearly already near to orgasm.\n\nPaul could barely see more than a silhouette and some movement, but he watched fascinated as Craig brought himself quickly to orgasm.\n\nWith a quiet, grunting moan, Craig climaxed, his body jerking with uncoordinated movement. Paul felt the warm liquid slop out across his spent cock and balls, running down his sack and between his legs.\n\nHe lay still, revelling in the sensation of his mates cum as Craig squeezed out the last drop. Rising silently, Craig climbed off the bed and left the room, looking back briefly at the door before he walked away.\n\nSlightly dazed, Paul lay there for a second. The slow ooze of cum rolling down beneath his balls served as proof that he hadn't dreamt the encounter, but still he was amazed. Clearly the dynamic of their friendship had shifted permanently now.\n\nPerplexed, but equally pleased, he rolled over and pulled up the sheet, resolving to clean up the mess the following day. He was asleep within minutes.\n\n********************\n\nPaul woke the following morning with a sense of resolve. He needed to repay the favour as soon as he had the opportunity. The quicker he did that, the sooner he'd get another blow job like last night.\n\nHe tried to ignore his own physical response to the thought of sucking Craig's dick again. This had nothing to do with attraction, he told himself. It was all about getting what he wanted.\n\nPaul found himself constantly watching Craig's junk, looking to see if there were any signs of arousal. He wasn't sure if Craig had noticed him watching, but he did certainly seem to be parading around a lot more than usual.\n\nHe was surprised with how quickly he became fascinated with Craig's genitalia. The variation in appearance from moment to moment actually surprised him. At times it seemed shrivelled and retracted, almost hiding from the outside world. At others it was swollen and heavy, swinging proudly as Craig walked by.\n\nOn reflection it was not really a surprise after all, given his own cock did exactly the same thing. This was just the first time he'd ever watched it play out in real time before him.\n\nThankfully he didn't have to wait long for Craig to show some arousal. It seemed that their sex drives had both ramped up and they were as horny as 18-year-olds once again.\n\nHe walked into the kitchen one afternoon, ready for some caffeine to stop himself from dropping off to sleep. Walking through the door, he noticed Craig already there, flicking through his phone while he waited for the kettle to boil.\n\nAs he took in the sight of Craig's naked form leaning back against the bench, his eyes flicked automatically to his groin. His hefty member stood swollen and half-hard, pointing out just under the horizontal. The smooth head of his cock just peeked through the retracting skin, revealing a glistening, clear drop of fluid at the tip.\n\nCraig looked up as Paul entered, their eyes meeting. He made no attempt to hide his growing erection.\n\nHolding his gaze, Paul walked forward, feigning confidence, and slowly lowered himself to his knees before him. He reached up and grabbed a hold of Craig's now fully erect cock, gripping it firmly at the base.\n\nThis time, he was not burdened by the uncertainty and awkwardness of the first time he'd taken his cock. His senses entirely aware, he took in everything in an instant. The thick, meaty weight of the cock in his hand; the two perfectly proportioned balls, hanging loose in their sack below. His hair was trimmed just enough to prevent bushiness, without making him appear overly manscaped.\n\nStill gripping the hard cock, feeling it pulse in his hand, he leaned forward and buried his face in his crotch, nestling in to his balls and groin, breathing in this most masculine of aromas. He reached out with his tongue, tickling Craig's sack gently as he stroked his hand up along the length of his cock.\n\nHe felt Craig's knees buckle just for an instant, before he grabbed a hold of the bench, holding him up. His balls twitched in response, and a soft gasp escaped Craig's lips.\n\nLooking up, Paul saw another drop of clear liquid ooze lazily from the tip of Craig's cock. Drawing the thick rod towards his mouth, he reached out with a broad tongue, and ran it up the underside of the sensitive glans, collecting the fluid as he went.\n\nHe savoured the impossibly smooth fluid in his mouth, awestruck that such an excretion could taste so incredible. Both sweet and salty, the fluid carried the same masculine elements that he was inhaling from Craig's crotch.\n\nIt was a taste that drove him wild. He needed more of it, needed to experience that same combination of satisfaction and excitement. That such a tiny drop of fluid excited such a response in him caused his mind to reel.\n\nAs he swallowed the precious cock nectar, his own cock twitched in response, the taste feeding his own excitement.\n\nDesperate for another drop, he dove back onto the waiting cock once again, sliding his lips down along the shaft, then back up again, milking from it what fluid he could.\n\nRapidly, instinctively, he began to understand what Craig really liked. I lick here, a finger in the right place, and he was rewarded instantly with a muscular twitch of the engorged organ and another drop of his sweet nectar.\n\nHe was insatiable as he chased his next hit, slurping and salivating over Craig's willing cock. His own rigid dick leaked copiously on the floor with each reward.\n\nNever before had his own pleasure been so tightly wound up in someone else's. Sure, he'd always tried to give his female partners a good time, but mostly that was to help his reputation and his chances at a second fuck. He'd never found such pleasure in providing pleasure.\n\nHe began to notice Craig getting more excited as he drew nearer to orgasm. Not wanting to slay his golden goose, Paul slowed down, desperate to keep his dripping tap from bursting.\n\nEdging Craig along the knife's edge, Paul teased him, alternating between stimulation and deprivation. Quickly he found the perfect pace to maximise his sweet pre-cum secretion without pushing him over the cliff.\n\nFinally, though, Craig could take no more. Pushing himself away from the bench that he was leaning on, he stood upright, resting a hand on either side of Paul's head.\n\nTesting him out, he slowly slid his cock deep into Paul's throat, sliding down into his gullet as Paul coughed and gagged. Pulling out, he pushed forward again, forcing Paul's throat to open to the unexpected invasion.\n\nFinding his rhythm now, and beginning to lose control to the sensations overtaking him, Craig began to fuck Paul's mouth hard, slamming his cock into his throat.\n\nPaul gripped Craig's arse with one hand, hanging on for dear life as his throat was invaded over and over. His eyes streamed as he opened his throat, accepting the offering gratefully. He was vaguely aware of his other hand madly stroking his own cock as he became a vessel for Craig's pleasure.\n\nHis eyes rolled back, and his awareness dimmed. He was nothing but a hole for Craig to fuck. He existed only for his mate's pleasure. This was what he was built for.\n\nHis body responded quickly as his skull was fucked, nerve endings twitching and buzzing. Craig's power overwhelmed him as his cock rammed again and again into his mouth.\n\nA slurping, moaning cacophony filled the room as their raucous sex sounded. He could feel the tension building up in Craig as his pace increased. He stroked himself furiously as Craig finally pulled out, pulling his head back by the hair and gripping his cock in a firm grasp.\n\nCraig jerked madly as his orgasm overtook him. Paul watched as his balls contracted up to his pelvis, ready to spill their seed. Transfixed he saw the engorged purple head of Craig's cock splay even further, his piss slit opening at the last instant.\n\nIn slow motion, he saw the miraculous eruption of cum shoot forth, arcing over his head before landing in his hair and across his face. Paul was shocked by the force of it as Craig shot again and again over him, splashing cum over his face, neck and chest.\n\nCum ran down his face, dripping into his mouth as his tongue lapped it up from his chin. The orgasm seemed to continue down through him, like a single event, rushing from his tongue, through his body and finally out of his own cock.\n\nHe leaned back furiously jerking his cock as he exploded out onto the kitchen floor, his seed mixing with the remnants of Craig's eruption on the lino.\n\nPanting he sat back, hand still lazily stroking his cock, as cum ran in streams down his torso. He wiped it from himself, licking the pearly fluid hungrily from his fingers. There was no hiding anymore; no pretending that this was just a simple arrangement.\n\nCraig looked down at his cum-covered face and smiled, patting him on the cheek. He threw him a tea towel as he walked over to the fridge. His half-flaccid cock swung, flicking the last drops of cum against a cupboard door.\n\nPulling a beer out of the fridge, he handed it down to Paul.\n\n\"You look kind of thirsty.\" He said wryly, before grabbing one himself and walking into the lounge room.\n\n********************\n\nThe following days were a bit of a blur. The awkwardness of their arrangement had been lifted by this latest encounter. The resolution of their sex life, albeit with some major adjustments, seemed to have inflamed their libidos. It was like they were horny 17-year-olds all over again.\n\nEvery erection was met with a willing mouth as they carefully tended to each other's needs. Both men found it easier to continue the charade that the more blow jobs they gave the more they would receive.\n\nBoth men knew it for the charade that it was.\n\nOne afternoon late in the week, Paul came home early from work. Already unbuttoning his shirt, he wandered towards the kitchen to grab a celebratory beer.\n\nAs he got to the door, he saw Craig sitting at the kitchen table, his laptop open before him. A carefully ironed business shirt covered his torso, while his naked lower half was clearly visible beneath the table.\n\nCraig looked up as he stood at the door, blushing furiously. The all-too-familiar sounds of a Zoom meeting emanated from the laptop, explaining Craig's half-formal attire.\n\nSensing an opportunity to have some fun at his expense, Paul grinned back at him, out of sight of the webcam, and continued to slowly unbutton his shirt. In mock striptease-style, he slowly removed his clothes piece by piece, swinging them around his head and throwing them flamboyantly on the kitchen floor.\n\nHooking his thumbs into the waistband of his underwear, he turned and bent, legs straight, slowly sliding them down and exposing his naked arse.\n\nStraightening again, he looked back over his shoulder, an attempt at a coy grin on his lips. Slapping himself on the arse, he allowed his underwear to fall to the floor, before turning around again, flaccid cock swinging.\n\nCraig was doing his best to ignore his antics, focusing intently on the computer screen and nodding in apparent agreement with whatever was being said in the meeting. His throbbing erection under the table was impossible to hide though.\n\nGrinning impishly, Paul tiptoed up to the table, careful not to make a sound that could be heard by the other meeting attendees. Slowly, he lowered himself down onto his knees and crawled forward beneath the table, carefully moving the chairs out of the way.\n\nKnowing what was about to come, Craig tried kicking him out of the way. Being unable to move his top half, lest his colleagues noticed something going on, it was easy for Paul to evade his feeble attempts.\n\nPushing his way towards him, Paul knelt between his knees, looking up at his blushing face from beneath the table. Craig didn't dare glance down at him, knowing what was about to come. Resigned to it, he carefully angled the webcam up a little further, and pushed his chair back a fraction further.\n\nPaul held himself up with Craig's knees under each arm. He reached forward with one hand and grabbed a firm hold of his erection. He felt, more than heard, Craig's sighing relaxation as he rested back on the chair.\n\nStaring up at his face, Paul quickly took his cock into his mouth, gently tickling the underside with the tip of his tongue. The instant hit of precum told him that Craig was incredibly turned on by this pseudo-public encounter.\n\nQuickly swallowing the length of his rod, he sucked hard, careful not to break the seal of lip to cock, so as not to let out a tell-tale slurp.\n\nIt was difficult to get a rhythm in the cramped space that he had, and he could barely lift his head out of Craig's lap without hitting the underside of the table.\n\nKeeping the head of his cock firmly gripped in his mouth, he sucked hard, massaging the sensitive glans with his tongue. He stroked the remaining part of his shaft with one hand, tickling his balls with the other.\n\nCraig rested a hand on the back of his neck, encouraging him along despite his initial protest.\n\nSuddenly Craig's leg's tensed and he gripped the back of Paul's neck in a vice-like grip. Pausing for a moment, Paul realised he'd just been asked a question.\n\nIt was difficult to stifle a laugh with a cock in his mouth, but he managed, looking up at Craig as he tried to appear serious and thoughtful. Paul wondered if they could see the sweat beading on his forehead as he struggled to respond.\n\n\"Well really, I think we'd be better...ahh...running that as a pilot now and...mmmm...assessing it's impacts first before we get ourselves over COMmitted.\"\n\n\u2003\n\nPaul laughed silently as he punctuated Craig's reply with an extra tickle of his cock, or a finger exploring behind his sack.\n\nFinally Craig relaxed back into his chair once again, the focus finally moving away from him. He twisted Paul's ear in silent retaliation.\n\nUncomfortable with his cramped position and ready to wrap things up, Paul quickly redoubled his efforts, sucking expertly on the end of Craig's leaking cock, stroking him rapidly with a firm grip.\n\nHe could feel Craig responding beneath him, trying to stop himself from pushing up into Paul's willing mouth. Forcing himself to stay still, Craig was a model of tension, every muscle rigid.\n\nIt wasn't long before Paul could feel him starting to shift as he fought to stay still against his impending orgasm. He worked his jaw, massaging his cock with his lips and tongue, stroking him towards climax. Craig's legs pressed down firmly into the chair as he forced himself to remain still.\n\nPulling back at the very last minute, Paul looked up at Craig's face as his freed cock slapped up against his belly. Craig's face was beet red, his breathing shallow and silent as he gripped the table like a vice.",
        "An orgasmic spasm rippled up from his balls to the tip of his cock as it erupted, cum flowing freely onto his shirt and running down into his lap. His body was entirely rigid, his convulsing cock the only part of him moving.\n\nFinally the convulsions slowed, and Craig started breathing once again, the colour draining from his face. Paul watched as he checked himself out in the webcam, breathing a sigh of relief as he realised that everything had happened out of shot.\n\nPatting him playfully on the knee, Paul slowly edged his way back out from under the table, leaving his mate to sit out the rest of the meeting with his cum-covered shirt just out of view.\n\n********************\n\nAs Saturday night rolled around once again, Paul and Craig predictably found themselves back on the couch, naked as always, and watching another movie. Amazed at how far things had come over a short time span, he couldn't shake a vague sense of uncertainty.\n\nThe sharp up-turn of his sex life was a welcome change to Paul as he thought about the events of the recent weeks. At the same time, though, he was troubled. Early on, it had been easy to chalk it up to two horny guys with no access to women. Increasingly now, he was finding himself becoming obsessed with Craig.\n\nTheir interactions had become so frequent now, that he hadn't had to jerk off in more than a week. When he closed his eyes at night, it was Craig's body that he saw. He even had a couple of sex dreams with Craig playing a leading role.\n\nThe question on his mind, constantly, was whether it was developing into something more serious. And if it was, well, that changed things a lot!\n\nAlso, if he was honest, it was hard to deny the background anxiety that maybe Craig wasn't having these same thoughts.\n\nSince their first carefully negotiated foray into anal sex, their encounters had remained steadfastly oral, and carefully transactional. It seemed easier, somehow, and while Paul desperately wanted to feel that incredible sensation again, he didn't want to seem too keen.\n\nSo, they stuck to the simple yet effective technique of sucking each other off. No intimacy required, and certainly no kissing. If they swallowed some cum in the process, well, that was just the cost of doing business.\n\nThey joked light-heartedly as they drank and watched another predictable end-of-the-world film. It was amazing how often these films hit exactly the same formula!\n\nWho needed an excuse for the buff, white, divorced-but-still-in-love-with-his-ex protagonist to take his shirt off anyway? And boy were those pants tight. Wonder what that bulge would look like uncovered and hard. Maybe he'd bend over and spread those tight buns, just waiting for someone to come along and fuck him.\n\nPaul shook himself out of the horny little trance he'd ventured into. He looked down to see his hard-on at its rigid best, still instinctively trying to hide it.\n\nCraig saw him shift and looked over, his eyes moving almost instantly down to his lap. He rested a hand on his thigh, briefly and looked him in the eye, saying nothing.\n\nPaul leaned back, ready for Craig to drop down into his lap and take him in his mouth. Instead, he was surprised as he leaned away from Paul, lying down sideways along the couch. He drew his top leg up towards his chest, resting the palm of his hand on his arse.\n\nPaul looked down at him in surprise. His arse was on full display, the muscular globes of his glutes, dusted with a fine fuzz of hair. The tight opening was just visible between his splayed cheeks. His junk was pressed beneath him into the towel on the couch.\n\nHe licked his lips as Craig looked back at him, still silent. With no doubt about the invitation, Paul didn't hesitate. He gave himself a couple of strokes, smearing the leaking precum over the head of his cock. He spat into the palm of his hand, adding that to his natural lubricant.\n\nHe took a moment to reposition, straightening Craig's lower leg along the couch, and straddling him on his knees. He ran his hand down along Craig's flexed thigh, his fingers finding and exploring his waiting hole.\n\nHe spat in his hand again, rubbing the saliva around Craig's opening, lubricating and relaxing him at the same time. His twisted, muscular body looked somehow even more masculine as he lay there offering his arse to Paul.\n\nWith one steadying hand on Craig's thigh, he guided his cock with his other hand, pushing carefully, but insistently against the clenched opening.\n\nHe was surprised as Craig opened almost immediately, swallowing the head of Paul's cock inside the tight, muscular tunnel. They both gasped in unison.\n\nPausing for just a second, Paul pushed slowly forward again, advancing slowly by consistently deep into his pelvis. With a single, insistent push, he was fully inside him, his pelvis pushed firmly against Craig's arse.\n\nSomeone's been practicing, he thought absently to himself.\n\nHe began slowly to slide in and out, relishing the sensation of his balls sliding along Craig's lower leg. He gripped hard on his flexed thigh, his other hand steadying himself on the back of the couch.\n\nPaul moaned as the tight tunnel into Craig's pelvis gripped firmly around his cock. He rubbed his hands over Craig's twisted torso, feeling the taught muscle beneath his grip. He was struck by the sheer size of his body, the muscular bulk of the form that he was fucking.\n\nUntil now, his preference had been for women on the slim side. Fucking them had always been an act of power and domination. He could pick them up with ease, and throw them onto the bed. Often it seemed like he could wrap his two hands around their waist as he fucked them.\n\nFucking Craig, though, was a very different act. He was strong and muscular, as heavy as Paul was himself. They were similarly matched in strength. Sex was more like a wrestle, a meeting of equals.\n\nAnd it was so fucking hot!\n\nHe held firm to Craig's pelvis as he started to fuck him harder. He watched his face as he slammed his cock deep into his pelvis. Craig grunted with every thrust, biting his lower lip and looking over his shoulder at Paul towering over him.\n\nPaul was covered in sweat as his heart rate rapidly increased. He watched closely as he adjusted his angle, keen to find Craig's pleasure spot as they fucked.\n\nFinally, the look of bliss washed over Craig's face as Paul brushed against that hidden bundle of nerve endings again and again. He adjusted his pace again, sending long, slow strokes deep inside him as they fucked.\n\nCraig clamped rhythmically against his invading cock, massaging him as they fucked. It felt amazing. He could feel himself streaming clear precum deep inside of him as the head of his rock hard cock was squeezed and stroked.\n\nSensing that Craig wanted to move, Paul slid down onto the couch, lying behind him as they spooned, cock still buried in arse. Holding Craig's bent leg up in the air, he kept up his hard pace, sliding himself in and out with a slapping force.\n\nCraig reached down and gripped his rock-hard cock firmly in his hand, stroking himself as Paul fucked him. His eyes were closed now, a low, guttural growl emanating from him throat, punctuated with every thrust.\n\nIt took only another minute or two for Craig to start to moan with more energy. Leaning over him as he thrust into him, Paul watched as he stroked his cock, jerking frantically as he brought forth his orgasm.\n\nWith a loud moan, Craig's whole body convulsed, shaking uncontrollably as he jerked. A huge wad of cum short forth from his cock, spraying over the towel and over the edge onto the carpet. Paul continued to fuck him as he shot streams of hot white cum.\n\nThe convulsions rippled through his body, and Paul felt the muscular contractions squeezing around his cock. Finally coming down from his orgasm, Craig began to go limp in Paul's grasp.\n\nKnowing he wasn't far away from his own climax, Paul didn't want to let it go. Rolling Craig onto his belly, cum smearing beneath them both, he climbed on top, his thighs squeezing Paul's legs together tightly.\n\nWith better leverage now, he fucked him hard, the wet, slapping sound of their sex echoing through the room. His balls slapped against Craig's arse, their bodies slick with sweat and cum.\n\nHe grunted with the exertion, one hand on the back of Craig's neck. Craig lay there, submitting. He moaned with every powerful thrust, rocking his pelvis back to meet him.\n\nThe spark of Paul's climax was lit in no time, the muscular form of his mate submitting beneath him adding fuel to the rapidly spreading fire.\n\nDesperate to fill him with cum, he clenched all his muscles, his whole body tense and ready to explode.\n\nHe could hear words, and suddenly realised they were coming from his own mouth.\n\n\"Yeah, fuck, yeah, god, take it, fuck...\" A stream of profanity flew from him as his pleasure built, spreading through his pelvis.\n\nWith a tightening of his balls, he could feel the end approaching. He slid his arms under Craig, gripping onto his shoulders, the full length of their bodies together.\n\nHis thrusts became completely uncoordinated as his orgasm took over. He cried out, thrusting his cock deep inside Craig as cum erupted from him with a rippling ecstasy. Again his body convulsed and again he erupted inside of him. The cum continued shooting forth, filling his mate up with his seed.\n\nThe ripples of pleasure seemed to ricochet through his body in slowly diminishing waves for some time. Still buried deep inside Craig, he collapsed on top of him, their slick bodies sliding against each other.\n\nHe rested his head on Craig's back, slowly catching his breath. Craig shifted slightly, and taking the cue, Paul lifted himself gingerly from him, cock twitching as he slid free.\n\nStanding from the couch, he walked over to the kitchen and grabbed a couple of beers as was their custom now.\n\nCraig sat up as he walked back in, sitting himself up on the towel-covered couch. Cum covered his belly and groin, and no doubt leaked from him as he sat there with a nonchalant air.\n\nPaul handed him a beer and sat beside him. Suppressing the urge to wrap an arm around his shoulders or to lean against him, he grabbed the remote.\n\n\"I guess we need to wind the movie back a little, hey?\" he said lightly. \"Don't want to miss any of the storyline.\"\n\n********************\n\nPaul was increasingly struggling with the strange juxtaposition of their intense physical intimacy with the interim return to their usual chummy mateship. They were both clearly directing energy into not discussing their burgeoning sex life as if that would somehow make it all more real.\n\nPaul knew that things were changing in him regarding his feelings towards Craig. It was no longer just sex, but he couldn't decide what else it was. He hated the uncertainty and longed to be able to work it out with Craig one way or another. He could never do that, though, without making it clear to him how he felt.\n\nIt felt like a ticking time bomb between them as they went about their life. The question was always there, hanging between them.\n\nPaul stood in the bathroom a few mornings later, wiping the shaving cream from his chin. He cast a critical eye over his naked reflection, wondering if he'd ever have been able to attract someone like Craig if not for the pandemic.\n\nA movement in the corner of the mirror caught his eye. Nearly out of sight in the darkened hallway, Craig stood naked, watching him in the mirror.\n\nLike a flash, the thought crossed Paul's mind. What if he just turned around, walked right up to him and kissed him, fair on the mouth. Surely that would tell him he was interested in more than just sex.\n\nIn an instant though, the thought had gone again. He could never bring himself to do it and risk rejection. He didn't want to admit he had feelings for another guy. It was a door once open that could never again be closed.\n\n\u2003\n\nMaking an instant decision, he decided that he couldn't rock the boat. This arrangement was too good to risk.\n\nLooking directly at Craig in the mirror, he bent forward, leaning down on the bench top. He stepped his feet apart a little, tilting his pelvis up to show Craig his hole. Casting his eye over the bench, he reached for the tube of moisturiser, squirting it out onto 2 fingers.\n\nSlowly, he reached down, between his legs and smeared the cream across his freshly washed hole. Keeping eye contact with Craig, he slowly slid on finger through the tight opening, smearing the cream inside himself.\n\nAs Craig stepped forward, Paul could almost taste the thick, clear fluid dripping lazily from the end of his rock-hard cock. He licked his lips as he finger fucked himself, anticipating the much larger rod that would soon be dilating his sphincter.\n\nCraig wasted no time. Spitting into his hand, he rubbed the spit and precum quickly over the end of his cock. Resting one hand reassuringly on Paul's hip, he lined up against his waiting hole, pressing against the tight resistance with the hard head of his cock.\n\nWith a brief moment of concentration, Paul allowed himself to relax, opening to enable Craig's entry. It happened in one long, slow slide, his full length plunging into Paul's waiting pelvis.\n\nPaul gasped in shock as he was suddenly filled. He gripped the edge of the bench tight, as his knees nearly buckled beneath him. Craig gripped his hips with both hands, holding him up as he rested deep inside him for a brief moment.\n\nPaul breathed as his arse accommodated to the sudden intrusion. He could feel every twitching heart beat through Craig's rigid pole, his own hole twitching its regular response.\n\nThe moment of respite was only brief. Craig was clearly not in the mood for a slow, sensual fuck. Sensing Paul's relaxation, he gave him a slap on the arse, before pulling his cock nearly all the way out and ramming it home with force.\n\nA grunt escaped Paul's mouth before he even knew it had happened. The glancing blow across his prostate rippled through him as his arse twitched once again.\n\nBent at 90 degrees, he braced himself against the bench as Craig rammed into him again and then again. Their pelvises slammed together with a wet slap, the sound joining Paul's audible grunt with each thrusting blow.\n\nHe looked up in the mirror, seeing Craig's muscular figure towering over him as he allowed himself to be dominated. Craig fucked him vigorously, ploughing into his arse with an unexpected urgency.\n\nPaul watched the expressions on Craig's face as he fucked him, a combination of pleasure and concentration.\n\nHe turned his focus to his pelvis again, concentrating on the buzzing pleasure emanating from his prostate. He found that the more he concentrated on it, the bigger the pleasure ripples became, a tiny spark growing quickly into a burning fire.\n\nHe tilted his pelvis, allowing Craig deeper access to his pelvis with each thrust, but also increasing the pressure against his gland. He was rock hard, his cock standing straight up against his belly. For once, though, it was just a passenger on this journey, no longer in the driver's seat.\n\nHe glanced back up at Craig again. His eyes were closed now, his head tipped back a little towards the ceiling. Sweat was beading on his forehead as he gripped tight onto Paul's pelvis.\n\nHands still gripping the bench top, Paul turned his whole focus towards the burning pleasure deep in his pelvis. He could sense a corresponding tingle in the tip of his cock, but it was just a tiny drop in a raging ocean.\n\nThe waves of pleasure amplified with every thrusting blow against his prostate. His focus seemed to build it even further. He was letting out a constant low moan now, his mind blanking out to everything but the sensation of Craig's cock moving inside of him.\n\nHis moans grew louder as the pleasure took all control from him. Nothing existed except his pelvis and Craig's cock, joined together in a burning ecstasy.\n\nThe tingling pleasure in his neglected cock started to grow, echoing the ecstasy deep inside him. He felt the familiar beginnings of an orgasm, as the sensations in his cock and pelvis slowly merged into one.\n\nHe felt his balls contract even as Craig continued to ram into him with a frenzied intensity. He gripped the bench, as if trying to rip it off the wall as his cock swelled even further.\n\nHe moaned louder, ramming himself back against Craig's insistent thrusts. Completely untouched his cock began to twitch, the burning pleasure inside of him searching for any exit.\n\nAs the orgasmic trance overcame him, he cried out loudly, a moaning, guttural yawp. His cock twitched and bounced beneath him as he came, cum erupting forth in a long pissing stream that sprayed across the floor.\n\nFor the second time, his knees nearly gave way, only Craig's firm grip holding him up. His frenzied fucking didn't slow at all as he chased his nut, slamming home again and again into Paul's twitching arse.\n\nPaul watched him through the mirror as his senses slowly returned. Drenched in sweat now, Craig had a look of intense concentration, seemingly oblivious to the guy he was fucking.\n\nHis grip tightened as his orgasm finally arrived. Arching his back further, Craig rammed himself deep and hard, burying his cock as far into Paul's belly as he could. He stood there in that position as he came, his spasming cock spewing cum deep inside Paul's canal.\n\nHe gave a few slow thrusts as the torrent finally subsided, his cock pulling the cum from Paul's hole, and leaving it dripping down the inside of his thigh.\n\nWith one hand on Paul's back, he slid slowly out, slapping him on the arse as he finally popped free. He picked Paul's towel off the ground and wiped his cock, grinning at Paul's panting face through the mirror. Without a further word, he turned and walked from the bathroom.\n\n********************\n\nThese random, sex-only encounters did nothing to ease Paul's mind as the days in lockdown wore on. As the virus numbers began to fall in the community, he worried about what might happen when lockdown lifted. Would Craig want nothing more to do with him once he could hook up with women as he had before?\n\nHe began to watch the news updates with a perverse sense of perspective, almost rooting for the numbers to increase.\n\nTo try and break the boredom of being locked up inside, Paul and Craig had taken to walking most weekends. They lived in an area of the city close to the river, with a running track winding its way towards the CBD.\n\nOne warm Thursday afternoon, they found themselves out making the most of the sunshine. Barely noticing the gathering clouds overhead, they continued on, chatting amicably about nothing of significance.\n\nThe first heavy drops of rain hit against them, breaking into the conversation unexpectedly. They both stopped, looking up at the clouds.\n\n\"We should head back, I guess.\" The words were barely out of Craig's mouth before the skies opened and a torrential summer downpour hit them.\n\nThey both laughed, and turned for home, running through the streets, drenched to the bone within a few seconds.\n\nTheir run for home soon turned into a race, pushing past each other at the corners, both suddenly with something to prove. At the entrance to the flat, soaking wet and badly out of breath, they jostled to be first through the door.\n\nBursting his way in, Craig won the battle. He stood in the entrance, dripping wet as Paul followed, immediately after. They wrestled, playfully, elated after their run in the unexpected rain storm.\n\nThe playful intensity slowly morphed into something heavier as Paul pushed Craig up against the wall. Grabbing him by the neck, he leaned in to kiss him. Startled, Craig tried to turn away, only to be held in place by Paul's insistent hand.\n\nPaul fought against him, determined not to be dissuaded. Holding one arm pinned over his head, he locked his lips onto Craig's, holding his chin with his free hand. A brief refusal from Craig suddenly gave way to an open mouth, and Paul quickly took the opportunity, entering him with his tongue.",
        "Craig's resistance melted away as they kissed passionately for the first time. They gripped hard to each other, grunting and panting as they kissed. Paul pressed his body against Craig's, feeling immediately his arousal as they ground their pelvises together.\n\nWith a renewed urgency, they fought to get each other's clothes off. Craig grabbed a hold of Paul's shirt and reefed it up over his head, exposing his wet torso. His nipples stood cold and erect.\n\nPaul grabbed Craig's buttoned shirt at the neck, and ripped hard, tearing through the buttons in his efforts to get at Craig's skin. He rubbed his hands up and down the exposed torso, feeling the cool, wet skin in his hands.\n\nTheir kiss continued throughout, their mouths mashing together, barely pausing for breath. Their tongues fought a battle, two equally matched foes, fighting towards the same goal. They breathed with one mouth, sharing breath, unable to separate.\n\nReaching down, Paul wrestled with the belt around Craig's waist, tearing it free and undoing his pants. He reached inside, grabbing hold of his warm, hard erection, pulling it free from the wet material surrounding it.\n\nIt felt hot in his hand, the strong, rapid pulse throbbing under the skin. Paul stroked it firmly, feeling Craig exhale into his mouth as he experienced the pleasure of this first moment of being touched.\n\nBreaking their kiss finally, Paul dropped quickly to his knees, pushing Craig back against the wall and swallowing his cock in a single, rapid movement. He sucked with urgency, desperate to taste the clear fluid that leaked from the tip. His grunting, slurping exertions mixed with the sound of Craig's moans as he was pleasured so intensely.\n\nPaul sucked vigorously on his hot cock, saliva running from his mouth and wetting Craig's shaft and balls. He wanted to devour him, longed to be closer, to be part of him. He swallowed the length of his cock, burying his face against his hairy lower abdomen. The smell of his sweat mixed with the sweet smell of rain was intoxicating.\n\nHe reached up and ripped Craig's pants down, helping him to step out of his clothes, underwear, shoes. His hands wandered over his body, wanting to touch him everywhere at once. The reassuring touch of Craig's hand on the back of his head drove him to redouble his efforts.\n\nSlurping one last taste of precum from the opening of Craig's cock, he stood again and pressed his body back against Craig's, slamming their mouths together once again. His tongue ventured back into Craig's mouth, carrying the taste of his own cock like an offering. Craig devoured it, sucking and savouring the taste.\n\nPaul stepped back slightly, and grabbed a hold of Craig's cock in his fist. Turning, he pulled him towards his bedroom. Wearing only his unbuttoned shirt, Craig followed obediently behind, his cock like a leash in Paul's hands.\n\nPaul wrapped his arms around him again, eager to return to the passionate kiss that they'd been engaged in. He ran his hands up under Craig's shirt, pulling it from his shoulders and throwing it onto the floor beside them.\n\nHe threw Craig back onto the bed, standing over him as he unbuttoned his pants, and stepped free of his cold, wet clothes. Both finally naked now, he crawled onto Craig's recumbent form, lying down on him, trying to touch as much of him as possible.\n\nThey writhed on the bed, mouths trying to devour each other as they rubbed their bodies together. They were both leaking copiously, bellies and cocks rapidly lubricated with the slick fluid. They rubbed together as they kissed, a blissful friction as their cocks jostled and slid between them.\n\nGrabbing hold of Paul's shoulder, Craig suddenly took control, rolling him onto his back. He lay on top of him, holding back for a moment, staring into his eyes. For the first time Paul could see it there, that glimmer of something more than simple lust. Finally he knew they were no longer just fuck buddies.\n\nPaul grabbed the back of Craig's neck, pulling him back down to his mouth. He parted his legs as they kissed, wrapping them around Craig's back, feet pressing into his arse. He ground his pelvis into Craig's, working to rub their cocks together.\n\nTilting his pelvis, Craig freed his cock from between their bellies, angling it down between Paul's legs. Paul could feel it rubbing against his splayed hole as they humped. The fluid leaking from Craig's cock lubricated his tight muscle.\n\nPaul drew his legs out wide, tilting his pelvis up and pulling his legs up higher. He carefully positioned himself to give Craig better access to his hole. Craig responded in kind, lining the head of his cock against the wet opening, pushing against it with a slow, rhythmic thrust.\n\nPaul moaned into his mouth as the nerve endings around his arse tingled with the stimulation. His whole body was on fire, every touch sent shockwaves of pleasure into him as their bodies finally met in this passionate embrace.\n\nThe pleasure centred around his arse became a stronger focus, as he concentrated on relaxing his tight muscle.\n\nCraig noticed the change and pushed forward more insistently. The head of his cock found the very centre of Paul's opening, its continued push slowly dilating the muscle.\n\nThe first entry was sudden, the swollen head bursting triumphantly through the entrance to Paul's pelvis. Paul bit gently on his tongue as he moaned in pleasure at once again being filled. Inch by inch, Craig advanced into him, driving deeper into his pelvis.\n\nTheir hands were everywhere, their tongues locked, and legs wrapped in a tight embrace. It was as if they were trying to meld their bodies into one being, no longer content with just touching, needing to be closer together.\n\nPaul was light headed, the pleasure of Craig's cock inside him once again, coupled with the delicious friction of his cock trapped between their bellies drove him wild.\n\nEvery movement was pleasure. Craig fucked him with a slow, passionate intensity, having learned now exactly where to aim to give Paul the most pleasure. They slid together, oblivious to their surroundings, their slurping kisses and stifled moans filling the room.\n\nCraig grabbed a hold of Paul once again and they rolled together as one, Paul landing on top with his cock still buried inside. He sat up slightly, pushing up on his hands, straddling Craig's recumbent body.\n\nHe tipped his head back towards the ceiling, the blissful pleasure filling him. He rode Craig's cock, sliding himself up and down the hard rod, impaling himself over and over.\n\nLooking down again, their eyes met. He could see it clearly now, this deep longing for him. This was a passion that he'd never experienced. He felt safe, and vulnerable all at once. He had opened himself up both literally and figuratively to this man, and knew that he was doing the same.\n\nTheir connection was more than just a cock in a hole, or a mate doing a favour. This was a deeper, more intimate bond, maybe even love. Their physical joining now was augmenting the emotional connection that was finally breaking free.\n\nPaul drove himself down onto Craig's cock, burying him deep into his pelvis. His whole body was alight with an intense pleasure. He could feel the strokes of Craig's penetration through every part of his being.\n\nHe was aware of Craig's hand on his cock, but it seemed an insignificant addition to the ecstasy rippling through his body. It burned slow and hot, rippling through him in infinite waves.\n\nHe leaned forward, locking his mouth onto Craig's once again, needing to taste him, and feel his breath. He pressed their bodies together, the friction of his movements spreading across their whole being.\n\nHis cock slid freely between their bellies, the puddles of accumulated fluid providing copious lubrication. The smell of their sweat and sex permeated every aspect of their consciousness.\n\nPaul could feel the rhythm of Craig's heart beat change beneath him as his muscles began to tense. He drove himself down harder and faster onto his cock, desperate to bring him to a climax. The change in pace rippled into his own pelvis too. He could feel the inevitable conclusion building.\n\nCraig began to moan deep and loud, his face buried into Paul's neck. He cried out, his whole body tensing suddenly as he drove his pelvis up hard to meet Paul's, pushing himself still deeper inside of him.\n\nHis cock throbbed as his climax finally came, his hot, white cum shooting deep into Paul's pelvis. He came again and again, driving himself up into Paul with a frenzied, uncoordinated spasm.\n\nPaul's orgasm hit him immediately. He writhed on top of Craig's body as he was fucked intensely from below. His arse contracted with a rhythmic spasm around Craig's cock, cum leaking from him in hot globs.\n\nHis orgasm was like a wave breaking on the shore, huge in size, unstoppable. He gripped tight to Craig, trying to absorb his body as he came, the hot liquid exploding between them as they rubbed together.\n\nWave after wave crashed down on the shore and receded again, one building on its predecessor. His vision blurred, and his mind clouded as he was lost in the spiralling pleasure. Just as it neared an unbearable intensity, the waves finally began to draw back, bit by bit, returning to the ocean from which they'd come.\n\nHis vision cleared and his consciousness returned. He remained crouched on top of Craig's sweat-covered body, cum still leaking from his cock and smearing between them. Their mouths sought each other again as they kissed passionately, enjoying the afterglow.\n\nFinally, Paul rolled himself to one side, regrettably allowing Craig to slide from him. Ignoring the messy outcome of their sex, they lay beside each other, bodies still pressed together in a sweaty embrace.\n\nCraig locked eyes with him as he slowly caught his breath. He wordlessly stroked Paul's hair, tenderly brushing it back from his face. Paul traced gentle lines along Craig's back and torso, looping down to his arse and then back, over and over.\n\nFinally, content, he closed his eyes, safe in Craig's embrace. They slept together like that as the rain pounded on the window, the outside world only a distant memory."
