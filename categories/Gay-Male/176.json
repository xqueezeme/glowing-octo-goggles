        "Comments, critiques and tips are welcome. \n\nDamon Reid vs. Tristan Thomas\n\n***\n\n\"You sure you're okay?\" Tristan asked Damon for the fourth time since they boarded his luxury private jet. Damon had been looking preoccupied since he'd received a call just before they got on board.\n\n\"Yeah I'm good.\" Damon sighed, looking out as the plane started taxiing down the runway.\n\nTristan wasn't convinced but decided to let it drop since Damon seemed lost in thought. They were sitting facing each other, buckled in. Tristan took a sip of his Hennessey, which he had been served whilst they prepared for takeoff. Damon had opted for a glass of water.\n\nHe turned to look around and couldn't help but be impressed with the luxury interior of the plane. Damon had told him he had spec'd it up to his taste after the death of his father. It was obvious he had paid a lot to get it like how it was. It was a big plane but could only take about eighteen people since most of the space had been converted into something else. Though the mirrored ceiling created the illusion of a bigger space, there was actually enough space to stretch out on the plane. It was what Tristan called Traveling in style as it was obvious the plane provided huge levels of comfort. He couldn't wait to look around.\n\n\"We're now at cruising altitude,\" the pilot's voice boomed over the intercom as the plane leveled out. \"Feel free to move about the cabin.\"\n\nImmediately they were freed to move about the cabin, Tristan removed his seat belt and slid into the seat next to Damon and took his hand in his.\n\n\"Hey talk to me. You've been in a pensive mood since we boarded and I don't like it. I planned on enjoying this flight as I have a lot of work to do as soon as we get to Paris but this mood is not helping. Is it business? Come on talk to me.\"\n\nDamon sighed and squeezed Tristan's hand. Then he brought their entwined hands up to press a kiss on Tristan's knuckles. \n\n\"There was a wrong shipment delivery. It's going to create a lot of setbacks.\" Damon said.\n\n\"Can't you do anything about that from up here? Doesn't this airplane also come with Internet access?\" Tristan teased, trying to lighten Damon's mood.\n\nDamon turned to look at Tristan, his eyes laughing. \"You mean you don't mind if I do a little work? 'Cause I really have to clear this up.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Go right ahead. I want to look around anyway.\" Tristan said with a grin.\n\n\"Okay.\" Damon leaned over and ran his thumb gently over Tristan's lush lower lip. Then his hand moved to the nape of Tristan's neck, holding him while their lips met in a gentle, almost tentative kiss. Tristan moaned, his lips parting slightly. Damon wasted no time in slipping the tip of his tongue inside his mouth and deepening the kiss, loving the taste of alcohol on Tristan's lips. Tristan's head reeled from the sensation of Damon's hot, sweet breath filling his mouth. They were breathing heavily now as desire took over. \n\nDamon groaned into Tristan's mouth, and suddenly broke away from their kiss, panting. He leaned his forehead against Tristan's, trying to calm down. Then dropping a kiss on Tristan's swollen lips, Damon stood up and headed for the boardroom.\n\nHe paused and glanced over his shoulder at Tristan, melting him into a puddle with those maddeningly sexy blue eyes of his. \"Come get me when you miss me.\"\n\nA surge of lust pulsed through Tristan's groin. \"I will.\" He replied huskily. \n\nTristan was still reeling from that kiss when he heard the sweet voice.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Thomas,\" a sexy hostess greeted with a smile, \"can I serve you anything?\"\n\nTristan grinned and pointed at his glass. \"A refill will be okay Alma.\" He said glancing at her nametag. \n\n\"You sure that's all you need?\" Alma gave a brilliant smile. \n\n\"Yes that will be all.\" Tristan said with a glint in his eyes. Trust Damon to have such a hot number as hostess on his private jet. \"Actually I want to look around so if you don't mind, you can be my personal tour guide. Forget about the drink for now.\" \n\nAlma laughed at that. \"Sure Mr. Thomas. Anything you want.\"\n\n\"Hmm... Anything? I'm liking this trip already.\" Tristan drawled, drawing more laughter from Alma. \"And call me T.T.\" \n\n\"Okay T.T., so where do we start?\" Alma wondered aloud. \"The cockpit. Come on.\"\n\nBy the time they finished touring the plane, Tristan was totally impressed by the sheer luxury and was calling the plane a \"Flying Hotel\" to Alma's amusement. The only place they hadn't gone was the boardroom as Tristan didn't want to disturb Damon. The plane had been configured for both work and play. Damon did travel a lot so Tristan understood why he wanted the plane to give maximum comfort.\n\nThe curving lines of the jet disguised the fact that you were inside an aircraft. It had a cinema room, a curvy cocktail bar which boasted of a super-size TV screen, cozy seating and private dining or relaxing zone, a sleek and elegant kitchenette perfect for rustling up a delicious snack or a glass of something naughty, a bedroom, a boardroom and an executive suite with its bathroom.\n\nTristan finally ended in the cinema room, where he watched a movie with Alma after insisting she stayed and watch with him. They talked, ate some crackers, and generally had fun. \n\nBefore Tristan realized, they had already spent two hours and Damon had still not made an appearance. He thanked Alma for her time and went to the executive suite where their duffel bags had been placed. He knew Damon would be tired as he had been in there for a little over two hours. He quickly grabbed a tube of oil from the elegantly designed bathroom and headed out of the suite. \n\nWhen Tristan opened the door to the boardroom, it was to the sound of voices. Damon was obviously having a conference call. He closed the door behind him and locked it.\n\nDamon looked up from the documents in front of him, saw Tristan, and looked at his wrist watch. Then he scribbled something on a sheet of paper and held it up for Tristan to read.\n\n'Took you long enough.'\n\nTristan couldn't help the grin that lit up his face. He took the sheet and pen from Damon and scribbled his reply.\n\n'Got distracted by your sexy hostess. Sue me.'\n\nHe almost laughed out loud at the scowl that appeared on Damon's handsome face. One of the people on the conference call, who sounded angry asked Damon a question and paused for an answer. Tristan froze, thinking Damon couldn't possibly answer since he hadn't been concentrating on what the participants had been saying. But to Tristan's surprise and relief, Damon easily answered the question. Armed with the knowledge that, Damon obviously wouldn't get distracted whilst working, Tristan decided to go ahead with what he had in mind. \n\nHe went to stand behind Damon and started massaging his neck. Damon paused and sighed with obvious pleasure. Then he continued to talk as though he wasn't getting a neck rub. Tristan leaned over and unbuttoned Damon's shirt, taking it off. Then taking out the bottle of oil from his pocket, he poured a generous amount into his palm and started giving Damon a massage to die for.\n\nDamon couldn't help the moan that tore out of him. God, Tristan's hands felt good. And his cock was quickly standing to attention.\n\n\"You okay Damon?\" One of the participants asked? Tristan thought his voice sounded familiar but couldn't place it.\n\n\"Yes I'm okay Chris. But what is the stand of GAGA in all this? Are they going to partner Lim-Lor? They should let us know whether they are okay with the setup or prefer something else.\" Damon spoke in a slightly husky voice. He was so hard.\n\nTristan continued what he was doing, pushing Damon slightly forward so he could work on his back. When he was satisfied that he had done a good job on Damon's back, Tristan came around and threw a leg across Damon's thighs, straddling him. But before he could even bring his hands up to touch Damon's shoulders, his lips were being attacked. \n\nAfter a momentary surprise, Tristan's mouth opened to take Damon's exploring tongue, one hand cupping the back of Damon's neck, holding him to the kiss, while the other journeyed to Damon's chest to play with his nipple. Damon's gasp of pleasure was swallowed by Tristan, who drank in Damon's kiss like a starving man. \n\nTristan broke off the kiss and shoved his face into Damon's shoulder, trying to squelch his moans. He grinded himself on the huge erection he could feel in Damon's jeans, making Damon throw his head back in ecstasy. \n\nTristan slid off Damon's thighs and knelt between his legs, his hands working the button on Damon's jeans. He pulled out his pulsing cock from the restraining material, rocked forward and sucked Damon's cock deep into his throat...to the hilt.\n\n\"Fuuuuuck!\" Damon roared. \"Are you kidding me? Shit, I'm gonna\u2014damn.\" \n\nTristan closed his eyes as the first burst of cum hit the back of his throat. He couldn't even taste it as Damon was so deep down his throat, all that cum was probably pouring directly into his stomach. He smiled around the pulsing cock inside his mouth, feeling smug. Finally, he had been able to take all of Damon into his throat. He swallowed repeatedly, drinking him down, relishing the gruff sounds of satisfaction that rumbled from Damon's chest.\n\nDamon's hands were in Tristan's hair, his head thrown back in blissful abandon, sweat glistening on his abs. When Damon's cock stopped spasming within his throat, Tristan slowly slid his mouth up and down the still hard cock, pausing to lick at the last vestiges of semen in the slit. He kept sucking and licking, cleaning Damon off, not willing to give up that feeling of Damon's cock in his mouth.\n\nThe feel of Tristan's tongue sliding and rasping on Damon's cock, and the wet heat of his mouth was so fucking good, Damon thought he'd go mad. With a strangled cry, he pulled Tristan off his cock and slammed his mouth unto his, kissing him heatedly, mouth hot and wet.\n\n\"Oh Christ, Tristan.\" Damon breathed against Tristan's lips. \"You're fucking amazing.\" \n\n\"Damon...\" Tristan gasped remembering the conference call. \n\nThen they both felt it...total silence.\n\n\"Shit!\" Damon swore wondering what had just happened, where all the participants on the conference call had gone, had they been listening to Tristan send him into meltdown...\n\n\"You guys done?\" Chris' amused voice came back on the link.\n\n\"Oh God, Chris...\" Damon groaned.\n\n\"Don't worry. Thank your stars I figured out early enough what was going on. I cut the others off before they could hear anything...scandalous. Hey Tristan.\" Chris greeted.\n\n\"Hey Chris. What's up?\" Tristan asked with a soft laughter, standing up to sit on the table.\n\n\"You tell me buddy. You two are crazy you know that?\" Chris chuckled.\n\n\"Not my fault man.\" Tristan laughed.\n\n\"From what I heard, it was all you Tristan.\" \n\n\"And why do you think that?\" Tristan drawled. \n\n\"The man can't even talk Tristan. Don't kill him man. I'll call you guys when you land. Have fun.\" Chris went off the line.\n\nTristan turned to look at Damon. He looked dazed. \n\n\"Are you okay? You're shaking,\" Tristan murmured. Then he got off the table and drew a shaking Damon into his arms, his nose nestling in his hair. \n\nDamon wrapped his arms tightly around Tristan's waist and hanged on. There was no refuting Tristan's observation. Not only was he shaking, he felt confused. First of all, this was the first time ever that anyone had taken him down their throat to the hilt. And the time it had taken for him to cum...that was a first too. Damon really didn't know how the fuck that happened. One moment he was traveling down Tristan's throat, felt him swallow around his cock, and the next moment, he was coming. And coming had never felt this intense for him. \n\n\"Hey.\" Tristan tilted Damon's chin up and looked into his eyes. \"Better?\"\n\nDamon nodded, still not finding his vocal cords.\n\n\"Good. Now let me finish what I started. You are too tense. Come on.\" Tristan drew Damon out of his chair and turned him around to sit on the table. Then he gently pushed him back till he was lying on the board table, laughing softly when Damon hissed from the cold.\n\nTristan hooked his fingers into the waistband of Damon's boxer briefs and slowly pulled it down together with his jeans. Thank God Damon had already taken off his boots. When Damon was magnificently naked, Tristan proceeded to pour more oil into his palm and started to massage his abs. From the moans and groans coming from Damon, he knew was doing a good job. When he got to his stomach and hips, he didn't touch Damon's erection which was pulsing as though he hadn't just orgasmed. He moved to his thighs.\n\n\"Tris please.\" Damon groaned. \"And aren't you wearing too many cloths?\"\n\nTristan laughed and swiftly removed his t-shirt. \"Better?\"\n\n\"No. Lose the pants.\"\n\nTristan unzipped his jeans pants but left it on and continued with kneading Damon's thighs. When he got to his toes, he took one into his mouth and sucked on it as though he was sucking a lollipop.\n\n\"Christ!\" Damon's body jerked. He made to get off the table but Tristan pushed him back. Then he proceeded to massage his feet.\n\nTristan released Damon's feet and slowly took off his own jeans and boxer briefs. His hard cock slapped against his tummy, the tip wet with pre-cum. He took hold of Damon's thighs, and pulled his arse to the edge of the table. Then taking his hard cock into his slick hand, started stroking him slowly.\n\n\"That's it baby. Feels so good.\" Damon's eyes closed.\n\nTristan leaned over Damon and latched onto his nipple with his teeth. He bit, soothed and sucked until Damon was writhing on the table. With Tristan's thumb and forefinger working on the other nipple, and his other hand stroking that big pierced cock, Damon was delirious with pleasure. Tristan released the nipple from his mouth and took Damon's lips in a sizzling kiss that left him breathless. In that position, Damon could feel the tip of Tristan's cock right at his entrance. Before Damon knew what he was doing, his mouth was moving.\n\n\"Fuck me,\" he whispered. \n\nTristan stopped moving, \"What did you say?\" \n\nDamon gulped. \"Fuck me. Please.\" \n\n\"Are you sure?\" Tristan asked huskily. Though he was shocked, he couldn't stop the surge of excitement that burst inside him or the heat that traveled up his spine at Damon's words.\n\n\"Well, it must be good if it can cause people to pass out right?\" Damon grinned.\n\n\"You know, you really have to watch what you say to me right now you asshole. I could destroy this arse and there's nothing you can do about it.\" Tristan gave a mock scowl. Damon was obviously never going to allow him to forget when he had passed out after their very first fuck.\n\n\"Do your worst.\" Damon husked.\n\nTristan started stroking Damon's cock again.\"Ever bottomed?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" Damon said shaking his head no. \"There's a first time for everything right? And who better to initiate me into it than the love of my life? You're up to this aren't you?\"\n\n\"Hell yeah. I learn from the very best.\" Tristan drawled and without warning, leaned down and took Damon into his mouth. This time, he sucked just the head into his mouth and swirled his tongue around the barbell inside his piercing.\n\n\"Oh God.\" Damon breathed. \n\nTristan moved down and took in his balls, slurping and sucking on them, drawing more moans from Damon. Then taking the seat Damon had been sitting in earlier, Tristan grabbed Damon's legs and pushed them up, exposing his virgin puckered hole. Then tentatively, Tristan licked that twitching hole. \n\n\"Oh fuck!\" Damon exploded.\n\nTristan tongued Damon's hole, loving his ecstatic moans. Damon bucked, squirming, wanting more. He almost lost his mind when the tip of Tristan's tongue speared inside. \n\n\"Tristan...God, please.\" \n\nTristan tongue-fucked him so sweetly that he thought he could very well die from the pleasure of it. His balls and cock were throbbing, and he was writhing on the table, moving back onto Tristan, needing more. Damon couldn't breathe, was past speech, the sensations too intense for him to articulate anything. All he could feel was Tristan's tongue fucking him, and then Tristan's hand was moving up to grip his cock, stroking in time with the sucking and licking.\n\n\"Oh, God yes!\" Damon moaned, willing himself not to come.\n\nThen Tristan's tongue was being replaced by a finger. Damon gasped. Tristan took his time. Never going too fast and Damon appreciated it. Then he was adding a second finger, pegging Damon's gland again and again until he thought he'd go crazy.\n\n\"Tris just...please fuck me already.\" Damon groaned, spurting so much pre-come.\n\nTristan added a third finger and felt Damon tense. He wanted to ensure that Damon was open enough to take him. Though he wasn't as big as Damon, he knew he was big.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Tristan whispered. \"Just a bit more, okay?\" he asked as he slowly stretched Damon's entrance.\n\nWhen he thought Damon was stretched enough, Tristan pulled out his fingers and stood up. Damon felt the tip of Tristan's lubricated cock at his entrance and took a deep breath.\n\n\"You know what to do.\" Tristan said softly looking into glazed blue eyes. Damon nodded and pushed out as Tristan entered his body. His heart was racing, his prick rigid between them as he gave up control to Tristan.\n\n\"God you're so tight.\" Tristan gushed.\n\n\"Fuck. Damn.\" It hurt. More than he'd expected. But then Tristan wasn't small. He had a pretty big dick. How the fuck was Tristan able to take his monster dick? He felt Tristan's jerky movements as he tried to control himself. \"Hey I know what you really want to do...slam inside. Don't!\" Damon growled. \n\nTristan laughed shakily! \"Twerp! Yeah I want to do just that. But I'm not gonna.\"\n\nTristan pulled out ignoring Damon's protests. He poured more oil to slick his cock and started to push back in. He eased in more, an inch at a time till he was fully seated within Damon. \n\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked in a strained voice.\n\n\"I'll live.\" Damon's voice was tight with equal strain. He couldn't begin to describe the feeling of fullness and completion.\n\n\"Breathe Damon.\" \n\n\"Fuck you.\" \n\n\"I'm gonna do the fucking this time thank you very much.\"\n\nBefore Damon could answer, Tristan leaned down and took his lips in a kiss so sensual, Damon totally forgot about the pain and started moving, losing any ability to restrain himself as his hips started lifting of their own accord.\n\n\"Move.\" Damon groaned.\n\nTristan eased out of his body and slid back in with ease. On the second stroke, he hit Damon's gland and he went crazy.\n\n\"Oh God, Tris.\"\n\nDamon's balls drew up tight, his cock ached and he thought his entire body was going to explode with the fire ripping through him as each thrust grated over his prostate. Goose bumps rose on his skin and he shuddered and gave a low, incoherent moan. \n\n\"Ah fuck, this is amazing,\" Damon gasped. \n\nTristan slid out slow and then pushed back in hard and fast. He didn't say a word as he rocked, his cock moving inside Damon just enough to nail his gland and make him whimper. He straightened, braced his hands on Damon's hips and set a hard pace. Damon met him with each stroke, loving the mixture of pain and pleasure as Tristan's dick kept brushing over his button, sending fireworks dancing over his nerves. It felt so good.\n\n\"You're so fucking tight.\" Tristan panted, slamming home again, seating his prick deep inside Damon. \"God, you feel so fucking perfect. Still okay?\" he asked and earned a nod in return. \n\nThey fell into a natural give and take, the only sound the slap of skin and the heavy, rasping breathing of hard sex as they both took what they wanted, what they needed, from the other.\n\nTristan's thrusts slowed down, his eyes holding Damon's as captive as his body. Damon couldn't look away. He felt captivated, felt so much love he gasped and contracted around the cock ploughing into him. Then Tristan leaned over him, burying his face against Damon's neck.",
        "\"I want to stay in you forever.\" Tristan gushed. \"I love you so fucking much.\"\n\nDamon's heartbeat quickened at Tristan's words, his body tingling. \"Same here Tris. Same here.\" \n\nWith a moan Tristan slammed his lips unto Damon's and moved his hand between them to take his cock in his slick palm. Tristan milked that cock! He hammered into Damon, shoving deep inside him, causing Damon to cry out as a powerful orgasm tore through him.\n\n\"I got you baby. Come for me.\" Tristan husked against Damon's lips. \n\n\"Tris!\" Damon cried out and shot, his seed coating his stomach and Tristan's hand, his hot channel contracting exquisitely around Tristan. \n\nTristan didn't stand a chance against that delicious squeeze...he came a second later with a hoarse cry, his face buried against Damon's neck. Damon wrapped his arms around Tristan. As limp as he felt, he still did not let go of Tristan. It was several minutes before either could speak.\n\n\"Tristan Thomas,\" Damon whispered. \"What are you trying to do to me?\" He brushed Tristan's sweat-damp hair from his face and waited for him to open his eyes. \n\n\"I could ask you same.\" Tristan murmured. \"Are you okay, love?\" he asked with concern, rolling off Damon to curl against his side. \"It wasn't too much for you?\"\n\n\"I'm okay.\" Damon flashed that sexy grin which always made Tristan's heart soar. \"That was fucking fantastic, Tris. No wonder you like this.\" \n\nTristan propped his head on his hand and looked down at Damon, a very satisfied smile hovering over his lips. He couldn't help but feel a rush of triumph on how he'd been able to reduce Damon to a quivering mass.\n\n\"Don't look so smug, you fucker,\" Damon laughed and snuggled into Tristan's warmth. \n\n\"You're so fucking sexy like this.\" Tristan said huskily and leaned down to kiss Damon tenderly. Then he rolled over onto his back beside Damon with a smiled, feeling utterly boneless. \"Gonna fucking kill me, Damon.\" Tristan's voice was lazy and satiated.\" \n\nDamon chuckled. \"Oh, stop your whining. You weren't the one who was just folded damn-near in half and drilled into the boardroom table...and in the sky of all places too.\" He tossed back. \n\nA dark eyebrow arched. \"Are you complaining?\" Tristan asked with laughter. \n\n\"Hell no.\" Damon's blue eyes stared at Tristan from behind heavy lids. \"That was simply awesome, baby.\" His full lips parted in a sensual smile. \"I don't think I'll be able to sit down for a week though.\" \n\n\"You'll be fine. I don't want you scaring the French with any funny walk so I didn't stay inside you for long like I really wanted to.\" Tristan chuckled. \n\n\"Oww how sweet.\" Damon drawled.\n\n\"Fuck you.\" Tristan laughed.\n\n\"You just did.\" Damon joined in the laugher.\n\n\"Okay I need to celebrate. I just got inducted into the Mile-High Club.\"\n\n\"Yep. Welcome to the club.\" Damon drawled.\n\nTristan knew this wasn't the first time Damon had had sex on a plane but that didn't stop the obvious from hurting. Maybe it was the way Damon had casually admitted to it with his last statement. It made their encounter come off as one of the others and part of him was suddenly insanely jealous. Tristan sat up, got off the table and started dressing up. He knew he was being silly but couldn't help it.\n\nDamon sensed the change in Tristan but couldn't tell what had brought it on. He thought Tristan would give him something to clean himself with at least but it looked like he was rather getting ready to leave the boardroom.\n\nDeep blue eyes flickered as Damon's gaze raked over Tristan, giving away nothing of what he thought about what was going on. He got off the table, wincing at the slight discomfort. To think there was no tub on the plane to soak in. Shit! Great time to be adventurous.\n\n\"So is there anything I'm supposed to do?\" Tristan asked in a tense voice. \"What do your partners usually do after a mile-high dose?\" Tristan couldn't keep the bitterness from his voice.\n\nDamon wasn't going to dignify that question with an answer so he rather ensured there was no mess on the table, and then concentrated on dressing up. His heart sunk when he heard Tristan open the door and leave. What the fuck just happened? He never said he was a saint. Was he going to be punished for his past? How about him? Was he supposed to get pissed off at Tristan's past too? Tristan was being childish. Damon thought it was about time he grew up. And if it was the last thing he did, he was going to see to that. \n\nHe totally ignored Tristan.\n\n***\n\nWhen Damon entered the executive suite, Tristan was lying on the queen size bed reading a magazine. Damon stripped quietly and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When he came back in, he dressed in a grey cargo pants, black polo shirt and sneakers. Then without a word to Tristan, he went out of the room. He was hungry so he headed straight for the dining room. Alma served him delicious mustard-stuffed chicken with parmesan-roasted potatoes and a bottle of red wine. Though Damon enjoyed his meal, he knew he would have enjoyed it more if he had eaten with Tristan.\n\n\"Mr. Reid, will Mr. Thomas be coming to eat soon?\" Alma asked Damon. \"Should I start preparing something for him?\"\n\n\"Tell you what Alma, why don't you go ask Mr. Thomas? Maybe he's ready to eat.\" Damon replied with a smile.\n\n\"I'll do that Mr. Reid.\" And with that, Alma left for the suite.\n\nAt the door of the suite, she knocked, and not hearing any answer, entered. Tristan was not in the room but Alma could hear the sound of the shower.\n\n\"T.T.?\" She called out.\n\n\"Alma?\" Tristan responded from the bathroom. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Should I prepare some food for you?\"\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Tristan answered. \"No thanks. I'm okay.\"\n\n\"Alright see you later then.\" Alma said and left the room.\n\n\"Shit!\" Tristan swore. He just wasn't in the mood for food right then. He was feeling too guilty to be able to keep anything down. He had fucked up real bad. Even as he opened his mouth to ask Damon that silly question, he knew he was out of line. He had to apologize to Damon.\n\nAfter the shower, he dressed in a sexy sports shirt and black jeans, remembering how hot Damon had looked in that outfit he had dressed in after his shower. He had fought the urge to get off the bed and throw himself into Damon's arms, where he so desperately wanted to be. Damon didn't look like he would have accepted it. Hell, HE wouldn't have accepted it. \n\nJust as Tristan was thinking about how to apologize for his silly attitude, the door opened and Damon entered. Without looking in Tristan's direction, he toed off his sneakers and slid into bed.\n\n\"Damon?\"\n\n\"Un-huh?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Tristan said simply.\n\nDamon looked at Tristan's remorseful face for a while and patted the space beside him. \"Sit.\"\n\nTristan sat on the bed. \n\n\"Tristan,\" Damon begun softly, \"How would you have felt, if I had acted like how you had?\" \n\nTristan raked his fingers through his damp hair in frustration. \"Damon I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"No seriously. I want to know. How would you have felt? And especially, if I had acted as such right after I'd fucked you?\" \n\n\"Shit!\" Tristan groaned. \"Pissed, hurt...I would have been devastated.\" Tristan finished in a whisper. \n\nDamon decided he didn't like the shattered look on Tristan's face. He just couldn't stand it. After all, Tristan was obviously regretful for how he had acted. Damon wanted his cheerful Tristan back, wanted the playful, witty Tristan back. And what better way to do that than make light of the situation...\n\n\"Good. I'm human then. 'Cause I couldn't help but cry in the shower earlier. Thought for a moment I was coming down with something.\" Damon said.\n\n\"Oh God, Damon.\" Tristan looked stunned for a moment, and then he threw himself at Damon and buried his face against his neck, chanting 'forgive me'. If he had looked at Damon's face, he would have realized he was only joking.\n\nWhen he felt Damon shaking he almost died, thinking he was crying again. He raised his head up from Damon's neck and gasped when he realized Damon was rather laughing.\n\n\"What...\" Tristan sat up.\n\n\"I was just messing with you dude. I didn't cry. God, you should see the look on your face.\" Damon howled with laughter.\n\nTristan had to take a moment to process what was going on. He had been pranked. Damon actually thought this was funny? Tristan saw red. \n\n\"Will you shut the fuck up?\" Tristan bellowed.\n\nThat got Damon's attention. He stopped laughing and looked at Tristan. Had he really just shouted at him? And why the fuck was he looking all furious? Damon flipped!\n\n\"No, no, no Tristan, you don't get to go Hulk on me at this point. 'Cause I have every right to get on your fucking nerves. What you did was a shitty thing to do. Have I quizzed you about your past fucks? Why should mine be an issue?\" \n\nDamon was getting worked up. He sat up and stared Tristan down. \"I'm just as human as you are Tristan. And you mustn't do to me what you wouldn't want me to do to you. Hell, I've never treated you with anything but care after sex. Don't I deserve same? Do you have any idea how I felt when you left me like that?\" Damon whispered. All the hurt he hadn't acknowledged in the boardroom surged through him. \"I've never been this hurt in my life.\"\n\nTristan felt so much shame and guilt he just wanted to die. \"I'm so sorry.\" His voice was small, contrite.\n\n\"Oh and one more thing...grow the fuck up!\" Damon said in a hard voice.\n\nTristan couldn't explain the emotions running through him at that point. He knew what he did was wrong but Damon's last comment hurt more than he cared to admit. Possessiveness and jealousy had obviously driven him to act as he had. Not to justify how he had acted, but as far as he was concerned, anyone could be jealous. It didn't make them immature did it? He didn't think he had a right to point that out though...taking into consideration the fact that he had acted badly. \n\nDamon saw how defeated Tristan looked and immediately regretted his outburst. The last thing he wanted was to be too hard on Tristan. He pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. \n\n\"Can we just please forget this and move on?\" Damon's voice was quiet.\n\nTristan nodded slowly, staring down at his fingers. \"Yes.\" His voice was low, quiet. Hoarse.\n\n\"And just for the record, yes I have fucked on a plane...or two. But not on this one. This is a first.\" Damon said.\n\nTristan shrugged. \"It doesn't matter whether you have or not. I was out of line and I'm sorry.\" \n\nDamon had a feeling Tristan didn't believe him. \"Tris, I do have another private jet besides this you know. This, I didn't want to do stuff like that on 'cause I didn't want to disrespect the memory of my dad. With you...it's different. I'm not doing this with one of my flings. I want 'forever' with you Tristan. So I don't see it as disrespecting. Besides, you didn't give me the chance to say no anyway.\" Damon added, tongue in cheek.\n\nWhen Tristan didn't give a witty comeback as he would usually do, Damon got worried and reached for him. \n\n\"Hey come here.\" Damon drew Tristan to him and wrapped his arms around him. \"I'm sorry baby.\" Damon said quietly.\n\n\"You have nothing to be sorry for.\" Tristan murmured into his chest. \"I'm just appalled at the way I treated you. I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"Apology accepted. I'm sorry about the way I spoke. I guess it was either that or tear up. Forgive me please.\" Damon said softly. \"But if you ever do that to me again, I'm gonna whoop your arse.\" Damon growled.\n\n\"Never again.\" Tristan whispered, looking into Damon's eyes. \"How are you feeling?\" His voice was filled with concern.\n\nDamon grinned. \"I'm okay, thanks for asking. You know I was only kidding about whooping your arse right? I can never do that. I love you Tris.\" \n\nDamon leaned forward to kiss Tristan lingeringly.\n\n\"I love you too Damon.\" Tristan breathed when his lips were released. \"And you can't whoop my arse baby. I'm a black belt.\" \n\nDamon barked with laughter, glad Tristan was sounding like his usual self again. \"I'll try and remember that.\" He nuzzled behind Tristan's ear, tightening his arms around him. \"God, you smell divine. Hungry?\" \n\n\"Famished.\" Tristan sighed, feeling pangs of hunger.\n\n\"Wait here.\" Damon said getting out of the bed but Tristan's voice stopped him before he could leave the suite.\n\n\"Hey Damon...\" Tristan said softly. \"Seriously, are you okay? I...I saw you wince when you came to lie down and just now when you were getting off the bed too. I know there's no tub in here but I could...\"\n\n\"Tris, I'll live.\"\n\n\"Don't be stubborn Damon.\"\n\n\"Relax. We can take care of me when we land.\"\n\n\"I'm so gonna laugh at you if you walk funny when we land.\" Tristan's tone was one of wry amusement.\n\nDamon flipped Tristan off and left the suite to Tristan's howls of laughter.\n\nWhen he came back, he had Tristan's food and a bottle of Hennessey with two glasses on a trey. Damon striped off his cloths leaving just his boxer briefs and then did same for Tristan. Then he fed Tristan, kissing him in between bites. By the time the food was finished, half of the bottle of Hennessey was gone. \n\nTristan moved to lie on top of Damon, kissing him slowly and gently, his lips soft and full, teasing and playful. Slowly Tristan began to move his hips, the thrusts as gentle as the motion of his lips. Damon felt himself stir and moaned deep in his throat, deepening the kiss. Their tongues explored and tasted and their boxer briefs soon became wet with their pre-cum. The plane shook suddenly, then dropped but the two lovers didn't even feel it. They were so lost in each other. Tristan sat up and straddled Damon, grinding their cocks together through their boxers. \n\n\"Fuck baby.\" Damon was going out of his mind with pleasure.\n\nTristan pulled off his boxers to release his weeping cock, and then he pulled off Damon's. Leaning to the side, he pulled his duffel bag to him and took out a tube of lube. He opened it and squirted some onto Damon's cock. Then he stroked that big beautiful cock, spreading the lube all over it. Whilst stroking Damon's cock, Tristan coated his fingers and spreading his legs wide, he allowed his finger to breach his hole, lubing himself up. It was hot! \n\nDamon just watched him, breathing hard. He couldn't tear his eyes away from Tristan's parted lips, flushed cheeks, and heavy-lidded gaze. He'd never wanted to fuck someone so badly in his life.\n\n\"Baby if you keep that up, I'm gonna come.\" Damon murmured huskily. \n\nTristan added another finger, going in and out of his body, stretching himself for Damon.\n\n\"You're trying to kill me.\" Damon whispered. The combination of the feel of Tristan's hand on his cock and the sight of Tristan fucking himself was too much. His body was perilously close to sensory overload.\n\nThen Tristan was straddling Damon and lining his cock with his stretched hole. He slowly lowered himself onto it, gasping as the broad girth eased into him, pushing beyond the now-unresisting ring of muscle, till he had all of Damon inside him.\n\n\"Fuck!\" Damon gasped, a look of pure pleasure on his face.\n\n\"God, I missed this.\" Tristan breathed, relishing the exquisite fullness with his eyes closed. It felt as though it had been ages since he'd had Damon's cock inside his body.\n\nDamon watched Tristan's face for traces of pain, relieved when his lips rather parted in what could only be a smile of unadulterated satisfaction.\n\n\"F-feels so good, Damon.\" Tristan gasped brokenly. The feel of Damon inside him was absolutely exquisite.\n\nThey were both too desperate now for slow and gentle. Tristan fucked himself on Damon's throbbing cock like his life depended on it. He lifted himself up and then slammed back down, impaling himself on Damon again and again. He couldn't help but cry out in ecstasy anytime that wicked barbell hit his prostate. His cock leaked profusely between them as he met Damon's thrust with solid ones of his own. He knew he wasn't going to last long. \n\n\"Close,\" Tristan moaned.\n\nDamon looked up at Tristan's face, caught in the rapture of near orgasm, and his heart leapt in his chest. He burned that image into his memory, wishing he were an artist and could paint, so he could capture the way Tristan looked right then. He was simply breathtaking and Damon knew he was the luckiest man on earth to have the attentions of such a lovely creature.\n\n\"So beautiful,\" Damon whispered. \"And all mine.\"\n\n\"Yours, Damon.\" Tristan panted, feeling claimed, overwhelmed, possessed by Damon...but never once wishing for an exorcism. \"All yours.\"\n\nDamon reached down to grab Tristan's arse, to hold him still while he fucked up into him, driving himself into Tristan with powerful thrusts of his pelvis. As he bucked and rocked against him, Tristan leaned down and started kissing him fiercely. They couldn't get enough of each other. Tristan moved down and latched onto Damon's nipple, sucking firmly.\n\n\"Oh fuck baby.\" Damon breathed, his voice hoarse and low and oh so sexy.\n\nDamon's body felt as if he were on fire and he knew that his own release wasn't far off. His hips jackhammered against Tristan's, moving faster, bringing them both closer to the edge.\n\nWhen Damon felt Tristan bite down painfully on his nipple, he roared, surged up into him and held his cock deep inside Tristan, pressing that barbell hard against his prostate. The muscles at the base of Tristan's cock gave a hard spasm and he erupted with a cry, shooting his essence between them.\n\n\"Jesus!\" Tristan's eyes squeezed shut as his body took its pleasure.\n\nDamon gasped when he felt Tristan's channel grip him in hard spasms, squeezing his cock like a vise and knew he was going to blow. Then he saw Tristan sit up quickly and rotate on him to face his legs, with his dick still buried deep inside him. The feeling of Tristan's heat twisting around his cock during that rotation was just too much and he gave a tortured gasp as he felt the beginnings of an intense orgasm.\n\n\"Bend your knees.\" Tristan commanded urgently and Damon did, even as he felt his orgasm surge through him. Then Tristan leaned forward and reached for Damon's toes. Taking each set of toes in each palm, Tristan squeezed them hard, smiling when he heard Damon scream just as he felt his cock throb inside him, felt the warmth flooding him.\n\n\"Oh. My. God!\" Damon couldn't stop screaming and coming as excruciating pleasure spiked through him.\n\nEven as Damon screamed and thrashed beneath him, riding his intensely pleasurable orgasm, Tristan felt the exquisite sensation of Damon coming inside of him, felt the thick cock twitching, felt the vibrations against his gland...felt an unexpected orgasm grip him. \n\n\"Oh Fuck,\" Tristan growled, his head thrown back in pure bliss as he shot between his stomach and Damon's thighs.\n\nStill trembling with the aftereffects of his unexpected orgasm, Tristan forced himself to rotate on Damon again to face him. Judging by the look of undisguised bliss on Damon's gorgeous face, and the shudders that were still shaking his frame, Tristan knew he had achieved his goal. Lowering his head, he claimed Damon's mouth in a deep, melting kiss, conveying everything he was feeling at that moment. All the love, contentment, ecstasy, joy and lust he felt were conveyed in that kiss. Then Tristan's body went limp, a sweet tranquility washing over him as he collapsed in a sweaty, sated heap unto Damon. \n\nDamon was quiet. Too quiet. Wondering whether he was alright, Tristan raised his head to look at him, saw Damon's glazed eyes and moaned. Damon looked totally floored, looked like he was still out of it, trying to make his way back from wherever he was. He looked totally blissed out. \n\nTristan touched his cheeks gently. \"Hey, are you okay?\" \n\nDamon nodded, struggling with the effort to keep his eyes focused. \"That was the single most fantastic fuck of my life Tris.\" Damon's voice was barely more than a whisper. ",
        "Tristan chuckled, his green eyes sparkling with mischief. \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"What the fuck was that Tris? What did...what did you do to me there? Fuck, that was...I don't know what the hell that was.\" Damon finally said.\n\n\n\nTristan laughed. \"Liked it that much huh?\"\n\n\"Liked it? Hell, you just blew my mind. I've never in my entire life felt anything like that before. I fucking loved it. God, what you do to me.\" Damon groaned.\n\nTristan laughed softly in his ear. \"You're easy.\" He said sliding his mouth over Damon's collarbone and neck, leaving a trail of open mouthed kisses and licks. \"Glad you loved it. You did say you had never been this hurt in your life. I...wanted to...to give you something else to think about. I'm very sorry Damon.\" Tristan added in a whisper.\n\n\"Shh, baby. It's okay. Just know that this has been a flight of firsts for me. And I'll cherish it forever. I love you.\" Damon said softly.\n\n\"I love you too.\" Tristan whispered. \"You are my world, Damon.\" \n\nDamon's heart swelled. If it were possible, he fell even more in love with his crazy brat. \"And you are mine,\" he choked with a tremulous smile. He leaned up and kissed Tristan soundly. His hands slid over Tristan's back and hips, clinging and stroking at the same time. He just couldn't stop touching him. \n\n\"I hate it when we fight.\" Tristan said softly.\n\n\"We will fight once in a while. It will only strengthen us. And we can always look forward to the make-up sex. That was fuckingly brilliant baby.\"\n\nTristan laughed and yawned. \n\nDamon made to pull him off his cock but Tristan clenched his arse, refusing to move. \"I want to sleep with you inside me please.\"\n\n\"Tris...\" Damon groaned both in protest and pleasure as Tristan was still clenched around him. \"You know what will happen if I stay in you for long.\"\n\n\"I don't care.\" Tristan said stubbornly. \n\n\"Well I do. We can't both be walking funny in Paris.\"\n\n\"Just for a while Damon. Please.\" Tristan whispered.\n\nDamon sighed. \"Okay.\" He said reluctantly pulling the covers over them. \"Sweet dreams love.\"\n\nBut Tristan didn't even hear him. He was already fast asleep, breathing evenly. Loving Tristan's weight on him, Damon turned his face into Tristan's hair, tightening his arms around him. To think he had actually planned on fucking Tristan's brains out on this flight. Looks like he rather got fucked senseless...and he loved it! He fell asleep surrounded with the heat of Tristan and with a smile on his face."
