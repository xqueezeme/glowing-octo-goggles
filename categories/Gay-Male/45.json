        "Comments, critiques and tips are welcome. \n\nDamon Reid vs. Tristan Thomas\n\n***\n\n\"Have you tried calling him?\" Cole asked a worried looking Damon.\n\nThey were sitting on the beach after ten p.m. Tristan was still not back from his meeting with Chloe.\n\n\"I have Cole. It goes straight to his voice mail. Maybe he needs time. Maybe he's...\"\n\n\"We both know Tristan loves you Damon. I haven't known him for long, but I know genuine love when I see it. He adores you. He wouldn't need that long a time to set whatever straight with that girl. You have to go look for him dude.\" Cole said, his voice stern.\n\nCole remembered his conversation with Tristan that afternoon when he met Tristan on his way out to meet with the girl. He had told Tristan in no uncertain terms what to expect from him if he dared to break Damon's heart. \n\n\"So help me God, I'm going to thrash you to within an inch of your life if you dare break his heart.\" Cole had said to Tristan, his voice lethal as he stared Tristan down. \"Oh and consider that as both a promise and a threat.\"\n\nCole had been surprised at the amused smile that had spread across Tristan's face. He thought he had managed to look frightening enough.\n\n\"Why the fuck are you smiling?\" Cole had snapped.\n\n\"Finally.\" Tristan had said, shaking his head in amusement. \"Finally, someone threatens me on his behalf. He will be thrilled to hear this.\"\n\n\"He's my best friend Tristan. I've known him for years. And I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. So I need to make sure you are taking this just as seriously as he is.\"\n\n\"Don't worry Cole. I'd rather die than hurt that jackass. I love him too fucking much. His is my life.\" Tristan started walking towards where \u00c9tienne was parked. \"And guess what Cole, I do value my life.\" He threw over his shoulders.\n\nCole hadn't been able to stop the smile that spread across his face. Damon was in good hands and that was all that mattered.\n\nNow sitting on the quiet beach looking at his friend, Cole was ready to bet on his life that Tristan wasn't doing anything deliberately to hurt Damon. There was a good explanation for his silence and absence. Maybe the battery on his phone had run down, maybe he was hurt somewhere, maybe he... There just had to be a good explanation for Tristan's MIA act.\n\n\"I don't even know where he went.\" Damon said quietly.\n\n\"\u00c9tienne drove him there right? Call him. If you don't, and anything happens to Tristan, you will never be able to forgive yourself Damon. Trust me on that.\"\n\nDamon felt his heart begin to beat faster. What if Cole was right? What if something bad had happened to Tristan? Well, what if Tristan had decided he preferred to be with Chloe after all, and they were celebrating with a marathon of sex somewhere? What if...\"\n\n\"Damon, snap out of it. Stop thinking too much and act. What is the worst that could happen? He prefers her so chooses her over you. Big deal!\"\n\n\"What are you now? A fucking mind reader?\" Damon muttered.\n\n\"I could see the wheels turning inside your stupid head by looking at your ugly face dude. You just have to move on if that happens. It will be difficult but you have all of us. We will help you get through it. But what if he needs you right now? Call \u00c9tienne now Damon.\"\n\n\"Okay I'm calling him.\" Damon said dialing \u00c9tienne's number. They were supposed to have gone to the house for dinner but had to cancel when Tristan was not showing.\n\n\u00c9tienne picked up on the first ring. \"Monsieur Reid?\" He said too brightly for someone who was supposed to be sleeping. After all, it was late.\n\n\"\u00c9tienne, I need you to take me to wherever you dropped off Tristan please.\" Damon said.\n\n\"I'm at the parking area Sir. Ready when you are.\" The chauffer replied brightly.\n\n\"What? Why are you still here?\" Damon sounded surprised.\n\n\"Let's just say I didn't trust the little Miss. I've been waiting for this call. Come, let's go bring him home Mr. Reid.\"\n\nDamon laughed softly, feeling lightheaded. It looked like he was the only one who hadn't been thinking of going on a rescue mission. Did he have such little faith in Tristan? Well that stopped now.\n\n\"I'll be there in five minutes \u00c9tienne. Thanks.\"\n\n\"Want me to come with you?\" Cole asked falling into step beside Damon.\n\n\"No. I got this. Thanks buddy.\"\n\n\"Keep me posted. And tell Tristan I said he had better have a good explanation for this ready before I see him in the morning.\" Cole said giving Damon a one-armed hug.\n\n\"Will do. See you later.\" And with that, Damon went to his room to quickly grab his wallet. \n\n\"You better be okay Tris.\" He muttered under his breath.\n\n***\n\n\"Wait here.\" Damon told \u00c9tienne, who looked like he wanted to follow Damon to the door.\n\nDamon pressed the door bell and waited. And boy did he wait. After a really long time, during which he thought no one was home after all, the door swung open to reveal a flushed and disheveled Chloe. She was holding up the covers that was loosely wrapped around her, holding it against her breasts. She looked...freshly fucked. Damon's heart was beating so fast, he wondered whether he was having a heart attack.\n\n\"Uh-huh?\" She said looking like she was irritated for being interrupted from whatever she had been doing.\n\n\"Hi, I'm looking for Tristan. Is he here?\" Damon asked peering discreetly behind Chloe.\n\n\"And you are...\"\n\n\"Damon. His boyfriend.\" Damon said, his expression, blank. \n\n\"Oh. The boyfriend.\" Chloe smirked. \"What do you want with him?\" Her eyes flashed with disdain as she kept the door partially closed and leaned into the jamb.\n\n\"May I come in?\" Damon asked tightly.\n\n\"It's best if you didn't.\" She said looking like she was trying to protect someone. Tristan!\n\nDamon congratulated himself on his outward calm because inside, he was a quivering mess. His brain taunted him with images of his Tristan entwined with Chloe in a heated sexual dance.\n\n\"Please.\" Damon said quietly. \"I promise this won't take but a minute.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" She opened the door wide to allow Damon to enter. \n\nDamon couldn't help but notice Chloe's smug attitude. It was almost as if she had Damon right where she wanted him. He had a feeling something wasn't right but he couldn't put a finger on it. He steeled himself, waiting for his world to come crashing down around him. \n\n\"You can make yourself comfortable.\" Chloe said.\n\n\"Thanks but I don't think that's necessary. Just call Tristan for me and I will be on my way.\" Damon said in a normal voice, not betraying the fact that he was confused and numb inside.\n\n\"Oh but you need to sit for what I'm about to tell you now that you're here.\" Chloe said sitting in the couch and tucking her feet beneath her.\n\n\"Go ahead and talk. I'd rather stand.\" Damon said folding his arms across his chest.\n\n\"Have it your way.\"\n\n\"What did you have to say? I'm all ears.\" Damon said casually.\n\n\"You know Tristan is not gay right? I mean I know you guys probably have sex so you probably think he is. Well he is not. I should know. I'm his girlfriend. You see...we love each other. Whatever he had with you, was just him being adventurous...a fling. So I will urge you...actually we will both be better off if you forget about him and move on. I know who you are. And I know you can easily manipulate and influence people to do what you want. Well, not this time. He is mine and that's how it's going to stay.\"\n\nIt took a while for Damon to realize Chloe had stopped talking. He cocked an eyebrow and cleared his throat.\n\n\"I understand all that you've said. But don't you think it will be more realistic if Tristan told me all this himself? Huh?\"\n\n\"Well he's asleep so you just have to take it from me.\" Chloe retorted.\n\nDamon shrugged. \"I'm not leaving till I see him lady.\"\n\nChloe stared at Damon for a while, and then stood up. \"I just thought I'd spare you the heartache but if you insist, follow me.\" Chloe turned and headed towards what Damon assumed was the bedroom.\"\n\n\"I insist, thank you very much.\" He drawled, following Chloe into her bedroom.\n\nThe sight that met Damon made his breath catch in his throat. Tristan was sprawled on the bed on his stomach, his naked body partially covered with the covers. He was fast asleep. Damon almost turned on his heels and left but had to remind himself that he had told himself before coming that he was going to have faith in Tristan. Much as the obvious was staring him in d face, he still had to hear it from Tristan. He just stood and stared at his lover, sleeping so peacefully, his face looking angelic. He was beautiful. Even at a point when Damon felt like screaming in anger, he couldn't help but admire Tristan. Damon smile humourlessly. \n\n\"So what exactly went on here if I may ask? Is it that he's sleeping because he's drunk, or the sex was too great so he just had to fall asleep?\" Damon asked in a loud voice.\n\nChloe smirked and shrugged daintily. \"What do you think?\"\n\nDamon laughed. \"Yeah. Silly me huh?\" He slapped his hand against his forehead. \"What was I thinking? Of course he probably passed out after some great sex.\"\n\nChloe shrugged again, looking as though she believed Damon had genuinely made a mistake. \n\nSuddenly, Damon felt calm. Whatever was going on there was not as it seemed. For one, Tristan was a very light sleeper. No matter how tired Tristan was, there was no way he would sleep through all that talking. That simply wasn't Tristan.\n\n\"So, care to wake him up? I would like to hear everything from...how do they say it...the horse's own mouth.\" Damon said, inching closer to the bed.\n\n\"That's not necessary. I've already told you all there is to know. Just go and look for another boy-toy.\" Chloe hissed.\n\n\"Ow come on, humour me hon. He's breaking my heart here. The least he could do is tell me himself.\" Damon sat on the bed and shook Tristan gently but he didn't stir.\n\n\"Whew! That must have been some sex.\" Damon muttered. \n\n\"We aim to please. He was obviously not getting anything hot enough.\" She sneered.\n\n\"Obviously not.\" Damon sighed. \"Okay sleepy head. Time to wake up.\" He shook Tristan harder, but he still didn't move. What the fuck! \n\nDamon quickly pressed his fingers to the base of Tristan's neck and gave a sigh of relief when he felt his pulse. He then tapped Tristan on the cheek continuously, calling his name the whole time. When Tristan started stirring slightly, Damon breathed another sigh of relief. He knew Tristan didn't do drugs. But the scene had 'drugs' written all over it as he couldn't smell alcohol.\n\nDamon pulled Tristan's slack body towards him and flipped him to sit on his lap. \"Hey baby, open your eyes.\" Damon said lightly tapping Tristan on his cheek.\n\n\"Damon?\" Tristan said groggily. \n\n\"It's me baby. Look at me.\" Damon said softly. \n\n\"Feel so weak.\" Tristan whispered. \"Drug.\"\n\nThat's when Damon felt it. He felt wetness on his cheeks. He took a swipe at his cheek and realized he had tears on his face. Shit! He didn't remember the last time he had seen his own tears. \n\n\"What did he take?\" He asked Chloe quietly. \n\nWhen Chloe remained silent, Damon looked up at her and saw how terrified she looked. He got all the answer he needed then...she had drugged Tristan \"What the fuck did you give him?\" Damon bellowed, startling Chloe.\n\nChloe whimpered, knowing she had messed up. Tristan had spoken the truth. He and Damon did love each other. She didn't need to be a genius to know how Damon felt about Tristan. It was right there in the way he was acting. \"I...I am so...sorry.\" She started twisting her fingers in the covers wrapped around her. \n\n\"You can be sorry later. Just tell me what you gave him Chloe. Please.\" Damon pleaded. He didn't know what he was going to do if whatever drug had a severe effect on Tristan.\n\n\"Ecstasy.\" Chloe muttered but Damon heard her perfectly.\n\n\"Jesus! How many hours ago did you give it to him.\"\n\n\"I didn't give him much. It was just to make him...\"\n\n\"I know exactly what you wanted from him lady. Just tell me how many hours ago he took them and give me his cloths.\" Damon said dialling Michael's number in the U.S. \n\n\"I...about seven hours ago.\" Chloe said quickly giving Tristan's cloths to Damon who immediately started dressing Tristan up.\n\nMichael picked up on the second ring. \"Jesus don't you sleep Damon?\" Michael laughed on the other end of the phone.\n\n\"I need your help Michael. Tristan has been drugged. Ecstasy.\"\n\n\"Christ, Damon. What the fuck are you idiots do...\"\n\n\"Shut up and listen Dr. Twerp. From what I'm being told he didn't take in a lot. But I'm not comfortable with the way he looks. He took it about seven hours ago.\"\n\n\"Have you checked his pulse?\"\n\n\"It feels normal. He tried to talk and said he felt weak. Hasn't opened his eyes though.\"\n\n\"Is there an increase in his body temperature?\"\n\n\"No, he feels fine.\"\n\n\"What did he take it with? Alcohol?\" Michael asked.\n\n\"What did he take it with?\" Damon asked a quietly sobbing Chloe.\n\n\"Orange juice.\" She said in a small voice. \n\n\"Orange-fucking-juice Michael.\" Damon muttered into the phone which was tucked between his ear and shoulder.\n\n\"Is the person you're talking to the one who drugged him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Damon was busily putting Tristan's cloths back on him.\n\n\"Let me talk to him.\" Michael said.\n\n\"Her.\" Damon growled. \"Hold on.\" Damon handed the phone over to Chloe. \"He's a doctor. You better tell him everything.\"\n\nAfter talking to Michael for a while, during which time Damon finally got everything back on Tristan, Chloe handed the phone back to Damon, looking relieved. But then, she had known Tristan wasn't in any real danger.\n\n\"Don't worry Damon. He will be fine. She gave him just a little. She did give him Hydromorphone when he complained of headache a while after taking in the ecst...\"\n\n\"What the fuck is that?\" Damon bellowed.\n\n\"That's a really strong painkiller. Don't know how she got them. That's probably why he got knocked out. Damon don't panic, he'll be fine. Just keep an eye on him and allow him to sleep it off.\"\n\nBy the time Damon was done talking to Michael, Chloe was dressed. Damon carried Tristan fireman style and stormed out of the bedroom into the hall and headed for the entrance.\n\n\"Are you going to take him to the hospital?\" Chloe asked quietly, handing over Tristan's cell phone which had been switched off, to Damon.\n\n\"For your sake, I hope it doesn't have to come to that. What the fuck did you want to achieve? Is sex so important to you that you would endanger someone's life just to have it?\" Damon asked looking incredulous.\n\nChloe shook her head vigorously. \"It wasn't just for sex. I didn't intend to harm him. I would never do that. I love him.\"\n\n\"And if you had to drug him to have sex, what does that tell you?\" Damon roared. \n\nChloe started sobbing quietly. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nDamon sighed and took pity on the sobbing girl. \"It's okay. He will be fine. He just has to sleep it off. Just don't pull that stunt ever again. You could kill someone. Alight?\"\n\n\"Okay. I'm so sorry. Listen, if it's any consolation, he wouldn't do it. He...\"\n\n\"Wouldn't do what?\" Damon sounded impatient. He just wanted to get out of there.\n\n\"He wouldn't touch me no matter what I did. He wanted to leave but I wouldn't let him. I locked the door and hid the key. I might as well have allowed him to leave because he ended up giving me the highest insult ever. And that really pissed me off.\"\n\nDamon's raised an eyebrow, wondering what his brat had said to piss off the 'nice' lady.\n\nChloe smiled bitterly and whispered. \"He attempted to wank off. Said if I wasn't going to allow him to leave, then he had to take care of himself. \n\n\"Well I'm sure the ecstasy was working.\" Damon muttered.\n\n\"You are missing the point.\" Chloe said in a hard voice. \"He had me. You see, he made it clear immediately he got here, that he loved you and that there was no chance for us. I just wanted to remind him how it was between us but he said he wasn't interested.\" Chloe laughed bitterly. \"He wouldn't even share my favourite wine with me for old times' sake. So I told him to have some orange juice then. He really likes that brand.\"\n\nDamon made a mental note to ask Tristan what brand of orange juice that was.\n\n\"I meant it when I said I didn't mean to harm him.\" Chloe continued, looking at Damon. \"You see, I use Ecstasy all the time. Tristan was never a user. I knew I didn't have to give him much to get him in the mood. And it worked too. Only problem was, he wasn't going to allow me anywhere near his dick, even after he realized I had drugged him and he didn't have any control over his erection. He preferred to take care of his hard-on himself. I saw red. I...I hit him on the head.\"\n\n\"You did what?\" Damon growled, startling Chloe. Damon couldn't stop the anger that was bubbling up within him all over again at that news. \"Are you crazy? Christ!\" Damon placed Tristan in a chair and quickly started checking his head for a cut or a bump. \"What did you hit him with?\" \n\n\"My...my iPad.\" Chloe stuttered. \"He didn't get any cut or swelling. But he did complain of a headache.\"\n\n\"And that's why you gave him the painkiller. Where the fuck did you get those anyway? My friend says you shouldn't have that kind of drug on you.\"\n\n\"A friend gave them to me. I have severe headaches at times.\" She whined.\n\n\"Some friend you got there. They are dangerous and you shouldn't be taking them without a doctor's prescription. Is your friend a doctor?\" Damon asked tightly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You have issues lady. What happened when he took the painkiller?\"\n\n\"He slept some few minutes after. Well I did coax him to go lie in bed so he could at least be comfortable. He was too drowsy to protest.\"\n\n\"Thanks for telling me. I'm still pretty pissed off though. That was a shitty stunt you pulled off.\" Damon bent to pick Tristan up. \"Wait, did you tell my friend you hit Tristan on the head?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm surprised he didn't tell you though.\" Chloe frowned slightly.\n\nDamon gave her a slight smile. \"He probably thought I'd kill you.\"\n\nChloe smiled back at Damon. \"One more thing.\" She said, laughing softly when Damon groaned. \"He was fully clothed when I put him in bed. I stripped him when I saw you at the door.\"\n\n\"You mean all that look,\" Damon pointed at Chloe, referring to how she looked when she opened the door.\n\nChloe nodded sheepishly. \"I thought if I could convince you we were already...you know, then you would break it off with him and I... that sounds stupid now.\" Chloe ended with a groan making Damon laugh. No wonder Chloe had taken so long to open the door when he came.\n\n\"It sure does. Listen we gotta go. But get off the drugs will you? It will destroy you.\" Damon advised.\n\n\"I will.\" Chloe said in a small voice.\n\n\"Promise?\" Damon insisted.\n\n\"Promise.\" Chloe smiled.\n\n\"Good.\" Damon winked at Chloe making her smile through the fresh tears brimming in her eyes.\n\n\"You are a good person. No wonder he loves you so much. Tell him I said I'm sorry will you?\" She said quietly.\n\n\"I will. You take care.\" And with that, Damon stepped out with Tristan tugged safely in his arms.\n\n***\n\nTristan woke up with a groan, feeling his stomach heave and knew he was going to throw up. Crap! He quickly rolled off the bed and staggered into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before he was retching violently. Damon was hot on his heels. He held Tristan throughout, messaging his back and murmured soothingly to him as horrible dry heaves wracked his body. Tristan tried awkwardly to push Damon away, but he wouldn't move. \n\nTristan's head hanged over the toilet as he panted for breath. As soon as he knew he wasn't going to bring out anything again, he sat back against Damon's chest and laid the back of his head on his shoulder, loving the feel of Damon's fingers running through his hair. They stayed like that till Tristan's breath was back under control.",
        "\"Better?\" Damon asked softly.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Tristan croaked. \"I want to take a shower.\"\n\n\"I think you'll be better off in the bath tub baby.\" Damon said.\n\n\"No, I prefer the shower. Don't wanna fall asleep in the tub.\" Tristan countered. \n\n\"Okay but I'm getting into the shower with you. Wouldn't want you falling and cracking that empty head of yours.\"\n\n\"Pervert.\" Tristan murmured making Damon roar with laughter. \"Wanna brush my teeth first.\"\n\nWith Damon's help, Tristan made it safely to his feet. Swaying slightly, he drifted into Damon's warm, solid embrace and buried his face in the hollow of Damon's throat.\n\n\"We need to get some food into you Tris. And water. Lots of water.\"\n\nTristan groaned at the thought of food. \"I don't wanna eat.\" He whined.\n\n\"Well you've gotta. You need your strength back. Come on.\" Damon helped Tristan to the sink counter so he could brush his teeth whilst he took off his own cloths. He had already showered but wanted to get in there again with Tristan. He wasn't going to take any chances. Tristan wasn't going to crack his skull in addition to everything that had happened. Not on his watch.\n\nAfter Tristan finished brushing his teeth, Damon pulled off his boxer briefs and led him into the shower.\n\n\"Lean on me.\" Damon instructed.\n\nTristan laughed softly. \"I'm not that weak you know.\"\n\n\"Just do it.\" Damon chuckled, pulling Tristan to lean on him with Tristan's back against his front.\n\nHe proceeded to wash both Tristan's hair and body thoroughly, using a washcloth at Tristan's request. Tristan sighed and closed his eyes, enjoying Damon's ministrations. It felt heavenly. When Damon messaged his scalp, it felt so damn good Tristan moaned, reminding Damon of the last time they had been in a shower together and what had happened. \n\n\"Shit!\" Damon cursed softly under his breath when he felt his cock start to harden. \"Turn around.\" Damon's voice was husky.\n\nTristan turned around and curled his arms around Damon's neck. He looked up into Damon's eyes and smirked, immediately recognizing that look. Arousal. When Damon's big, strong arm circled Tristan's waist, bringing his body flush against his, he couldn't miss that rock hard, hot, thick cock pressed against Damon's belly.\n\n\"Told you you're a pervert.\" Tristan chuckled. \"Taking advantage of a helpless man.\"\n\n\"Fuck you.\" Damon laughed. \"I can't help myself.\"\n\nTristan buried his face in Damon's neck and licked at the water on his skin. He dropped a kiss on Damon's neck making him shiver. Then he licked the skin from Damon's collarbone up to his ear, drawing a tortured moan from Damon.\n\n\"Tris...\"\n\n\"Shhh...\" Tristan whispered against Damon's lips and proceeded to kiss the living daylights out of him.\n\nDamon hissed as Tristan's hand snaked down between them, to close around his hard cock. \n\n\"Baby, don't start something you can't finish.\" Damon groaned.\n\n\"Shut up.\" Tristan muttered. \n\nTristan stroked Damon slowly, watching his eyes rolled back in his head. His mouth skated over Damon's lightly at first, then deeper, teasing his tongue against Damon's, sucking on it, stroking it until Damon moaned into his mouth. As he kissed Damon, Tristan's hand sped up slightly, his thumb running over Damon's barbell. Sudden heat suffused Damon's entire body and his balls got tight and high, showing just how close he was to shooting his load. With a fierce growl into Tristan's mouth, Damon moved a hand between them to cover the hand Tristan was stroking him with. He wrapped his hand tightly around Tristan's and squeezed, quickening his stroking. \n\nDamon jerked fast and rough with both their hands, moaning brokenly into the kiss as desire unfurled hot and deep in his chest and then spiralled lower, urgent and demanding. He couldn't think, couldn't breathe... He tore his lips from Tristan and cried out Tristan's name as he shot warm spurts of cum unto their hands, his body writhing and twitching throughout his climax.\n\n\"Christ...\" Damon choked out, as he squeezed his eyes closed and tilted his head back to rest against the tiled wall behind him.\n\nTristan curved a hand around Damon's neck and pulled him into another kiss. When they both came up for air, Tristan moved his lips along Damon's jaw, dropping tiny kisses. \"Thanks for coming to my rescue.\" He whispered into Damon's ear.\n\n\"You're welcome. Just don't scare me like that again. Please.\" Damon said still trying to catch his breath.\n\nTristan dropped a kiss on Damon's lips. \"I'll try.\" Tristan said chuckling at Damon's dazed look.\n\n\"Baby should I...\" Damon started.\n\n\"No. Rain check?\" Tristan whispered.\n\n\"Okay. Come on, let's get some food into you.\" Damon shut off the spray and led Tristan out of the shower.\n\n***\n\nAfter ensuring that Tristan had eaten a good meal, Damon insisted on Tristan getting back into bed. \n\n\"I've slept enough Damon. I just want to relax...sitting up if you don't mind.\" He muttered.\n\n\"Relaxing it is.\" Damon said, scooting back on the bed till his back was pressed against the headboard. \"Come here.\"\n\nDamon drew Tristan into his lap. Tristan leaned sideways against Damon and rested the side of his face against Damon's chest. He shuddered as he felt Damon's arm curl around his waist, holding him securely, whilst the other rubbed his back soothingly. \n\n\"So you were really going to jack off when you had a willing beautiful hottie begging for it.\" Damon murmured against Tristan's hair. \"How disappointing.\"\n\nTristan burst into laughter, his body shaking with mirth. \"She told you that?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" Damon chuckled. \"That was very insulting you know.\"\n\n\"You wanted me to take her up on her offer?\" Tristan sounded incredulous. He raised up his head to look at Damon.\n\n\"Hell no. Just kidding.\" Damon made a horror-stricken face making Tristan laugh even harder. \"Thanks.\" Damon added softly.\n\n\"You are most welcome.\" Tristan chuckled laying his head back on Damon's chest.\n\nDamon still couldn't get over what Tristan had done...or not done. That must have taken some serious will power. For a highly sexed person such as Tristan, that was really something. And all for him. Damon felt humbled.\n\n\"I'm sorry for all the shit I said during our argument.\" Damon said quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry too.\" Tristan sighed. \"For what I said. I didn't mean it.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Damon murmured. \"And I take everything I said on the plane, back.\" Damon added.\n\nTristan was quiet for a while, then asked mischievously. \"Even the declarations of love?\"\n\nDamon laughed. \"Hey I'm serious here. I...I have never been that jealous in my life as I was in that club Tris. I hated that feeling. And it made me angry. Angry at you. Made me say things I shouldn't have. Made me act like a kid. I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"Being jealous where someone you love is concerned, doesn't make you a kid. It simply means you're human Damon.\"\n\n\"I know that now. I take what I said back. Forgive me?\"\n\n\"No. You have to grovel first, then I get to torture you, then you'll have to grovel some more, then I'll...\"\n\n\"What if I just set Chloe on you?\" Damon asked innocently, then burst into laughter when Tristan groaned. \"How much do you remember of what went down anyway?\"\n\n\"Hmmm. Pretty much everything. Right from the point where Cole threatened to beat me to an inch of my life if I hurt you, to the point where Chloe clocked me on the head.\"\n\n\"He did what? When?\" Damon couldn't keep the amusement out of his voice.\n\nTristan laughed softly. \"You don't have to sound so happy dude. That was my life he was threatening. Right after I left this room to go to Chloe.\"\n\n\"God, I love that guy.\" Damon laughed.\n\n\"Should I be worried?\" Tristan gave a mock growl.\n\nDamon laughed. \"That's a different kind of love dickhead.\"\n\nTristan laughed. \"I also remember \u00c9tienne muttering curses that would have made a sailor blush on our way back here, and you squeezing the life out of me with your arms. Did you think I was going to disappear or something?\" Tristan couldn't help teasing. \n\n\"You have no idea how I felt. Grateful to God that you were okay, angry at myself for doubting you even for a second, and a whole lot of other feelings. I'm sorry for cracking your bones.\" Damon pressed a kiss into Tristan's hair.\n\n\"I'm guessing Chloe told you everything that happened.\" Tristan asked sounding serious again.\n\n\"Yeah. You should have encouraged her to stop using, Tris. That shit will destroy her if she doesn't stop.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I didn't? I hate drugs Damon. My system doesn't handle it well. I react to even the mildest of painkillers. So naturally, I used to tell her all the time that I was okay without drugs and she could be too. Her friend works with a big pharmaceutical company here in France, and supplies her with all the dangerous drugs.\"\n\n\"That Raoul fellow?\"\n\n\"The one and only. She's a big girl. She can take care of herself. I'm just pissed off for what she did to me. She knows I hate any kind of drug.\"\n\n\"At least she gave you your favourite orange juice.\" Damon teased, trying to lighten up Tristan's mood.\n\nTristan laughed. \"So tell me from the point you entered this shitty drama.\"\n\nSilent, the only sound his soft breathing; Tristan lay unmoving against Damon as he told him everything.\n\nTristan sighed when Damon finished with his rescue story. \"She heard about us before we came to France Damon. And it was driving her insane.\" Tristan said softly.\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\n\"You can say that again. You should have seen what she did. She's known me for a long time Damon, and she knows just how to get me hot and bothered. I really wanted to leave but she wouldn't let me.\"\n\n\"Hey relax. Hell I'm sure even without drugs, I would find it difficult to resist a hot chic like Chloe. You need a medal baby.\" Damon chuckled.\n\nTristan laughed. \"What can I say? You've ruined me for any other person. You sure she didn't do anything when I pass...\"\n\n\"Dude, you were so out of it even the hottest porn stars couldn't have gotten your dick up.\"\n\n\"Shit! Maybe it doesn't work anymore.\" Tristan groaned.\n\n\"You had a semi in the shower not too long ago fucker. It works alright...\" \n\n\"Maybe we should make sure.\" Tristan said, turning to straddle Damon and getting right in his face.\"\n\nDamon laughed just as his phone rang. He picked it up and looked at the caller ID. \"Michael.\"\n\n\"Hey doc.\" Damon gave Tristan a quick peck on the lips. \"Yes he's okay. I'm putting you on speaker.\"\n\n\"Tristan?\" Michael's voice was loud and clear as though he were in the room with them.\n\n\"Hey Michael.\" \n\n\"What the fuck were you thinking hanging out with psychos?\" Michael bellowed and both Damon and Tristan winced. \"And that idiot Damon allowed it. What the fuck is wrong with you people. Do you have any idea what that painkiller could have done to you?\"\n\n\"Michael you said he was ok...\" Damon started.\n\n\"Of course I had to say that you moron. You were getting hysterical. I didn't want you having a heart attack or anything. The psycho chic did tell me the dosage she gave him and I believed her. What I found strange was how hard it knocked Tristan out. It shouldn't have. And what the fuck did you do to her to drive her to violence Tristan? Dean is on his way there and you guys had better tell him something sensible.\"\n\n\"Ow come on Jackass, what happened to doctor-patient confi...\"\n\n\"You're not my fucking patients. You're family. Dean is on his way to Belgium. He wants to see for himself whether Tristan is okay. And you, Papa Bear, had better stay out of his way whilst he's there or else...\"\n\n\"Or else what?\" Damon growled.\n\n\"Don't say I didn't warn you. This happened on your watch. And that idiot Cole too. Tristan?\"\n\n\"Yes Michael.\" Tristan was trying very hard to suppress his laughter.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" Michael snapped back into doctor mode.\n\n\"I'm good.\"\n\n\"No nausea, constipation, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, vomiting?\"\n\n\"I did throw up this morning. But it was just once. And I do have a slight headache.\"\n\n\"Damon, don't you have Tylenol or Advil?\" Michael asked.\n\n\"His system doesn't take kindly to drugs. Any drugs. Even the mildest ones.\" Damon drawled.\n\n\"That explains it. No wonder he passed out like that. Why the fuck didn't you tell me?\"\n\nDamon rolled his eyes. \"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"Are you taking in enough fluids Tristan?\"\n\n\"Yes doc.\"\n\n\"Cut the doc shit. Make sure you have a lot of rest okay? And no fucking. You had enough on that plane to last you a lifetime I'm sure. Just sleep.\"\n\n\"You do know I came here to work right?\" Tristan asked just as Damon was muttering that he was going to kill Chris.\n\n\"Hey, kiss my arse. If you were there to work, why the fuck were you hanging out with a drug addict? I've gotta go. Working late today. Talk to you guys later.\"\n\n\"How are Mary and Melissa doing?\" Damon asked about Michael's wife and daughter.\n\n\"Terrorizing me. But who am I to complain?\"\n\nDamon laughed. \"My love to them.\"\n\n\"I'll tell them. Tristan?\"\n\n\"Yes Michael?\"\n\n\"Rest. Bye.\"\n\n\"Bye.\" Both Damon and Tristan answered, disconnected the line, and burst into laughter.\n\n\"Your friends are nuts.\" Tristan said, kissing Damon on the chin. \n\n\"Tell me about it.\"\n\nTristan leaned forward till his face was real close to Damon's, then slowly and erotically, licked a corner of Damon's mouth with the tip of his tongue, causing Damon to gasp and moan at the same time, his cock jerking inside his pants.\n\n\"Damn Tris,\" Damon murmured huskily, \"didn't you hear a thing Michael said?\"\n\n\"Fuck Michael. If he really wanted me off sex, he shouldn't have mentioned the plane. What do you say we go for a swim?\" Tristan husked grinding on Damon's rapidly stiffening cock.\n\n\"Oh shit bay...\"\n\n\"Damon?\" They heard Cole call out from outside, knocking on their door.\"\n\nBoth Damon and Tristan groaned. \"This is fuckin' unbelievable. Why the fuck do we always get interrupted when I get into this position?\" Tristan groaned, getting off Damon. \"Are you going to go get that?\" He asked Damon, making a beeline for the bathroom.\n\n\"And what are you going to do there?\" Damon asked, getting off the bed and adjusting himself.\n\n\"I'm going to pee, dummy.\" Tristan muttered.\n\n\"With you, one can't be too sure these days.\" Damon chuckled, obviously referring to Tristan's wanking episode.\n\n\"I heard that asshole.\" Tristan called out from the bathroom.\n\n\"You were meant to.\" Damon laughed, going to the living room to let Cole and Briana in.\n\n***\n\nDamon and Tristan were alone in the private pool of the resort. That particular section of the pool was reserved for couples or friends who wanted their privacy. Cole and Briana had gone out after Briana fussed over Tristan like a mother hen, asking him every other minute whether he needed anything.\n\n\"Know what Cole,\" Tristan had told Cole, \"You're lucky you've put a ring on that finger. I would have put one there myself.\"\n\n\"Hey, what about me?\" Damon had asked with mock indignation. \n\n\"You want to put a ring on her finger too?\" Tristan had asked giving his best innocent look.\n\n\"Wiseass.\" Damon laughed with the others, pulling Tristan to him and giving him an open-mouthed, hot kiss.\n\n\"And he says we like kissing.\" Cole muttered, standing up and drawing a laughing Briana up.\n\n\"What time are you guys coming back?\" Damon asked breathlessly when he came up for air.\n\n\"We should be back by two p.m.\" Cole responded. \n\n\"Cool. We'll be at the private pool are then.\" Damon said.\n\n\"Dude, I said two p.m. Don't forget. We wouldn't wanna walk in on anything...x-rated.\" Cole said with a smirk, making everyone laugh.\n\n\"Speak for yourself Cole.\" Briana said with a naughty chuckle.\n\n\"Oh I wouldn't mind giving you a private show anytime Honey. Just name when and where.\" Tristan drawled, blowing Briana a kiss. She blew one right back.\n\n\"Fuck you Tristan.\" Cole laughed, pulling a laughing Briana after him.\n\nNow Damon and Tristan were having a great time, swimming laps in the pool. The water felt great on their skin. After a while Damon swam to the shallow end of the pool and stood with his back to the wall, watching Tristan swim. Tristan was doing butterfly strokes like a professional and Damon thought he was a really good swimmer. \n\n\"Show-off.\" He called out to Tristan. He obviously loved being in water.\n\nDamon looked at Tristan's body hungrily as he moved in the water. He looked simply stunning. Damon's phone rang then, interrupting the lewd thoughts he had started having about his boyfriend. It was Caleb Thomas.\n\nTristan started swimming up to Damon to tell him off for calling him a show-off, but then saw Damon on the phone. He took in how water ran off Damon, making his skin shine. The water reached up to Damon's stomach but Tristan could clearly see Damon's impressive bulge in his sky blue trunks which hugged him like a second skin. Tristan's mouth watered and a naughty grin spread across his handsome face. He dived underwater and swam towards Damon.\n\nDamon was busily talking to Tristan's father when he felt something lightly bite him on the dick.\n\n\"What the fuc...\" He jumped but hands held his hips to steady him. Tristan. \n\n\"What is it Damon?\" Caleb asked. \"You okay?\"\n\n\"Yes I'm good. Just stepped on something...pointy. I'll live.\" Damon chocked out.\n\nTristan smiled to himself. If only whoever Damon was talking to could see through the phone. Ignoring Damon's hand which was trying to push him away, Tristan pulled down Damon's trunks to his thighs and took the huge pierced mushroom head into his hot mouth. \n\nDamon's eyes opened wide as he felt the hot smooth mouth engulf his cock. He didn't dare make a sound. What the fuck was Tristan playing at? He was talking to his father for goodness' sake.\n\nTristan began to lick the tip of Damon's rapidly hardening cock, then placing his hands on Damon's arse cheeks, he pulled him deeper into his mouth. Damon couldn't stop the gasp that escaped his mouth when his cock slid into Tristan's mouth and heat engulfed him.\n\n\"Damon?\" Caleb voice was full of concern.\n\n\"Ahh... I think I cut my feet.\" He mumbled.\n\n\"Where are you at the moment?\" Caleb asked.\n\n\"What?\" Damon sounded confused. Was that a trick question? \"On the beach.\" His voice sounded gruff even to his own ears.\n\n\"Good.\" Came Caleb's voice. \"Just step into the water and allow the salt to wash the cut. It will heal faster.\"\n\n\"Okay thanks.\" Damon said breathlessly, his head thrown back in ecstasy. He was going to kill Tristan. But even as he was thinking of ways to kill Tristan, Damon's hand was moving to Tristan's bobbing head and twining his fingers in the wet locks. When Tristan moaned deep in his throat, the sound sent a pleasurable tingling throughout Damon's entire body.\n\n\"Fuck!\" He gasped uncontrollably.\n\nCaleb laughed on the other end of the phone. \"Hey don't be a baby. I know it stings but it's better for you.\" Then Tristan's father went right ahead and delved into more business, having no clue as to the scene unfolding on Damon's end of the phone. Afterwards, Damon couldn't fathom how he was able to make the right sounds to create the impression that he was listening to Caleb. 'Cause he didn't hear a word the older man said. \n\nWhat made the whole experience even more exhilarating was the fact that, Tristan was doing it underwater. He would come up once in a while to draw in breath, but Damon never even notice those moments because Tristan's hand always automatically took over.\n\nWhen Tristan pulled him even deeper into his throat and swallowed around his cock, Damon didn't have any choice but to end the call. He pulled Tristan off his cock, bringing his head above water.\n\n\"Caleb can I please call you back? I need to take care of this. It's...distracting.\" Damon said in a voice that sounded almost painful, watching Tristan's eyes widen at the mention of his father's name.\n\n\"Sure, sure. Talk to you later. Say hi to T.T.\" The older man said and hanged up.",
        "Damon threw the phone down, not caring that it almost fell into the pool. He turned so that Tristan's back was to the pool wall, and for the very first time, fucked Tristan without lube.\n\nFor Tristan, it was one of the most memorable fucks of his life. When Damon caught him between the wall and his firm, sexy body and pulled his swimming trunks off his body in one fluid movement, he just knew he was in for it. Damon held Tristan firmly around his waist with one arm and stared intently into his aroused green eyes.\n\n\"Wrap your legs around my hips.\" Damon commanded in a rough, deep, dark and sexy voice, which made Tristan shiver with excitement. \"You finally get your wish.\" Damon growled as he reached behind Tristan to circle his puckered hole with his fingers. \"I don't have any lube here, and I can't wait.\"\n\n\"Make my day.\" Tristan moaned. \n\nWhen Damon started pushing his fingers into Tristan's tight hole, he made a lusty sound between a sob and a moan which went straight to Damon's cock. Moving slowly, on the invading fingers inside him, Tristan threw his head back in bliss, exposing the sexy line of his throat. \n\nLooking at Tristan, Damon's breath hitched in his throat. With his lips slightly parted, and his breath coming out in gasps, Tristan looked so sexy Damon was sent into a liquid meltdown.\n\n\"God, Tris.\" Damon choked, bumping his forehead against Tristan's briefly. \n\nDamon slipped his fingers out and Tristan felt the massive head of his cock press against his wet hole. Damon slowly pushed into him, the water around them making the penetration easy. The head slid past the entrance and began to enter till Tristan was impaled to the hilt on Damon's stiff cock.\n\n\"Oh my God!\" Tristan gasped, shivering all over as his body adjusted to the heavy invading length. \n\nBlindly Tristan turned his head to seek out Damon's mouth. When he found Damon's lips, they shared a hot, wet kiss as their laboured breathing mingled.\n\n\"Hang on.\" Damon said against Tristan's lips, looking into his glazed eyes. \n\nKeeping an arm securely around Tristan, Damon held on to the railing beside Tristan with his other hand. He pulled out and then thrust his hips forwards once again, entering Tristan with his whole length, quickly finding a rhythm. \n\nTristan tried to suppress the urge to cry out in ecstasy when he felt that wicked barbell pressing and then sliding on his prostate. He buried his face against Damon's neck and nipped at his skin with his teeth, making Damon swear and pound even harder into him with escalating urgency. Damon nailed Tristan's prostate, fucking him like he was never, ever going to stop. They were so far gone on each other that even if someone had entered the pool area, they wouldn't have noticed or been able to stop. Damon thanked his stars at the back of his mind that they had the place to themselves. \n\nTristan hanged on for dear life as Damon surged out then back inside him with deep thrusts. He fisted his fingers in Damon's hair and stifled his moans against his neck, the sensations running through him too pleasurable and intense. With his button being massaged with each thrust of Damon's cock, and his cock getting a thorough rub between their bodies, Tristan was reduced to a quivering mess. It felt good. Amazing. Tristan lifted his head and yanked Damon's head down by his hair, capturing his mouth in a fierce kiss as he pounded inside. \n\n\"This is so good Damon.\" He gasped brokenly against Damon's lips.\n\nWith a low growl, Damon whispered those words that never ceased to melt Tristan, into his ears. \"I love you.\" Damon's tongue traced the shell of Tristan's ear, then fucked that ear erotically, mimicking the thrusting of his cock...Tristan flew apart.\n\nHe sank his teeth into Damon's neck to stop the scream that was bubbling up from within him as he shot between them. His mind blanked and every inch of his body tightened as bliss coursed through his entire body.\n\nTristan's legs gripped Damon harder as he clenched Damon's driving cock with his contracting channel. Damon kept thrusting into him faster and faster, rubbing that pleasure button. Tristan tore his mouth away from Damon's neck to frantically give a low wail and bucked against Damon as an even stronger toe-curling orgasm shot through him. \n\n\"Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!\" Tristan chanted, his orgasm rolling over him in waves.\n\nThe delicious squeezing of Tristan channel along Damon's cock was driving Damon out of his mind. A moan tore through his chest and he shook all over as he started to pulse. With a groan, he slanted his head and took Tristan's mouth in a mind-numbing kiss, moving faster, thrusting harder, his breath laboured and his whole body quivered with pleasure as he started shooting into Tristan. \n\n\"Fuck, Tris,\" he growled against Tristan's mouth as he kept thrusting, riding out his orgasm. \n\nEven when he finished shooting, Damon kept gliding in and out as he kissed Tristan deep but soft and sweet. Tristan tightened his legs and arms around him and kissed him back. They clung together, trying to catch their breath as the water swished around them. \n\n\"That was incredible.\" Tristan gasped. He had come so hard it took several minutes for his mind to start working again. \"You are amazing.\" He whispered, still riding his orgasmic high.\n\nDamon stared at Tristan, his eyes closing briefly as emotions washed over him. He loved him so much. Loved him in ways he didn't think was possible. Tristan was his life. He was feeling so emotional he didn't trust himself to speak. \n\n\"Damon?\" Tristan frowned at Damon, wondering why he was staring at him.\n\n\"I was talking to your father Tris.\" Damon murmured. \n\nTristan burst into uncontrollable laughter. \"I didn't know. Honest!\" He continued laughing, unwinding his legs from around Damon and standing on shaky legs. He still clung to Damon.\n\nDamon laughed and shook his head, looking around. \"What am I going to do with you?\" he muttered.\n\n\"I like what you're doing so far.\" Tristan murmured, all traces of humour gone. \"Don't ever let me go Damon.\" He looked up at Damon with eyes full of love.\n\nDamon felt a lurching sensation in his chest at Tristan's words. He couldn't even begin to describe the emotions Tristan aroused in him. Tristan could bring him to his knees with a smile, make his heart swell with no more than a look from those gorgeous green eyes. He belonged to him, heart and soul. Damon's gorgeous, blue eyes locked on Tristan's with a look so heated and intense, Tristan gasped. \n\n\"Damon...\" Tristan watched the emotions roll through Damon's expression.\n\nIn all their time together, Damon had never looked at him in that way before. Yes he sometimes looked at him like he wanted to devour him and other times, with so much love, but nothing quite like that very moment.\n\n\"Marry me.\" Damon's voice was thick with emotion. He couldn't have stopped those words even if he had wanted to. He hadn't planned on asking Tristan. It suddenly felt like he had to stake his claim, had to let the world know who he belonged to, had to... \"Please.\"\n\n\"What?\" Tristan's mind went numb and he started shaking so bad.\n\n\"Marry me Tris. Make me the happiest man alive. I can't live without you. I don't want to live without you by my side. I'd rather die.\"\n\nTristan's eyes drifted shut and tears, which had gathered in his eyes without his knowledge, promptly and silently slid down his cheeks. The feeling causing through him that very moment could only be described as overwhelming joy and happiness. Hearing Damon say he wanted to spend the rest of his life with him gave Tristan such a euphoric feeling, nothing in the world compared to it.\n\nDamon watched Tristan for some seconds, tightening his hold on him. His heart was pounding. He felt as though his life would be over if Tristan turned him down. When Tristan opened his eyes to look at him, Damon poured his heart out.\n\n\"I would never be complete without you Tris. I need you like I need air. Contrary to what you think, not only would I fight for you, I would kill for you. I would even die for you because I am nothing without you.\" Damon's throat clogged with emotion and he swallowed. \"For me, love pales in comparison to what I feel for you. You are my world Tristan Thomas. Marry me my love. Be mine for eternity. Just...be mine. Please.\" \n\nAt Damon's soft plea, Tristan's arms tightened around his neck and one of his hands sifted up into Damon's short hair. \n\nTristan gave Damon a gentle, radiant smile and whispered, \"I'm yours.\"\n\nThen pulling Damon's head down, Tristan kissed him slowly, deeply and passionately. Damon was so overwhelmed with emotions he wasn't surprised when he felt wetness on his cheeks.\n\n\"Is that a yes?\" He whispered.\n\n\"What do you think?\" Tristan retorted, licking at Damon's lips.\n\n\"Tris...\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes.\" Tristan interspaced each 'yes' with a kiss. \"There's no one else I'd like better to grow old alongside.\n\nDamon hadn't known just how tense he had been, waiting for that three letter word. And when Tristan added the bit about growing old with him, Damon was so overcome with emotions he let out a deep breath and with it a sob. Then he buried his face in Tristan's neck and cried. Tristan held and rocked Damon throughout his sobbing. \n\nAt a point, he reached down and pulled up Damon's swim trunks, which was still around his thighs. He was so going to remember this day forever. The day Damon proposed to him and cried his heart out...bare-assed. Tristan smiled to himself, feeling overwhelming love for the man in his arms. When Damon eventually quieted down, he raised his head and smiled at Tristan, who busily wiped at Damon's wet cheeks. \n\n\"Thanks. For covering my arse.\"\n\nTristan smiled. \"You're welcome. Are you okay?\" Tristan asked softly.\n\n\"Never better my love. Never better.\" Damon said pecking Tristan on the lips.\n\nDamon picked Tristan up and sat him on the edge of the pool. Then he dived in and came back with Tristan's trunks. He put it on Tristan and hugged him tight and kissed him. This kiss was slow, unhurried and sensuous.\n\n\"I love you so much.\" Tristan whispered when they broke apart, staring up at Damon with his heart in his eyes.\n\n\"I know. And love you.\" Damon whispered back, still clutching Tristan to his chest.\n\nWhat Damon said next made Tristan's heart pound so hard he gasped.\n\n\"Let's do it here. In France.\"\n\n\"Wh...what?\" Tristan stuttered, shocked.\n\n\"Let's get married here before we go back home. It's legal here. And Cole and Briana can be our witnesses. Please Tristan. I don't want to wait.\" Damon pleaded.\n\n\"My parents...\"\n\n\"I will ask them when we get back to the room. You can ask my mum.\" Damon's eyes were so hopeful and eager. \n\nLooking into those gorgeous blue eyes, Tristan knew he couldn't possible deny him anything.\n\n\"Let's do this.\" Tristan said with a gleeful laugh. \"Can't wait to see the look on Addie's face. I'm gonna get hitched before she does. She will be pissed!\" Tristan laughed.\n\n\"We will throw the biggest party when we get back home. Oh God, I can't wait to make you legally mine baby.\" Damon said hugging Tristan to him.\n\nAnd that's the position Cole found then in when he entered the pool area.\n\n\"Hey guys.\" Cole greeted sitting on the edge beside Tristan. \"Wow that's a big one.\" Cole said staring at the huge hickey on Damon's neck.\n\n\"Jackass.\" Damon said whilst Tristan laughed. \"Where's Briana?\"\n\n\"Going to call her to come.\" Cole said taking out his phone. \"Wanted to make sure the coast was clear.\" He smirked whilst the other two laughed.\n\nThe two couples relaxed on the lounge chaises with drinks whilst their lunch was being set up.\n\n\"What's up with you Tristan?\" Briana asked. \"You have this permanent smile on your face.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Tristan asked surprised.\n\n\"Probably has something to do with this idiot here.\" Cole said pointing at Damon. \"You can't seem to take your eyes off Tristan dude. Is there something we should know about?\" Cole asked looking at Damon.\n\n\"What the hell,\" Damon muttered, and then his face broke out into the most brilliant smile, \"Tristan agreed to marry me.\" He blurted out.\n\nBriana screamed and jumped onto Tristan whilst Cole pumped Damon's hand, looking happy for the two.\n\n\"Congrats you two.\" Cole said, moving over to Tristan's lounge chaise and pulling a still screaming Briana off him, who promptly ran into Damon's arms. Then he pulled Tristan into his arms and hugged him tightly. \"Thanks.\" Cole murmured into Tristan's ear. And just like that, Tristan got teary eyed.\n\n\"Shit.\" Tristan muttered, rubbing his eyes. \"Thanks for having faith in me Cole. He told me what you said to make him come 'rescue' me.\"\n\n\"He was already dying to come.\" Cole shook his head at Tristan. \"I merely gave him the push. I wish you two the very best.\" Cole said hugging Tristan again.\n\nThe four of them shared a bottle of champagne with their food, feeling thankful and happy for the soon to be married couple.\n\n***\n\n\"You sure about this son?\" Caleb Thomas asked his son in a hoarse voice. Stephanie Thomas rubbed her husband on the back, seeing how emotional he was getting.\n\n\"Yes Dad. I want this.\" Tristan answered in a shaky voice, holding tightly onto Damon's hand whilst talking to his father.\n\n\"Okay. Put Damon back on.\" Caleb said.\n\n\"Caleb?\" Damon said tentatively. He was shaking with nerves.\n\n\"You know the drill. We already understand each other don't we?\" The older man asked quietly.\n\n\"We do. I won't let you down Sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Hold on and talk to Stephanie.\"\n\nTristan's mother came on the line sounding breathless. \"Damon?\"\n\n\"Hello Stephanie.\"\n\n\"Have you already made an appointment at the City Hall?\" She jumped right into it.\n\n\"I've pulled some strings. Everything is done. We do this tomorrow at four p.m. Stephanie.\"\n\nStephanie Thomas laughed softly. \"That's okay then. I'll be there.\"\n\n\"Ow come on St...\"\n\n\"Shhh. Don't let Tristan know. I want to surprise him. Now quickly say something else to explain why you started protesting. Think fast.\"\n\nDamon's mind was spinning so fast, he was sure his head was physically spinning. \"Sure. We use protection all the time.\" Damon blurted out.\n\nWhilst Tristan groaned beside Damon, Stephanie laughed on the other side.\n\n\"You don't use any do you?\" Stephanie asked, wiping tears of mirth from her eyes.\n\n\"No.\" Damon replied, laughing.\n\n\"See you tomorrow. Now let me talk to my son.\"\n\nAfter talking to Stephanie, they called Lydia who promptly said she was getting on the next flight to Paris. Nothing Damon said would stop her.\n\n\"At least you get to do this with your mum beside you.\" Tristan said pitifully, rolling unto his stomach on the bed. \n\nDamon felt a feeling of sadness wash over him at Tristan's words and crestfallen look. He couldn't stand it. \"Stephanie is coming. It was supposed to be a surprise. Now you have to act surprised when you see her.\" Damon blurted out.\n\nThe thrilled look on Tristan's face was worth spilling the beans. \"At what point did she say that? I was sitting beside you the whole time.\"\n\nDamon just shrugged. Tristan's eyes widened when it dawned on him.\n\n\"She didn't really ask about protection did she?\"\n\n\"Nope. I was supposed to make something up to cover my blunder or protests or whatever. That's what came to mind.\" Damon laughed.\n\n\"You're a lousy liar. I bet she didn't believe you.\"\n\n\"No she didn't.\" Damon roared with laughter. \"But then, your mum has always been smart.\"\n\n\"I can't wait for tomorrow.\" Tristan squealed in delight. \"When is Dean getting here?\" \n\n\"Tomorrow morning. Why?\" Damon asked running his fingers through Tristan's hair.\n\n\"I want him to witness with my mum on my behalf. Then your mum and Cole can witness for you.\"\n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\n\"What are we going to be called?\" Tristan turned to face Damon.\n\n\"Whatever you want love. Tell me what you want.\" Damon asked, pulling Tristan to lie on him, Tristan's chin resting on Damon's chest.\n\nTristan turned his head to lay his cheek on Damon's chest as he thought, enjoying Damon's fingers running through his hair.\n\n\"I want to take your name Damon. Tristan Thomas Reid. Want to maintain my T.T. What do you think?\" \n\n\"Thomas Reid it is. Damon Thomas Reid. I love it.\" Damon smiled tremulously. He had never been happier in his life.\n\n\"I love you.\" Tristan whispered.\n\n\"Right back at you. Damon whispered.\n\n***\n\nTristan called it 'The Friday to Remember'. Indeed it was a day both Damon and Tristan would never forget. Their wedding day. It was a simple, quick, touching and lovely ceremony. It was an all-white casual affair. Everybody present was dressed casually in white including Damon and Tristan. Damon looked sexy in white linen pants, an un-tucked white long sleeved button down shirt with the three top buttons opened, and white loafers. Tristan looked simply delicious in white khaki pants with an un-tucked white shirt and a white blazer, completing the look with a classy white six Inch premium boots. They both looked drop dead gorgeous.\n\nThe sheer beauty of their designer wedding bands made the people gathered gasp. The 7.5mm comfort fit band was made of exceptional 950 platinum. The classic eternity style platinum ring had 36 channel set black diamonds encircling its form. The inscription inside both rings simply read: ALWAYS & FOREVER. D.T.R & T.T.R. The ring was bold, tastefully luxurious and understandably expensive. It was simply stunning.\n\nWhen Damon and Tristan read the heartfelt vows each had written, there was no dry eye in the marriage chamber of the City Hall. Tristan blushed so hard when the reverend who officiated over the nuptials, finally pronounced them husband and husband and asked them to kiss each other.\n\n\"Really? Blushing? One would think you've never ever kissed me in front of these people.\" Damon chuckled against Tristan's lips.\n\n\"Well I've never kissed you in front of the rever...\"\n\nDamon silenced Tristan by sealing their lips together and giving Tristan a spine tingling kiss, to which everyone gathered cheered. Then everyone was hugging them and wishing them well. There was Lydia, Stephanie, Briana, Cole, Dean, \u00c9tienne, and Luke, Damon's stepdad who had flown in with Lydia Reid. Cole had still witnessed with Lydia on behalf of Damon though. \n\n***\n\nAfter the ceremony, they all set off to a restaurant for dinner...at least that's what Tristan thought. Tristan rode alone with Damon in a white limousine with \u00c9tienne at the wheel. Throughout the ride he chose to straddle Damon, with his head on Damon's shoulders and his arms around Damon's neck. Damon rubbed Tristan's back, both enjoying the soothing sounds of classical music playing in the background. The feeling of contentment within both men was obvious.\n\nEventually the car stopped and Tristan got off Damon's lap and looked around, surprise clearly written on his face when he realized they were at a waterfront and not a restaurant as he had thought.\n\n\"Where are we?\" He asked looking around.\n\n\"You'll see. Come on.\" Damon said, stepping out and thanking \u00c9tienne who held the door open for them. Reaching for Tristan's hand, Damon pulled him out.\n\nTristan gasped when he saw the huge yacht with lights flashing all over it, on the dock. It was majestic, breath-taking and graceful. There were other yachts, but none as spectacular as the one they were standing in front of. There were lights all over the waterfront, giving the place a Christmassy look. \n\n\"Wow this yacht is magnificent.\" Tristan breathed.\n\nAfter admiring the yacht for a while, Tristan began to wonder why they were there instead of the restaurant. It was getting late and he was sure the others might be hungry. He didn't think he could eat anything that very moment though. He was too excited to keep anything down. He turned to look at Damon, noticing the presence of the others. ",
        "\"What are we doing here Damon? They might be hungry.\"\n\n\"Watch.\" Damon pointed to the side of the yacht and suddenly, lights went on, displaying the inscription, \"TRISTAN\". Tristan screamed, his eyes wide with surprise.\n\nEveryone laughed and clapped, clearly amused by Tristan's reaction. He quickly sobered and turned to look at his husband to see the smile on his face.\n\n\"Did you buy that?\" Tristan asked wide-eyed. At Damon's nod, Tristan squeezed his eye shut. \"Fuck!\" He swore, knowing the yacht must have cost a fortune.\n\n\"I did propose to you in water, right after you showed me some really cool skills.\" Damon chuckled at Tristan's raised brow, knowing exactly what he was thinking about. \"That too. But get your mind out of the gutter.\" Damon whispered and dropped a kiss on Tristan's temple. \"You obviously love being in water. What better wedding present than this?\"\n\n\"I love it. And I love you. Thanks.\" Tristan went on his toes and devoured Damon's mouth right there in front of everyone. \"Can we go check it out?\" He couldn't suppress his excitement. \n\n\"Well...these people might be hungry so we...\" Damon's eyes glinted mischievously. \n\nTristan didn't even turn to look at the others. \"They don't look hungry Damon.\" He gushed making everyone laugh.\n\nThey all climbed up the gangplank till they got on deck. Damon asked Tristan to do the honours of opening the main sliding doors since it was his yacht. When Tristan did, there was total darkness inside.\n\n\"Hey where's the switch?\" Tristan asked.\n\n\"Check to the right.\" Damon replied.\n\nTristan found and hit the switch, flooding the whole place with lights and screamed for the second time that evening when a bunch of people screamed 'Congratulations!'\n\nThen Tristan saw his father, his sisters, Tracy, Ashley and Adriana, Chris, Matt, the people he worked with, his friends in France and a few close ones from home and many other people. He covered his face and started shaking with silent sobs.\n\nA strong arm circled Tristan's waist from behind and pulled him up against a hard chest and steely thighs. \"You are supposed to be happy asshole.\" Damon said into Tristan's ear and turned him to face him. \n\n\"I am.\" Tristan said in a shaky voice wiping the tears from his eyes. \"It's just that...\"\n\n\"I know. I ruined one surprise for you so I had to give you another.\"\n\n\"You call this another? More like many others.\" Tristan laughed through his tears. You...what time did you organize all this?\" Tristan asked but before Damon could open his mouth to answer, he continued. \"Your so called work on your iPad last night. This was what you were doing wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. I couldn't possibly have spoken on the phone. You would have heard me. Now let's go greet our guests.\"\n\n\"I'll get you for this Damon Thomas Reid.\" Tristan said in a stern voice.\n\n\"Can't wait for whatever you have in store for me. Ready?\" Damon laughed.\n\n\"As I'll ever be.\" Tristan laughed delightedly. \n\nAnd they had a blast. There was a buffet of fantastic assorted French cuisine and drinks of all kinds. Their eight-tier all-white wedding cake was simply beautiful. Andre's DJ was dishing out good music and everyone had fun.\n\nWhen Tristan saw a shame-faced Chloe, he simply hugged her and told her she was forgiven. He was too happy to be angry at anyone. Caleb Thomas had traveled to Paris with his daughters and a few of Tristan's friends on his private jet. Stephanie Thomas had obviously set off earlier in order not to miss the ceremony. Damon's other friends who could not make it to Paris due to the short notice, called to wish them well. Tristan, Adriana and Briana virtually danced to every song that played. At a point Damon had taken Tristan's blazer so he could be free to have unrestricted fun.\n\nTristan was talking to his friends when he felt Damon's arms go around him from behind. \n\n\"Having fun?\" Damon husked into his ears.\n\nTristan turned within his arms and tilted his head up for a kiss. \"You know I am. You outdid yourself. I haven't had this much fun in...forever.\" \n\n\"Good.\" Damon graced the tip of Tristan's nose with a kiss before releasing him. \"Just checking up on you. Go enjoy yourself.\" He prompted, patting Tristan on his rear.\"\n\n\"I would rather you show me around this thing.\" Tristan said looking up seductively at Damon.\n\nDamon's looked at Tristan with a wicked glint in his blue eyes. He blinked at Tristan innocently, pretending he didn't know what Tristan really wanted. \"You're sure you don't want to keep having fun? The tour can always wait.\"\n\n\"Shut up and take me to bed Damon.\" Tristan laughed and took Damon's hand in his, quickly turning to excuse himself from his friends. \n\n\"Well, we will have to explore together because this is my first time on this yacht too. Of course I know the layout so we can find our way around.\" Damon drawled, turning Tristan towards where he knew the bedrooms were.\n\nTristan laughed. \"Good. Let's start with the bedroom shall we?\" Tristan said, waving at Andre, who winked and gave them a knowing smile.\n\n\"Why the fuck is Andre winking and smiling like...wait, I think he knows we're...\" Tristan trailed off noticing that the few other people looking their way had knowing smiles on their faces.\n\nDamon roared with laughter. \"What do you expect them to think when they see the couple making a quick getaway at their own wedding party? It's not like they are wrong.\" Damon leaned down to nuzzle on Tristan's ear, making him shiver and laugh softly. \n\n\"Well fuck them. I want to make love to my husband. They should sue me.\" Tristan chuckled as they got to the door of the master suite.\n\n\"Ooh I love the sound of that. My husba...\" Damon trailed off as they entered the plush master suite. \n\nThey both gasped at the sheer elegance of the room. Everything in the room was designed in a classy black and white. The perfect combination of modern and classical was simply perfect. The furniture and deco were all black and white. The bedroom wasn't any different. The king-size bed was covered with lovely black and white sheets, the plush white carpet had beautiful black designs on the edges, with a black and white floral arrangement in the corners of the room that went perfectly with the surrounding deco.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the blown up black and white picture of Tristan on top of the fire place opposite the bed. He was sleeping with his lips slightly parted. It was stunning. \n\n\"When...\" Tristan breathed, staring at the picture.\n\n\"Last night. You looked so angelic I thought it would be best if I captured the look before you morphed back into the monster you are.\" Damon teased.\n\nTristan tried to laugh at the joke but what came out was a sob. \"It's beautiful.\" Tristan said shakily turning to face Damon.\n\n\"You are beautiful.\" Damon whispered, raising his hand to Tristan's face. \n\nDamon's fingers moved slowly down Tristan's chin to the column of his throat, then to the first button on his shirt. He slowly undid the buttons on Tristan's shirt and took it off. Tristan took over then and started unbuttoning Damon's shirt, dropping a kiss on Damon's revealed skin after each button that came undone. Once he had finished with the buttons, Tristan pulled the fabric aside, revealing Damon's taut muscles and sexy abs, and then lowered his head to take one of Damon's nipples into his mouth. \n\n\"Fuck baby.\" Damon groaned, placing his hand on the back of Tristan's head to stroke his hair, enjoying the pull on the taut circle of flesh. \n\nWhen Tristan moved to Damon's other nipple and started twisting the other with his fingers, Damon cried out in pleasure. Damon pulled Tristan off his nipple and lowering his head to capture Tristan's mouth in a hungry kiss. He quickly divested Tristan of his boots, socks, pants and boxers and picking him up, bridal style, proceeded to kiss Tristan senseless. With a groan Damon broke off the kiss and laid a fully aroused and trembling Tristan gently on the bed.\n\nTristan laughed shakily. \"I just knew you would carry me at a point this evening.\"\n\nDamon laughed as he stripped out of his cloths, revealing inch by inch of his sexy delicious body. Tristan watched him, licking suddenly dry lips as his hand moved to stroke his hard cock. His husband was gorgeous.\n\nDamon groaned low in his throat when he turned to find Tristan stroking his hard leaking cock. \"You make me so damn hot baby.\" He murmured, covering Tristan's body with his.\n\nAnd cut off from the rest of the people on the yacht, the couple made mad sweet love to each other. When Tristan felt Damon inside him, stretching him, filling him, he closed his eyes and moaned softly. It was divine.\n\nWhen they both felt the intense orgasm barrelling down their spine, they looked at each other and Damon whispered, \"Come with me baby.\" \n\nDamon increased his thrusts and the stroking of his hand on Tristan's cock, their gazes locked on each other. He was floored by the glazed look in Tristan's eyes. Tristan in the throes of passion was a thing of beauty.\n\n\"Damon...\" Tristan gasped and that was all the signal Damon needed. \n\n\"Right there with you baby.\" He captured Tristan's lips in a fiery kiss, shooting into him just as Tristan shot between them. It was mind-blowing. Their bodies were perfectly in sync. They both groaned into the kiss but never once broke off the kiss. Even after that intense orgasm, the two continued to kiss each other softly and oh so sweetly.\n\n\"Thank you for being mine Tristan Thomas Reid. I love you. So much.\" Damon said, his eyes suspiciously bright.\n\n\"And I love you Damon Thomas Reid. Thank you for being my husband.\" Tristan replied, gently wiping at a tear that had slipped out of Damon. \"And thanks for the surprise. Anything more and I swear I would have fainted.\" He chuckled.\n\nDamon quickly busied himself with rolling off Tristan but Tristan read the move and took hold of Damon's chin, forcing him to look into Tristan's questioning eye.\n\n\"What did you do Damon Bartholomew Thomas Reid? What other surprise are you...\"\n\nDamon groaned, thinking of ways to kill his beautiful mother for telling Tristan his middle name. \"Baby I have to go get a washcloth for yo...\"\n\n\"Not today. I want to feel you in me. Now tell me. What are you hiding?\" Tristan peered into Damon's eyes.\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" Damon groaned, flopping onto his back and praying that Tristan didn't get emotional or angry. He just wanted him to laugh with happiness. \"I might have spoken to Adriana about your preferred car.\"\n\n\"Might have? Damon...\" Tristan groaned.\n\n\"What? I'm not too comfortable with that bike you speed around on. Just...humour me please. Drive the car sometimes. Pretty please!\" Damon pouted and batted his lashes at Tristan making him roar with laughter.\n\n\"Dude will you stop making that face? It's so not you.\" Tristan wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes. \"So you got me a...\"\n\n\"Lamborghini Reventon.\" Damon drawled. \"Adriana said you're in love with that car. It's waiting in our home as I speak. Can't wait to see you driving the shit out of it.\" Damon grinned.\n\nTristan went so quiet Damon's heart sunk. He moved to cover Tristan's body with his and buried his face in Tristan's neck, chanting...\n\n\"Please, please, please.\"\n\n\"What? Why are you saying that?\" Tristan asked, confused.\n\n\"Please don't get angry or emotional.\" Damon murmured into Tristan's neck.\n\n\"Dude, I can't not get emotional. It's not every day I'm given one of the most expensive cars in the world as a gift. What the fuck do you want me to do? I didn't even get you anything.\" Tristan ended in a whisper.\n\n\"You gave me the greatest gift of all my love.\" Damon raised up his head to look into Tristan's eyes with all the love that he felt, in his. \"You.\" Then he lowered his head and captured Tristan's lips in a languid kiss. \n\n\"I don't know what to say.\" Tristan whispered, slightly shaken.\n\n\"Just say you will love me forever.\" \n\n\"I do, and will forever Damon.\" Tristan said with so much emotion.\n\n\"Good. Better get used to this, husband mine. I plan on spoiling the shit outta you.\" Damon said, moving off Tristan.\n\n\"And what am I supposed to be doing whilst you're spoiling the shit out of me?\" Tristan drawled.\n\n\"Laugh Tristan. I want to hear you laugh. You have no idea what it does to me when I hear you laugh.\"\n\n\"Damon, the last thing I feel like doing right now is laughing. I want to...\"\n\n\"Need help with that?\" Damon cut Tristan off and then pounced on him, tickling him mercilessly.\n\nTheir delighted laughter rang out in the room. The whole day had been a roller-coaster of emotions. The couple wanted to end the day on a high by simply having fun with each other. They both knew there was bound to be challenges along the way, but they also knew their love would stand the test of time. They were together and that was all that mattered.\n\nTHE END"
