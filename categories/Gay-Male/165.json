        "Nate spent the better part of an hour on the phone with his mother and Seth. Three-way-calling might have its benefits, but as far as Brandon was concerned, the only purpose it had served today was to keep Nate worried and exhausted. By the time he got off the phone, his shoulders were slumping and his eyes were swollen.\n\nWhen Brandon handed him a shot glass full of whiskey, Nate gave a weary grin and settled down beside him on the couch. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get me all liquored up so you can have your wicked way with me, I should tell you now that I\u2019m pretty much a sure thing.\u201d\n\nBrandon nudged his shoulder and laughed when he almost fell over. \u201cNo offense, baby, but I like my guys a little more lively than you are at the moment.\u201d\n\nNate rubbed his hand over his face. \u201cYou try talking to a hysterical woman for over an hour and see how lively you look.\u201d\n\nBrandon couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cHow is Seth, anyway?\u201d He made a satisfactory grunt when Nate elbowed him in the ribs.\n\nBrandon laughed. \u201cYou know I\u2019m just teasing you. How\u2019s your mom taking it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all in shock, to tell you the truth. Mom seems to be handling it better than Seth and I are. He and I both knew there was a good chance Dad was guilty, but neither one of us ever expected him to confess. I guess we just figured he\u2019d deny it to the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, so did I. I had my doubts about Calder\u2019s actual guilt, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Nate took a deep breath. \u201cSo now what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Calder pleading guilty, the death penalty is taken off the table. The most he can get is life without parole. That will be up to the judge, but Amy\u2019s death combined with the charges for the attack on Marjorie, the arsons, and the attempts on you, make it hard for me to see a judge giving him anything less.\u201d\n\nNate didn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes. Finally, he said, \u201cI think I\u2019d like to start seeing that psychiatrist you took me to, Dr. Carson? I think I\u2019m gonna need some help to process all this.\u201d\n\nBrandon nodded. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea, Nate.\u201d He reached out and squeezed Nate\u2019s knee. \u201cEverybody needs a little help now and then. I can\u2019t imagine anyone going through an ordeal like this without needing a little professional help.\u201d\n\nNate said, \u201cHow come you went into forensic psychology instead of going on and getting your medical degree?\u201d\n\nBrandon grinned. \u201cCan you really see me sitting down with patients? I don\u2019t exactly have a sparkling bedside manner. Besides, two doctors in the family are enough. Between you and Keith, the Nash clan is covered.\u201d\n\nNate leaned back and closed his eyes. \u201cWe really are gonna be a family, huh? I mean, I didn\u2019t just dream it all, did I?\u201d\n\nBrandon leaned over and kissed first one eyelid and then the other. \u201cNope. I\u2019m gonna have you in front of the preacher as soon as you give the word.\u201d He sat back against the cushions. \u201cSpeaking of which, now that this is officially over, what do you say we set a date?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I mention that you\u2019re a part of the family now? That means my mother has a legal right to kill you.\u201d\n\nNate laughed. \u201cJust what I need, another homicidal parent.\u201d Brandon grabbed him and started tickling his ribs. He writhed and jumped, finally calling out, \u201cOkay, okay. I give.\u201d\n\nBrandon stopped tickling but didn\u2019t move his hands. \u201cYou ready to answer my question, or do I have to get rough with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromises, Nash, promises.\u201d Brandon\u2019s fingers started to move again. Nate put up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019ll be serious.\u201d \n\n\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d\n\nNate reached up and stroked Bran\u2019s face. \u201cThe day before thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nBrandon turned his head to the side and kissed Nate\u2019s hand. \u201cYou realize that\u2019s in two weeks, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s not like you have to order a dress or anything. Your brothers and mine will be out of school, and most of our family members will have the day off anyway. Besides,\u201d he gave a shy smile. \u201cThe courthouse will be open. I\u2019ll be able to file the paperwork for my name change. I already checked.\u201d\n\nBrandon studied him for a minute. \u201cYou\u2019ve given this a lot of thought, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nNate nodded. \u201cYeah. At first I wanted to wait. Without, Amy . . . Well, you know how I feel. But she wouldn\u2019t want us to wait, and I don\u2019t either. Now that I\u2019m out of danger, I want us to make it official.\u201d\n\nBrandon kissed his brow. \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way.\u201d He picked up Nate\u2019s hand and started sucking on his index finger. \u201cHave you given any thought to our honeymoon?\u201d\n\nNate moaned as Brandon took his finger deeper into his mouth. \u201cYou keep doing that, and I won\u2019t be able to think about anything.\u201d Brandon retreated, but only a little. Nate said, \u201cHow would you feel about a week at a nice little cabin in the Smokey Mountains?\u201d\n\nBrandon took Nate\u2019s finger out of his mouth but kept a tight hold on his hand. \u201cIt sounds great, but I doubt we could rent one on such short notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to rent one. When Grandma Morris died, she left the cabin she and Grandpa owned to me. I haven\u2019t been in a coon\u2019s age, but I pay a crew to keep it maintained. All I have to do is call the service and they\u2019ll have it cleaned and ready for us.\u201d\n\nBrandon narrowed his eyes. \u201cA coon\u2019s age?\u201d\n\nNate thickened his drawl. \u201cYep. Us country boys depend on them there critters to keep track of the seasons. Know what I mean?\u201d\n\nBrandon pushed him down on the couch and covered his body with his own. \u201cJim Varney, you aren\u2019t. I do like the whole bumpkin routine, though.\u201d\n\nNate wiggled seductively beneath him. \u201cOh, really? Why is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething about that twang in your voice gets me hot.\u201d He ground his hips against Nate\u2019s. \u201cThen again, there\u2019s little about you that doesn\u2019t get me hot.\u201d When Nate laughed, Brandon said, \u201cWant me to prove it to you.\u201d\n\nNate\u2019s voice was husky and his eyes were glazed over. \u201cYeah, but not here.\u201d\n\nBrandon got up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs, then.\u201d\n\nNate stood up, shaking his head as he went. \u201cNo.\u201d Seeing the look of disappointment on Brandon\u2019s face, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to make love, I\u2019m just saying I want to do it some place special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t where you tell me you have some fetish about sex in public places is it? I\u2019m as flexible about some things as the next guy,\u201d he ignored Nate\u2019s look of skepticism, \u201cbut showing my bare ass to half of Reed isn\u2019t my idea of foreplay.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudging by some of the fights we\u2019ve had, I\u2019d say you\u2019re an expert at showing your ass.\u201d When Brandon playfully cuffed his arm, Nate said, \u201cI was thinking we could go to your special place, the one overlooking the pond. I\u2019ve wanted to since the first night we made love, but we couldn\u2019t with the guards around. Now that Howard\u2019s gone and you\u2019ve called off your deputies, we\u2019re all set.\u201d \n\nBrandon groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s forty degrees out there, Nate, and it isn\u2019t even full dark yet. Couldn\u2019t we at least wait till the spring thaw?\u201d\n\nNate leaned forward and nibbled Brandon\u2019s chin. \u201cThe moon is full. I\u2019ll be able to look into your eyes while I make love to you.\u201d\n\nBrandon swallowed hard. \u201cWhile you make love to me?\u201d\n\nNate continued to lick his way down Brandon\u2019s neck. \u201cYep. You\u2019ve been trying to get me to top you again since that night at Gale\u2019s.\u201d\n\nBrandon shivered as Nate\u2019s tongue moved from his neck to his ear. \u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t as good for you that way.\u201d\n\nNate whispered against his ear. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t enjoy it, but I was so stressed out that first time, I wasn\u2019t able to relax and just let my body take over the way I do when you\u2019re inside me. Now that I know we\u2019re not in any danger, I believe I can give you my full attention.\u201d\n\nDamn. \u201cNate, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\n\nNate walked behind Brandon and pressed his growing erection into the crease of Bran\u2019s jeans, then reached around to stroke Brandon\u2019s swelling crotch. \u201cDid I mention that I\u2019m not wearing any underwear?\u201d\n\nBrandon lost all his speech capabilities when he thought of nothing standing between Nate\u2019s most tender skin and the rasp of his jeans. He managed to say, \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\nNate licked Brandon\u2019s other ear. \u201cYou got it, babe. I\u2019m going commando.\u201d\n\nBrandon sighed and went to get a blanket.\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I let you talk me into this.\u201d It was the eighth time he\u2019d said it, but Nate couldn\u2019t help but smile at Brandon\u2019s disgruntled tone.\n\nNate pointed to the fire Brandon was building. \u201cWith that inferno you\u2019ve got going, I doubt we\u2019ll feel the cold. The only danger now is smoke inhalation.\u201d\n\nBrandon added the final log and came to sit on the blanket with Nate. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna do something, might as well do it right. And if you\u2019re gonna make love outside in the middle of November in Illinois, you need a fire.\u201d\n\nNate got behind him, with Brandon now sitting between his legs. He wrapped his arms around Bran\u2019s waist. \u201cWhen you grabbed the matches, I had no idea you were going to recreate the Great Chicago Fire.\u201d\n\nBrandon looked at him over his shoulder. The firelight and moonlight combined to make his dark hair shimmer. \u201cAre you always this bitchy?\u201d\n\nNate grinned. \u201cOnly when I\u2019m horny and my guy won\u2019t shut up.\u201d\n\nBrandon shifted until he was lying down on the blanket. He held out his arms to Nate. \u201cIf you want me to shut up, you\u2019d better give me something to put in my mouth.\u201d\n\nNate said, \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna get undressed first?\u201d\n\nBrandon sat up, stripping and grumbling as he went. When he\u2019d taken off everything but his boxers and his socks, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take off my shorts, but I\u2019m leaving my socks on. I may get frostbite, but it won\u2019t be on my toes.\u201d \n\nNate gave him a wicked smile. \u201cThere was a time when you thought you\u2019d get frostbite from me.\u201d\n\nBrandon groaned and fell back on the blanket. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna live that one down, am I?\u201d\n\nNate stood up and started undressing. \u201cNope. I\u2019ll still be bringing it up on our golden anniversary.\u201d\n\nBrandon\u2019s eyes darkened with love and lust. \u201cAs long as we have fifty more years together, I don\u2019t care how you choose to torture me.\u201d He looked down at his still soft penis. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s torture, and then there\u2019s torture. I\u2019m glad you decided to top, babe, because I don\u2019t think this ole\u2019 boy is gonna be perking up anytime soon. Not with my balls frozen like they are.\u201d\n\nNate discarded the rest of his clothes and knelt between Brandon\u2019s legs. \u201cLet\u2019s see what I can do about this delicate condition of yours.\u201d Using the tip of his tongue, Nate traced the fine veins of Brandon\u2019s sack and then followed the long vein on the underside of his rapidly growing cock all the way up. Nate teased him like that until Brandon was all but begging for more. When Nate took the entire hardened length of him into his mouth and swallowed him to the hilt, Brandon\u2019s hips lifted off the blanket. \n\n\u201cOh, God, Nate . . . That\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nNate didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he pulled off long enough to lube his middle finger with the KY jelly he\u2019d smuggled outside. He spread Brandon\u2019s legs and carefully loosened him up, returning to the job his mouth was doing as he worked his finger inside.\n\nBy the time Nate slid in a second finger, Brandon was panting and muttering under his breath. When Nate went for a third finger, Brandon shook his head.\n\n\u201cNow, baby. Don\u2019t wanna wait, anymore.\u201d\n\nNate slicked himself up, got into position, and slid slowly inside Brandon\u2019s tight body, first the thick head and then his shaft, an inch at a time. Brandon was all but screaming by the time Nate was all the way in. \n\n\u201cJesus, Nate. That feels so damned good. Move, baby. I wanna feel you thrusting into me.\u201d\n\nNate gritted his teeth and started to move. He could feel the head of his dick bumping against Brandon\u2019s prostate. Even if he hadn\u2019t been able to feel it, Brandon\u2019s husky groans every time Nate pushed back in would have been a clear give away.\n\nAfter several good thrusts, Nate could feel Brandon tightening up. \u201cI\u2019m almost there, Nate. Come with me, baby.\u201d\n\nNate locked eyes with Brandon and thrust all the way in. He filled Brandon just as Brandon came in powerful waves all over his stomach and chest. As Nate fell onto Brandon in a pleasantly exhausted heap, he realized for the first time that he and Brandon were finally over the hump. The future was free and clear for the two of them. He was still smiling an hour later when they made their way back to the house.\n\n* * * \n\nBrandon shook his head in disgust as Nate wrote out a check for forty-six thousand dollars. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re buying that car after our conversation last night.\u201d\n\nNate handed the check to Cain and then turned back to Brandon with a grin. \u201cWhich conversation would that be? The one where you promised not to share the garage with me if I bought that \u2018souped-up death wagon,\u2019 or the one where you offered to drive me to a dealership and buy me anything I wanted if I\u2019d forget all about buying that \u2018rebuilt refugee from a thirties\u2019 gangster flick?\u2019\u201d\n\nCain was scandalized. \u201cYou offered to take him to a dealership?\u201d\n\nBrandon shrugged. \u201cDesperate times call for desperate measures.\u201d He moved his eyes from Cain to Nate. \u201cI almost lost you in that first car accident, not to mention what could have happened at your office.\u201d He reached out and stroked Nate\u2019s cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t go through that again, Nate. If I have to beg and grovel to keep you safe, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nNate was filled with so much tenderness for the man in front of him, he forgot all about the fact that they were standing in Lucas\u2019s garage. He reached for Brandon and heard a loud clearing of the throat. \n\nCain said, \u201cI\u2019ll just go put this in the office safe and gather up the paperwork.\u201d He left before Brandon and Nate could protest.\n\nNate pulled Brandon into his arms and said, \u201cLook, Bran, we just got our lives back. Do you really think I would do something reckless or stupid to screw all that up?\u201d\n\nBrandon sighed and rested his forehead against Nate\u2019s. \u201cNo. I know you better than that. But a guy\u2019s got a right to try and protect his family, you know?\u201d \n\nNate moved his hands from Brandon\u2019s waist to slide them into the back pockets of his jeans, pulling him even closer. \u201cYeah, I do know, Bran, but you gotta trust me.\u201d\n\nBrandon gave up. \u201cYou win. You know I can\u2019t argue with you when you go all logical on me. I won\u2019t say anything else about the car\u201d He narrowed his eyes. \u201cBut you can\u2019t stop me from thinking it.\u201d\n\nNate nodded in agreement, pleased to have won that round. Lucas came back a few minutes later with a manila folder in his right hand and something brown and fuzzy in his left. \n\nHe handed the folder to Nate. \u201cHere\u2019s the title and registration. I\u2019ve still got temporary insurance on her, so all you have to do today is buy the tags and get the registration changed over into your name.\u201d He stuck out his hand. \u201cCongratulations, Doctor Morris. You just bought yourself a car.\u201d\n\nNate felt like a sixteen-year-old with his first set of wheels when he shook Cain\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks, Cain.\u201d He looked to Lucas\u2019s left hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nCain held up a raccoon\u2019s tail. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna drive a car like that, you\u2019ll need one of these for the antenna.\u201d\n\nBrandon just shook his head.\n\n* * *\n\nClive Rogers opened the door to his office at the Carlin Bank and Trust with an engaging smile. He looked to Brandon to be the stereotypical description of every British banker Hollywood ever cast. He had the three piece suit, the salt and pepper hair, even the accent. Despite his resemblance to a stodgy bean counter, Brandon found him to be warm and friendly as they shook hands. When Rogers had called to say the tapes were in, Brandon had wasted no time driving to Chicago.\n\n\u201cSheriff Nash, please come in and have a seat. May I offer you something to drink? A cup of coffee, perhaps?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, but I had a cup on the way over.\u201d Brandon cracked a smile. \u201cCoffee? I thought the English all drank tea.\u201d\n\nRogers shivered. \u201cNasty stuff, that. Give me a good cup of coffee over a mug of tea any day.\u201d He pointed to a pair of wingback chairs perched in front of a tall cherry armoire. \u201cIf you\u2019ll have a seat, I\u2019ll fetch the cassette.\u201d\n\nBrandon settled himself in one of the chairs and waited. Rogers came back in a few minutes and opened the doors of the armoire, revealing a television with a built in VCR. He slipped the cartridge into the port and said, \u201cI\u2019ve used the time stamp on the check to narrow down the cassette number. I believe this is the one you\u2019re looking for.\u201d He settled in the other chair and pushed the play button on the remote. \n\nBrandon did his best to be patient while Rogers ran through the film. When a familiar, red head can into view, Brandon sprang to the edge of his seat and said, \u201cStop the tape.\u201d\n\nRogers pushed the paused button. \u201cI take it that\u2019s your man?\u201d\n\nBrandon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s him. Damn. I was sure the signatures on the check and the cancellation agreement were different.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult to tell.\u201d Rogers stopped the tape, walked to the VCR and ejected it. He handed the cartridge to Brandon. \u201cI\u2019ve already made the necessary copies.\u201d He then looked Bran directly in the eye. \u201cI assure you, Sheriff Nash, we were shown the proper form of identification or we never would have cashed that check. We have a strict policy concerning the cashing of notes, especially when the person in question doesn\u2019t have an account with us. None of my people would violate that.\u201d\n\nBrandon stood up. \u201cI\u2019m not placing the blame on you or your employees. The man on this tape was a pro. He was more than capable of making a fake I.D.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used the word was, Sheriff. I take it your man is deceased?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nRogers gave him a blank stare. \u201cThen, there won\u2019t be a trial?\u201d\n\nBrandon shook his head. \u201cOh, there\u2019ll be a trial, alright, just not for Wilson.\u201d Under his breath, he said, \u201cI just pray to God we\u2019ve got the right man.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nNate was in the kitchen, stirring a stock pot full of beef stew when Brandon got home. He yelped when Bran slid his arms around his waist. Only then did Brandon notice Nate was wearing headphones.\n\nNate clicked off the portable CD player and slipped the earphones around his neck. \u201cJesus, Bran. Give a guy a heart attack, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nBrandon kissed his cheek. \u201cSorry, babe, but I didn\u2019t see the headphones.\u201d He turned Nate in his arms so he could watch his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that, anyway? We have a perfectly good system in the living room.\u201d\n\nNate ducked his head a little bit. \u201cYeah, but Sasha\u2019s in there sleeping.\u201d\n\nBrandon did his best not to laugh, but failed miserably. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re in here listening to headphones so you won\u2019t disturb our dog?\u201d\n\nNate stepped lightly on his foot. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, Nash. I\u2019ve had a hard day.\u201d\n\nBrandon pulled him closer and cuddled him to his chest. \u201cWanna tell me about it?\u201d\n\nNate sighed. \u201cI will, but you aren\u2019t gonna like it.\u201d\n\nBrandon moved back enough to see him clearly. \u201cMight as well tell me and get it over with, then.\u201d\n\nNate said, \u201cI ran into Mike today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the courthouse, when I went to register my car. He was there probating Amy\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nBrandon reached up to push a lock of Nate\u2019s hair off his forehead. \u201cWhy would I be mad about that? You can\u2019t help who you run into.\u201d\n\nNate took a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2019s true, but I sort of invited him to dinner.\u201d\n\nBrandon did his best to cool his temper. He kept telling himself he wasn\u2019t angry. He counted to ten and back four times. He tried deep breathing, and even prayer. \n\nTo his credit, Nate didn\u2019t even flinch when Brandon yelled, \u201cYou did what?\u201d\n\nNate went back to the stove and pretended that Brandon wasn\u2019t standing in the middle of the kitchen looking at him like he was insane. \u201cI ran into him, he asked if we could talk, and I invited him to dinner. I figured you\u2019d rather have him over here, with you to chaperone, as have me go somewhere with him.\u201d\n\nBrandon walked over to the table and fell into a chair. \u201cI\u2019d rather you tell the bastard to fuck off. He did his best to take your head off at Amy\u2019s funeral. Why in the hell would I want that son-of-a-bitch in our house?\u201d",
        "Nate put a lid on the stew pot and came over to the table. He took the seat next to Bran and reached for his hand. \u201cHe was grieving, Bran. The guy lost his wife not three days before he went after me. Don\u2019t you think we should cut him some slack?\u201d\n\n\u201cNate\u2014\u201d\n\nNate shook his head. \u201cJust listen to me for a minute. How would you feel if someone had been after Amy, and I\u2019d gotten caught in the crossfire? Would you have been Mr. Calm and Cool if I\u2019d been the one laying in that box?\u201d\n\nBrandon shuddered at the very thought. \u201cHell, no, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to sit across the table with the guy.\u201d\n\nNate\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cBrandon, I\u2019m not asking for your permission here. If this is really my house, too, then I have the right to invite anyone I want to sit at this table. If I don\u2019t have that right, then we have a much bigger problem on our hands than Mike.\u201d\n\nBrandon pulled back his hand and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to take a shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cBran\u2014\u201d\n\nBrandon shook his head. \u201cJust give me a few minutes, okay?\u201d He went upstairs before Nate could respond.\n\n* * *\n\nNate was setting the table when Brandon came back downstairs. He was wearing a pair of faded jeans with ripped knees and a black t-shirt that showed every ripple of his chest muscles. His hair was still damp, and Nate could see a little trail of water trickling down his neck. He had the urge to walk over and lick the moisture away, but he resisted. It was going to be up to Brandon to make the first move. He only hoped he didn\u2019t have a long wait.\n\nHe didn\u2019t. Brandon came around the table and took him into his arms. \u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n\nBrandon grinned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna make this easy, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\nBrandon bent him back over the dish-free-section of the table. He leaned over him and started sucking on his ear. \u201cI was a real jerk about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nNate could feel himself boning up, but he wasn\u2019t about to let Brandon off the hook. Not just yet anyway. \u201cKeep going.\u201d\n\nBrandon kissed his neck. \u201cThis is as much your house as it is mine, and you have the right to invite anyone you want to come and eat with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\nBrandon rested his head on Nate\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDo I have to say it?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Fraid so.\u201d\n\nBrandon grinned again. \u201cYou were right and I was wrong.\u201d\n\nNate reached up and wiped the water from Bran\u2019s brow. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell yes it was. Damned apology gave me heartburn.\u201d\n\nNate kissed Brandon\u2019s chest through his shirt. \u201cThere. I kissed it. Did I make it better?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d know you were going to start kissing my body parts and making them better, I\u2019d have chosen blue-balls over heartburn as my disease of choice.\u201d\n\nNate wrapped his arms around Brandon\u2019s neck. \u201cBlue balls, huh?\u201d\n\nBrandon turned his head and kissed the inside of Nate\u2019s wrist, taking the time to trail his tongue along the fine blue vein leading up to his hand. \u201cYep. Classic case of blue-balls. If I don\u2019t get some relief, and get it soon, one or both of those suckers is gonna pop right off.\u201d\n\nNate flexed his hips in an evidence gathering attempt. \u201cI think you\u2019re right, Bran. Maybe you should see a doctor.\u201d He pretended to think about it, and then said, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d He was about to give Brandon a thorough examination, when Sasha came in from the living room and started barking.\n\nNate looked up to see Mike standing in the kitchen. He said, \u201cSorry to interrupt, but the door was open.\u201d\n\nBrandon couldn\u2019t have gotten up any faster had his pants been on fire. His eyes went from sparkling blue mischief to icy control in the space of a heartbeat.\n\n\u201cVaughn.\u201d\n\nMike nodded. \u201cHello, Nash. I take it you didn\u2019t know I was coming.\u201d\n\nBrandon shook his head. \u201cOh, I knew you were coming, all right. See, Vaughn, Nate and I don\u2019t keep secrets from each other.\u201d Ignoring Nate\u2019s warning stare, he went on to say, \u201cNo, I knew all about your visit, I just couldn\u2019t think of a damn thing to do to stop it. What I\u2019d like to know now is, when the hell are you leaving? I\u2019d like enough advanced notice to be suitably relieved when you make your exit.\u201d\n\nNate started to say something, but Mike interrupted him. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Nate. After the way I treated you at Amy\u2019s funeral\u2014\u201d He broke off, but not before Nate saw the wetness in his eyes. Mike stood in silence for several tense minutes, working to gain control. Finally, he said, \u201cAfter the way I treated you, I don\u2019t blame him for not wanting me here.\u201d\n\nNate knew better than to hope for Brandon to do the polite thing and make Mike feel welcome. Instead, he took up the reins. \u201cSupper\u2019s almost ready, Mike, if you want to have a seat at the table. Brandon, why don\u2019t you take Sasha for a quick walk while the cornbread is finishing up?\u201d\n\nIf Brandon wanted to argue, he didn\u2019t show it. He seemed as relieved to get away from Mike as Mike seemed to have him go.\n\nThe minute they heard the back door closing, Mike said, \u201cListen, Nate, I really appreciate you letting me come over tonight, especially after all that\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nNate went back to the stove and took a peek at the bread. Straightening and turning to face Mike in one motion, he said, \u201cLike I told you at the courthouse, Mike, I understood. As Brandon will tell you, I went a little crazy after Amy died, myself.\u201d\n\nMike said, \u201cYeah, well, you didn\u2019t take a swing at one of your best friends, either. And no offense, but I doubt Nash is gonna want to tell me anything besides \u2018go to hell.\u2019\u201d\n\nNate went to the refrigerator and removed a stone-ware jug of sweetened tea. After pouring three glasses full he said, \u201cBrandon\u2019s just upset. He\u2019ll come around eventually.\u201d He managed to sound half-way convincing, too.\n\nMike shook his head. \u201cThat I seriously doubt, my friend, but it won\u2019t matter, anyway. I\u2019m leaving Reed, Nate. I\u2019ve already turned in my resignation with the firm and put my house on the market. All that\u2019s left now is to decide where I want to go, and to get the hell out of here.\u201d When Nate muttered a protest, Mike just shrugged. \u201cYou know it\u2019s for the best. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lived here long enough to establish a whole lot of ties.\u201d He looked down at the scarred oak surface of the table and fingered a knot in the wood. His voice was dull, emotionless. \u201c You and Amy were my only real links to Reed in the first place. Now that Amy\u2019s gone and you and I\u2014\u201d He broke off and looked up at Nate. \u201cYou and I will always have a bond, but it\u2019ll never be like it was. Not with all that\u2019s happened. I think you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nNate wanted to argue, but he did know what Mike meant, because he felt the same way. The friendship they\u2019d shared was forged more out of a mutual love for Amy than any real affection for each other. And as bad as he felt about it, Nate still couldn\u2019t look at Mike without seeing Amy\u2019s smile, or hearing her laughter. It was damn painful just to be in the same room with the guy. When the time came for him to speak, all Nate could manage was, \u201cAny ideas on what you want to do next?\u201d\n\nMike sank a little further into the chair. \u201cNot really. The only real family I have is my aunt in Atlanta and a handful of cousins. I may just drift for a while, traveling around and trying out new places. It\u2019s not like the five-year plan Amy and I came up with when we moved here means anything, anymore. Fucking bomb saw to that.\u201d He gave Nate an apologetic smile. \u201cThat sounded like I\u2019m still blaming you, didn\u2019t it? For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damn good thing you aren\u2019t, Vaughn.\u201d Brandon stood in the doorway, his eyes narrowed on Mike. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single thing Nate could have done to save Amy, and you know it.\u201d \n\nNate knew that look, and he also knew there would be a free-for-all if he didn\u2019t step in and put a stop to it. He said, \u201cBrandon, if you\u2019ll bring the tea to the table, I\u2019ll take the bread out of the oven and we\u2019ll be ready to eat.\u201d\n\nBrandon grumbled, but he did what Nate told him to do. Nate rescued the cornbread, and then carried the stew pot to the table. Within five minutes, they were all seated at the table and ready to eat.\n\nTo say the meal was tense was an understatement. Aside from the initial saying of grace, they ate in complete silence. Dinner at home with his parents had always been like that. His father wanted complete quiet at the table, and that\u2019s what he got. But dinner at the Nash house was different. Whether it was just him and Brandon or the whole noisy clan, there was always laughter and conversation. And when he and Brandon were alone, the food was often abandoned for much more pleasurable pursuits than eating. Tonight, though, the silence was almost more than Nate could stand. He picked at his food, and watched Brandon glare at Mike over his bowl of stew. Nate was more than a little relieved when the phone rang and broke the silence.\n\nBrandon started to get up, but Nate shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d He was across the room before Bran could argue.\n\nNate picked up the phone and said, \u201cHello.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoc? It\u2019s Sam. Is the sheriff around?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Sam. He\u2019s right here.\u201d He held the phone out to Brandon. \u201cBran, it\u2019s for you.\u201d\n\nBrandon took the phone, while Nate went back to his seat. He studied Brandon\u2019s face, noticing as his expression went from intent to elated. He was practically hoping up and down when he said, \u201cAlright, Sam. Keep everyone out of her room until I get there.\u201d Pause. \u201cNo, Eva and the doctor are fine, but no one else goes in until I have a chance to talk to her.\u201d Pause. \u201cAlright. See you then.\u201d\n\nBrandon hung up the phone and gave Nate a radiant smile. \u201cSam was calling from the hospital. Marjorie Newman is awake.\u201d \n\n* *  *\n\nBrandon grabbed Nate and swung him around the kitchen. \u201cShe\u2019s awake, Nate, and according to Sam, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any signs of permanent damage.\u201d\n\nNate caught his breath and gave Brandon a wet kiss right on his lips. Brandon pulled him closer and deepened the contact. He barely heard Mike clear his throat. He reluctantly broke away and turned to find Mike standing by the table.\n\nMike said, \u201cExcuse me guys. I forgot I was supposed to call one of my clients about the closing of his condo. It\u2019s been rescheduled.\u201d\n\nNate said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to use the phone in here. Or there\u2019s one in the living room if you need some privacy.\u201d\n\nMike pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own phone, but I\u2019ll take you up on the privacy. I\u2019ll just step outside for a second.\u201d He slipped out while Brandon was still staring at Nate.\n\nWhen he was gone, Brandon said, \u201cYou realize what this means, don\u2019t you Nate?\u201d\n\nNathan nodded. \u201cWith Marjorie awake, and my father pleading guilty, it\u2019s really over.\u201d\n\nBrandon pulled him close and kissed his temple. \u201cYou got it, baby. This is the last link in the chain. As soon as I take Marjorie\u2019s statement, I can sign off on this case and pronounce it closed.\u201d\n\nNate leaned his head against Brandon\u2019s chest. \u201cIs that why you didn\u2019t want just anyone in her room, to protect the integrity of her statement?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. More than likely, she won\u2019t remember anything, but just in case she does, I don\u2019t want Calder\u2019s lawyer to be able to say she was coerced or coached in any way.\u201d He gently pushed Nate towards the mudroom. \u201cGet your coat and lets go.\u201d\n\nNate shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t go with you, Bran. We\u2019ve got company, remember.\u201d\n\nBrandon snorted. \u201cYeah, as if I could forget. Look, just tell him you have to go to the hospital with me and send him home. He\u2019s a big boy. He can take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Brandon. This is the first time since the funeral that Mike has reached out to me, and I\u2019m not going to let him down now.\u201d\n\nBrandon did his best not to lose his temper. \u201cNate, you aren\u2019t responsible for that guy. You don\u2019t have to baby-sit him.\u201d\n\nNate firmed his jaw. \u201cBrandon, I\u2019m not going to argue with you about this.\u201d\n\nRemembering their argument earlier, Brandon sighed. \u201cFine. I know better than to try to force you. Look, just promise me you\u2019ll call if you need me.\u201d He reached over to the counter where Nate\u2019s cell phone was charging and handed it to him. \u201cCarry this in you pocket until I get back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrandon\u2014\u201d\n\nBrandon pulled him into a hug. \u201cPlease Nate. Just this once. For me?\u201d\n\nNate pulled back and grinned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re getting pretty good and that pitiful whining thing, you know?\u201d\n\nBrandon grinned right back at him. \u201cDid it work?\u201d\n\nNate slid the phone into his hip pocket. \u201cAs if you ever had a doubt.\u201d\n\nBrandon pulled him into a soft, slow kiss. When they were both sufficiently breathless, Brandon said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of doubts about a lot of things in my life, Nate, but not about you. Never about you.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nBrandon spent a lot of time in hospitals. Aside from the births of his nieces and nephews, there were accident reports, victims\u2019 statements, interviews with the coroner, and on and on. Usually he dreaded victims\u2019 statements the most, but he was actually looking forward to this one. Marjorie Newman\u2019s statement would put an end to this whole sordid mess, and mark the beginning of his marriage to Nate. He was practically skipping by the time he reached Marjorie\u2019s room.\n\nHe greeted Sam, who was dutifully standing guard in the hall, and then knocked on the door. He opened it before receiving leave to go in. He\u2019d visited several times since Marjorie\u2019s attack, so he was prepared for the balloons, flowers, and cards littering the room, as well as for the sight of Marjorie\u2019s partner, Eva, sitting near the bed. The only surprise in store for him was Marjorie, sitting straight up in the bed, her gray hair beginning to grow back from the shaving made necessary by a blow to the head. Her hazel eyes twinkled as Brandon came into the room.\n\nEva greeted him with a warm hug. Unlike Marjorie, Eva\u2019s hair hadn\u2019t grayed with age. It was jet black and secured in a braid down her back, clear signs of her American Indian heritage. Eva was a beautiful woman who looked closer to forty than her actual sixty years with her browned skin and petite figure.\n\n\u201cBrandon, come on in here and have a seat. Isn\u2019t it wonderful about Marjorie?\u201d\n\nBrandon stood behind one of the two chairs next to the bed and waited for Eva to take her seat. When she did, he sat down and reached for Marjorie\u2019s hand. He said, \u201cHey there, pretty thing. You look more like a woman who\u2019s spent two months at a spa than in a coma.\u201d\n\nMarjorie pooh-poohed him with her hand. \u201cNot . . . nice . . . lie to. . .me.\u201d\n\nBrandon gave Eva a quizzical look. She smiled and said, \u201cThe speech problems are only temporary, according to the doctor. Her mind is perfectly intact.\u201d\n\nBrandon nodded and turned back to Marjorie. \u201c\u201dYou up to answering some questions, sweetheart?\u201d\n\nShe bobbed her head up and down, so Brandon took out his notebook and said, \u201cMost of these are yes or no questions, so just nod or shake your head, and save your voice.\u201d When she acknowledged that, he continued with, \u201cOkay, doll, first question: do you remember what happened the night of the fire?\u201d\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\u201cGreat. Do you remember the man that did this to you?\u201d\n\nAnother nod, this one more forceful. Brandon reached for her hand again and gave it a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, Marjorie. Now I need to ask you another question. Did the guy who hit you just walk into the store and club you, or was he hiding, waiting for you to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cHiding. . .in bathroom. Went to close. . .up. Heard noise. . .found him inside.\u201d\n\nBrandon let go of her hand long enough to reach into his coat pocket and pull out a picture of Wilson. \u201cLast question, Marjorie, and then I\u2019ll go away and let you rest. Was this the guy that hit you?\u201d\n\nMarjorie barely looked at the picture before shaking her head. Brandon held the photo up a little higher. \u201cTake another look, Marjorie.\u201d\n\nAnother shake, this one more emphatic. Brandon looked at Eva, who only shrugged. He turned back to Marjorie and said, \u201cAre you sure? Remember, you took a pretty vicious knock to the head. Could you be mistaken?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. . .mistake. Not him.\u201d\n\nBrandon folded up the picture and put it back in his pocket. He didn\u2019t want her to get upset, but he had to keep trying. \u201cMarjorie, do you know who it was?\u201d\n\nMarjorie fought hard to make her mouth work. Finally, she was able to say the two words that held the most power over Brandon at that moment. \u201cMike. . .Vaughn.\u201d\n\n{TO BE CONTINUED IN TWO WEEKS}"
