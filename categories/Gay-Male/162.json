        "Jamie placed one more box on top of the stack in the back of the U-haul and moved aside so Ash could close the door. \u201cIs that everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. That was the last box.\u201d Jamie wiped the sweat out of his eyes, not that it did any good. The late August sun was relentless, especially at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back inside the air-conditioned apartment. But first, thanks were in order. \u201cI appreciate your coming over here and helping me load all this up, man. Dillon wanted me to wait until he got back, but I hate packing. I figure it\u2019s better just to get it over with.\u201d When Ash nodded his agreement, Jamie said, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe your dad is doing this. I can\u2019t believe he bought and furnished a house near Garman just so the three of us wouldn\u2019t have to live in the dorms.\u201d\n\nAsh grinned and shrugged back into the t-shirt he\u2019d shed while they were loading the truck. \u201cI can. You know my dad, Jamie. He\u2019s still pissed that you wouldn\u2019t keep that money Ben left you. You should have known he\u2019d find a way to pay you back, somehow. He feels like he owes you for all you\u2019ve done for me. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t even be here if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d His face fell. \u201cNot to mention the way you helped me when Chad. . .well, you know.\u201d\n\nJamie nodded. \u201cHow are you doing with that?\u201d\n\nAsh sighed. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone, even though it\u2019s been over three months. After everything he did, I think a part of me will always miss Chad.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstandable. He was a part of your life. And watching a guy kill himself isn\u2019t something you just get over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m glad that you and Dillon didn\u2019t have my death to add to the shit you\u2019ve already been through. Where did you say Dillon is, again?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaying goodbye to Heath.\u201d\n\nAsh leaned against the back of the truck. \u201cHeath\u2019s not coming to the going-away-party your aunt\u2019s throwing for you guys tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m sorry to hear it, but why?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaid he didn\u2019t want to be around a bunch of people right now. He\u2019s taking Megan\u2019s leaving town a whole lot harder than I thought he would.\u201d\n\nAsh curled his lip. \u201cIt\u2019s his own damn fault. I feel the same way about Heath that I feel about Chad\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nJamie propped his foot on the bumper of the U-haul. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw how Mr. Minton acted that night at the police station. A whole roof full of people heard Chad confess to killing Ben, and Mr. Minton still didn\u2019t want to believe it. He practically accused us of pushing him.\u201d\n\nJamie winced. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me. Talk about misery. The thing is, though, I felt sorry for the guy. He\u2019d just lost his son. He must have loved Chad a lot to be so torn apart by his death.\u201d\n\nAsh shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. Up until that night, he acted like he didn\u2019t even know Chad was alive. Mr. Minton drank or gambled away every paycheck he ever got. If it hadn\u2019t been for Chad\u2019s grandma, the guy wouldn\u2019t have even had clothes to wear. And Chad\u2019s mom was just as bad, leaving him home alone every night while she was out screwing around on his dad.\u201d Ash spat on the ground. \u201cHeath\u2019s exactly like they are. He treated Megan like some whore he picked up for the night, then acts like he\u2019s dying with love for her now that she\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, some people don\u2019t know when they\u2019ve got it good. At least Megan sounds like she\u2019s doing okay. She called us this morning to tell us she finished up her summer credits. She sounded better than she\u2019s sounded in a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I talked to her for a little while last night. She\u2019s still giving me lip about not walking with the rest of you on graduation night.\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s skin itched just thinking about that stupid cap and gown. \u201cYou didn\u2019t miss anything, believe me. Megan did miss you at graduation, though. She mentioned you not being there only about a hundred and fifty times. She\u2019s really come to depend on you.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad she had someone to lean on. With you guys, her family, and me, Megan was able to pull it all together.\u201d Ash drew a deep breath. \u201cSomeone should have done something like that to help Chad. I should have done something. If I had, maybe--\u201d\n\nJamie didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cDon\u2019t even say that. You had no way of knowing that the guy was obsessed with you. He killed Ben because he wanted him out of the way. You couldn\u2019t have known Chad was that close to the edge. Ben sure as hell didn\u2019t, or he wouldn\u2019t have taunted him that night.\u201d\n\nAsh shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cI know. Here I am bellyaching, when you\u2019ve been through just as much as I have. How are you taking this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can accept it. Morgan\u2019s gonna do life for offing Carpenter, and with Mitch\u2019s testimony, a good chunk of Carpenter\u2019s clients are gonna get what they deserve. As for Ben\u2019s killer,\u201d Jamie shrugged. \u201cSeeing Chad take a twelve story leap still gives me nightmares, but I\u2019m dealing with it. You still in therapy with Dr. Carson?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. He upped my sessions to twice a week just in case all this turned out to be more than I could take, and he\u2019s recommended a good therapist not far from Garman.\u201d Ash pulled his keys out of his pocket. \u201cSpeaking of Garman, I\u2019d better get this truck back to my dad. One the guys who works for him is gonna drive it up there for us tonight. You and Dillon gonna head up in the morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. We\u2019re gonna crash with Aunt Sadie tonight and then head out at dawn. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading for New York tonight, after the party. Dad and I are driving up together, then he\u2019s gonna ride back home in the U-haul with the guy who\u2019s driving the truck.\u201d Ash started towards the cab of the truck, then stopped. \u201cHey, I just thought of something. How are you guys gonna get both cars up to Garman? Is someone gonna drive the Firebird up there for you? Cause I\u2019m sure my dad would be glad to, if you asked him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a problem, dude. The Firebird is staying here.\u201d\n\nAsh narrowed his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t think that by leaving the car here you\u2019re gonna get out of learning how to drive. Dillon and I have both told you that we\u2019re gonna teach your ass to drive once school starts, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nJamie smiled. \u201cBelieve me, that\u2019s a fate I\u2019ve resigned myself to. When I said the car was staying here, what I meant was, it isn\u2019t mine anymore. I sold it.\u201d\n\nAsh whistled. \u201cI\u2019d have bet good money that you\u2019d never get rid of that car. What made you change your mind? Price too good to turn down?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Jamie didn\u2019t bother to tell Ash that he\u2019d sold the car for a whopping one dollar and fifty cents.\n\n\u201cCool. Who bought it? Whoever it is got one heck of a sweet ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I sold it to Mitch. Now that Morgan\u2019s sentencing is over and the investigation is coming to a close, he\u2019s out of protective custody. He\u2019s gonna need wheels for his new job.\u201d Jamie glanced up for just a second at the cloudless blue sky. \u201cI think Ben would have wanted it that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. Where\u2019s Mitch gonna be working, anyway? Chicago?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. He\u2019s working for the guy who bought Nora\u2019s house. Blake, I think the guy\u2019s name is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver at the new domestic violence shelter? Damn. I guess he and Ben knew all about that. Violence, I mean.\u201d Ash turned away, but not before Jamie saw the sadness and pain shadowing his eyes. Jamie started to say something, but thought better of it. Some wounds couldn\u2019t be healed with words. Ash took a second to compose himself, then said, \u201cOkay, enough of this. Things to see, people to do, that sort of thing.\u201d He punched Jamie on the shoulder. \u201cSee you at the party, roomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d Jamie watched as Ash got into the truck and pulled out of the driveway. As nice as it was of Aunt Sadie to throw them this party, Jamie had another party in mind. A private party. All he had to do now was wait for Dillon to come back, and then it would be time. This particular celebration had been delayed long enough.\n\n      #\n\nHeath grabbed two sodas out of the fridge, taking one for himself and tossing the other one to Dillon, Slumping down on the couch, he said, \u201cSo, you\u2019re a college man now, huh? How does it feel?\u201d\n\nDillon stretched his legs out in front of himself and leaned back in his chair, kicking a pile of clothes out of the way in the process. Heath\u2019s apartment had reverted back to the pigsty it once was, but Dillon was too excited about leaving for Garman to worry about it. \u201cIt feels damn good, even though I won\u2019t officially be a \u2018college man\u2019 until I take my first class.\u201d\n\nHeath cracked open his drink and took a sip. \u201cYou\u2019re in at Garman, and that\u2019s what counts. You made it, kid. Oh, that reminds me,\u201d he placed his can on the coffee table and reached into his pocket, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d Heath pulled out an envelope and passed it across the table to Dillon. \u201cI should have given you that the night you graduated, but, well . . . you know.\u201d\n\nDillon knew exactly what had happened graduation night. Heath had been so afraid of ruining it for Megan, he\u2019d stayed away. Dillon didn\u2019t say anything, though. Heath was hurting bad enough without having it rubbed in his face. Instead, Dillon reached for the envelope. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen it and see. Call it a late graduation present.\u201d\n\nDillon slid his finger under the flap and broke the seal, recognizing the watermark of a cashier\u2019s check sitting inside. Dillon pulled the check free and nearly dropped it when he saw the amount. \u201cEighty-thousand-dollars? Jesus Christ, Heath, where did you get this kinda money?\u201d\n\nHeath shrugged. \u201cI always knew I wanted to be a firefighter, but Mom and Dad thought it was beneath me. Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, the next big time lawyer from the Carver clan. The old man set up a college fund for me, same as he did for you. And just like you, the thing was in my name, so I got to keep it when I moved out. I never used it, and I figure it\u2019s only fair for you to have it.\u201d\n\nDillon didn\u2019t know what to say. He tried to give it back. \u201cI can\u2019t take this, Heath. You could use this money for anything. Hell, you could buy yourself a house.\u201d\n\nHeath\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything, Dillon. Not that money can buy, anyway. As for a house, there\u2019s only one person I want to set up housekeeping with, and she\u2019s out of my reach.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Megan could still come around.\u201d Dillon knew it was a long-shot, but he had to say something.\n\n\u201cYou know better than that, kid. Megan told me the last time I saw her that she doesn\u2019t love me, not anymore.\u201d Heath laughed, a sound devoid of humor. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the definition of irony? Just when I realize I\u2019m so in love with the woman I could die for her without blinking, I kill whatever love she felt for me in the first place.\u201d Before Dillon could form a response, Heath shifted the subject. \u201cAnyway, like I was saying, I want you to have that money. You\u2019ll have enough to deal with when school starts without having to work extra hours just to make ends meet. Besides,\u201d Heath smiled the first true smile he\u2019d given Dillon all afternoon, \u201cI think it\u2019s the perfect revenge on our esteemed parents. Can you imagine how hard it\u2019s gonna be for them knowing that you\u2019re spending their money not only your from your own account but mine, too? I can just see it now. Dad will be sitting in his study, thinking about you and Jamie enjoying a night of sin-filled debauchery on his dime. Priceless, I tell you.\u201d\n\nDillon laughed. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna tell them, you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI already told them, my friend. Pissed isn\u2019t the word to describe their reaction.\u201d\n\nDillon stiffened. \u201cYou saw them? When?\u201d\n\n\u201cSettle down, Dillon. Open up that Coke you\u2019re holding in your lap, take a drink, and relax.\u201d Heath picked his own drink back up and took another sip. \u201cMom and Dad came to see me at the fire station last night. Claimed they wanted to know how you were doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth, that they lost the right to ask about you the minute they threw you out of the house. When Dad tried to argue that leaving was your choice, I asked him if nearly being tortured by a mad scientist in psychologist\u2019s clothing had been your choice, too.\u201d\n\nDillon whistled. \u201cBet he liked that.\u201d\n\nHeath laughed. \u201cI thought the old man was gonna have a stroke. Mom tried to cover, saying they had no idea what Henderson had in mind for you.\u201d\n\nDillon\u2019s outraged protests sent soda spewing halfway across the room. Wiping Coke from his chin, he said, \u201cWhat a crock. The only reason our parents weren\u2019t prosecuted as accomplices is because of that deal Alicia struck with Dad to drop the charges against Jamie and testify against Henderson.\u201d Dillon sighed. \u201cThank God Henderson had sense enough to plead out. He\u2019s gonna shave a couple of years off his sentence, but at least Jamie and I won\u2019t have to come back to testify.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know. I told them as much, about the deal Dad made and all, but you know how they are. Mom had some bogus explanation, and Dad just ignored me. I finally told them that I was busy just so they\u2019d leave.\u201d\n\nDillon nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d He glanced down at his watch. \u201cShit. I gotta go, Heath. I told Jamie I\u2019d be back like half an hour ago.\u201d He stood up, and so did Heath. Dillon clutched the cashier\u2019s check to his chest. \u201cI still don\u2019t know how to thank you for this Heath. I\u2019m at a loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I told you, you don\u2019t have to thank me. Just . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cJust make sure you tell Jamie everyday how much you love him. Don\u2019t fuck up your chance at happiness the way I did, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Dillon grabbed his brother and pulled him into a tight hug. Heath was stiff at first, but before long he was returning the hug tenfold. Dillon said, \u201cI love you Heath.\u201d\n\nDillon heard a suspicious sniff. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Heath pulled back. \u201cNow, get out of here before Jamie thinks you\u2019ve stood him up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows that will never happen.\u201d Dillon slapped Heath on the back on last time. He started for the door, but Heath\u2019s voice stopped him. \u201cDillon?\u201d\n\nDillon turned. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\nHeath shuffled his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to say the words, you know? Mom and Dad have told us all our lives how much they love us, and look how that turned out. And I love Megan, but look what I did to her.\u201d He looked Dillon in the eye. \u201cEven so, you know I love you, too, right?\u201d\n\nDillon nodded. His brother\u2019s love was one thing he\u2019d never doubted. \n\n      # \n\nJamie smiled when he heard Dillon\u2019s car pulling into the driveway. Meeting him at the door, he said, \u201cI was starting to think you\u2019d run off to New York without me.\u201d\n\nDillon wrapped him tight in his arms and spun him around. \u201cNever happen.\u201d Dillon put him down and looked around the apartment, noticing the boxes were all gone. \u201cI told you I\u2019d be back to help you and Ash load the truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsh came early, so we decided to get it over with. It didn\u2019t take long with the both of us working.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, I wanted to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you did, but it was no big deal.\u201d Jamie kissed his nose. \u201cHow was Heath?\u201d\n\n\u201cMissing Megan like crazy, and trying not to show it. He hasn\u2019t been the same since she left town, but he doesn\u2019t talk about her much, other than to say he fucked up, which we already knew.\u201d Dillon remembered the check. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what he gave me as a belated graduation gift.\u201d\n\nJamie listened as Dillon told him the story and then showed him the check. All he could think of to say was, \u201cDamn.\u201d\n\nDillon grinned. \u201cThat was my reaction, too.\u201d Dillon took another look at the apartment. \u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything I can do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there is one thing. Come with me into the bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, baby? Didn\u2019t you get enough of me this morning?\u201d\n\nJamie gave his arm a solid whack. \u201cSince when do we have to go to the bedroom for that? As I remember, we\u2019ve managed quite nicely in the living room, the kitchen . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe garage, the car.\u201d Dillon laughed. \u201cI get the point. Well, if you\u2019re not gonna let me have my wicked way with you, what\u2019s in the bedroom?\u201d\n\nJamie grew serious. \u201cBen\u2019s ashes.\u201d\n\nDillon caught on. \u201cDoes that mean what I think it means?\u201d\n\nJamie nodded. \u201cBen\u2019s instructions were to wait until I was ready, then scatter his ashes.\u201d\n\nDillon ran his fingers through Jamie\u2019s hair. \u201cAs I remember it, Ben wanted you to wait until you were completely happy and then scatter his ashes.\u201d Dillon used one finger to lift Jamie\u2019s chin so that they were eye to eye. \u201cAre you happy, Jamie? Completely, I mean?\u201d\n\nJamie leaned into his touch. \u201cDo you doubt it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but you\u2019ve been through so much. If you want to wait a while, until you\u2019re sure you\u2019re ready to say goodbye, I think even Ben would understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already said goodbye, in my heart, anyway. All that\u2019s left now is to say goodbye in the physical sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea where you want to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I do.\u201d\n\n      #\n\nTo say that Cain Lucas, owner of Reed\u2019s largest junkyard/garage--and the place where Ben had bought most of the parts for his car--was surprised by Jamie\u2019s request was putting it mildly. The three of them stood inside Cain\u2019s immaculate shop. Cain pinned his dark eyes on Dillon, looking to him for help. \n\nDillon said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. This is Jamie\u2019s show. I\u2019m just along for the ride.\u201d\n\nCain turned back to Jamie. Jamie knew Cain from the times he\u2019d come out here with Ben, looking for parts. Jamie was a little in awe of the big man. With his long black hair and his bronze skin, Cain looked more like a Cherokee warrior than a garage owner. He was a study in beauty.\n\nJamie waited a tense minute while Cain made his decision. Jamie was afraid Cain would deny his request, but finally, he said, \u201cBen Lewis was a good customer of mine. I always try to put my customers first,\u201d he glanced down at the urn, \u201cno matter what the circumstances.\u201d Cain wiped his grease-stained hands on a rag he\u2019d pulled from the pocket of his coveralls, then pointed one long finger towards the rear of the junkyard. \u201cThe Firebirds and Camaros are in the back. Take your time.\u201d\n\nJamie almost sighed with relief. \u201cThanks, Mr. Lucas. I appreciate it.\u201d\n\nCain smiled, softening the lines of his face. \u201cYou can thank me by calling me Cain.\u201d\n\nJamie thanked him again and walked outside. Dillon followed, but stopped just outside the door. \u201cYou want me to go with you?\u201d\n\nJamie shook his head. \u201cThis is something I have to do by myself, I think.\u201d\n\nDillon kissed him on the lips. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you here then.\u201d\n\nJamie made his way through the junkyard, dodging wrecked cars and homeless engines. It took him about ten minutes to make it to the back. He stopped in front of a car that looked to be the same make and model as Ben\u2019s and sat on the slightly crooked hood. Holding the urn in his lap, he began to speak.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can hear me or not, Ben, but I kinda think you can. Maybe that\u2019s just wishful thinking on my part, but I don\u2019t believe it is. Anyway, I\u2019m here to fulfill your last wish.\u201d Jamie took a deep breath. \u201cYou asked me to release your ashes when I was completely happy. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible to be totally happy, not forever after, anyway, but I can honestly say that there\u2019s nothing more in my life that I want or need.\u201d He paused. \u201cOkay, so that\u2019s not true. If I could just have you back here with me, then I\u2019d want for nothing. But that isn\u2019t possible. You\u2019re gone, and I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nJamie stopped long enough to watch a barn swallow dip and dive over the wreckage of an old Ford a few cars away. Looking back down at the urn, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you already know this, but Chad is dead. He paid for what he did to you, just like Burke Carpenter paid. Like Morgan paid.\u201d Jamie sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that will give you peace, but I hope so. I hope you find in death what you never had in life.\u201d\n\nJamie took the lid off the urn. \u201cBy your own count, there were two things in this world you loved: me, and your car. I never could understand why you chose me out of all the guys you could have had, and I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you what you wanted in return. The best I can do is honor your memory. I wracked my brain to come up with the best way to do that, and all I could come up with was living my life to the fullest, enjoying each day in ways you\u2019re no longer able to do.\u201d Jamie grinned, \u201cThat, and I can give you a decent burial, so to speak.\u201d He slid off the hood of the car, clutching the urn close to his body. \u201cKnowing how much you loved that car of yours, I can\u2019t think of a better place for you to spend eternity. Well, your ashes, anyway.\u201d Jamie took a handful of ashes, scattering them in the slight breeze. He repeated the action until the urn was empty, then placed the container on the ground. \u201cGoodbye, Ben. God knows I\u2019ll never forget you.\u201d",
        "Jamie made it back to Dillon a few minutes later. \u201cI\u2019m finished.
