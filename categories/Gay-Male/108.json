        "It took almost an hour for Dillon to get Jamie calmed down. The minute he\u2019d laid eyes on Mitchell Harding, Jamie had started hyperventilating. Dillon tried everything he could to convince Jamie that he wasn\u2019t staring into the face of a dead man, but Jamie\u2019s panicked brain couldn\u2019t absorb the information, not in the state he was in. In the end, Dillon had little choice but to let Jamie\u2019s panic attack run its course. Dillon let out a deep breath when Jamie\u2019s own breathing returned to normal.\n\nDillon took a second to study Mitchell, who was sitting in one of their living room chairs. His resemblance to Ben was uncanny, but now that the initial shock was over, even Dillon could see some differences. Whereas Ben\u2019s hair had been short and spiky, Mitchell\u2019s hair was longish, clasped with a leather cord at the back of his neck. Ben\u2019s face had been unmarked perfection, but Mitchell had a wicked scar running the length of his right cheek from the corner of his eye to his chin. And there were other differences as well, like the more muscular build of Mitchell\u2019s body and the deeper tone of his voice as he apologized, yet again, for sending Jamie over the edge.\n\nMitchell looked to Jamie, who was sitting on the couch next to Dillon, still wheezing slightly. \u201cI am so, so sorry, man. I had no idea I was gonna trip you out like that. When my sister told me you wanted to see me and that it had something to do with Ben, I came straight to Reed. I didn\u2019t even think about calling first.\u201d\n\nDillon waved away the apology with one hand while the other moved in slow circles across Jamie\u2019s slightly turned back, trying to soothe and comfort him as best he could. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize, Mitchell. This wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, call me Mitch.\u201d Dillon nodded and made formal introductions for himself and Jamie. Mitch pushed a stray lock of hair away from his forehead, the leather of his jacket creaking as he moved. Crossing one faded, jean-clad leg over the other and picking at the heel of one black boot, Mitch inclined his head towards Jamie. \u201cWhat caused him to freak?\u201d\n\nWas he kidding? Dillon tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice. \u201cNot to be insensitive or anything, but you have to admit that you and Ben could pass for twins.\u201d\n\nPain clouded Mitch\u2019s warm brown eyes. \u201cShit. I didn\u2019t even think about that.\u201d His whiskey-smooth voice lowered an octave. \u201cI used to think Ben and I favored a lot, but then, after I got this scar--\u201d His hand moved unconsciously to his cheek and Dillon had the feeling the memory was as vicious as the scar itself. \u201cWell, anyway, I guess I just didn\u2019t think.\u201d He looked at Jamie again. \u201cIs he gonna be okay?\u201d\n\nJamie sat up, using Dillon for leverage and holding on to him like a lifeline. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Sorry about that, going all crazy on you, I mean. It\u2019s just, for a minute there . . .\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was so low, Dillon wondered if Mitch could hear it. \u201cFor a minute, I thought you were Ben.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand. You and my brother, you were tight, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jamie stopped for a second, gathering himself together. \u201cHe was my best friend. I still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nMitch shifted in his chair, his movements slow and measured. Even Dillon, a total stranger, could tell that the guy was grieving. But if he cared so much about his brother, why hadn\u2019t he seen him in over two years? Why the breach? \n\nBefore Dillon could pose the question, Mitch said, \u201cHow did my brother die? Lily told me something about a drunk driving accident, and that a couple of \u2018fags\u2019--her words, not mine--wanted to see me because they thought I might know something about his death. She gave me your names and a cell phone number, told me you lived in the town of Reed, and nothing much else.\u201d\n\nJamie was about to say something, but Mitchell\u2019s last statement raised a question in Dillon\u2019s mind. \u201cIf all Lily gave you were our names and a cell number, how did you find us?\u201d\n\nMitch sighed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, believe me. I\u2019ve been trying to pin you down for almost two days now. I knew that Ben\u2019s foster mother was a woman named Slater, but when I found her house, some guy told me she\u2019d moved. I finally tracked her down at the realtor\u2019s office where she works, but she refused to give me your address. Said she didn\u2019t want me hurting you the way I hurt Ben.\u201d His voice dropped again, and he lowered his eyes. \u201cAs if I could.\u201d He came back up to meet Jamie\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnyway, when she wouldn\u2019t tell me anything, I tried looking you both up in the phone book.\u201d He smiled, but there was little humor in it. \u201cI must have called every Walker in the book before giving up and trying to find you both under the name Carver. Wouldn\u2019t you know it? I had a hit the first time out. I guess I should have tried Carver first, anyway, since C comes before W.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cAlthough, after talking to the lady who answered the phone, I almost wish I hadn\u2019t called at all.\u201d He looked at Dillon with more than a little pity. \u201cYour mom is one angry lady.\u201d\n\nDillon wrinkled his nose. \u201cThat\u2019s one conversation I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t hear. I can just imagine what my mother told you. Needless to say, I\u2019m not exactly the favorite son around the Carver house.\u201d\n\nMitch snorted. \u201cTotal understatement, dude. The minute I said your name, your mom went off on a ten minute tear about you and James Walker being shacked up in, what was it she called it? Oh yeah, \u2018that Lambert Lane Den of Sin\u2019.\u201d Mitch shrugged. \u201cAt least I got your address out of it, even though I had to ask around town before I found the place. Not to mention the fact that it took me forever to spot this apartment behind that big ole house in front.\u201d Mitch gave a sheepish but sincere grin. \u201cThen it took me another couple of hours just driving around town, trying to work up the courage to come knock on your door. I wasn\u2019t even sure I\u2019d have the guts to climb the stairs.\u201d\n\nJamie spoke, and Dillon was relieved to hear some of the strength returning to his voice. \u201cI understand. It was the same way for me when I knocked on your sister\u2019s door, looking for you.\u201d\n\nMitch put both feet on the floor, propping his elbows on his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m not grateful that you came and told us about Ben, but why did you come looking for me? If you and Ben were as close as I think you were, you must have known that I haven\u2019t seen Ben in almost three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it, though. I didn\u2019t even know you existed. My best friend in the world had a whole family I didn\u2019t even know about. Why is that?\u201d\n\nMitch sighed again, this time making the sound of a man torn apart inside. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my sister, James. Would you brag about having a family like us? No, Ben did the right thing. He saw a chance to get out and he took it. Good for him.\u201d\n\nAs much sympathy as Dillon felt for Mitch and what he\u2019d lost, there was too much riding on what he might know for Dillon to let it go at that. Jamie was too tenderhearted to grill him, but Dillon was determined to get to the truth. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that, and you know it. You need to tell us what really happened between you and Ben to cause such a split between two brothers who by all accounts cared so much about each other. We also need any information you can give us about Burke Carpenter\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nMitch went on the defensive. Dillon figured him for a man tired of taking orders. \u201cOh yeah? You think I drove here from Michigan just to spill my guts to two guys I don\u2019t know from Adam? If I wouldn\u2019t talk to the cops when they came nosing around, what makes you think I\u2019ll talk to you?\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s voice came through loud and clear. \u201cBecause as soon as we\u2019re done talking to you, we\u2019re going to see the sheriff here in Reed, a guy named Brandon Nash. We\u2019re taking with us evidence of blackmail and murder, and all hell is going to break loose. Which side of all this you\u2019re on when the smoke clears depends on what you tell us within the next five minutes.\u201d\n\nDillon stared at Jamie in slack-jawed astonishment. So much for underestimating his partner. He should have known better. Jamie might be tenderhearted, but when it came to Ben, he was single minded and determined to a fault.\n\nMitch was just as astonished but for different reasons. \u201cWhoa. Back up a minute. Like I said before, Lily told me Ben was killed by a drunk driver. How does that tie in with blackmail and murder?\u201d\n\nJamie spelled it out, going from Barry Sledge and the supposed accident that took Ben\u2019s life, to finding the money and both sets of pictures, to the slashed tire, and then ending with the mismatched jack handle. By the time Jamie was done outlining each point, there was no doubt in Dillon\u2019s mind that Mitch was a believer.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure that this Barry Sledge guy couldn\u2019t have killed Ben?\u201d\n\nJamie shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure of anything in all this mess, but, like I said, Barry Sledge swears Ben was already dead when he hit him.\u201d\n\nMitch raked his hands through his hair, dislodging the leather cord, which fell unnoticed to the floor. He all but tied the silken black waves of his hair in knots as he tried to take it all in. \u201cAnd the last set of photos you found, you\u2019re sure those are of Burke?\u201d \n\n\u201cAs sure as I can be. All I saw was that one photo of him in his folder at the police station.\u201d\n\nMore surprise came from Mitch, and Dillon could also see a hint of admiration. \u201cYou went through Burke\u2019s folder?\u201d\n\nJamie blushed. \u201cUm, yeah. That\u2019s how I got your name and number. I sorta swiped a paper listing all the known occupants of Burke\u2019s house at the time of his death.\u201d\n\nMitch whistled. \u201cThat took a whole lot of intestinal fortitude, kid. If the police catch you, you are so screwed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, but it was worth it. And who are you calling kid? According to your sister, you\u2019re only two years older than me.\u201d\n\nMitch\u2019s eyes took on a faraway, almost wistful gleam. \u201cAccording to the calendar, I\u2019m two years older than you. But the way I\u2019ve lived, the things I\u2019ve seen . . . it ages you.\u201d He cleared his throat and came back to the present. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\n\nDillon took that one. \u201cWe want the truth about all of it, from your split with Ben to the night Burke died, anything that might tell us whether or not Burke killed Ben in retaliation for the blackmail.\u201d\n\nMitch balked. \u201cYou think Burke killed Ben for blackmailing him? No way. Burke was a slime ball, sure, but he didn\u2019t have the balls to kill anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could have hired someone to do it.\u201d\n\nMitch shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting my point, James. If Burke really was Ben\u2019s second blackmail victim, why pay Ben off in the first place if Burke was just going to kill him later? Why not do it at the get-go?\u201d When Jamie started to argue, Mitch said, \u201cBefore we take this any further, do you think I could take a look at those pictures? It might not even be Burke. You said yourself you couldn\u2019t be sure.\u201d When Jamie hesitated, Mitch went on with, \u201cIf you expect me to spill my deepest and darkest secrets to you, you\u2019re gonna have to give me something in return. Trust works both ways.\u201d\n\nDillon had to admit, the guy had a point. Jamie gave him a small nod and Dillon stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll get \u2018em. Jamie asked me to hide them for safekeeping.\u201d\n\nHe hated leaving Jamie alone with the guy, even if Mitch did seem sincere enough. Still, Dillon didn\u2019t waste any time retrieving the pictures he\u2019d taped to the back of one of Jamie\u2019s framed sketches. Having a budding architect in the family had its advantages.\n\nDillon came back in, handing the pictures to Mitch and reclaiming his place beside Jamie. He watched the emotions swirling across Mitch\u2019s face as he flipped through the pictures, finally throwing them down on the coffee table in disgust. \u201cThat\u2019s Burke. No doubt about it. The fucker was doing those girls in his own damn bedroom.\u201d\n\nJamie said, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need to look again. Those pictures have got to be at least two-and-a-half to three years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Those pics were taken just a few months ago. Four, maybe. Five tops\u201d\n\nJamie was on the edge of his seat, literally. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Ben left Burke years ago. How would he have gotten recent photos?\u201d\n\nMitch picked up the top picture, wincing at the image on the paper. \u201cThere\u2019s no way these pics are two or three years old. See that scar right there?\u201d Dillon and Jamie leaned in and looked to where Mitch\u2019s finger pointed towards a long, narrow gash trailing down the length of Burke\u2019s back. Even in the grainy photo, it was impossible to miss.\n\nDillon leaned back against the couch. \u201cSo he has a scar. So what? How does that prove when the pictures were taken?\u201d\n\nMitch placed the photo back on top of the pile. \u201cSeven months ago, Burke was in a car accident. Wrapped his Porsche around a tree. That scar came from a piece of jagged sheet metal slicing into his back. Took almost two hundred stitches to sew him up, and he was out of commission for another two months recovering from all his broken bones. That\u2019s why I say those pics had to be taken somewhere in the four to five month time frame.\u201d\n\nDillon rubbed his fingers over the back of his stiff neck. \u201cThen that leaves us with two choices. Either Ben snuck back to Chicago, set up a camera, and photographed good old Burke in action, or he had someone do it for him.\u201d\n\nMitch held up two fingers. \u201cI vote for the second scenario. After what happened the night Ben left, I don\u2019t think he would ever willingly have stepped foot in Burke\u2019s house again.\u201d Mitch shuddered. \u201cGod knows, I wish I\u2019d had the same choice.\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s voice was filled with compassion. \u201cWhat happened that night, Mitch? It\u2019s obvious that you loved Ben, that you\u2019re nothing like your sister. What happened that pulled you and your brother apart?\u201d\n\nMitch closed his eyes, but not before Dillon saw the tears. When he opened them again, the tears had been replaced with an iron resolve. Resolve to help bring his brother some justice.\n\nMitch cleared his throat. \u201cBefore I start this, do you think maybe I could have a glass of water?\u201d\n\nJamie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d When he came back in and handed Mitch the glass, Mitch said, \u201cThanks, man. Talking about this makes my mouth go dry.\u201d He wasn\u2019t kidding. While Jamie was sitting back down, Mitch drained half the glass in one long swallow. Placing it on the table near the pictures, Mitch said, \u201cHow much information did you get out of my sister?\u201d\n\nDillon rolled his eyes. \u201cDepends on what you call information. We know that she was in prison for dealing drugs, and that you and Ben were sent to more than one foster home. Oh, and we know that you aren\u2019t really \u2018bent,\u2019 as your sister so elegantly put it.\u201d\n\nMitch laughed. \u201cShow\u2019s what she knows, huh?\u201d Seeing Jamie\u2019s rounded eyes, he laughed again. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gay. I knew I was before I ever started working for Burke.\u201d He cringed. \u201cDidn\u2019t make fucking guys for money any easier, but hey, you do what you gotta do, right?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI guess Lily needs to believe that I\u2019m not really gay so she can keep living in that fantasy world of hers. More power to her, but I\u2019m through hiding. Is it hot in here to you?\u201d He pulled off his leather jacket and hung it on the back of his chair, revealing a wide, well-developed chest hidden beneath a tight black t-shirt. \u201cIs that all she told you?\u201d\n\nJamie said, \u201cNo, she also mentioned something about Burke having a partner.\u201d\n\nAgain, Mitch did a full body shudder. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get to him in a minute. First I want to answer your question about the night Ben left Chicago. I believe you\u2019ve been honest with me, and now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Lily went to prison, she blamed Ben for getting her busted.\u201d Mitch sniggered. \u201cPersonally, I always figured the little shit did it on purpose, and I was damn proud of him for it. Me and Ben, we were two of a kind. He hated living with Lily and selling that junk on the street corner as bad as I did. When we were busted and CPS moved us into foster care, Ben and I were relieved, especially since the social worker was trying to find a home that would take both of us so we could stay together.\u201d Mitch\u2019s expression turned dark. \u201cIf we\u2019d only known what we were walking into, we\u2019d have run away and never looked back.\u201d He shook himself. \u201cHindsight\u2019s a bitch. Anyway, the lady at CPS found several places that would take us, but each placement was only temporary. And Ben and I weren\u2019t exactly the easiest kids to deal with. Hell, we\u2019d practically raised ourselves, and here were these perfect strangers harping at us to do our homework and go to bed at ten o\u2019clock. We pitched up so much hell, it\u2019s no wonder they couldn\u2019t find a foster home to keep us. Enter good ole Burke.\u201d\n\nMitch paused, his hands shaking slightly. Dillon wondered how evil Burke had to have been so that just the mention of his name could cause such a reaction from Mitch. But Mitch went on with the story, in spite of the obvious distress he was feeling. \u201cWhen I first met the guy, I thought he was the answer to all our prayers. Well-spoken, dressed to kill. I thought Burke was a regular Superman, ready to come in and save us. After two weeks in his house, I knew better.\u201d Mitch fidgeted, trying in vain to find a more comfortable position. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long we were there before he started pimping us out, but I can tell you this, I believe the dirty bastard is roasting in a black pit for the things he made us do. And the hell of it is, no one could do a damn thing to stop him. He had so many freakin\u2019 cops and councilmen on his client list, I honestly think the guy could have screwed a goat on the mayor\u2019s front lawn and gotten away with it.\u201d\n\nJamie bit his lip. \u201cYou and Ben didn\u2019t have anybody you could turn to? No family besides Lily?\u201d\n\nMitch shook his head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anybody but each other. And for a while, that was enough. As much as I hated whoring, we made decent money, even if Burke did take most of it. Ben and I saved what we could, hoping one day we\u2019d have enough banked up to make a break for it.\u201d Mitch sighed. \u201cWe almost made it, too. And we would have, if it hadn\u2019t been for dear, sweet Uncle Jared.\u201d\n\nDillon and Jamie said, \u201cWho,\u201d almost in unison.\n\n\u201cBurke\u2019s partner. Uncle Jared. That\u2019s what he called himself, anyway, though I doubt it was his real name. See, he and Burke had a sort of silent partnership. Jared would provide and screen new customers for Burke in exchange for a cut of the profits.\u201d\n\nDillon said, \u201cIf he helped out in the operation, why do you call him a silent partner?\u201d\n\nMitch fiddled with the leather bracelet he wore on his left wrist--his only jewelry save for the tiny gold hoop in his ear. \u201cBecause even though Jared brought in guys, he had nothing to do with the day to day running of the business or the management of the boys. Nope, that was all Burke.\u201d He pulled a pack of cigarettes and a lighter out of the front pocket of his t-shirt. Tapping one out with less than steady fingers, Mitch started to light up, then stopped. \u201cSorry.\u201d He held the cigarette up to Dillon and Jamie. \u201cDo you mind? It helps settle my nerves.\u201d\n\nNormally Dillon would have said no, but the guy was doing them a favor by telling them this. Hearing no protest from Jamie, Dillon said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d He went in search of an ashtray, finding nothing better to use than an empty soft-drink can. He handed it to Mitch with an apology on his lips. \u201cSorry, man. It\u2019s all I could find.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Mitch set the can on the table next to his water glass and lit the cigarette, striking his Zippo lighter against the leg of his jeans in one fluid motion. He took a long, grateful drag before returning to his story. \u201cLike I said, Jared\u2019s job was to bring in business and screen the customers. Burke was always solid on one thing, and that was no violent stuff. None of that bondage or S and M shit. Not that he was worried about our welfare. No, Burke didn\u2019t want anyone damaging the merchandise.\u201d Mitch took another drag, and Dillon noticed that the shaking had settled somewhat. \u201cJared must have done a pretty good job screening, because Ben and I were there for almost three years without incident. Then, just before Ben\u2019s sixteenth birthday, everything changed.\u201d",
        "Dillon fought the urge to reach out and pat Mitch\u2019s arm, not sure how the gesture of comfort would be received. Instead, he said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nMitch sighed. \u201cBurke was out of town, one of the few times he actually left Jared in charge. Burke was pretty strict about no sex with clients in the house, which is why I was so shocked to see those pictures of him having sex with those girls in his own bedroom. He scheduled most of our encounters in out of the way motels, then slipped the motel managers extra cash to keep their mouths shut. But Burke was out of town, and Jared brought in this guy--Ralph, he called him--who was willing to pay extra if he could get it on with a matched set, twins. Burke didn\u2019t have a set of twins, but--\u201d\n\nJamie broke in. \u201cHe had you and Ben, and the resemblance was good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. I told Jared there was no way I was going to have sex with my little brother, but Jared assured me that the guy didn\u2019t want that, just wanted us both there. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot we could do about it, so Ben and I just went along with it. Things started off normal. Well, as normal as can be expected when you\u2019re selling your ass, but then the guy went nuts on us.\u201d\n\nUh oh. Dillon was almost afraid to ask, but he had to. \u201cNuts, how?\u201d\n\nAnother drag off the cigarette. \u201cThe guy got off on hearing other guys scream. The more pain he inflicted, the more he liked it. Ralph decided to do me first. His idea of foreplay was to knock me around, give me a bloody nose. I tried to fight back, and that\u2019s when he pulled out the knife.\u201d Mitch\u2019s fingers again found the scar on his cheek. \u201cI backed away as soon as I saw it, but I didn\u2019t move fast enough. Bastard took a strip out of my cheek. That\u2019s when Ben knocked him over the head with a baseball bat one of the other boys had left within easy reach.\u201d\n\nJamie winced. \u201cOuch on both counts, but good for Ben. He did the right thing protecting you like that.\u201d\n\nMitch shook his head. \u201cHe thought he was doing the right thing, but we\u2019d have both been better off if he\u2019d just let the guy do his worst to me.\u201d\n\nDillon found that hard to believe, not unless . . . \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Ben killed the guy?\u201d\n\nMitch took in a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened. Well, what we thought happened, anyway. When Ralph didn\u2019t move, I called out for help. Jared came running in, and not long afterwards, Burke came home from his trip. They ordered Ben and me out of the room, said they\u2019d take care of everything.\u201d Mitch sighed. \u201cAbout an hour later, Burke came in and told us that Ralph was dead, that Ben had killed him. He also threw Ben out of the house, told him to pack his things and go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. I thought Ben ran away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he wanted people to think, James. Ben had been giving Burke fits for a while. He was smarter than Burke\u2019s other boys, myself included. Ben was always so headstrong, less inclined to follow orders than the others. I think Burke was relieved to have a good excuse to get rid of him, top money maker or not. I wanted to go with him, but Burke wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nSince Ben had learned from the master, it didn\u2019t take Dillon long to figure out how Burke kept Mitch from leaving. \u201cHe blackmailed you, didn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\nMitch gave a weary nod. \u201cYeah, he did. Told me unless I broke off all ties with Ben, he\u2019d have Ben arrested for murder. Claimed he had the whole thing on tape, and knowing Burke\u2019s penchant for taping his boys having sex, I believed him. From that point on, anytime I mentioned leaving, even after I turned eighteen, Burke would threaten to have Ben locked up if I left.\u201d He gave a sad smirk. \u201cGuess I was too good at my job. Wanna know the funny part? The whole thing was one big lie. Ralph wasn\u2019t dead. The blow knocked him out, but except for one Louisville-Slugger sized headache, he was fine. Burke made the rest of it up to keep me right where he wanted me, and to get Ben out of his hair.\u201d\n\nDamn. And Dillon thought he\u2019d had it rough. \u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix months ago, not long after Burke\u2019s accident. I heard Burke and Jared arguing one afternoon. They didn\u2019t know I was anywhere around. Seems that Burke was trying to cut Jared out of the business. He\u2019d decided he didn\u2019t need a partner, anymore, and he wasn\u2019t happy about the fact that Jared was having sex with some of his boys. Jared was going through a laundry list of things he\u2019d done to help Burke out, including helping him get rid of Ben by staging Ralph\u2019s so-called murder. Jared threatened to tell me the truth if Burke dumped him, and he also threatened to expose Burke\u2019s own dirty little secret.\u201d Mitch\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what that secret was at the time, but I guess I do now, huh? God, I mean, I knew Burke was straight, but I thought he liked older women. Ones who at least qualified for a driver\u2019s license.\u201d\n\nJamie shivered, and Dillon pulled him in close without ever breaking eye contact with Mitch. \u201cHow did Burke respond to Jared\u2019s threats?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn typical Burke fashion. He shrugged them off, told Jared he didn\u2019t have any proof, and even if he got some, Burke was well connected enough to keep it from sticking.\u201d Mitch shook his head in amazement. \u201cEven flat on his back recovering from a car crash, Burke had one hell of a nerve. He told Jared to go ahead and tell me the truth, that I would never leave him, and that Jared would never have the balls to expose their little operation. On that last part, he was right. Apparently, Ben was the one who got the dirt on Burke and started blackmailing him.\u201d\n\nDillon turned to look at Jamie. He could almost see the wheels in Jamie\u2019s brain going round. Jamie said, \u201cI think they both did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said it yourself, Mitch. After what happened that night, why would Ben ever want to step foot inside that house again? Too much of a risk. To get the photos, he needed someone on the inside. Someone who could come and go when Burke wasn\u2019t around. Someone who knew the boys and the layout of the house.\u201d\n\nDillon said, \u201cSomeone like the mysterious Uncle Jared.\u201d\n\nMitch crushed his cigarette butt against the top of the Coke can and dropped it inside. \u201cSon-of-a-bitch, you\u2019re right. Even with Burke trying to cut Jared out, he\u2019d still have enough pull with the boys to get in and out of the place without Burke knowing. It\u2019s not like the boys cared enough about Burke\u2019s welfare to tell him that Jared was on the property. And Burke only had cameras set up in certain places. I should have thought of that the night Ralph was supposedly killed, but I was too damn scared to think rationally.\u201d\n\nDillon did reach out and pat him on the arm then, relieved when Mitch didn\u2019t flinch away. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up over it, man. You did the best you could under the circumstances. Out of curiosity, though, why didn\u2019t you leave when you found out that Burke and Jared had lied about Ralph?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked myself that same question a thousand times. Scared, I guess. Where was I gonna go? I had a little bit of trick money saved up, but not enough to last any length of time, especially not after taking out the amount Lily guilted me into sending her each month. I was too old for foster care, and I\u2019d burned all my bridges with Ben.\u201d Mitch picked at a tiny hole just above the knee of his jeans. \u201cI only have one skill, and Lily didn\u2019t want me unless I \u2018earned my keep,\u2019 so it wasn\u2019t like I had a whole lot of options. All that changed when I came home from a night of tricking and found Burke\u2019s body shredded into hamburger on the front porch.\u201d\n\nJamie closed his eyes, and Dillon wondered if he was remembering the pictures he\u2019d seen at the police station. Opening them again, he said, \u201cYou were the one who found him?\u201d\n\nMitch nodded. \u201cYeah, and from the looks of it, the killer hadn\u2019t been gone long. If I\u2019d gotten home about fifteen minutes sooner, there would have been two bodies lying on that porch.\u201d\n\nDillon was horrified. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing I could do. I made a run for it. I more or less flew upstairs, grabbed what cash I\u2019d saved, then made a break for it before the cops got there. At least Burke had no objections to us owning our own cars. In fact, he liked it because he didn\u2019t have to arrange a ride for us back and forth between jobs. All of the other boys were still out on their runs, so no one saw me. I hopped in my car, and I was outta there before I could get caught. When the police started their investigation, one of the guys who lived in the house gave them my name and told them I lived there, too. They traced me back to Lily, who was only too happy to help them since she figured she probably wouldn\u2019t be getting any more money out of me. She called me on my cell phone and told me the cops were looking for me. She even sounded happy about it, the witch. But I played it cool. I went down to the station on my own and gave them my statement--something to the affect of not having seen or heard anything. They must have bought it, because they let me go with the standard, \u2018If you think of anything that might help the case, please let us know.\u2019 That was it. They were done with me, and I hit the road.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Dillon remembered. \u201cYou said something earlier about Michigan. Is that where you went?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I met this john a few months ago, one of the only ones who\u2019s ever really been nice to me. He lives up there, but comes to Chicago every now and again on business. He\u2019s a decent enough guy, only picks up hustlers who are over the age of eighteen. Anyway, he told me once if I ever needed anything, I could call on him. I made it seem like I was up that way for a visit or something.\u201d Mitch pulled out another cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m sure he knew I was lying, but he\u2019s cool enough not to ask any questions. I hid out with him until I called Lily three days ago to see if the heat was off. I more or less had to promise to pick up a few tricks and send her some cash just to get her to tell me anything. That\u2019s when I found out you guys were looking for me. I drove straight here, and the rest, you know.\u201d\n\nDillon had no idea listening to someone else\u2019s story could be so emotionally draining. He ached deep inside for Mitch, and, as much as he hated to admit it, for Ben. He stood up and stretched. \u201cSo here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got so far. We know that Burke had a partner, and that he\u2019s most likely the one who gave those pictures of Burke to Ben. Why do that though? Why use Ben to blackmail Burke?\u201d\n\nMitch lit the second cigarette. \u201cBecause what Burke said was true. Jared wouldn\u2019t have the balls under normal circumstances to do his own dirty work. He\u2019d want someone else to handle the negotiations. Who better than Ben, a guy who hated Burke with every fiber of his being? Hell, knowing my brother, he jumped at the chance to give Burke a little payback.\u201d\n\nJamie again moved to the edge of his seat. \u201cThen it makes perfect sense that Burke would have turned all his anger on Ben. Maybe he thought Ben was acting alone. Maybe he thought killing Ben was the only way to get out from under the threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not buying it, James. I do think Burke was bluffing with Jared when he told him he wasn\u2019t worried about having his secrets exposed. Otherwise, he never would have paid the blackmail in the first place. But the very fact that he did pay it rules out murder in my mind. If Burke was gonna kill Ben, he\u2019d have done it right at the beginning, when Ben made his first demand. He wouldn\u2019t have waited.\u201d Mitch thought for a minute. \u201cYou said Ben was blackmailing another guy, some rich man whose son Ben was seeing. What about him? Could he have killed Ben?\u201d\n\nJamie shook his head. \u201cHe was out of the country on a business trip. I checked. And even so, if your argument towards Burke being innocent is \u2018why pay if you\u2019re just gonna kill the guy,\u2019 then the same could be said for Mr. Barnes, He paid Ben almost as much as Burke did. If he was gonna kill Ben or hire someone else to do it, why pay?\u201d\n\nMitch thumped his ashes into the can. \u201cThere goes that theory.\u201d\n\nDillon paced the living room. \u201cI think you\u2019re both overlooking the obvious. If Ben was willing to double cross Ash the way he did, who\u2019s to say he didn\u2019t double cross this Jared guy? We\u2019re all reasonably sure that Jared and Ben had to be working together. Who\u2019s to say Burke didn\u2019t pay off Ben only to have Ben keep the whole thing, rather than giving said partner a cut?\u201d\n\nJamie stood up then. \u201cWe could sit here all night talking this out and never know the truth. Until we find out who this Jared guy really is, and how he hooked back up with Ben after Ben left Burke\u2019s, there\u2019s no way to know whether we\u2019re dead on or grasping at straws.\u201d He started towards the kitchen, then stopped. \u201cI\u2019ve got a howling case of the munchies. You guys hungry?\u201d\n\nDillon grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to ask. You know I\u2019m always hungry.\u201d He looked down at Mitch. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\nMitch rose to his feet and shook his head. \u201cI should go. It\u2019s late, and I\u2019m sure you guys will want to hit the sack soon.\u201d\n\nJamie said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that late, and besides, you came all this way just to talk to us. The least we owe you is a meal, even if it is just a bologna sandwich and a bag of chips.\u201d\n\nMitch plunked the remains of his cigarette into the can and carried it to the wastebasket at the edge of the kitchen. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything. I\u2019m the one who owes you for being there for Ben when I wasn\u2019t.\u201d He paused. \u201cThere is one thing I\u2019d like to ask of you, though.\u201d\n\nDillon went on alert and stepped closer to Jamie. \u201cOh yeah, and what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nMitch smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a regular guard dog where this boy\u2019s concerned, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He smiled at Jamie. \u201cYou\u2019re one lucky guy to have someone who loves you that much.\u201d To both of them he said, \u201cI was wondering if you had a picture of Ben I could have?\u201d\n\n\nDillon was immediately ashamed. \u201cHey, man, I\u2019m sorry. I had no idea you didn\u2019t have any.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo harm, no foul. I have some old ones, a few from when we were kids, but nothing recent.\u201d Mitch\u2019s voice dropped and so did his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been close to three years since I last saw him. I don\u2019t even know exactly what he looked like when he died.\u201d\n\nRight at that moment, Dillon wished the damn apartment was wallpapered with pictures of Lewis, anything to ease this guy\u2019s pain. But he didn\u2019t have so much as a snapshot of Ben, and judging from the look on Jamie\u2019s face, neither did he. Jamie said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a single picture. Ben hated photos. They had to make him take his school pictures for the yearbook.\u201d The minute he said it, Jamie smacked himself on the forehead. \u201cOf course. Ben\u2019s picture is in last year\u2019s yearbook. I\u2019ll go ahead and show it to you now, then see if I can get you a copy from somewhere. Sit back down while I get it.\u201d\n\nMitch smiled, the first real smile he\u2019d given since walking in. \u201cThanks, man. That means a lot.\u201d\n\nMitch took a seat in the same chair as before and waited for Jamie. He didn\u2019t have to wait long. Jamie came in from the bedroom with last year\u2019s book and stood on one side of Mitch\u2019s chair, leaving Dillon to take the other. Flipping through the book, Jamie opened it to the page Ben was on and laid it in Mitch\u2019s lap. \u201cThere you go.\u201d\n\nMitch traced the face in the picture with one finger, so much hurt and longing in that one gesture that Dillon wanted to weep. Not surprisingly, the tears were flowing freely down Mitch\u2019s cheeks when he looked up and said, \u201cHe looks so grown up in this picture. God, I wish I could have been there, especially when . . . well, you know.\u201d He took a minute to clear his eyes, then said, \u201cAre there any more pictures of him in here?\u201d\n\nJamie grinned. \u201cKnowing Ben, not if he could help it. But you can flip through and see. The yearbook staff always fills the extra pages with snapshots of the student body.\u201d\n\nMitch nodded. \u201cThat part of high school I do remember.\u201d He picked up the book and started flipping through. \u201cI\u2019m glad at least that Ben was sticking it out with school. I quit and never went back. I--\u201d Mitch stopped and his entire face froze. He dropped the book face down and jumped to his feet. \u201cWhat the hell kinda game are you trying to pull?\u201d\n\nDillon rounded the chair and picked up the book. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me you didn\u2019t know anything about Burke\u2019s partner. I wanna know what\u2019s going on, and I wanna know now.\u201d\n\nDillon opened the book to the page it had fallen on and saw the full-page picture of Dan Morgan. \u201cThis? You mean Principal Morgan?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s calling himself?\u201d Mitch searched first Dillon\u2019s and then Jamie\u2019s faces. \u201cMy God, you really didn\u2019t know. Your Principal Morgan is my Uncle Jared. We just found Burke\u2019s partner.\u201d\n\nDillon dropped the book like it was a live coal. \u201cJesus.\u201d He took one look at Jamie\u2019s horrified expression and said, \u201cThat\u2019s  \n\nit. We\u2019re calling Brandon. Now. If he\u2019s not back from Chicago, the dispatcher\u2019s just gonna have to track him down.\u201d He looked at Mitch. \u201cIf you\u2019re not gonna back us up on this, then you can leave.\u201d\n\nMitch shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m with you all the way on this one.\u201d\n\nJamie reached for the phone, just as Dillon heard a loud pop and the living room window exploded inwards in a hail of glass and bullets.\n\n {To Be Continued} "
