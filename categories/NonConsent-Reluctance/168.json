        "Rain finally broke the dry spell of late August but had only made the heat worse. James walked through the streets of London, trying once again as he had every day this past fortnight to forget about her. His desperation to be back in the city had stopped making sense. The nights smelled like burning mitre and the days smelled like hundreds of moving sweating bodies. The waste water of the Thames cloyingly hung in the humid air.\n\nHis mind drifted back to Sophia and the countryside; of making love to her in the millpond and eating fresh picked berries off her naked body. He cursed himself again. He needed to forget her and leave her to her piece of land. Whitcomb had a courier deliver to him the final deed for the farm, but he didn't dare go back to tell her. Instead he'd impotently sent her money every week, putting off telling her the truth or facing her ever again.\n\nHe thought about the smell of the fresh earth on the road to the farm, the quiet rustle of the ash trees lining the pond, and the clover scent of her hair. He stopped in his tracks. He needed a woman to forget about her. This wasn't the first love affair that had ended in his life and each time he would return for a day or two to the Rose Tavern and all would be well.\n\nHis heels turned on their own and started walking toward Drury Lane, picking up pace until they reached the gate of the Rose. Already he could see plump prostitutes wandering in and out on the arms of men of every station. He walked up to the door when a frizzy haired brunette in a tattered red gown answered.\n\n\"Wha' you doin' 'round 'ere? Thought you couldn't ge' it up for a real woman no more,\" she said, chewing on the words and flashing a shoulder.\n\n\"Kindly shut your mouth, Evelyn,\" James said to her, \"Your breath smells like other men's cocks.\"\n\nHer mouth gaped wide open before she closed it again. A relatively prim woman with a streak of gray interrupting her auburn hair came up behind the insulted doxy, \"Well, if it isn't James Gardiner. I didn't think you would come back to us.\"\n\n\"Madame Brown,\" James said, removing his hat, \"It's been too long. Might I come in?\"\n\nShe pushed Evelyn aside and opened the door. James stepped in to raucous noise at the bar and a blur of red velvet curtains and uplifted breasts, rouged cheeks and painted-on beauty patches. The entire place smelled like gin and sex covered up with the cloying scents of lavender, roses and vanilla. Normally this would have been enough to excite him but he felt nothing. Several drinks would cure that.\n\nHe grabbed a pint of ale and listened to Madame Brown titter away with London gossip before he started growing impatient. There was a time when James would to listen to the Madame through several rounds, the woman occasionally divulging something important about a potential business contact that James could use to his advantage. Now, he simply could care less. He set down the empty pint and ordered another.\n\n\"I want to see your very best girl. You know the one,\" he said, looking at her as she floundered for a moment, \"Now!\"\n\nMadame Brown looked at him with a half smile, \"You asked for this a month ago if I remember and then we didn't see you again. You're not going to waste my girl's time again, are you? Last time you took her out to buy a dress and\u2014\"\n\n\"No. This time it's straight to business,\" he said setting down the emptied second round, \"Where is she?\"\n\nMadame Brown pulled aside a youthful, bare-chested young man with kohl lightly riming his eyes, \"Charles, fetch Julia, would you?\"\n\n\"Right away, mum.\"\n\nMadame Brown turned back toward James who was drinking half way into round three, \"Julia was none too happy about last time you saw her. Five guineas. In advance.\"\n\nJames clenched his teeth and fished around in his pocket for the coins before slamming them down on the table in front of her, \"As I said; straight to business.\"\n\n\"No refunds,\" she said, biting down on the side of the first coin, \"And if you've really gone sly on us as she suspected last time, Charles would be more than happy to\u2014\"\n\n\"No. Julia will do. Thank you,\" he set down the empty third pint and watched her appear at the top of the stairs, delicate dyed blonde curls framing a heart shaped face with an upturned nose. She wore a blue and turquoise silk robe. James looked up at her. Before Sophia, he had rutted on this woman many times. Now all he could do was compare her. Her smile was forced and imperious; not sweet and shy like Sophia's. Her hair was too well coifed; not wild bunches of curls he could get lost in, like Sophia's. Her eyes... James tried to snap himself out of it. This was purely business. He'd never be able to have his life back the way it was if he didn't put Sophia out of his head, and a quick round with Julia was the perfect solution. He ordered a shot of gin and tossed it back quickly.\n\nJames walked up the stairs, grabbing her roughly by the wrist, \"Why it's Jamie, returned to us! My, and aren't you in a hurry for what will probably be a whole lot of nothing again...\" she said as he led her down the hall to an empty room, not saying a word. He slammed the door behind them; drowning out most of the pub noise downstairs and the sound of muffled fornication in the rooms upstairs. It did nothing to drown out visions of Sophia dancing in their room to the sound of the violin.\n\n\"Quiet. Get on the bed.\"\n\nJulia walked backward seductively and lay on the pillows, her knees spread out to reveal the cream white insides of her thighs ending in the shorn and naked pink lips of her sex, \"So something quick then? Are you looking to burn down a guinea a minute?\"\n\n\"Just be silent,\" he snapped, \"Remove your clothes.\"\n\nAs Julia complied as the words triggered James's memory. Julia slipped off her robe, revealing her sumptuously curved naked body only interrupted by white heeled shoes and silk stockings climbing up to her thighs. James thought back to that first conversation past initial introduction he'd made with Sophia. Though he'd behaved like a beast toward her, the thought of being inside of her again powerfully hardened him momentarily. But with one look at Julia, he was slowly softening once more. He had to take drastic action. James quickly undid the placket of his breeches and lunged over her, hearing her breath catch as he lay astride of her suddenly.\n\nHe stared at her, inches from her face. She was open to him, waiting. James looked down at her once more and leapt away cursing himself, pacing the room and running his hands through his hair.\n\n\"God's wounds... twice, now?!\"\n\nJames bellowed up at the ceiling above him, continuing to pace drunkenly as he fixed his pants shut once more.\n\n\"If I didn't know better Jamie, I'd say you're in love,\" Julia said calmly, \"It's almost cute.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you silly strumpet. Yes, I'm in love! Desperately. Are you happy? I can't get her out of my mind,\" he paced again, looking up at the ceiling, \"I need to be rid of her.\"\n\n\"Well... what does she need?\" Julia said, standing up.\n\nHe froze. It was the one thing he'd been avoiding this entire time. He felt sick, and not just from a stomach full of ale and gin. Sophia most likely hated him now, if she ever cared about him to begin with. He wasn't sure which possibility he disliked more: that she was relieved to be rid of him or that he had broken her heart by leaving. James turned back to Julia, \"Lie back down again.\"\n\nJulia shrugged, \"All right, but I don't think it will\u2014 Hey! What are you doing?\"\n\nJames silently removed one of her shoes and held up her stocking-covered foot to the palm of his hand, carefully examining it against his hand.\n\n\"James, I don't do feet. Talk to Annabelle if\u2014\"\n\n\"Will you please be quiet? I'm trying to see something here,\" Her feet were just a little too short, but they would do, \"You're coming with me today.\"\n\n\"Clothes modeling? I'm not staying out for hours on your paltry three shillings, again. That was just a favor last time, because I thought I would get to have a go at that beautiful cock of yours later on. And besides, rainy days are the best draw for me.\"\n\n\"I'll pay you a guinea an hour.\"\n\nJulia's mouth turned up, \"I think we have ourselves a deal.\"\n\nSophia woke up and looked out the window at the rain, listening to it smack against the roof in waves. The millpond's surface was broken into pieces by the fat drops of rain. She lay in bed in her chemise and listened to Katje bustling downstairs, cooking and talking to Aletta in Dutch. She felt like a stranger in her own house, unaccustomed to being waited on. Here she sat on the bed in her long chemise, wrapped in David Farthing's old cream-colored silk robe. Katje had insisted upon it, but Sophia was bored to death and needed something to take her mind off of James.\n\nShe hopped off the bed and instantly felt dizzy, a wave of nausea come up again. She had been sick intermittently for almost a month and now nearly every day this week and wondered when it was going to let up. She attributed it to the new array of food Katje was subjecting her to, and her growing melancholy about James. Still, she walked over calmly now to the chamber pot and let loose the emptiness filling her stomach.\n\nShe felt better. Katje bustled into the room just as Sophia was wiping her mouth off with a handkerchief and set down a tray of berries and cream before walking over to Sophia and fixing her hair.\n\n\"What... Katje, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"You have guest downstairs.\"\n\nJames? Her heart flew into her chest, \"Is it him?\"\n\nKatje sighed and shook her head before muttering something foreign, frustrated and slightly angry under her breath, \"But I think that Master James send him.\"\n\nSophia bolted downstairs and saw a young man with red hair and a stack of white boxes next to him. He had removed his coat and hat near the door and had knelt down to talk to little outgoing Aletta. He looked up at Sophia and stood to bow slightly.\n\n\"You are Miss Sophia Latwicke?\"\n\nSophia curtsied to greet him, \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Aaron Ravenscroft, apprentice to the Shudalls.\"\n\n\"Should I know...\" Sophia trailed off looking at him quizzically.\n\n\"...the premier tailoring house on Saville Row?\" he paused and quickly cleared his throat, \"I have been sent by a... Mr. James Gardiner... to deliver these for you. Along with this note.\"\n\nSophia clutched the note, dumbfounded. She watched as he wiped off the wet boxes with a cloth and opened each of them, starting with the small square package on top of the pile which Aletta was examining closely\n\n\"It's presents for you! Miss Sophia, can I help open them?\"\n\n\"Of course you can, Aletta. Bring it here.\"\n\nAletta walked forward, the box filling her small thin arms, as Sophia removed the cover. Inside was a pair of white shoes. He had remembered what she had wanted to have from that last day they spent together before he left for London. She looked at her first name in his handwriting, so similar to Mr. Farthing's, and cracked the wax seal bearing his initials. Only two words appeared on the paper.\n\n\"Forgive me.\"\n\nSophia held it close to her as Ravenscroft and Aletta unwrapped the four remaining long flat boxes. She drifted away in thought, swept back to their last night together, remembering the exact moment when he confessed that he loved her. She felt warmth suddenly low in her belly as she was taken back to when he lay with her, skin on skin, deep within her. How afraid she was to return those feelings to him...\n\n\"Miss?\" the young man said, interrupting her reverie and indicating the opened parcels.\n\nSophia knelt down to look at the dresses spread out before her, thin paper delicately framing each one. Here was a rich burgundy silk sack back gown, with white lace and a matching chemise, followed by a pistachio and cream nightdress with a white long-sleeved nightgown. She peeled back the paper of the third and fourth boxes to find a brilliant sapphire blue gown in one and a light golden one that matched her hair in the last box. She stood backed away from the boxes, her face white as a sheet and dizzy.\n\nAletta was jumping up and down as though it were Christmas morning, \"Oh, Miss Sophia, they are so beautiful! Did Master James have these made for you?\"\n\nThe tailor's apprentice straightened up again, \"Mr. Gardiner told me to tell you that these are only the first four.\"\n\nSophia blanched, \"The first four?\"\n\n\"He had us put a rush on them. The remaining eight gowns are still being tailored.\"\n\n\"And you came all this way...\"\n\n\"Mr. Gardiner insisted.\"\n\nShe started to feel dizzy again for a moment, \"Can you please wait for me to write a letter in return?\"\n\nRavenscroft smiled, \"I would be very happy to, honestly. Would you mind if I sat by the fire and took some tea? It's quite a drive back to London.\"\n\n\"It won't be a long letter, but please do,\" Sophia went to David's old writing desk and wrote out four words. She calligraphied James's name across the front and sealed the back before handing it to the tailor's apprentice.\n\nIt had mercifully stopped raining, the first time in over a week. James dropped two coins in the apprentice's hand for his service and information and shut the door of his Westminster townhouse behind him, keeping out the humid evening noise of the streets. It was from her. His hands shook and his heart raced as he examined the closure. It was his uncle's seal, but Sophia had drawn a rough 'S' with the end of a quill through the red wax, marking it as her own. He smiled, his pulse drumming in his ear as he opened the letter and read its brief contents.\n\n\"Only if you return.\"\n\nSophia would forgive him if he came back. The thought brought joy and terror to him all at once. He needed her by his side, and her infectious charm and love for the countryside had spread now to his view of the city. There was so much he needed to be here in the city. He was a financier of transport, a gentleman, a man to see and be seen, a climber into the society forbidden to his farming forbearers.\n\nHe looked at her letter again, his uncle's seal standing out. James was no pawn. This game that Uncle David had played with both their lives was a cruel joke; he had certainly predicted that James would need to have her, but David hadn't predicted that James would fall in love with her. He was a self-made man, not consigned to the lot of a wealthy yeoman farmer as his family had been, and intended for his eventual heir to climb even higher than he.\n\nBut this sweet country girl had spun him about. James had intended on marrying some penniless lesser noblewoman in a marriage a la mode for heirs one day after he'd finished having his pleasure with London. Now he found himself wondering what the point of all of his struggles truly were.\n\nWhen he took a hard look at himself his social climbing seemed pithy and unimportant in the face of true happiness. He pictured her as she had whirled about in the bedroom, dancing to the sound of the violin as he played for her. She was so unconsciously innocent, able to make him see a more beautiful and perfect world through her emerald eyes.\n\nHe closed his eyes and felt his cock harden suddenly as he envisioned his hands on her hips, watching her writhe above him, her breasts riding high as she took him deep inside her body. Her innocence only held up to a point. He knew the ways to unlock her passion. James made his way upstairs and undressed for bed, placing her letter on the nightstand.\n\nHe writhed and twisted under the sheets, blood still pooling in his groin and his mind alive with visions of Sophia's creamy naked flesh. He pictured her again, her abdomen snaking in slow circles as he stared up at her. His hands moved down his thighs into the position of how he held her hips when she rode atop his body and thrust his groin slightly into the air. His fingers traveled inward, tracing the ridge of flesh upward and encircling the head with his hand, pulling down hard.\n\nJames sucked in air through his teeth, picturing her graceful glide over him, the smooth curves of skin and the hardened points of her breasts under a halo of flaxen hair. He gripped his shaft, pulling up and descending, cradling his scrotum with his left hand. His mind focused on that perfect velvet cavern that fit tight around him. He could see the look of desire and surrender in her eyes each time he entered her.\n\nHis mind trailed to the last time they had made love, of pausing as she came just to feel the extraordinary spasms of her flesh beneath his, held fast against his body as her tremors rolled through her. His thumb came up over the head and he could feel himself getting close. Her voice rang through his subconscious: return to me James, return to me...\n\nA rushing heat shot through him, making him groan as he came. His back arched as a rope of his seed exited quickly, followed by a few spurted drops as his eyes remained shut. He cleaned up and looked to the nightstand where the open letter lay.\n\n\"Only if you return.\"\n\nHe blew out the candle and laid in the dark, the cold emptiness of the pillow next to him his only companion. He reached across the sheet for the woman he knew wasn't there, \"Sophia...\"\n\n\"James...\"\n\nShe at last stilled her damp finger on her pulsing bud, feeling her thighs twitch as she lay in bed gasping. A sheen of sweat clung to her forehead as her body recovered and waited in vain to feel his arms encircle and hold her. It was never the same. Her body needed him; her heart needed him.\n\nShe wanted to sit across the table from him laughing and talking, ride with him through the countryside, dance for him as he played the violin and feel the warmth of his arms around her as she slept. It wasn't just the sex. She loved him. Against all odds, she had fallen in love with him. But she could never tell him this while he owned her. It was compulsory if she did that, not genuine. She didn't want him to have to guess whether she meant it or not. She wanted him to know it.\n\nSophia smoothed down her new silk nightgown and turned on her side, holding one of the pillows close to her chest. She shut her eyes and drifted off to sleep, lulled by the chirp of frogs after the rain. When she awoke, her stomach was on fire. Dizzily, she pursed her lips together and made a beeline for the chamber pot, holding her hair back as she emptied the contents of her stomach.\n\nThis was only happening in the mornings. Her thoughts took her back to the orphanage when she was twelve and had just gotten her courses, watching pretty, ginger-haired Gwenny Millhouse wave goodbye to the younger girls when she was sent to work in the household of a ship builder in Ramsgate. She only lasted three weeks before being dismissed and sent back to the orphanage. Not long after, she began getting sick in the mornings, asking Sophia and the others to not tell the head mistress. Sophia had remained silent, but it became apparent very quickly that Gwenny was pregnant, her belly swelling a few months later. They had sent her to another home for girls in faraway Cornwall and she was never seen nor heard from again.\n\nSophia turned white with fear. When had she last had her courses? She tried to count back the weeks. Everything had happened so quickly for her; first the death of poor Mr. Farthing, then James sweeping into her life and turning it upside down. Ice crawled up her back. She had forgotten completely. Counting back she was supposed to have had her courses over three weeks ago, before James had shown up the second time and surprised her in the millpond. That meant...\n\nShe looked down at her belly and pressed her hand lightly just under her navel. Her mind flashed back to the iron candelabra she had planned to use to end him, how he had reduced her to a quivering mass of nerves at just the sight of his form rising off the bed to stalk across the room and possess her where she stood. She remembered lying in afterglow beside James the night he had initiated her into pleasure, his fingers resting on her womb as she had brought her hand to meet his, interlacing their fingers over her as they drifted to sleep.",
        "\"How is it you can make me feel this way?\"\n\nSophia burst into tears, loud sobs, as she cradled her belly and their child within. The spark of life had started within her late that night. She was certain of it. Now she feared his return. Would he cast her out, as poor Gwenny had been turned out, when she was discovered? She looked down again and caressed her womb. Whatever James thought about it, this child was hers and she would protect it with her life. She wouldn't tell him, if she ever got the chance to tell him in the first place. There was the possibility that she would never see him again.\n\nThe uncertainty and the thought of being separated from him forever made her nauseous again, and she doubled over in front of the chamber pot, not hearing the door creak open lightly behind her. She wiped off the edges of her mouth and spit the last remaining bile into the ceramic pot before turning around to see Katje staring at her. The woman's brow was crinkled with worry and she was wringing her hands.\n\n\"You would like ontbijt this morning?\" she said slowly, using the Dutch word for 'breakfast'. Sophia had asked her to start teaching her some words in Dutch in exchange for correcting her English.\n\n\"'Would you like' and yes, thank you, Katje. Something very light, if you don't mind,\" she said wiping a tear away from her face. Katje was looking around Sophia to the bile in the chamber pot and back at Sophia, who was still clutching her womb.   Katje looked at her quizzically again and came closer, \"Miss Sophia... Do you... do you have baby inside?\"\n\nSophia burst into tears and crumpled at the base of the dresser as Katje rushed over to her.\n\n\"Oh Miss, do not worry. You will be fine. I had baby three times, and I just fine. You will see,\" she said stroking Sophia's hair.\n\n\"Please don't tell him. Please,\" Sophia said in tears, \"James can't know about this.\"\n\n\"But Master James love you. Trust me, I know. I see many, many women come and go. But you Miss Sophia, you are different. You he think about all the time.\"\n\n\"Please Katje, just promise me!\"\n\n\"I not tell. I promise,\" she sighed and shook her head, \"He should be with you right now, not in that vreselijk city.\"\n\nThe start of September brought with it a cold snap once the rains subsided. James moved quickly through the streets, past the drunks and apple carts, peddlers and beggars, making his way to the Rose Tavern. He rapped on the door until Madame Brown appeared.\n\n\"I think we've had quite enough of your bullshit for one month, Mr. Gardiner.\"\n\n\"Where is Julia?\"\n\n\"She's preparing to meet with a client. A real client. I'm not about to disturb her for the likes of you.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Brown, just let him in for God's sake,\" Julia said, appearing behind the red-clad woman in a translucent light blue chemise, \"He won't be long.\"\n\nJames muscled past the Madame, tipping his hat and giving her an oily smile as he wandered upstairs after Julia. She shut the door behind her, \"All right, talk. But talk fast, James. I'm in the middle of getting ready. I have a date with the Duke of Somerset tonight,\" she said over her shoulder.\n\n\"But he's so old...\"\n\n\"And so rich, darling. He's taking me to the theatre like a proper courtesan, not some two penny whore,\" she sucked her cheeks together and examined them in the mirror, \"So what sins have you come to confess, my child?\"\n\nJulia smoothed rouge over her cheeks in the mirror as James kept his eyes on her reflected face instead of letting them drift down to her barely clothed round ass. Not two months ago, he would have simply told Julia her date was cancelled and spent the day with her legs wrapped around his hips. Now the idea didn't so much repulse him, as it just simply did nothing for him. James sighed, \"She wants me to come back.\"\n\n\"So go back, then.\"\n\n\"It's not that simple, for reasons I told you about last week,\" he said, sitting on the edge of her lush bed, watching her prepare herself for another man.\n\n\"I really think your uncle was just trying to help make a match for you. But if you can't handle that, then screw what your uncle wants. Just because you go back doesn't mean you have to marry her like he wanted. You're James Gardiner. You live life on your own terms. Ask her to be your mistress.\"\n\n\"And leave London? She won't leave the farm, that's for sure.\"\n\nShe brushed white powder over her face, \"James, I don't understand what makes you want to stay here so badly. You hate London anyway. You always have.\"\n\n\"What? That's nonsense! I love London.\"\n\nShe snapped her powder shut and looked back at him, \"No man gambles, drinks and fucks the way you do if they aren't looking for some kind of escape.\"\n\nHe folded his arms, his mouth dry and partly open in defensive shock.\n\n\"Trust me,\" she said turning back and running her charcoal stick over the candle before blowing on it, \"I know men. You came here to escape your family, and you hate it here. The only reason you are here is because it's not there. Well now you have something there that's worth pursuing and you're just afraid is all. Now, stop staring at me like a fish and talk. I can't go on babbling at you when I'm doing my eyes.\"\n\nHe sat for a moment staring at her in indignation, \"What do you mean when you say 'gambles, drinks and fucks' like I do?\"\n\n\"Busy with my right eyelid, dear; answer your own damn question,\" she said dismissively.\n\nHe sat for a minute to think about everything she had just said. London held no sway over him since he returned. He had the sneaking feeling since he came back that his life here was meaningless, and was already convinced that a life with out her was even worse. He thought back trying to even remember the last six years of his life here and the nights all seemed a blur of whores, cards and gin, \"Julia, I think you may be right.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm right.\"\n\n\"I have my home here, though.\"\n\n\"How much are you paying for it?\"\n\n\"Fifty a year.\"\n\n\"Ha! You're being robbed,\" she said adding the last bit of kohl to her left eye.\n\nHe wrinkled his brow at her, \"So, you think I should just give up all my holdings here and live in the country?\"\n\n\"No, you idiot, keep your over-priced townhouse and visit the city on business when you need to. And there usually isn't anything that can't be done from a country estate. Ask any lord or gentleman in London.\"\n\nJames stood up, \"I should be going then. You have a guest coming.\"\n\n\"Yes! Go! Be happy, damn you,\" she said, putting on a set of diamond chandelier earrings, \"Oh and James...\"\n\n\"Yes, Julia?\"\n\n\"Confession isn't free.\"\n\nHe smiled and dropped two guineas on the table, \"Thank you, Julia.\"\n\nJames walked out of the Rose Tavern, a broad smile on his face. He hailed a coach and rode home, ready to spend his last night without Sophia, preparing for his journey to Ashford and back to her.\n\nSophia woke up late and started walking toward the chamber pot, expecting to throw up as she had every morning. It was becoming routine. Today was no exception, and it seemed to be getting worse every passing day. She cursed herself for writing the note for James to come back. She doubted that he would. He had most likely gone back to his former life and, except for a gift-giving twinge of guilt and a weekly allowance to pay her and Katje for the upkeep on the farm, would never think about Sophia again.\n\nShe wiped the corners of her mouth and looked down, holding her womb once more. Now there was now something that mattered far more. Even if she never saw him again, James had given her a greater purpose: being the best mother she could possibly be for their child. Every decision she had to make from here on out was for both of them.\n\nSmoothing her hand over her tender breasts and down to the skin below her navel, she smiled down at the infinitesimal outward curve of her usually flat stomach. Sophia started slowly humming the songs his father would play, hoping the baby could hear her. She wondered what she would look like this coming spring when she was showing, her belly swollen with new life.\n\nKatje knocked on the door, \"Miss Sophia?\"\n\n\"Come in Katje.\"\n\n\"Oh, you were singing to the baby?\" she said smiling as she carried in the breakfast tray bearing a bowl full of apples, the only food that Sophia could stomach right now.\n\n\"Shh... Yes. I was. Do you think he can hear me?\"\n\n\"Of course he can! Izaak and I would always sing to the kinderen.\"\n\nSophia nodded, giving her a rueful smile, thinking of this woman's pain in losing her beloved husband and sons. Katje shook her head and muttered under her breath again. Sophia wrinkled her brow, \"Katje is there something I'm doing wrong?\"\n\n\"No, no. It's not you. I just upset. He should be here!\"\n\nSophia felt her chest close in and thought about him. Even if she were his mistress he'd grow tired of her. Then where would she and her child be? She remembered the stories of several of the orphan girls she came of age with; tales of knowing their mothers barely, when their fathers long since abandoned them to the streets. Of mothers turned to prostitution to feed their babies, and families ripped apart. Her heart said that he would never do such a thing, but then again her heart had told her that her father would never abandon her and she was nameless before she turned ten.\n\nSophia ate a single bite of apple and picked out the gold gown to wear today, without the stays. She was worried about them hurting the baby. Sophia tried to remember back to what David would tell her sometimes when he got really drunk, that he had the perfect husband for her in mind. She wondered if the man David had told her about would still accept her if she already had a child by a man who had left her. The thought of being with anyone beside James made her ill, and she didn't want to lose her food again today so Sophia put that idea out of her mind. She made her way into the study, planning out the weekly menu with Katje before picking up one of David's old poetry books and nestling into a chair.\n\n...Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee, As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be To taste whole joys.\n\nShe blushed and felt warmth flush her from breast to thigh at the words and couldn't help but imagine James, the wall of his chest pressed against her bosom, the twitch and dance of turgid flesh where they were meant to join, the love and passion for her in his steel gray eyes as they bored through her very soul. She tried to shake the images from her head. When the baby arrived at least she would have something to do. Katje had forbade her from working the farm now that she was the lady of the house and with child, and it left Sophia with little to do in the course of a day but think about James.\n\nShe shut her book and looked out the window. It was a sunny cool day, the beginning of September. There was no reason why she shouldn't enjoy the beautiful afternoon outdoors. Sophia watched as Katje and Aletta set off in the cart toward Ashford to gather supplies. She stared at them as the old mare slowly clopped down the road.\n\nShe had taken James's advice. Her customers begrudgingly started paying her five more shillings a canister. Even without James sending five pounds a week she was making a modest sum off of it, enough to buy a couple new yearling heifers this spring. She stood under the oak tree, feeling the cool breeze move through the leaves as he looked out across the meadows and the turns of the road.\n\nJames had loaded a week's worth of clothes into his carriage. He would send movers up to gather the rest of his belongings once he was certain he could win back Sophia, and that she would forgive him for his foolishness. He stopped at the crossroads, dressed in a gray frock and breeches now that the mourning period for his uncle was over. James climbed out and led his stallion into the shade to take a drink from the brook and set down a few carrots for him to eat. He heard another cart ambling down the road, horse hooves pounding lightly against the rain-softened earth.\n\n\"Master James! Master James! Mama, hij is teruggekeerd! He's come back!\"\n\nJames looked up to see Aletta standing and waving at him in the cart as her mother tried to pull her down to sit so she wouldn't accidentally fall out the side. He flagged them down, their cart grinding to a stop at the crossroads. Katje nodded, greeting him with solemn disdain.\n\n\"It's good to see both of you. Katje, how is she? How is Sophia?\" he asked in Dutch.\n\n\"Niet meer! I no talking to you about her. You ask her yourself!\" Katje returned brusquely in English.\n\nJames was surprised at her tone and grew anxious. Had Sophia changed her mind about him coming back? Had he waited too long? His worry over Sophia washed out any imperious return of words he would have otherwise had for Katje, his servant, speaking to him in that tone, \"All right, Katje. I'll ask her myself.\"\n\nHe backed away from the cart and let them continue on toward Ashford before climbing back in his chaise and turning it west toward the farm. He needed to see her immediately and would give anything to send the carriage into a full gallop, but the road was wet and treacherous now, with deep muddy ruts and sun-baked ridges everywhere. He sat patiently in the driver's seat pushing back thoughts that he may have already lost her forever.\n\nSophia sat down beside the oak tree, scanning the land around her. While this tree would remain green, fall would come soon and turn the ash trees brilliant gold. She looked outward to the edge of the wooded road in the distance and saw a single dark speck come around the bend. Had Katje forgotten something? She squinted her eyes to see if they were all right.\n\nAs the shape came closer, a lump formed in her throat. It wasn't a cart. It was a chaise; James's carriage. She debated whether or not to flee inside, but it would be useless to hide from him. She felt her heart pounding and worked to quiet her stomach as he drew closer.\n\nJames looked up from the road at the oak tree in front of the house looming larger on the horizon. A golden figure rose up from the ground like a specter and he watched as curly blonde hair about in the wind above an angelic golden dress. His breath caught in his chest. It was Sophia.\n\nShe stood still, paralyzed as he made his way into plain view, an unmoving expression on his face. He was dressed in silvery gray and Sophia realized that this was the first time she had seen him in anything but jet-black mourning dress. She worked to push thoughts out of her head about how handsome he was, how the edges of his frock had flared up as he leapt down from the chaise, revealing the outline of his strongly muscled thighs. James latched open the gate and grabbed the reins, leading his stallion into the yard before walking back without a word to close the gate behind him.\n\nJames felt his heart continue to beat louder as he went through the motions of arriving, the awkward silence becoming overbearing. He wanted to run to Sophia, grab her about the waist and pull her close, taste her lips and rake his fingers through her hair; to carry her up the stairs and caress her naked skin once more.\n\nSophia fidgeted, unsure of what to say. It was all she could do to keep the wave of excited nausea from spilling out. Her eyes welled up with tears as he slowly advanced toward her. James stood in front of her for what seemed like an eternity, not saying a word, just looking into her eyes. He reached out and brushed away a lock of hair that the wind had carried over her face. She crumpled and leaned toward him, feeling his arms close around her as she cried.\n\n\"I was a fool to leave. Please Sophia,\" he started, feeling her shudder against him, \"there are things I need to tell you.\"\n\n\"James...\"\n\nHe led her into the house, sitting at the very dining room table where he had first ravished her. She backed away from him and stood near the hearth as he opened his satchel and pulled out a worn parchment and held it up for her. She scanned the words, making out through her bleary eyes the title Parish Apprentice Terms of Indenture. His eyes met hers again, \"You said you could never love me as long as I owned you.\"\n\nSophia's heart caught in her throat and she startled back a half step, hearing a resounding rip and then another as he tore the paper into pieces in his hands. James stood and walked toward a stunned Sophia and stooped to throw the papers into the hearth before standing in front of her again. She mouthed dry words before something finally came out, \"So you are throwing me off the land because I said\u2014\"\n\n\"How can I throw you off of land you own?\"\n\nShe looked up at him blankly, \"I don't understand.\"\n\nHe led her by the wrist back to the table, pulling out a chair for her and sat down across from her. James reached into his leather satchel again and brought out another paper rolled and bound with ribbon, \"Read this.\"\n\nSophia took the parchment from him and pulled the ribbon off with shaking hands, carefully unrolling the paper. Her face went white, \"This is the deed to the farm...\"\n\n\"Actually it's a trust. Unfortunately, the laws of the land can't give the property to you directly. This was the best I could do. I may merely protect the land for you until your... heirs inherit it,\" he said choking on the words or the thought of another man having his Sophia. He came out of his chair and dropping to his knees at her side.\n\n\"This... this is all I thought I ever wanted...\" Sophia said, setting the paper on the table as it unrolled itself. She briefly glanced at her own name, Sophia Latwicke, on the trust before turning back to James. He was kneeling before her, anxiety written across his face.\n\n\"Sophia, I release you. You have everything you wanted from me now. The farm is yours, but I can only hope, perhaps pray, that you can forgive me enough to let me stay here with you for as long as you see fit,\" he said, shaking before leaning his forehead onto her thigh, \"I love you and I don't want to live without you. But I will understand if you need me to leave. I was a fool and what I did to you was unforgiveable. I can only hope that this small act will help prove myself to\u2014\"\n\nShe brought her hand to his cheek and raised his face up to hers, tears running down, \"James... James, when you left I only had one thing I wanted to say to you that morning...\"\n\nHe froze and prepared himself for the inevitable, calculating whether he could journey back to London before nightfall or if he should stay at the inn. It was less painful than thinking about the idea of losing her, \"What had you wanted to say?\"\n\n\"...That I had fallen in love with you,\" she said, wiping her cheek with the back of her hand, \"That I didn't want you to leave. That I needed you, James, as I need you now.\"\n\nHe looked up at her and stood, \"Sophia...\"\n\nShe rose out of the chair to face him and felt her lips tilt up to kiss him. He was warm and she sighed, the nausea and dizziness leaving her as she relaxed against him, feeling him capture her mouth with his. He brought his hands up to her face as she held the collar of his frock, smoothing her hands over his chest as he drew back from her to look into his eyes, \"I know why you left. I read the letter you found. I was certain you thought I was going to use you to regain my place in society after you learned about my origins.\"\n\n\"No, that's not why. I asked the barrister about your origins when I saw that Uncle David had used your birth name, de Grey. Sophia, you were cruelly abandoned, and if the world had worked for you as I've seen it work for scores of others then your position in society wouldn't even have given mine so much as a glance. And I didn't leave because I thought you would try to regain your rightful place. I left because I was a coward.\"",
        "\"You told me that night that you loved me...\"\n\n\"...And I meant every word of it. But I learned that we were both unwitting pawns in my uncle's quest to keep me here.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, \"My uncle told you that he was deeding the land to you as a trust provided that you pass your term of indenture, marry and produce heirs. Did he ever say anything beyond that?\"\n\nShe thought for a moment, watching as the pieces of the puzzle started to fit together before her very eyes, \"He said a few times that he had a husband in mind for me. That I would meet him one day, but he said once that he hoped it wasn't soon...\"   James broke away from her for a moment and came back with a folded note from his pocket, handing it to Sophia as her lips mouthed the name on the front. James Gardiner. He spoke as she read it, wide-eyed, \"The man whom he spoke of was me. He knew that I would want you. Powerfully.\"\n\nShe placed the letter on the table, folded over her trust to the farm and looked up at him as he moved in closer to her, bringing his arm tightly closed around her waist. She could feel his desire for her pressed against her abdomen, the heat from his body matching the warmth radiating from her core. His mouth returned to hers and a small moan escaped her lips.\n\nIt had been too long since he had held her like this and images in her head of James moving powerfully inside of her and holding her body against his skin warred with the images she had of children and young mistresses cast out once their men tired of them. She wasn't a fool. James was a wealthy landowner and tradesman and she was the bastard daughter of a dead laundress. No matter how much he professed to love her he would have to marry for heirs, eventually.\n\n\"But the great David Farthing couldn't foresee my falling in love with you, Sophia. I vowed I would never marry by his bidding. And so in my cowardice I ran.\"\n\nHer fears had been confirmed. She knew he couldn't marry her, and she didn't want to hear from him right now that she would be his mistress. She silenced him with a kiss. Just for tonight. She loved him and needed him beyond reason right now. Tomorrow morning, Sophia would break both of their hearts and tell him that she couldn't be his mistress and that she needed to be alone on the farm. It was what was best for their child. Unbeknownst to him, she would always have a piece of him to treasure. But in this moment she ached with her desire for him, \"Please... can we just let that go, then? James, it's been too long... I need you...\"\n\nHe responded by picking her up around the waist and bringing her lips to his as she swayed on the tips of her toes. He was pleased that she wasn't wearing that binding stay and her curves were unbound below the dress, \"As you wish, my lady.\"\n\nJames picked her up and carried her in his arms toward the staircase, delighted to be back at the farm where he belonged. He ascended each step carefully, pausing once they were at the landing to let her down and kiss her again, moving his mouth to her jaw line and kissing toward her ear before whispering to her, \"I love you, Sophia.\"\n\n\"I love you, too,\" she said, her heart breaking with what she would have to do tomorrow. She knew that it was best for all three of them if she let him move on with his life and let her child grow up without the specter of abandonment hanging over its head. She had promised her child that she would never put him through the hell in which she had lived. But for now, she would share one last night with James.\n\nHe kissed down Sophia's breasts, the orbs cast golden like her dress and hair as the sun poked in under the awning. He picked her up again and carried her into the bedroom, laying her across the sheets as he ran his hand up one smooth leg. This had almost been too easy. The fight in her that he loved so much was subdued and muted.\n\n\"Sophia,\" he said pausing to look up into her eyes again, \"are you sure you're all right? Is anything wrong?\"\n\n\"No,\" she lied, \"Nothing's wrong. I missed you. Just... let's just enjoy each other tonight,\" she said as James smiled and kissed her. She felt her heart crumple in guilt, but told herself that this was for the best. James moved his hand up to grip her thigh, pulling her upward and taking her dress up above her waist until he could lift it off of her, chemise and all.\n\nHe looked down at her, pleased. She'd been eating more; her curves rounded out and supple before him. He stripped off his cravat and waistcoat, unbuttoned his breeches and threw them and his shirt to the floor, joining her naked flesh on the bed. He would enjoy her tonight, and every night after that, he thought to himself. He lay alongside her and held her to him, feeling her breasts crush up against his chest, her legs parting as one of his moved between them. James sighed as his cock nestled in, pressed against the hot silky skin of her thigh. His thoughts drifted to the letter as he kissed her and a light filled his heart.\n\nJames was the master of his own destiny; and he chose her. Sophia was his mate, perfect for him in every way from how she challenged him when they argued to how she danced for him when he played. He wanted to marry her. He broke off their kiss and rose above her, looking down into her eyes. His hands caressed her skin as the warmth of the idea filled him. His uncle had carefully planned enticing James back to the farm with this woman, but his love for Sophia was his own choice. He wasn't about to lessen her part in his life just to spite David. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.\n\n\"James?\" she said, breaking him out of his revelation, \"what are you thinking about?\"\n\nHe smiled down at her, \"It can wait until morning.\"\n\nHe renewed his kiss and rolled with them, lifting her above them. She looked down at him and consciously wiggled her thigh against his hard cock, watching as he closed his eyes and sucked air in through his teeth. Sophia wanted all of him tonight. She knew that this was her last night to be with this man, or any man truthfully, and Sophia decided to make every moment count; she needed to give him as much pleasure as she could before she had to say goodbye to him forever.\n\nShe moved down between his thighs and gathered his pulsing flesh into her hand. James tilted his head up to watch her take this initiative on her own, eager to taste him. She knelt down and brought her open lips around the head, eliciting a sharp moan from James. He brought his hands to her head to run his fingers through the strands of her hair, straining to keep himself from forcing her down onto his cock. He watched the curve of her ass rose high in the air behind her as she crouched over him and felt the exquisite pull on his flesh once again as she enveloped him within her hot mouth, rising up before licking the head with her tongue.\n\nShe relished in the taste of him, a mix of pepper, sage and nutmeg that blended into a scent that was distinctly him, and distinctly arousing. She moaned against his cock, the hum of her voice vibrating the sensitive tip against the back of her throat. James hissed and pulled away from her as she looked into his eyes with uncertainty.\n\nHe paused a moment, then pulled her up to him again, rolling her under his body with a kiss before breaking away to look into her eyes, \"Trust me, my love. As much as I enjoy releasing in your mouth, that's not what I need from you tonight.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" she rasped, her voice low with desire.\n\n\"All of you,\" he said, his eyes darkening. Sophia felt her breathing hitch and the vulnerability of her body pinned underneath his to the mattress as he spoke, \"I can't take anything less than all of you.\"\n\nHe bit down lightly on where her neck joined her shoulder before trailing his tongue down to her puckered nipple, swirling the tip around the crinkles of pink flesh and suckling it deep into his mouth. His fingers danced across the skin of the other, pinching it in synchronicity to each time his teeth drew up its mate. Sophia writhed underneath him, her back arching up and lifting her breasts higher. James grasped his hands around her waist, running them down the sides, his thumbs trailing the rows of ribs as his mouth descended to her navel to swirl inside, and then kissing her womb with light pecks as he made a circle of kisses across her mound.\n\nSophia watched him kiss, unbeknownst to him, the place where their child grew and felt her eyes start to water before James thrust her back into the pleasure of the moment by darting his tongue across her swollen bud. She craned her legs apart instantly, her body rocked backward as he teased her before pulling away to blow on the soft hairs covering it. She mewled a whimper, eager to have the heat of his mouth on her again. James looked up at her and pushed two fingers slowly into her canal, feeling her nectar coat his hand as he curled them within her.\n\nWith his ring finger he delicately pushed against her anus, watching the surprised expression cross her face before her eyes went glassy once more with pleasure. He swirled it around once more, hearing her moan deeply, feeling her start to clench around the invading digit. James was swept away momentarily by the thought of slowly entering her beautiful ass, the ring of her anus clenching down around his cock, the shock and vulnerability written across her face as he carefully pushed deep inside her.\n\nThe thought almost made him lose control. He calmed himself. There would be a lifetime of opportunity to explore that. But tonight he needed to feel her under his body and touch her womb from the inside. James continued to wiggle his small finger inside her, steadying her with the palm of his hand on her stomach as he lowered his lips to her waiting sex. Nothing had tasted as good to him before and he drank in her cries of pleasure as he filled and covered her completely with his hands and mouth.\n\nSophia brought her hands up through her hair to the side of her head, thrashing and moaning, the pleasure of what he was doing to her becoming too much. She was shocked when he had touched her... down there... but like every other way he had ever touched her she felt nothing but desire for more. Her body thrashed as he thrust three fingers within her in unison, his tongue twisting around her nub and lapping up her juices. She felt the wave within her building, slowly at first before crashing down, her back arching off the bed as James withdrew his fingers from her and sucked her pearl gently into his mouth.\n\nHe steadied her hips, feeling them start to close in as her hand flew to his head, pushing him down, her neck craned back and her mouth opened in a silent cry. James cradled her lower back with his hands until she fell back to the bed. He immediately sprung up over her body, lifting her thighs with his hips. He couldn't stand it any longer. For almost a full month he had needed to be within her and had held out for as long as possible. Sophia clung to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist.\n\nJames leaned down and kissed her hard on the mouth. Sophia tasted what she imagined must be her essence on his lips. He carefully fitted his body over hers and held himself at her gate. Pulling away from her lips, he looked into her eyes, \"I love you Sophia,\" he said, thrusting forward into her, \"I'll always love you.\"\n\nSophia grasped him and wept from the pleasure of him filling and completing her for the last time, \"I love you, James. Please don't ever forget that I love you.\"\n\nShe gazed up at him as he rose over her, his body guiding them through tense minutes of pleasure as he angled downward inside her, plunging as deep as he could join their bodies together. Sophia wished this would never end; that she could lock them together in this moment for all time. She responded by lifting her legs higher along the sides of his body, drawing her back down to brush over her skin with his hard chest, his abdomen curling and arching with each new movement into her tight channel.\n\nHe pushed into her, taking her in deep strokes, his control shredded and his being surrendered to her. Sophia clenched tightly around his cock, milking it within her as he drove into her. Her keening cries mixed with his gasps and punctuated groans as James pushed into her, rhythmically. His body needed more, received more, and needed even more from her as she buckled around him, feeling the waves of her orgasm once again. He felt Sophia rise up again underneath him, her fingers clawing into his back before James was driven over the edge with her.\n\nHe lay within her, his head lying beside hers, watching a single tear roll down her calm face. He kissed it away and pushed deeper inside of her with a shudder, overwhelmed by the contentment he finally felt. For the first time in his life he was exactly where he needed to be. Sophia wasn't an escape for him or a distraction. She was his reality, and one that he would be part of for the rest of his life. He whispered to her how much this meant, how much he loved her as another tear meandered down her cheek.\n\nSophia felt him stay within her, her mind beleaguered by longing and sadness. She desperately didn't want to let him go. He felt so perfect and she knew that if life and the world were fair and just, she would get to have James forever. But experience and the coldness of existence had taught her enough. She felt him caress her skin as he softened within her, and then rolled to the side taking her with him. The sun had just disappeared over the horizon and both of them were exhausted.\n\nJames curled up with her nestled in the crook of his arm as she started to drift off. He watched her close her eyes and lean in closer to him before shutting his own, vaguely noticing a bowl full of apples sitting on the nightstand as he drifted off into restful sleep.\n\nSophia woke up to a strong streak of sunlight through the crack in the curtains piercing the room, winding across the sheets of the bed and over their intertwined bodies. She felt dizzy all ready and looked back at James, trying to carefully get out of bed so as not to wake him. She felt her stomach turn over and ran across the room, trying her best to be quiet as she spit up bile into the chamber pot. Sophia gasped and heaved once more before standing up. Her hand dropped down her belly to cradle her womb, smoothing over the skin and whispering to her baby that it would be all right.\n\n\"Sophia...\"\n\nShe spun around to face that voice, turning white as a sheet as her wide fearful eyes met James.\n\nHe sat up in bed, his world reeling. Their last night together before he left flashed through his mind. She had been dizzy while he played the violin and nauseous the following morning. He'd thought it was the stay, and she had made the excuse that it was dinner. The tailor's apprentice said that she looked ill when he had questioned him about her. Then there was the bowl full of bland apples in the room on the dresser when she had never mentioned liking them at all before. His mind connected all this information, \"Are you... are you carrying my child?\"\n\nHer knees gave way. She steadied herself on the dresser as James got out of bed and strode across the room to her, catching her in his arms. He tilted her chin up so her eyes met his. She just stared up at him paralyzed, her breathing shallow and her face pale.\n\n\"Please answer me,\" he said looking at her pleadingly, moving a loose strand of hair behind her ear.\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispered, tears filling her eyes. He knew. Sophia felt her heart beating out of her chest. She watched James slowly smile down at her and started to relax as he trailed a hand down her ribs to her womb, his fingers brushing over the skin before cupping his palm firmly around her belly.\n\n\"Since when?\" he whispered back.\n\n\"Our first night... I think.\"\n\nHe looked back up at her with a wide smile, his eyes dancing, \"Well. That simplifies things, then.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Get dressed,\" he said, playfully smacking her bottom, \"We're going into town.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she said, confused.\n\n\"We're going to see the vicar, then the town doctor,\" he said, pacing the room.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm marrying you; if you'll have me, Sophia,\" he looked at her awkwardly and dropped down to one knee before her, taking her hand, \"Will you marry me, Sophia?\"\n\nShe looked down at him in shock, \"James, you don't have to marry me just because I got with child.\"\n\n\"I would have asked you to marry me anyway, and I should have asked you as soon as I had made up my mind to do so,\" he placed his hand on her womb once more, splaying his fingers across her skin, \"This simply means that we'll have to do it sooner than I expected.\"\n\nSophia looked down into his eyes as he reverently touched her womb waiting for her answer, \"Yes,\" she said, a smile creeping over her face, \"Yes! But, is it me you really want to be your wife or are you\u2014\"\n\nJames stood up in front of her and covered her mouth with his, kissing her protests away. His lips possessed her; his arms twining around her as she leaned forward into his embrace, feeling his arms hold her to his body. A hand came up through her hair as he mated his tongue with hers before pulling back and looking at her passion drenched face.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"does that answer your question?\"\n\n* * *\n\nEpilogue\n\nSophia rocked back in the chair of the bedroom, looking down her breast at the pair of blue eyes staring wide up at her. Pink gums sucked and gnashed at her nipple before letting go, sated. She pulled little David away and lifted him onto her knee, bounced him gently and rubbing his back.\n\n\"You know, it's times like these he makes me jealous.\"\n\nSophia turned around startled to see James standing in the doorway, resting against one arm. He walked into the room and leaned over his wife to pick up his son, bringing the infant to his shoulder, bouncing and patting his back until he burped. She smiled at her husband and started closing the front of her gown.\n\n\"Do you have to put them away so quickly?\" James walked over to the crib and set little David down with a blanket as he cooed at his father.\n\n\"Oh stop it, James,\" Sophia said smiling, \"You saw plenty of them last night.\"\n\n\"Ah, and what about tonight?\"\n\nSophia raised the hem of her skirt to the top of her thighs and crossed one bare leg over the other, watching the fire in his eyes smolder at the unexpected tease of flesh, \"That my dear husband, depends entirely on how long you wish to stay up.\"   James took Sophia by the hands and stood her to face him, bringing her in for a kiss. His hands wrapped around her middle and hoisted her in the air as she shrieked in surprise, wrapping her legs around his waist and laughing, \"When I said 'up' this wasn't really what I had intended.\"\n\n\"I know exactly what you intended, wife,\" he said, knowingly grinding his hips into hers.\n\nShe wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him before pulling back to see his face, \"Well, this position is a little familiar\u2014\"\n\n\"As it should be,\" James interrupted her, \"We stood in this exact place as we are now a year ago, tomorrow.\"\n\nSophia flushed and was flooded with memories of her gripping the stalk of the candelabra and tripping backwards over the base before James had wrapped his arms around her and thrust into her depths in the full moonlight. Her mind wandered to their interlaced fingers as they lay in afterglow, the first hesitant sign of love they had shared, after he had provided her with the seed that had conceived their son.\n\nJames gave her a peck on the tip of her nose, \"Happy early anniversary.\"\n\nShe smiled wickedly at him before smashing her lips against his. Sophia ran her hands through his hair and squeezed her body tighter around James, giving him a kiss he wouldn't soon forget. "
