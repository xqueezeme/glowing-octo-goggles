        "Agatha endured the subsequent weeks with a degree of forbearance and fortitude that she had not known herself to possess. Her betrothal ceremony with Fredenand turned out to be a turbulent, tense affair, with the Prince glowering at King Olbrecht and his sister, Princess Sira for the major part of the ceremony. He refused to dance with Agatha during the evening celebrations, and though Agatha couldn't care less for losing the affections of her future husband, she was pleasantly surprised when Princess Sira accosted her and led her out into the dance floor. Princess Sira was fair haired and tall, with muscular, brown limbs that testified to long hours spent in the southern sun, and Agatha took an immediate liking to her cheerful, outgoing temperament. \n\nGeorgina informed her later that Prince Fredenand had been severely castigated by his father and sister for beating his future bride, and Agatha heaved a sigh of relief when he did not visit her chambers on the night of the betrothal ceremony.\n\nAgatha found herself in Princess Sira's company increasingly often for the next few weeks. Sira ushered her out of her wing every morning and forced her to accompany her in her horse riding lessons. Agatha was only too happy to comply with the Princess's wishes as it gave her an opportunity to resume an outdoor activity she had come to love, and also because her time with Sira provided a welcome respite from Georgina's hawk-like watchfulness. As the days wore on Agatha began to realize that Sira Olbrecht did not possess a shred of the vanity and cruelty that defined her elder brother; instead she was a composed, restrained and shrewd woman, who had inherited most of her father's pragmatism and political acuity but none of his inflated sense of self. Their hours out in the southern sun left Agatha's freckles more pronounced than ever and the pallor in her cheeks was all but gone by the end of a week. In another week, Agatha's mark was nearly half complete, and by then Prince Fredenand decided to pay his betrothed another visit.\n\nAgatha had allowed Georgina to tutor her in the meantime, and she displayed an uncharacteristic degree of equanimity when her handmaids rushed into her chamber to prepare her for her husband to be. She had already determined that she would keep her magic under restraint around Fredenand, no matter what torture he inflicted upon her, and her hours of isolation in her wing were often spent reflecting and plotting about the most prudent way to dispose off the Prince without drawing suspicion to herself. This change in her temperament, from vehemently excitable to restrained and calculative, surprised Agatha more than anything, and she begrudgingly attributed this to Orion's influence. With this change came the welcome respite of absolute control over her magic, and thus, when Agatha relaxed into her tepid bathwater that evening, she was calmly assured of enduring the subsequent hours without permanent damage to her person or reputation.\n\nWhen Prince Fredenand entered her bedchamber, Agatha offered him a tentative smile and held out a sealed crystal of a murky brew. At Prince Fredenand's inquisitive glance, she said, \"I have heard that your Highness likes to hunt. This is a potion intended to keep your kill fresh while it's transported back into the castle. All you have to do is dip your arrow into it before shooting at your prey.\"\n\nIntrigued, Fredenand dropped his whip and approached her, collecting the crystal from her hand. Agatha had prepared it the day before; Georgina had supplied her with the necessary ingredients and equipment. It was a simple potion, one that did not require magic, but extremely effective. Agatha was relieved when Fredenand decided to slip the bottle into the pocket of his trousers instead of throwing it away.\n\nHe beckoned her closer with his index fingers and unbuckled his belt, lowering them to expose his semi-erect shaft. \n\n\"Suck,\" he ordered, seizing a handful of her hair and forcing her down to her knees. Agatha obeyed dutifully, having prepared for this eventuality for the past week under her handmaid's tutelage. She took the slightly shriveled shaft in her mouth and sucked diligently, using her lips and tongue just like she had been instructed to. Prince Fredenand, however, soon decided that he wanted more control over his pleasure, and seizing the back of her head, started thrusting into her mouth until his erection hit the back of her throat. Fortunately he was neither well endowed nor lasted long, and by the time Agatha's eyes began to water he released himself, emptying his hot seed at the back of her throat. Agatha swallowed, her inscrutable face never betraying her revulsion. Fredenand pulled back his trousers and left. Agatha sank into the cold stone floor, the chill seeping deep into her bones through the shimmery chiffon robe on her person, renewing her determination to kill him slowly and painfully when opportunity presented itself.\n\nThe next day, Princess Sira asked her whether Fredenand was treating her ill. Agatha, surprised and touched by this thoughtful enquiry, shrugged noncommittally, determined never to seek Princess Sira's pity. \n\n\"My brother does not deserve you,\" Princess Sira said moodily, plucking at the grass in front of her. By an unspoken agreement, they had fallen into a habit of riding through the forest behind the Castle Keep and resting for an hour by a little known lake deep inside it. The woods smelled different here in the south in Agatha's opinion, the creepers that snaked up the tree trunks were splendidly variegated and covered in colourful inflorescence, their sweet perfume hanging heavy in the humid air. Despite the time of the year, orchids bloomed in profusion and the dense undergrowth sent off tall stalks of velvet spathes. It was a far cry from the dead ivy and the leafless, grey woods of Lohenstraad and Agatha, despite her otherwise trapped predicament, had learnt to look forward to her time in the forest.\n\nUntil Princess Sira had decided to start asking deeply personal questions, that is.\n\n\"My brother doesn't deserve you, just as he did not deserve Elia,\" she continued bitterly.\n\n\"Was Elia his last wife?\" Agatha enquired cautiously.\n\n\"Yes. She was my friend. She would have turned twenty four today, had she been alive.\"\n\n\"How was she?\" Agatha asked.\n\n\"She was beautiful. Sweet, frail. Would not hurt a fly. Took whatever he gave her without breathing a word to anyone. By the time I intervened, it was too late. She was too far gone.\" Princess Sira's face twisted in grief, and Agatha was startled to see tears in her eyes.\n\n\"You loved her,\" Agatha said softly. This conjecture lined up with Sira's strong inclination for remaining unwed despite no dearth of suitors.\n\nSira blinked furiously.\n\n\"You'll survive,\" Sira continued, her avoidance of the subject of her affections only conspiring to strengthen Agatha's presumption. \"You're not like her. I've seen the rest of the Dragon Riders in our council. They don't have a weak bone in their body. The Dragons choose the fiercest ones as their Riders.\"\n\n\"A woman's strength is not determined by her ability to endure prolonged torture,\" Agatha said softly. \"I would say that Elia was brave enough to do something I can never do.\"\n\n\"I would not call it bravery, Esmeralda. She left us without a thought for how her death would affect the ones who loved her. She should have told me what was happening instead of covering up the bruises with layers of clothing. I could have protected her.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, each immersed in their own thoughts. Then Agatha's curiosity peaked again.\n\n\"You seem very... different from your brother,\" she said cautiously.\n\nSira chuckled mirthlessly.\n\n\"If you had called us similar I would have considered it a great personal insult.\"\n\nAgatha waited silently, recognizing Sira's cathartic mood and only too happy to lend an ear to her sorrows. Sure enough, Sira continued to speak after a short pause.\n\n\"Fredenand wasn't always like this. Our father married our mother shortly after he ascended the throne of Vandan. My mother gave birth to Fredenand and me in quick succession in the following years, and after that, my father's interest in her began to dwindle. He would spend most of his nights in the Harem, seeking out women with dark hair and blue eyes, like your mother, and rumours were abound that he liked to call them Estrilda. My mother was a strong, opinionated woman, and she objected to this. Suffice to say, my father discovered a new mode of entertainment to fill his evenings. My mother's handmaids told me later that her cries would reach outside the Queen Consort's wing. Fredenand was old enough to understand what was happening, but not old enough to understand that it was wrong. I suppose Father's actions imprinted on his easily malleable, young mind, and he grew up believing that it was customary to treat one's wife like that.\"\n\n\"But ... I heard that King Andebert reprimanded him for whipping me!\"\n\nSira laughed again.\n\n\"Don't let his gentle nature fool you, Esmeralda. You remind him of the woman he loved, if a man like him can be considered capable of loving... no, let me rephrase. You remind him of the woman he fixated over for the majority of his youth, so of course he would seek to treat you well. If he were any younger, you would have been married to him, Esmeralda, and not my brother.\"\n\nAgatha stretched herself on the bed of grass and stared at the green canopy overhead, her thoughts turbulent and her outlook conflicted.\n\n\"Tell me more about your mother,\" she said.\n\nSira lay down beside her, their heads touching imperceptibly. \"She did not live long,\" Sira said mournfully. \"When I was five, she died from an undiagnosed illness. I don't have too many memories of her, just whatever the handmaids told me. They said that she loved to sew. I have this beautiful quilt in my bedchamber that was sewn by her. People say I take after her, but of course she was not as brown as I am.\"\n\n\"I think you look beautiful,\" Agatha said.\n\nSira was quiet for a while. Then she said, \"you know, I have been riding with you for two weeks now and you have hardly said anything about yourself.\"\n\nAgatha laughed, then plucked a wildflower out of the grass beside her and twisted the stalk around her index finger. \"I don't have much to say. I never knew my parents.\" To divert Sira's attention, she proceeded to a different line of questioning. \n\n\"Where did King Olbrecht secure the manacles that bind Elpis? I have been told by my handmaids that he tried to open them afterwards but could not?\"\n\nSira groaned. \"My father is a blubbering fool, Esmeralda. I don't know how he laid his hands upon that kind of magic, but he should have never confined the Thistle Dragon. Had the Azure Rider not handed you over, you would have died a natural death, and your Dragon would have died with you. And then, the Imperial Dragons' Council would have turned against us and laid waste to Regstone in their Wrath. The Azure Rider saved our lives in that way, I suppose. My father tried to unchain Elpis some years ago to escape this inevitability when our informers failed to bring news of you. Then, when he realized he wouldn't be able to open the chains, he started recruiting vampires into the Army. Now, I think my father is a proper imbecile. Vampires are a huge liability to the state owing to their feeding habits, and they cannot stand against Dragon Riders. If he wanted to prepare for an eventuality where the Dragons turn against us, he should have decriminalized possession of magic and started recruiting witches and wizards.\"\n\n\"Because the ones who can possess magic are the only beings who can kill Dragon Riders?\" Agatha asked softly, feigning ignorance.\n\n\"Precisely. It would have been like creating an Army of ... what was his name again?\"\n\n\"Malthus Vuldrethe?\"\n\n\"Yes. It would have been like creating an Army of Mathus Vuldrethes, except, that is not a stable recourse either, because humans who can possess magic often turn towards the darker side, which is why we burn so many of them every year in the first place. So all things considered, it would have been prudent to allow Elpis to fly away and find his Rider.\"\n\n\"Her Rider,\" Agatha corrected Sira.\n\n\"Yes, her Rider. So that is why we are now burdened with an ever burgeoning vampire population and no sustainable way to feed them. I tried to propose signing a Treaty with the vampires, like Lohenstraad has, in the ministerial council a few moons ago, but of course no one wants to listen to the presumably airheaded, vapid, privileged princess who knows nothing about politics and governance, thanks to an unaccountable bias against her sex in general. Now, when Fredenand suggested that we open up feeding houses, this suggestion was lapped up by those very men. It makes me so angry, Esmeralda.\"\n\nAgatha smiled a little at Princess Sira's justifiable indignance.\n\n\"For what it's worth, I believe you would be a much better ruler than Fredenand,\" she offered. \n\n\"That will never happen,\" Princess Sira snorted. \n\n\"Now that there's no imminent danger to Elpis's life, how does the Dragon Council feel about keeping her restrained?\" Agatha enquired.\n\n\"They are still not happy, especially as my father has abandoned all attempts to free Elpis now that he has secured you. He knows that keeping Elpis confined ensures your confinement, because Dragon Riders cannot bear to be separated from their Dragons once the bond is formed.\"\n\nAgatha sighed inconspicuously and followed the path of a blue and black butterfly through the undergrowth, trying to ignore the familiar sinking sensation in her chest. When Fredenand visited her that evening Agatha discovered that he had left his whip behind. He still unbuckled his belt and ordered Agatha to pleasure him with her mouth, but this time, he eased the pressure at the back of her head and allowed her a few moments' worth of respite whenever she gasped and spluttered for breath. \n\nAgatha found herself thinking about Siegel often, especially during the hour she was allowed to spend with Elpis. Elpis was curious about her past life in Lohenstraad, and since a better part of that life had been spent in Siegel's company, Agatha permitted herself to recall the memories of her old lover and her closest confidant. \n\nAgatha had met Siegel in the Academy when she was eleven years old. He had been thirteen at the time. Her magic had been blossoming at the time alongside her youth, and Siegel had walked in on her in a deserted classroom, catching her levitating a book in thin air. Agatha had been surprised by his sudden entrance and her lapse in concentration had resulted in the thick, hard bound volume crashing down upon a wooden desk. Siegel had closed the door of the classroom behind him and the two had considered each other in stunned silence for a few moments. Then Siegel had asked her if anyone else knew that she was a witch.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" Agatha had answered, confused by the consternation in his brown eyes. \"Isn't everyone here learning to be a witch?\"\n\nSiegel had explained to her, over the next few days, about the differences between mages and witches, how humans who could possess magic were far more powerful than ordinary mages, how, unlike mages, they could kill another human or even a Dragon Rider with their magic, and how they often lost control of their magic and went over to the dark side. He had followed with the example of a dark wizard called Malthus Vuldrethe, who had killed all the Azure Riders in Lohenstraad a thousand years ago, engendering a stream of natural calamities that left hundreds of thousands dead in the subsequent years. Possessing magic had been a crime punishable by death in Lohenstraad and Vandan since then. \n\n\"But it is not my fault that I can possess magic,\" Agatha had protested, \"and I have no wish to kill anyone, least of all a Dragon Rider.\"\n\n\"I don't think you will be able to convince a guard to release you using that rationale if you get caught,\" Siegel had smiled, and had proceeded to tutor her on how to control her magic, the intricacies of spells cast by mages and witches, their differences, and how to masquerade as a mage amongst others. Agatha had learnt soon that Siegel was a wizard too, albeit a more powerful one than her, and he could cast a piece of magic that he called \"the Haze\" and it shielded his magic from the eyes of non magical humans. Agatha had learnt that any human could learn to be a mage, for their activities were confined to harvesting the magic around them into inanimate objects like wards and brews, but a witch's magic was different; it was a steady surge of energy that pulsed through her in rhythm with the magic around her, threatening to break free from her every moment. Mages were made, witches were born.\n\nA year later, Siegel had walked in on Agatha in the same classroom, but this time she was sobbing silently instead of practicing magic. By then, the two had become nearly inseparable friends. He cajoled and coaxed her for an hour before she revealed to him that the Head Mage, Walter Abelardo had seen her working in the kitchen and had dragged her to his bedchamber the night before and had done unspeakable things to her. What was more, he had asked her to come back to him every night. When she had refused, he had threatened to turn her out into the streets.\n\n\"Did you use magic?\" was the first question Siegel had asked.\n\nWhen Agatha had shaken her head, Siegel had suggested that she could kill him. Ignoring her horrified reaction, he had told her about a little known, deadly herb called nightshade, which could be made into a fruity brew and disguised in the form of a drink.\n\n\"You can start drinking it in small amounts from now on to build up tolerance. Be civil to him so that he does not suspect anything, offer him the drink when you have built up a sufficient level of tolerance, and drink it with him, so that he does not suspect you of any foul play. Walter Abelardo is not very young, neither in robust health, and the effects of nightshade can be mistakenly accounted for as a seizure or a sudden heart failure.\"\n\nAnd thus, Siegel had guided her through the ordeal with an unyielding consistency that Agatha had never known. There were a few times when Agatha tried to retreat from the conspiracy, but Walter's increasingly intolerable whims and Siegel's careful persuasion had propelled her to return to the plan every time. When Agatha had stood by Walter's bed a month later, watching the light leave the man's eyes, she had felt exhilarated beyond measure, all of her misgivings dissipating into thin air. That was when she had determined never to allow anyone to violate her against her will and walk away unscathed. Siegel had convinced his father to enroll Agatha in the Academy after that, and after a few years, had asked if he could kiss her.\n\n'Did you love him?' Elpis asked after Agatha finished barrelling through twelve years worth of memories.\n\nAgatha did not have a ready answer to that. Yes, she had cared for Siegel, but after being with Orion she had grown to realize that she might have mistaken a case of sisterly affection for something else. Agatha redirected her unruly thoughts and focused on sharpening the ivory hairpin that she held in her hand, by rubbing it against the stone ground underneath them. Elpis unfurled one of her wings partway and wrapped it gently around her.\n\n'If you cut his throat with that, you will draw suspicion to yourself, little one,' her voice was gentle inside Agatha's mind.\n\n'Only if they find the pin afterwards,' Agatha thought stubbornly. \n\nGeorgina discovered the pin in her hair soon afterwards. In retrospect, Agatha blamed herself for asking too many pointed questions about heirship laws of the Vandan Kingdom and raising her suspicion. She had confronted Georgina openly about her ties to the Sacred Hand a few days ago, and to her surprise, her handmaid had acknowledged that the Sacred Hand had recruited her shortly after she had started serving as a handmaid to Queen Consort Estrilda. Agatha, emboldened by her candor, had started asking questions the next time Georgina entered her bedchamber to prepare her for breakfast with the royal family. Georgina had explained, quite willingly, that if Prince Fredenand died after producing a male heir, Princess Esmeralda would reign as the Queen Regent until her son came of age. However, if Prince Fredenand died without an heir, she would be relegated to the position of Queen Dowager while Princess Sira would ascend the throne of Vandan as Queen Regnant, assuming equal powers to a male monarch. Then, Georgina had volunteered gratuitously, that Queen Regents had been known to overrule heirship laws and rule till the end of their lives by promoting themselves to the position of Queen Regnants.",
        "\"Is that the Sacred Hand's plan, then?\" Agatha had asked faintly, trying to wrap her mind around the devious ploy that Georgina had laid out. \"Put me on the throne so I can rule for eternity?\"\n\nGeorgina, instead of answering her question, had pulled out the hairpin from the knot on top of Agatha's head and had whispered silkily, \"I should keep this in the meantime, Princess. We don't want you to... hurt anyone accidentally.\"\n\nAgatha was introduced to the members of the Dragon Council shortly afterwards. It was a tense, short, meeting, in which the Imperial Riders made it clear that they considered her as a lesser Rider because she would never ride Elpis. Petronella Batholomew, the Rider of Ligeviette, Elpis's mother, seemed to dislike her in particular. When Agatha asked Sira about it, she laughed and informed her that Imperial Dragons have an incubation period of ten years, which meant that Ice's little tryst with Ligeviette had left Petronella grounded for a decade.\n\nAgatha's relationship with Fredenand seemed to smooth out easily once Agatha realized that Fredenand's cruelty and vanity stemmed from a deep seated insecurity, an incapacitating lack of self worth and a desperate need to please his father. Agatha simpered and fawned over him with reasonable, respectful restraint in private and praised his many capabilities in front of his family, (Princess Sira frowned at her the first day she attempted this, then commended her in private. Agatha changed the subject and did not confess to ingratiation.) and within a few days, Fredenand started to spend the night in her bed. Soon, there were days when Agatha would wake up with his arms around her. Agatha was not foolish enough to lower her guards to a capricious man's affections, which were secured in the first place by stoking his ego, and she continued to play her part faithfully for the next month.\n\nHer guards stopped accompanying her to the top of the southeastern tower once they were reasonably convinced that Agatha had no intention of leaping to her death like her predecessor. Instead, they waited at the foot of the stairs, allowing Agatha a modicum of privacy with her dragon. Agatha seized this opportunity to use every Emancipation Spell in her repertoire on Elpis's chains, each attempt as futile as the one before it. When her guards retrieved her from the top of the tower an hour later, she was asleep from general fatigue and hunger. They carried her back to her bedchamber, where she woke up to find Georgina waiting expectantly by her bedside with a bowl of thick, creamy stew and a hunk of rye bread. Agatha stared at her suspiciously, a strange discomfort seeping into her ribs, but Georgina did not offer any explanation for the food and Agatha was not brave enough to ask.\n\n***\n\nIn the meantime, Sir Blaxton returned from Remadra to Rubenstraad to find an apoplectic Henry Baldric raging against Orion for his sudden desertion of his post of the General and his staunch refusal to carry out his Council responsibilities. Clearly, Sir Alexander had spread the word of Orion's personal interest with the Thistle Princess as far and wide as possible.\n\n\"Where on earth is Orion?\" Sir Blaxton asked.\n\n\"No one knows where he is. I sent men to his tower multiple times, but his retainer keeps sending them away, saying that he is not there or that he does not wish to meet anyone. His Dragon is still at the top of the tower, so at least he is still in Rubenstraad this time. But mark my words, he will disappear like the last time soon enough. I will never understand this man.\" Henry Baldric subsided into an irritable invective, grumbling words like \"lovesick\" and \"irresponsible.\" \n\n\"Let me find him,\" Sir Blaxton said.\n\nHe found Orion in a gambling house in Central Market that evening, having lured in ten unsuspecting players for a game of Thimble Rig. Blaxton needed only a moment to realize that the men were losing spectacularly and were increasing their bets in a desperate bid to recover their losses, and Orion, with the top half of his face hidden in shadows under the hood of his cloak, seemed equally determined to divest them of their savings. Blaxton intervened when he noticed the men rolling up their sleeves under the table and shooting each other calculative glances.\n\n\"Enough!\" He ground out authoritatively and approached the table, collecting the pouches of coins from Orion's side and returning them to their owners. \"Leave,\" he barked at the men, who scurried away as fast as their legs would carry them.\n\n\"I was just beginning to have fun,\" Orion said mildly, without lowering his hood. \"You're back early, Blaxton.\"\n\n\"What's going on, Orion? Why did you resign, and why did you appoint Sir Alexander as the General without consulting Sir Henry Baldric? You knew that appointing a new General is a joint decision, and not your own!\"\n\n\"Not you too,\" Orion said wearily, and Blaxton caught a whiff of mead in his breath. He waited for his erstwhile mentor to explain himself.\n\n\"Look, I am not fit to lead them anymore. I did something, rather, I did not do something quickly enough and that resulted in the deaths of thousands of our men. Sir Alexander, despite our differences, is quite capable of leading the men. He returned the day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"And he had quite a few interesting things to say about you, it seems,\" Blaxton said icily. \n\nOrion sighed and rose from his seat, leaving a few coins on the table. \"Let's talk outside,\" he said.\n\nOnce the two men were outside, Orion lowered his hood and asked, \"how are things in Remadra?\"\n\n\"It went well, the Forgers' weapons were extremely useful. We secured victory with next to no casualties. Speaking of Forgers, King Thozomir Copperbuckle has sent a missive, stating that he is grateful to the Kingdom of Lohenstraad for sending aid during a difficult time. He would like to extend his complete military support towards us in case we ever go to war again with Vandan. Given that you already secured the Treaty, it would be unnecessary, but this is still a good thing. Now, you would know that already if you had attended the Council meetings instead of slinking around here, wallowing in self pity like a green lover.\"\n\nOrion did not respond to this.\n\n\"You are not the only one who cared for Miss Hartelle, Orion,\" Sir Blaxton said. \"Lyla would not stop crying ever since she learnt about what happened. Are you going to leave us again?\"\n\n\"No,\" Orion said.\n\n\"So you will just confine yourself in your tower and be useless to us? We need to transport the surplus grains from the Disputed Corridor before the snow is upon us, and we need you to resume your post. I know you think that you let your men down by waiting for some time before handing Miss Hartelle over, but everyone understands why you did it. A man I once respected told me that political strategizing is about choosing the lesser evil and learning to live with yourself when you can't.\"\n\n\"Once respected?\" Orion asked.\n\n\"With how you are behaving right now, I am beginning to lose that for you.\"\n\nOrion stopped in the middle of the road and turned towards Blaxton, who was startled to see that his face looked pale and hollowed. \"I know what Sir Alexander is saying, and there may be a grain of truth to his words. I am becoming too old, unfit to lead the men. I will attend the Council meetings eventually, but I need some time before that. I shall stay in Rubenstraad, but I simply cannot return to the court affairs at this moment. Call me a coward if you will, Blaxton, but holding oneself accountable for the lives of so many men can get ... tiring. I never wished to be the General of the army, there was simply no one else left to assume that position when Elrond died. But that is not the case now, and one such plausible candidate stands before me. You have come a long way, Blaxton. I am proud of you.\"\n\n\"I did learn from the best,\" Sir Blaxton returned cooly. \n\nOnce Sir Blaxton had left, Orion pulled his hood back over his eyes, collected his stallion from the nearby stable and rode to the Academy of Magical Sciences. He awoke the dozing guard near the front gate of the Academy and said, \"I am looking for Siegel Lancelot. Could you please call him?\"\n\n***\n\nAgatha's mark completed itself by the end of another week, and she spent a while examining her back in the ornate oval mirror that stood in her bedchamber. Her mark was a rich purple on most days, but occasionally, it turned a pale lilac. Agatha was quick to notice that her mark turned lighter whenever Elpis was happy, which, admittedly, was not very often. Georgina walked in on her when she was examining her back and smiled deeply, commenting that it was very beautiful. Agatha was surprised at this sudden burst of warmth from her handmaid, and she regarded her with suspicion. Georgina immediately followed her approbation with a dignified reproval about the Princess's posture, and Agatha's misgivings evaporated.\n\nWhen Fredenand came to visit her that night, he seemed to be in a dark mood. He had stopped asking to be orally pleased a while ago, but this time, he mounted her from the back and finished quickly in a few sharp, brutal thrusts, then guided her lips over his cock by seizing a fistful of her hair. Agatha lapped up the remnants of his seed submissively, her disgust now checked under a blanket of self restraint, and wondered why Prince Fredenand inspired nothing but revulsion in her, even after so long.\n\n\"Your Highness seems troubled,\" Agatha said tentatively after Fredenand ejaculated for a second time in her throat and collapsed into the bed with a grunt. When he did not respond, Agatha reached out cautiously and ran her fingertips across his chest. She took it as an encouraging sign that he did not shove her hand out of the way.\n\n\"Someone insulted me greatly in court today,\" Fredenand complained petulantly. \"Sira wants to seek the help of Lohenstraad Army to dispose off the vampires. One of the members of the Royal Guard had the gaul to agree with her. What does Sira know about running a country? She is a just a spoilt pampered girl who thinks she understands politics because father patronizes her. If we ask for Lohenstraad's help now, just after we parted with the entire Disputed Corridor, we will be seen as the weaker nation. Sira does not understand that and I do not expect her to, she is after all a woman. But not only did Wilden agree with her, he asked me to reconsider my decision in front of the Ministerial Council. Imagine the impertinence! A trifle Royal Guard asking me, Prince Fredenand Olbrecht to reconsider!!\"\n\nFredenand heaved an annoyed sigh and continued, \"in any case, I have ordered him to be executed for direct defiance of my orders.\"\n\nAgatha stroked the Prince's hair with a look of vapid adoration plastered across her face, then said, \"he should suffer greatly for defying you, my prince. Death seems too easy a punishment. If he is executed, he will simply suffer a few moments of restlessness before the guillotine lands upon him, and I do not feel that is punishment enough for confronting a seasoned politician as you.\"\n\nAgatha waited cautiously to see if she had overdone the flattery. But Prince Fredenand raised himself partly on an elbow and asked, \"So what do you propose that I do?\"\n\n\"Get him whipped publicly,\" Agatha purred. \"As many lashes as it takes to get him unconscious. Make his family watch, if possible. He will spend his lifetime with the knowledge that he paid the price for crossing you. While he will be thankful that you spared his life, he will grow to respect your authority. And people will say, look, the Prince is strict, but also benevolent. They will love you as well as fear you, and ballads will be written in the years to come about your unyielding sense of justice. This is your moment to shine, my prince, brighter than King Olbrecht ever did.\"\n\nPrince Fredenand stared at her impassively for two heart stopping moments, during which Agatha was certain that she had carried the patronization too far. Then, a smile broke across his face and he said, \"you know, no one understands me like you do, Esmeralda.\"\n\n\"I aim to be of service, Your Highness,\" Agatha returned graciously.\n\nTo her surprise, Fredenand cupped her face and kissed her, almost gently. \"Call me Fredenand,\" he said. \n\nThe next day, Fredenand held her hand in public while the unfortunate Wilden Thomas was whipped in full view of the court. Fredenand had determined that thirty lashes seemed a justifiable amount for his transgressions and Agatha watched with an impassive countenance as the young knight dropped unconscious after twenty. Fredenand pulled Agatha into an embrace when he was being carried away and kissed the top of her head, drawing sighs and titters from the remaining courtesans. Agatha noticed that Sira was staring at her with a crease in between her eyebrows. The next morning, deep in the privacy of the forest, Sira said, \"you know, I underestimated you.\"\n\nThere was very little warmth in her voice this time.\n\nTo Agatha's surprise, her moonblood appeared like clockwork a few days later. She had been certain that Fredenand's visits and Georgina's refusal to send her a barren potion would leave her heavy with child before the year was past. Agatha counted her blessings and started finalizing her plans for her transition to the position of Queen Dowager. Fredenand's coronation was in two weeks and his public display of affection for her would now serve to absolve her of suspicion if he were to be found dead, and Agatha, changing her mind about not using magic to kill Fredenand, started recalling whatever she knew about the little known spell Grandmeister Eustace had used on King Norman Constantine and his courtiers.\n\n***\n\nA few days later, Orion was seen navigating his way through a crowded marketplace in the city of Regstone, close to the Sunken Reef Harbor by the South Sea. Sunken Reef Harbor was located at the southernmost tip of Vandan, and Regstone, besides being the capital of Vandan, was also the city that accommodated the sailors, traders and travellers who passed through the port. The marketplace was a kaleidoscope of colours, with snake charmers in resplendent headdresses playing quaint music on their flutes and traders from across the South Sea hawking their exotic wares beside the streets. Orion ran a hand through his brutally short hair; he had shorn it off in an attempt to blend in with the southern crowd, but with his towering height and pale eyes, he stood out in the sunlit, cobbled streets like a sore thumb, attracting inquisitive stares from the passersby.\n\nHe came across a door with an ornate flower carved across the wood and frowned. A quick glance around the neighbourhood informed him that he was entering a brothel. He raised a hand and hammered on the door, which was opened after a heartbeat by a woman in a plain dress.\n\n\"I am looking for Vera,\" he said, expecting the woman to tell him that he was at the wrong place. To his surprise, she nodded and said, \"follow me.\"\n\nOrion followed the woman through the damp, mildewed hallways of the brothel, feeling increasingly uncomfortable with every step. The woman brought him to a dark, sunless room heavy with draperies and the cloying smell of incense. She closed the door when she left and Orion glanced around, finally finding her on a stuffed, embroidered chair, wearing a luridly patterned dress so that she almost blended with her surroundings.\n\n\"Couldn't you have found a better place?\" He asked, feeling decidedly uncomfortable.\n\n\"This was the safest place I could think of,\" Georgina replied. \"Please take a seat,\" she continued graciously.\n\nOrion assumed a seat on a wooden chair, which complained loudly under his weight.\n\n\"Did she manage to open the chains?\" Orion asked.\n\nGeorgina shook her head. \"No, but not for lack of trying.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of that,\" Orion murmured, running a hand through his beard, scowling at the floor. \"Very well, in that case we shall simply have to take the more difficult route. I should be back before the Prince's coronation. Is her mark complete?\"\n\n\"Yes. It looks very beautiful.\" \n\n\"How is your position with her? Does she suspect you?\"\n\n\"No, she does think that I am still working for the Sacred Hand, as you instructed me to impress upon her, but she has no clue that I work for you. I have been mixing the barren potion in her water, and she has successfully won over the Prince.\"\n\n\"How is your position with the remaining members of the Sacred Hand in the Castle? Do they suspect you?\"\n\n\"Not to the best of my knowledge,\" Georgina shook her head. \"I have been playing my part very faithfully, Azure Rider.\"\n\n\"So I would imagine,\" Orion muttered.\n\n\"But I think you should allow me to tell her of your plan,\" Georgina continued. \"It is ... cruel to leave her under the delusion that she will be confined to the Castle for the foreseeable future. Not only that, it will inevitably spur her to take desperate actions. I believe she may be plotting to kill the Prince already. I think she hopes that Princess Sira will ascend the throne if the Prince dies.\"\n\n\"She can't do that,\" Orion said sharply. \"Tell her whatever you need to to dissuade her from that, but if the Prince is murdered now, she will be suspected, and it will make a secret extraction nearly impossible.\"\n\n\"I am trying my best,\" Georgina responded. \"I confiscated an ivory hairpin from her the other day.\"\n\n\"If you tell her what is going on, she will, probably unwillingly, end up revealing the intelligence to someone,\" Orion said carefully, raising his eyes to meet Georgina's. \"She needs to endure that life for only two weeks now, we will unchain her Dragon on the night of the Prince's coronation.\"\n\n\"It is easy for you to say. She is not doing well,\" Georgina said sadly. \"She does not eat much, she's growing thin.\"\n\nOrion rubbed his temples, fraught with indecision.\n\n***\n\nUnfortunately, Georgina was not wrong about Agatha's wretched state of mind. Elpis's deep depression in her state of confinement was beginning to affect Agatha despite her determination to stay sanguine. Added to that was her constant fear of turning dark like so many witches before her, because she was beginning to lose count of the number of men she had killed. Over the last few weeks she had grown to realize that bravery was not in sticking a blade through whoever caused her offence, it was in the silent resilience against the slow erosion of hope, it was in allowing herself to forgive a man who did not deserve it, in allowing herself to grieve for the loss of a life long past and a love never reciprocated. \n\nAnd by her definition, she did not feel very brave anymore as she sat on the ground by the pinewood dresser in her bedchamber that night, curled into a tight little ball, trying to guard against the deep chill in her bones that even the merciless southern sun could not take away anymore. Then, she heard a swishing sound in the moonless night outside her window. Agatha turned around and nearly shrieked. \n\nOrion was standing behind her."
