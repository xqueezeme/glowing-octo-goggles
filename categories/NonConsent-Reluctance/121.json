        " This is the final installment of Eirin. I would like to thank everyone for all the wonderful feedback I have received as well as your patience. I know it has taken a long time but I think you will find it worth the wait.\n\nAgain, thank you and enjoy.\n\nmeg\n\nLord Hawthorn watched Eirin as she tossed and turned in her bed. She had been having bad dreams all night. The healer had given Eirin something to help her sleep shortly after she had come out of her faint, but it hadn't helped with the nightmares. After going over the conversation he had heard in the library and having a long talk with Maria, he had put together most of the events. Now the only question that needed answering was 'Who was she?' She wasn't Phillip's daughter of that he was certain. Even before he had forced Maria to tell him of her suspicions he had come to that conclusion.\n\nHis heart clenched as he listened to Eirin once again call out for her father. She had been alternately crying out for him and weeping all night. He crawled into bed with her, fully clothed, and held her, soothing his hands up and down her hair and back. She finally wept before falling into a deeper sleep, whimpering occasionally. He held her all night, unable to fall asleep and wishing he could do more to help her.\n\n****\n\nMelissa rushed into the house intent on finding her father. He was in the study, already deep, in his cups. \"Lissy, me darlin', I do believe we are going to have to move on. Damn shame it is, sure is a damn shame.\" He finished by emptying his drink in a single swallow and stumbling over to the bar for a refill, still mumbling about how much he had enjoyed this house and was going to miss the allowance.\n\nMelissa looked at him, cursing him silently for being drunk when she needed him. She had stolen a horse from Lord Hawthorn and stopped only long enough to steal another on her ride back from his estate. She had made it in a little more than a day and a half, riding straight through; she was dirty and tired and out of patience. Somehow she still needed to warn him of her slip with Eirin and he needed to be lucid when she did. \n\nMelissa grabbed the glass from his hand, sloshing liquor all over her clothes and the floor. \"Phillip, we are in trouble, we need to leave, now!\"\n\n\"Oh, we have time; he's probably only just arriving there now. If we leave today, we should be far enough away by the time they get back.\" Phillip stumbled back over to the bar to get another drink. If he had to leave this lush life behind then he wanted to do it in style. Who knew when he would live like this again? Ah, well, that's life. He had spent time in the gutter and he had spent time in a mansion.\n\nMelissa was beyond the capacity to reason or argue with her father. She stomped over to the bar and with one swipe of her arm; she brushed the entire contents onto the floor, causing Phillip to start yelling and slurring curses at her. \"What do you mean 'he's arriving their now'? Who is arriving where? What are you talking about old man?\"\n\n\"It's that uppity solicitor. He was here a few of days ago, insisting on seeing Eirin. I had to tell him that she was with that Lord. Didn't tell him the whole story, but he'll learn it when he gets there for sure. He said he was going to fetch her back.\" Phillip looked longingly down at the shattered glass and spilled liquor scattered across the floor.\n\nMelissa slowly walked back to the sofa and slumped down on it. \"Phillip, we don't have a day. We don't have any time at all. This is much worse than I imagined. We've made a mess of it. We need to leave now, I just left Lord Hawthorn's castle, and I'm sure they have already started following me. If we do not leave now, we will both be jailed and maybe hanged.\" \n\nMelissa began to shake at the thought that she might have to go to jail. She wouldn't mind Phillip going to jail; he was cut out for it. She on the other hand was not. While she may not have been a well-bred young lady, she was none the less a good girl, and she knew she wouldn't make it in jail. She wished she could just leave without Phillip, but she really needed him.\n\nTwo months ago, she might have been able to make it on her own; now she had a child in her and before long it would start to show. No one would take on a mistress carrying someone else's bastard in their belly. Foolish her, she thought. She should have insisted he accept her as his mistress. He just felt so good; she had never had the will to deny him. If he had been her protector instead of just her bedtime partner, she wouldn't be in this situation. It was his fault. If he had been a true gentleman he would have offered her his protection from the beginning.\n\nMelissa looked up as Phillip loomed over her. His face was red and his eyes were cloudy, but his mouth was pulled tight and his hands were fisted. He was drunk and now he was angry, never a good combination. \"What do you mean you just came back from Lord Hawthorn's castle? What would you have to do there? How can you be caught there?\" Spittle flew from his lips as he tried to get the words out.\n\nMelissa cowered back on the sofa, realizing that she had no escape from him. \"I had to go, I have to have money. I can't stay here, I'm in trouble. You wouldn't get any money; the solicitor wouldn't give us any. What was I supposed to do? All you do is drink and play with women, I needed help! We wouldn't be in this situation if you had killed her like I told you to. This is all your fault!\"\n\nMelissa was still cowering on the sofa, but slowly she had begun yelling at Phillip as she remembered that it was his fault they didn't have any money.\n\n\"What did you tell them?\"\n\n\"I told them the truth, you killed her father, and she's an ungrateful bitch who couldn't look to anyone but herself. If you had thought more you would have married her. Then we could have had all the money, but no, you couldn't do that. 'I don't do virgins Lissy, they ain't no fun. Why would I marry her when I get her money for free?' That's what you said. Look at us now; we have no money and no way to escape. Kill her, marry her, anything, but no, you are a worthless failure, I don't know why I have stayed with you!\"\n\nMelissa began pushing at Phillip to move him back so she could get up. She was furious with him and his ineptitude, and she wasn't going to stay here and let him drag her down again. She shouldn't have come back here at all. She was smarter than him, and she would make it on her own. That was the last thought she had before the left side of her face exploded in a flash of light and pain and her head snapped back to bounce off the back of the sofa.\n\nPhillip did not wait for Melissa to recover as he pulled his left fist back and hit the right side of her head, directly on her ear. He continued hitting her as blood welled out of her right ear and from her split lip. He felt her lose a couple of teeth with one of his hits and split the skin above her left eye with another. Finally, Phillip stopped and looked down at his daughter. She had lost consciousness and was slumped on the sofa. Her hands were bloodied as well so that he assumed she had tried to protect herself, though he couldn't remember her doing so. \n\nHe looked around, realizing what he had done and started to panic. She had told them he had killed Lord Somers. He couldn't stay here. He rushed from the house, not even stopping to grab anything to sell for money.\n\n****\n\nEirin awoke the next morning to raised voices outside the door. She heard two male voices arguing with each other. She got up and without bothering to change into a fresh dress went out to see what was going on. Lord Hawthorn was standing outside in the hallway arguing with Mr. Prewitt, Eirin's solicitor. \n\nMr. Prewitt saw Eirin first and hurried to speak in his rather rushed and breathy voice. \"Oh, Eirin, thank God you are alright. What are you doing here? I have been looking for you for months. Go and pack now. You can not possibly stay here. What will people think if it is found out that you have been staying with a man, unchaperoned?\" With that Mr. Prewitt grasped Eirin's arm and began to move her towards the stairwell.\n\nLord Hawthorn was furious; he quickly reached out and shoved Mr. Prewitt away from Eirin, causing her to gasp. \"Do not put your hands on my fianc\u00e9, sir.\"\n\nThis caused Eirin to turn and look at Lord Hawthorn as if he had lost his mind. \"Do not lie to this man! If you were ashamed of what you were doing, then you shouldn't have been doing it. You bought me. You used me as your whore. Tell him the truth!\" Turning towards Mr. Prewitt, she continued, \"I am so sorry, Mr. Prewitt, for all your trouble and worry. However, I see no purpose in going with you. To be honest, I see no purpose in a guardianship at all, there is nothing left to guard.\"\n\nEirin had an idea and quickly became excited, \"Mr. Prewitt? Can I have any of my inheritance early? This man has paid for some things for me, dresses and such, and I need to pay him back before I can leave.\"\n\nBefore the solicitor could respond, Lord Hawthorn broke in, \"You have no inheritance Eirin; your guardian signed over complete ownership of you and all your property to me. You are also not leaving. I now have guardianship of you for the next seven years. You may go now, Mr. Prewitt. Thank you for your attention and I will be in touch.\"\n\nEirin struggled against Lord Hawthorn's grasp, but it was no use as he held her firmly while assuring Mr. Prewitt he would have his own solicitor send over the papers showing the transfer of guardianship and property over to him. He quickly called his butler and had Mr. Prewitt shown out of the castle.\n\nEirin was fuming, \"Let go of me you brute! What do you mean you have guardianship of me? And what is this about taking control of my properties? You can't do that!\"\n\nLord Hawthorn managed to get Eirin back into their bedroom before he let her go. \"What is your name?\"\n\nEirin just looked at him, her breast heaving with both anger and exertion from trying to free herself from his grasp. Finally, when he just continued to look at her she crossed her arms and glared at him, \"Eirin\".\n\nLord Hawthorn kept waiting for her to tell him the rest of her name, but she just stood and glared at him. He sighed, \"Your entire name Eirin, what is your last name?\"\n\n\"Somers, are you going to let me go now?\" Eirin spit out at him.\n\n\"You are Lord Somers daughter, the Duke of Somers' daughter. Do you know I've been looking for you? Why would I let you go?\" Lord Hawthorn managed to suppress his sigh and led Eirin over to the window seat, sitting with her.\n\n\"First and foremost. You are the Duke of Somers' daughter, are you not?\" Eirin merely nodded her head. \"Why did you not tell me this three months ago when you arrived? You knew I thought you were Phillip's daughter.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. Not until after. . .not until it was too late. By then I didn't think it mattered. Anyway, every time I tried to speak to you, you told me not to lie, so I just gave up. I told you I had accepted my position here, I do not lie. Why did you lie to Mr. Prewitt? We are not engaged and you can not possibly have all my holdings. Those are mine; Mr. Prewitt wouldn't even release them all to Phillip and Melissa.\"\n\n\"We will be married. I will apply for a special license at once and we will be married before the week is over.\" Lord Hawthorn was caught up in a storm of guilt and elation. He felt guilt from to the way he had treated her when she had been blameless in anything and actually had been a victim the entire time; he felt elation over the fact that she was a true Lady. That was perfect. He had already decided he loved her and wanted to marry her; things were even better now that he had found out that he would be marrying a Lady. \n\nHe had never believed he would find a Lady that he would be able to love. He had hated Ladies his entire life, always believing them to be shallow and fickle. Here was the love of his life, and his heart was soaring with the thought that she would be his forever. Lord Hawthorn continued mumbling about his plans and got up to start pacing the room. He wanted to marry her immediately. He wanted her to know how much he loved her and show her his life.\n\nEirin slowly stood up from the window seat. Nothing had changed. He now knew she was not the conniving woman he had always believed her to be, yet nothing had changed. She still belonged to him. He still held all her properties and was still ordering her around. Well, she wouldn't do it. He could not force her to marry him. She had been weak her entire life. She had allowed Phillip and Melissa to turn her into a slave and then sell her so that Lord Hawthorn could turn her into a whore. \n\nShe would now take back her life. She would be no man's pet, to take around London and be shown off. If he was in fact her guardian until her twenty-fifth birthday, that was fine, she would serve her time, but she would no longer lie with him, and she would never marry him. She reached this conclusion dispassionately and calmly. \n\n\"No.\" Eirin spoke the word calmly but loudly so that Lord Hawthorn turned to stare at her.\n\n\"It generally takes three weeks for the banns to be read. Do you really want to wait three weeks? I would love to have a huge wedding, but I figured we could have a party afterwards to announce ourselves. My God, Eirin, you could be pregnant!\" Lord Hawthorn's face lit up at the thought of Eirin carrying his child. Would it be a boy? A girl? Would the child have her lovely golden eyes?\n\n\"I will not marry you, Lord Hawthorn.\" Eirin's face was expressionless and her tone flat. Her composure held by a mere thread. She could indeed be pregnant, but she hoped to God that she wasn't. The fact that he was worried about sullying her reputation now, when it had in fact been him who would have put her in that position only hardened her heart more.\n\nLord Hawthorn looked closely at Eirin, narrowing his eyes at her expression. She was staring at him like he was mud on the hem of her dress. How could she not want to marry him? \"Eirin, don't you want to marry me?\"\n\n\"No, Lord Hawthorn, I have no wish to marry you.\"\n\n\"Are you in love with someone else? Were you being courted before you came here?\"\n\n\"No, I never participated in the season. I am in love with no one, and I have no intention of marrying you or anyone else.\"\n\nLord Hawthorn's expression was visibly relieved at hearing the news she was not in love with anyone else. Eirin, however, was no longer looking at him to notice. She had turned and started for the door, intent on returning to her room. Eirin had decided that she wanted to return to London so she could find Phillip and Melissa. She intended to take her house back and see that they paid for their actions. She tried not to remember the fact that Phillip had killed her father, knowing that if she did, she would collapse and not want to get back up. \n\nLord Hawthorn was still digesting her response when Eirin returned with her bag. \"I am leaving, Lord Hawthorn.\"\n\nLooking at her more closely, he could see how on edge she really was. Her eyes were bright and her knuckles white on the handles of her bag. He realized how much of a shock she had received within the last twenty-four hours, and he was just adding to it. Of course she didn't want to marry him. She couldn't even think straight much less make a decision such as to marry him.\n\nHe nodded at Eirin before asking her when she was leaving. When she announced it would be immediately, he thought quickly of how to make her wait just a bit. \"What about breakfast?\"\n\n\"I am not hungry. If you would lend me a horse, I will make sure it is returned to you.\" Her voice was still emotionless, but he could see the strain around her eyes as she held herself stiffly.\n\n\"If you would please eat something before you leave, I will have the cook prepare a basket for you to take with you and have the horse brought around and waiting. You won't be able to go very far if you are weak because you didn't eat.\" He held himself still, willing her to agree. \n\nFinally, Eirin nodded and headed to the dining room to eat. Lord Hawthorn followed her out of the door and down the hallway. He allowed her to set her bag by the door and head into the room without him. Once she had left, he picked up her bag and after going through it quickly, called a maid to come and take it back up to their room.\n\nBefore entering the dining room, Lord Hawthorn called a servant to give directions to the stable and kitchen. As he entered, he saw Eirin shoveling food into her mouth. She barely looked up as he entered, just continued to eat as if she hadn't seen him. \n\n\"Eirin, if you keep eating like that, you will be sick before you leave my property. I have already called for your horse to be brought around and Cook is preparing a midday meal so you do not have to stop.\"\n\nEirin paused in her eating and just stared at him. Finally, she set down her fork and took a drink of tea. She was suspicious of his attitude. He hadn't tried to stop her or talk her out of it. Nor had he reminded her that she had no property to return to in London. He was up to something and she wanted to be out of the house before she figured out what it was or he changed his mind.\n\nLord Hawthorn didn't speak as he sat at his place to eat his meal. He merely motioned for a servant to bring Eirin more tea and ate his meal in silence. He knew Eirin thought she was escaping him but he had no intention of letting her go. How could he win her heart if she were three days journey from him?\n\nAs the servant brought in the basket of food for Eirin to take on her trip, she jumped up so quickly she bumped the table. She hurriedly pushed in her chair and grabbed up the basket, almost running for the door on her way out. Pausing at the door to look back, she saw Lord Hawthorn still sitting at his place drinking his tea.\n\nLord Hawthorn caught up to Eirin as she was standing on the front steps glaring out at the carriage. She turned and stormed to him. \"What is that? I asked you for a horse, a carriage will take forever to arrive in London! I want to get there as quickly as possible.\"\n\nHe merely looked at her and took the basket from her hands. Placing his hand on her elbow, he led her to the carriage. \"It is not appropriate for a young lady to ride across the countryside on her own, nor would it be appropriate for you to arrive in London dirty and dusty from riding a horse the entire way.\"\n\nEirin stomped her way into the carriage and slamming down onto the seat she crossed her arms under her breasts and glared at him. \"What do you care? As long as I arrive back here ready to spread my legs? What makes you so sure that sending a carriage back with me will ensure my return?\"\n\nLord Hawthorn climbed up into the carriage as her eyes widened in shock. \"I am not sending you in a carriage; we are going to London together. I will help you look for Phillip and his daughter, speak with your solicitor about your holdings and arrange for them to be released to you.\"\n\nEirin's eyes narrowed as she watched him take the seat across from her. He was up to something but she couldn't figure out what it was. She wanted to argue with him further but first she needed to figure out the angle he was playing. She just continued to glare at him as the carriage started off down the road. \n\nLord Hawthorn and Eirin had very little conversation on their trip. They stopped at midday for a meal, eating under a tree by the side of the road quickly, before continuing on their journey. Eirin spent the majority of her time staring out the window, imagining all the things she would say to Phillip and Melissa once she found them. Lord Hawthorn spent his time watching Eirin and wondering how he was going to convince her that he loved her and wanted to marry her.\n\nThey had one argument the first night when Lord Hawthorn insisted on stopping at an inn to sleep. Eirin wanted to continue straight through, but Lord Hawthorn insisted the horses wouldn't make it. She gave up the argument in favor of ignoring him. He was confusing her too much to argue anyway, acting as if he cared whether or not the people that killed her father came to justice. He had mentioned getting her properties back to her. It had to be a trick, but what trick? She couldn't figure it out. It wasn't still his talk of marriage, as he'd never mentioned it again. Why would he, she wondered; he had gotten everything he wanted from her without it, her land, her money, and her. ",
        "Eirin was even more shocked when she and Lord Hawthorn were led to separate rooms. She looked at him curiously but all he did was bow to her and wish her a good night. Eirin entered her room in a daze, not understanding what was going on. She pulled up short when she saw that Maria was already in the room with a bath and her clothes. Not the clothes she had packed that morning, but the clothes Lord Hawthorn had given her.\n\n\"What in the world are you doing here? And why are those clothes here? I packed clothes to bring. Maria, what is going on here?\" \n\nEirin could feel herself falling apart. The events and confusion of the past couple of days had been pushed back but now they were forcing themselves forward so that she could not ignore them with planning and anger. Her life was out of her control. She had managed to deal with her arrival at Lord Hawthorn's castle with the thought that at least she was out of her house and not longer had to be a slave to Phillip and Melissa. She had at been treated kindly by most people and ignored by Lord Hawthorn until he wanted her. She had been allowed to keep busy with work and to explore the grounds.\n\nNow she had been sitting in a carriage all day long with nothing but her own thoughts and Lord Hawthorn watching her closely. He had been kind and considerate, stopping the carriage every few hours to allow her to walk around and relieve herself. He had told her they would be married! That and the discovery of her father's murderer kept running through her mind over and over. She tried again to push them out but her thoughts refused to cooperate and continued to rush forward and be heard.\n\nMaria watched Eirin as the anguish washed over her. She had seen her that morning in her anger and knew it wouldn't last. Eirin had been using her anger as a crutch to refuse to deal with the events of the night before and that morning, but Maria had known she couldn't continue like that. When Lord Hawthorn had ordered proper attire be packed for himself and Eirin and the carriage brought around, she had insisted on coming. Lord Hawthorn had tried to dissuade her, claiming her family would need her, but she wasn't to be budged. Someone needed to be there for Eirin when the events caught up to her.\n\nMaria rushed to Eirin and took her in her arms, leading her towards the bed to sit down. She rocked Eirin and listened to her babble about everything that had happened over the last three months.\n\n\"I just want to go home Maria. I want to be in my home. It's been so hard; Lori was so mean to me. I felt so uncomfortable with Lord Hawthorn and I'm not that kind of girl, I swear. I had never even been kissed. I want my daddy. Oh, Maria, I want my daddy. They killed him Maria. Why did they kill him?\"\n\nMaria continued to rock Eirin as her body lost its rigidity and became lax in her arms. Once Eirin had stopped crying, she began to undress her and get her into her bath.\n\nLord Hawthorn listened to the events in the next room through the wall. He wondered for the hundredth time that day if he was doing the right thing. Maybe he should have forced her to stay home? But she never would have agreed with that. She would have just run away after he left. He had to go to London himself; he couldn't allow Phillip and his daughter to get away with their actions. \n\nEvery time he remembered Eirin crying in her sleep his heart contracted and his throat closed up. He had to see them be punished; he had to do whatever he could in order to bring some consolation to Eirin. Why wouldn't she allow him to console her? She was angry with him all day, barely speaking to him except for their fight when he insisted on stopping for the night. \n\nLord Hawthorn spent the night sitting in a chair by the wall that divided him from Eirin. When she woke up screaming in the night, it was all he could do to stop himself from running into the hallway and breaking down her door. He sat, feeling impotent, as Maria whispered words of comfort to Eirin.\n\nThe next day went much the same, except that Lord Hawthorn gave in and allowed them to continue on into the night. They arrived at Eirin's townhouse at close to midnight. Eirin began to stomp her way into the house, but was instead ordered by Lord Hawthorn to remain in the carriage. \n\nEirin watched impatiently out the window, cursing Lord Hawthorn in her mind for his arrogant and overbearing attitude. It was her house. She had just decided to defy his orders when he called out to the driver to unhitch a horse and run for a doctor. Rushing into the house, Eirin found Melissa on the sofa in the study, her face swollen and discolored. She had dried blood on her face, clothes and hands and was mumbling incoherently. \n\nEirin looked at Melissa dispassionately. Though two days ago she had been ready to kill her, she knew she could not let her die. It just simply was not in her nature to allow another being to suffer. Eventually she would look back upon this instance and marvel at her lack of compassion for Melissa, but at that moment she was too busy ordering the rest of the servants to bring her supplies.\n\nBy the time the doctor arrived Melissa had been moved to a servant's room and changed into a nightgown. As Eirin cleaned her, she noticed that Melissa was missing several of her teeth and in all likelihood had three broken fingers. She had cried the entire time and babbled off names that Eirin did not recognize.\n\nThe doctor had informed them that it was too late to stitch her up as she had already begun to heal and it would be impossible to prevent any scarring at that point. Eirin secretly thought that Melissa deserved to be scarred; she had used her beauty to manipulate people her whole life, now she was going to find out what it was like to truly work for a living. \n\nEirin stretched her back as she stood to pace the room. She knew she should leave a servant in there to watch Melissa, as she owed her nothing more. However, she couldn't just leave Melissa in the hands of someone who might not know what to do if she became even sicker. Thus Eirin found herself watching over Melissa trying not to let her own problems invade her thoughts.\n\nShe was just making her third circle of the room when she was startled by Lord Hawthorn standing in the doorway, holding a cup of tea and looking at her expectantly. \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you; what did you say?\"\n\n\"I asked if you would like a cup of tea? Or, if you would prefer I can take over for you and sit in here for a while. That way you can take a bath and get some rest. You haven't even changed out of your traveling clothes; surely you would prefer to freshen up?\"\n\nEirin turned back towards the bed before looking at Lord Hawthorn again and shaking her head, \"Thank you for the offer, Lord Hawthorn, but I really am fine here. The doctor didn't know how long she had been in this house alone after being beaten; she could still take a turn for the worse.\" Her voice was friendly enough but he could not help but notice that she didn't really look at him, just in his direction.\n\nLord Hawthorn continued standing in the doorway just looking at her, until finally, he said in a low voice, \"Christopher.\"\n\nEirin turned towards him, her brows furrowed in confusion, \"I'm sorry?\"\n\n\"Christopher, it is my name.\" \n\n\"Oh, yes, well thank you, but I really am fine. I will stay with her through the night and see you tomorrow.\"\n\nLord Hawthorn closed his eyes before stepping into the room and setting the cup on a table by the door. He then turned and left without another word.\n\nEirin watched Lord Hawthorn leave, wondering at his motivation for visiting her in here as well as bringing her a cup of tea. He had been uncommonly patient during their entire trip and it made her uncomfortable wondering when he would make whatever demand he was working up to.\n\nThe next morning Eirin did not show up at breakfast. When she was missing at the midday meal as well, Lord Hawthorn went in search of her. He found her sitting in a chair in a corner of the room Melissa was recovering in. She had her feet curled up under her and head was resting on her hands against the back of the chair. \n\nHe watched her for a while, listening to her soft breathing, before he went over and lifted her up. She didn't move at all as he carried her up the stairs and stripped off the dress she had worn the previous day in the carriage, telling him just how tired she was. He could see the dark circles under her eyes and couldn't figure out what compelled her to stay with Melissa, a woman she proclaimed to hate, even after she was dropping with fatigue.\n\n****\n\nA full week had passed since Eirin and Lord Hawthorn had arrived at her house to find Melissa unconscious in the study. Melissa was still ensconced in the servant's room where she had been deposited, but she was no longer crying and mumbling incoherently. \n\nInstead she was screaming at the top of her lungs. \n\nEirin had been forced to have someone tie her wrists to the bed and Melissa was obviously unhappy with this new turn of events. There was nothing for it, though. Each time someone tried to look at her wounds she would reach out and scratch them. She was also hitting herself and Eirin feared she would cause herself further injury.\n\nEirin stood beside the bed but in reality she wasn't listening to Melissa. If anyone had seen her, they would have noticed that her eyes were unfocused and staring off into space. In fact, Eirin wasn't even aware of where she was. She was thinking about the last week in the townhouse. \n\nEach night, after he thought she had fallen asleep, Lord Hawthorn slipped into bed with her and each morning, before she should have awoken, he left. He held her tightly during the night, sometimes running his hands up and down her arms; however, he had never even tried to kiss her. Sometimes she could hear him whispering, as if speaking to her, but his words were to low for her to hear. \n\nShe had tried to avoid him when they first arrived by staying with Melissa during all her waking hours, refusing even to take meals. Everyone looked at her oddly, wondering why she would be so concerned about a person that hated and yelled at her. She didn't care about Melissa. She just wanted a room to go to, where she could think without having people crowd around her and look at her with a combination of curiosity and compassion. She just ignored Melissa's screaming and stayed within her own head. She had her own problems to think about, like why Lord Hawthorn was still there and what he wanted.\n\nEirin was still deep in thought when she realized that the room had grown quiet. She looked around and gasped when she saw the man of her considerations. He was standing over Melissa's bed with his hands on his hips while she stared up at him but he was looking at Eirin. Somehow he had managed to enter the room and walk by her without her even noticing. Now he was gazing at her, his look a combination of lust and tenderness. He began to reach out to Eirin but she jumped back, broken from her reverie. \"I should check on...\" her voice faded off as she hurried from the room.\n\nLord Hawthorn watched as Eirin ran from the room. Ran from him. His heart constricted at the thought that she was afraid of him. His sole solace each day was being able to go to her at night after she went to sleep. Knowing he could hold her without her flinching and speak tenderly to her without her turning away. \n\nHe had already set the balls in motion. There was no going back now. He would leave the decision up to Eirin and he prayed that she would choose him. \n\n****\n\nEirin was in the library when Maria came to get her. She turned with a smile, expecting to be able to sit with her friend and have pleasant conversation. However, the look on Maria's face was anything but pleasant. \"Maria, good lord, what is wrong? Has something happened? Did they find Phillip? Did Melissa get free?\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed of you!\"\n\nEirin stepped back, her eyes widening in hurt and confusion. She felt her mind race to figure out what she could have possibly done to upset Maria, but as far as she knew she hadn't done anything. Since she had arrived in London, she hadn't even been out of the house, sticking to Melissa's room or her own most of the time.\n\n\"Don't look so shocked at me, young lady. You know what I'm talking about. Look at yourself; look at what you are wearing. Lord Hawthorn bought you wardrobes full of beautiful new clothes. Each night he waits and waits at that dinner table alone, hoping you will show up. Most nights he leaves without even eating. You spend more time with a woman who curses at you than you do with the man who loves you.\"\n\nEirin's back went up at Maria's tirade as she tried to hide the hurt it had caused her. She had thought that of everyone, Maria would understand her feelings. Afterall, it was Maria who had taken care of her during her stay at Lord Hawthorn's estate. In addition, of everyone, Maria knew the most about their situation.\n\nEirin's voice was flat as she answered Maria. She knew now where her loyalties lay. Of course, she had worked for Lord Hawthorn for years, why would she believe that Maria would be on her side? \"Maria, I am sorry that I have disappointed you. Perhaps you would prefer to eat with your Lord yourself? I have made arrangements for Melissa to be moved to Belle View so no doubt you will be able to return home soon. I want to thank you in advance for your help during my stay with your employer.\"\n\nMaria watched as a wall fell over Eirin's eyes and her heart broke at the dead tone in her voice. She had never meant to come in here and yell at her, but Lord Hawthorn was more miserable than she had ever seen him. Even when his mother was rejecting him and his step-father was abusing him, he still had a spark of fire in his eye. Something to show that he was a fighter, something to show that in spite of them, he would win. \n\nNow that spark was gone. Lord Hawthorn was a ghost in this house. He spent every waking hour either trying to find Phillip or worrying about Eirin. He had hired servants and saw to it that Eirin's every need was fulfilled without her ever even realizing it. He was constantly sneaking down to Melissa's room to check on Eirin or calling servants to find out where she was. Maria just wanted to see him smile again. She knew Eirin and Lord Hawthorn were meant for each other and she had a suspicion that Lord Hawthorn had finally realized it too. Now how to get Eirin to realize her love for Lord Hawthorn?\n\nMaria wanted to go to Eirin, take her in her arms and hold her. Maria wanted to rock her like the child she appeared and tell her that everything would be alright. But, Eirin wasn't a child; she was a strong-willed young woman who had survived more than her fair share of hardships in her life.\n\nMaria knew that someday she would be able to comfort her, but not now, not today. Today, Eirin was caught in her own storm of emotions. Today Eirin needed a release. So, instead of holding her, like the mother in her wanted to do, Maria offered to take her shopping.\n\nEirin blinked. Just a minute ago Maria was yelling at her for being so inconsiderate. What had just happened? \"Maria? Why would I want to go shopping?\"\n\n\"Eirin, honey, new servants have been hired and I'm not really needed here. Melissa's yelling and screeching is just about to drive me insane. I don't know my way around London, so I was wondering if you would accompany me on some errands.\" \n\nEirin narrowed her eyes at Maria once more but merely nodded her head. Something was happening, but so far she couldn't figure out what it was. Maria suggested Eirin run up to her room and freshen up before they left.\n\nAfter Eirin left Maria sat in the parlor wondering what her next step would be. Eirin had too much on her thin shoulders and Maria desperately wanted to help her with her load. The question was how would she get Eirin to open up? How could she make Eirin see that Lord Hawthorn would be good for her? She sighed as she started leaving the room, worried that she wouldn't think of any answers before it was too late.\n\nMaria shrieked as she bumped into Lord Hawthorn in the doorway. Lord Hawthorn put his finger to his lips and motioned for her to be quiet as he led her back into the room and shut the door. \"I was listening from the hallway, Maria. I want to thank you for taking Eirin out today. I was beginning to worry that she would make herself sick with the way she's been going.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord Hawthorn, I don't know what I'm doing! I yelled at her and I didn't mean to. I'm so frustrated watching the two of you be so miserable. Now Eirin says that she's arranged for Melissa to be moved to Belle View, so we are going to be leaving. Are we leaving? Will you just leave that poor girl here all alone?\" cried Maria.\n\nLord Hawthorn broke into her ramble, \"Maria, calm down. We aren't going anywhere. I want you to do me a favor, please. No, hold on, don't interrupt me,\" Lord Hawthorn held up his hand to keep her from interjecting since he knew that once she started talking she wouldn't stop again. \"I want you to get her to order herself some more dresses. She won't wear the ones I ordered for her, try to keep her out as long as you can today. I have a plan, but I need her to out of the house, can you do that?\"\n\n\"Lord Hawthorn, you know I would do anything for you, but she doesn't trust you. She doesn't trust me either. I saw the look in her eyes as I asked her to run errands with me; I know she thinks I'm up to something. I swear my only thought was that I wanted her out of this house where she is so tense sometimes I'm afraid she'll break.\"\n\nLord Hawthorn reached out and hugged Maria. It was the first time he had ever shown her affection in such a way, but he couldn't help himself. She was the absolute dearest woman he had ever known and if it weren't for her, he would never have been able to trust Eirin. It was Maria who had opened his eyes to how innocent Eirin really was and how horrible he had been. He owed Maria so much, and if his plan worked and he was able to win Eirin's heart for keeps he would owe her even more.\n\nMaria squeaked. \"My Lord! Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Maria, I've never told you this, but I really do love you. You are a wonderful woman; I know that if you take Eirin out today and show her the sunshine and talk to her just like you do, you can convince her to do anything.\"\n\nMaria's eyes started tearing up as she pulled back to look at the employer she was so devoted to. She had watched him grow from a quiet, withdrawn child into a driven man. She had always been so proud of him, but at the same time she had worried that he would eventually change to a bitter old man.\n\nJust a short while ago she had been worried about him because he looked so depressed and flat. However, now his eyes were shining and his face was glowing. She knew the look on his face because she had seen it on the face of her own husband every day since they had met; the husband Lord Hawthorn himself had arranged for her. Lord Hawthorn had finally reached his decision; he loved Eirin and would fight to have her. Maria felt her entire body lighten with the joy she felt. She had never thought this day would arrive.\n\nMaria nodded her head as she reached up and took his face in her hands. Maria spoke in barely a whisper and for the first time in as long as Lord Hawthorn could remember; she didn't rush her words or ramble on. \"You love her and I know she loves you too. She is a special girl and she's good for you.\"\n\n\"I know, but I'm good for her too. She doesn't realize it yet, but she will. Now go, Eirin will be down any second now. Remember, keep her out until this evening.\" With that Lord Hawthorn gently pushed her towards the door and watched her walk out. \n\nEirin and Maria spent the day running around London. Maria's fears turned out to be for naught. Eirin was caught up in the scenery and bustle of London, giddy as a school girl in her excitement. Maria made Eirin tell her about everything they passed. ",
        "Eirin laughed as she explained about the season and all the people around them. Maria's enthusiasm was contagious and she found herself relaxing for the first time since they had arrived in London. Eirin had never really driven around or explored London very much. She and her father had spent most of their time at their country estate and had only arrived in London a couple of years ago. He had moved them there so that he could conduct some business then he had met Phillip and before they were able to move away again, he had died. \n\nPhillip and Melissa had not had any interest in leaving. She had certainly left the house more often after they had moved in; however she had been so busy running errands that she had never bothered to look around. Looking at London through Maria's eyes made her realize how beautiful it was. She had never appreciated the gardens and parks she had seen in the past.\n\nTheir mood sobered quickly as they entered the novelties shop where Maria wanted to buy some lace to take home with her. The shopkeeper, a portly woman with a pinched face and severe bun, waddled up to them and started to usher them out the front door, \"Servants in the back. Tell the girl back there who you are picking up for and she'll retrieve your order.\"\n\nEirin set her feet and looked at the woman with the haughtiest expression she had ever given another person. \"I beg your pardon madam. I am Eirin Somers, daughter of the Duke of Somers. You, madam, do not know what you are talking about.\" Her voice was clipped and her tone was harsh as she spoke. She turned on her heel and headed for the door.\n\nThe shopkeeper's voice stopped her, but she didn't turn around as she listened to the woman speak, \"My Lady, I am so sorry. Of course, I should have known, won't you come in? Can I show you some special lace that has just arrived?\" The woman was practically pleading by this time.\n\nEirin turned then, her expression just as closed and unforgiving, \"No, you have lost my business today and probably for anytime in the near future. I would think of this the next time you make a snap decision about someone who enters your establishment.\" \n\nEirin held her back straight as she left the shop but her face was a bright red and her steps quickened as they reached the street. Eirin all but ran to the carriage with Maria stumbling to keep up with her. Eirin yelled to the driver to take her home and slammed the door after them after they climbed in. She was shaking but her back was straight and her chin was up. \n\nMaria looked at Eirin with a combination of compassion and censure. She was pale and her hair was dull. She was wearing the dress she had left the estate in. She had worn the same dress every day for a week, refusing to wear the clothes Lord Hawthorn had bought her, insisting that they were not hers, and therefore, she did not want to chance ruining them. Eirin's hands, twisting in her lap, were rough from the hot water she had used to wash Melissa's bandages.\n\nMaria snapped up from her seat and yelled through the window for their driver to stop. She then jumped out of the carriage and went and held a low, rushed conversation with him. Eirin looked at her as she reentered the carriage, too tired now to even question Maria about the conversation with the driver. She rested her head on the back of the seat and closed her eyes, sorry that she had ever come out today. She had forgotten herself. She was no Lady. She had no right to tour around London like a school girl, giggling and gossiping. \n\nAs the carriage pulled to a stop, Eirin used all of her remaining strength to open her eyes and pull herself away from the seat. Halfway out the door, she pulled up short; they were not back at her townhouse. They were still in the shopping district in front of one of the premiere modistes. Eirin backed herself up into the carriage again, pulling the door closed as she went. \"Please, Maria, if you want to go shopping, let me off at home. The driver will be able to take you wherever you want to go, you don't need me.\"\n\nMaria could hear the quiver in Eirin's voice and almost changed her mind; however she remembered Lord Hawthorn's instructions and steeled her resolve. In her mind, Eirin needed this anyway. She would never want to become a wife until she once again felt like a woman. Eirin needed to realize that though her circumstances had changed, she herself had not. \n\n\"This is not for me, dearie. You need some new clothes; no young Lady should be out in those clothes. I'm ashamed of myself for not thinking of it before.\"\n\n\"No! Maria, I have no money for clothes, I'm saving my allowance to pay back Lord Hawthorn. This is fine, I swear, I just want to go home.\" Eirin's voice started breaking at the end, but Maria was already shaking her head.\n\n\"Pah, you do not need to pay him back all that money. It was his own fault. He knew money was missing from the house accounts, as well as silver from the rooms. I had told him months before. He is the one who was so caught up in his own affairs he didn't pay any attention to me. Furthermore, he is the one who abused you, if anything he should pay you!\"\n\nEirin's face paled at that. For him to pay her for what he did to her made her really and truly a whore. Then she remembered the look he had given her that morning and she could feel herself flush. Each night, when he held her while he thought she slept, it filled her entire belly with butterflies, and the tickle of his whispers through her hair and the dance of his fingers on her arm made her tingle. \n\nMaria realized what she had said and quickly reached out to take Eirin's hand in her own. \"Oh, honey, not like that. I swear, I just meant that he has a lot of making up to you to do. He was such a brute and he should have realized it long before. Oh, no, please, don't look like that, I swear, I didn't mean to say it like that...\"\n\nEirin cut her off, almost laughing at Maria's babbling, even in her own confusion and depression. \"I knew what you were saying, I really did Maria. It's just how it sounded.\" Eirin sighed and her shoulders slumped. \"Please? I really would like to go home.\"\n\n\"Honey, you need this. You need to remember what it is to be a Lady. You feel as if you can't be that anymore. But a Lady is who you are, no one can take that away from you, you can't even take it away from yourself. It's not about what you've done or what's been done to you. You were born and raised a Lady; you just need a reminder of it. Come in here with me, please?\"\n\n\"I can't, I'm so ashamed of myself; of what I've become.\"\n\n\"What you've become is a strong woman who has found her voice. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Sweetie, it's not like anyone even knows what has happened; all the shame you feel is in your own head. Lord Hawthorn will marry you and you will see yourself as everyone else does.\"\n\nAt that Eirin pulled her hands away from Maria as her face closed again. \"I am not marrying Lord Hawthorn.\" Maria had never heard that tone of voice from Eirin before.\n\n\"Well, why not? Didn't he offer? I know he wants to.\" Maria reached out to once again take Eirin's hands but Eirin pulled away from her before they could touch again, ignoring the hurt look in Maria's eyes.\n\n\"He did not offer, he ordered. I am no one's responsibility, Maria. I don't need Lord Hawthorn to take care of me for my reputation. I will never marry someone just because he feels it his duty, or because he feels guilty.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to marry you because he feels guilty or because it's his duty, he loves you Eirin; can't you see that?\"\n\n\"What I see is that he used me for months and he had no problem with it until he found out who I was. What I see is that he is still running my life and I don't want him to, I want him to leave me alone. Let me try to pick up the pieces that are left and leave. I can't stay here with him; I can't see him every day, see the heat in his eyes or feel the tenderness in his hands.\" Eirin was sobbing and Maria hurried to take her in her arms.\n\n\"Eirin, honey, you can't run from your own heart. What you are feeling is love. I know it hurts but you can't make the hurt go way just because he leaves. Listen to what your heart tells you.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make any difference if I love him; I know he only wants to marry me because it's his duty.\"\n\n\"Do me this favor; just give him a chance. Stop assuming you know how he feels or what he thinks.\" Eirin finally nodded at Maria, though she wasn't sure she would be able to follow through with her promise. \"Ok, now, I'm going into this shop and I'm going to get a beautiful new dress to surprise my husband with when I get home. I would really like it if you would come in with me; you would make me even happier if you would buy some dresses for yourself.\"\n\nEirin finally gave in and agreed, so they went into the store. Maria talked Eirin into getting several outfits that they picked out together and they each got an outfit to wear home. Maria was delighted that Eirin seemed to loosen up so much and was secretly pleased at how well she had succeeded that day. \n\nShe had not only managed to keep Eirin out of the house for the entire day but she would be bringing her back in a dress that would really impress Lord Hawthorn. She held a secret smile with her the entire way home, filled with new confidence that Eirin would let Lord Hawthorn into her heart. \n\n****\n\nLord Hawthorn spent the day frantically trying to prepare everything for when Eirin arrived home. He started by calling Mr. Prewitt to the house and preparing documents to return all of Eirin's property back to her. They had one argument because Mr. Prewitt said he couldn't return the entailed property back to her; first of all, she was a woman, and the property was entailed to the male heir, second the property was tied up in her father's will and he made arrangement for her to receive it at the age of twenty-five. They compromised by returning it to Mr. Prewitt's control with the agreement that Lord Hawthorn himself would silently oversee them.\n\nMr. Prewitt had also given him the information he had been waiting for about Phillip. In some ways he was relieved, but on the other hand, he wished he could have gotten to him first. He had wanted to punish Phillip himself. He consoled himself with the thought that at least Phillip would never be able to hurt Eirin again.\n\nAfter the solicitor left, Lord Hawthorn arranged to have Melissa removed from the house immediately, accompanying her to the hospital where it appeared she would be spending the rest of her life. \n\nOnce he had the house back to how he wanted it, he started preparations for Eirin's return. He had planned a special dinner for her and arranged for the servants to be out for the night. He couldn't put off all he wanted to discuss with Eirin any longer; he just hoped she would be willing to speak to him.\n\n****\n\nAs they pulled up to the townhouse, Eirin was feeling more like her old self. She still didn't like fittings or shopping, but she realized that she really did enjoy dressing properly. Eirin also felt stronger, and she knew she would be able to at least give Lord Hawthorn a chance. She had spent so much time avoiding him she hadn't even realized how much he had done for her. Now, looking back, she could see it. He had been extremely considerate of her since they had arrived in London, and even before if she were going to be honest with herself.\n\nThey entered the door to see that most of the lights were out and no one was around. Eirin was worried and her brows were furrowed in confusion as she looked towards Maria for an answer. Maria just shrugged and shut the door behind her before she led Eirin the rest of the way into the house.\n\nEirin jumped at the sound of footsteps on the stairs; she turned to see Lord Hawthorn coming down, holding a candelabra. He was dressed formally in a black suit with an intricately tied cravat at his neck. He also wore a huge smile, but as he came closer she could see that his eyes were guarded. \n\n\"More beautiful women I don't think I've ever seen.\" He approached them and bowed formally, taking first Maria's hand and then Eirin's to proffer a kiss. Eirin could see that Maria was blushing and couldn't stop herself from smiling.\n\nLooking back towards Lord Hawthorn, she saw him hold out his arm towards her. She was surprised when he took her hand to slip it through his arm and invited her to dine with him. Her surprise was doubled when, instead of going into the dining room, he led her back up the stairs.\n\nThe arrived in the Lord's solar and Eirin's eyes widened at what she saw. The room was lit by hundreds of candles on every surface. There was a small fire in the fireplace and set in front of it was a low table filled with food of every kind. Set around the table were at least a dozen cushions. She turned back towards Lord Hawthorn and saw the uncertainty in his eyes.\n\nLord Hawthorn watched Eirin's expression as she entered the room. He so hoped that she would be pleased and didn't realize he was holding his breath until after he saw her smile and felt all the air leave his lungs. He tried to make himself relax, knowing he wouldn't be able to do anything tonight if he didn't.\n\nPulling himself together, he led her to the table and helped her arrange herself on some of the cushions before the table. Heading back to the other side of the table, he couldn't stop himself from commenting, \"You really do look beautiful. I've always thought you were lovely but somehow, today, you seem even more beautiful. Did you and Maria have a nice day?\"\n\nEirin held out her glass for Lord Hawthorn to fill as she answered, \"Yes, thank you. It was a very nice day. Maria mentioned something about bringing her husband back next year to attend the opera.\" She giggled as she thought of it. She went on to explain all they had seen and Maria's reaction to everything.\n\nBefore long, they were well into their meal and talking as if they had never had been at odds. Lord Hawthorn could feel himself slowly relaxing as their conversation continued. He was so relieved that the evening was going well; he had been afraid she would refuse to dine with him or that if she did, she would be sullen and harsh. \n\nHe watched her eyes light up as she described some of the sites they had seen and he felt his stomach clench at how radiant she was. He once again mentally kicked himself for ever believing she could have been anything than what she was, a wonderful, beautiful young Lady. He had let his own jaded childhood color his views on everything. If he had been less jaded in the first place, he never would have believed Phillip and he would spend the rest of his life sorry for what he had put her through. He just hoped that she would give him the chance to make it up to her, forever if necessary.\n\nAs Eirin sat back, indicating she was full, Lord Hawthorn leaned forward and laid his hands on the table. Now was the time he had been most nervous about. He knew he had to tell her. Some of what he was going to tell her would please them both but the rest of the information would be very distressing; the last thing he wanted to do was distress her anymore.\n\nBefore he could start, Eirin addressed him, \"Lord Hawthorn. . .\"\n\nLord Hawthorn interrupted her, \"Please, my name is Christopher. I know you do not want to be too familiar with me but please, if you do nothing else, use my Christian name?\" \n\nEirin nodded, \"Christopher, yes, I am sorry. What I wanted to say was that I was sorry for the way I have treated you this past week. I know you have tried to help me this week you didn't deserve my behavior.\"\n\n\"No, Eirin, you have nothing to apologize for. You have never done anything wrong; it is I who should be apologizing. None of this would have ever happened if it weren't for me.\" Lord Hawthorn balled his hands on the table to prevent himself from reaching out to her. He wanted nothing more than to hold her but even if she would let him, it wasn't time yet.\n\n\"Don't take responsibility for that which was not your fault. Phillip and Melissa put me in the positions I have found myself in and I let them. I was devastated by my father's death; I couldn't find the will to fight them and it was easier to just do what they said and bury my own grief.\" Eirin looked down at her lap as she thought back upon the last year and all that she had allowed to happen.\n\nLord Hawthorn quickly scooted around the table and lifted her chin with his finger. \"Eirin, why would you blame yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't blame myself, not really. But, I do accept responsibility for not standing up to the two of them. I knew something was not right when they moved in so quickly, but I didn't care. All I cared about was the fact that my father was gone. Mr. Prewitt tried to help get me out of the house, but I just spurned him.\"\n\nCradling her head against his shoulder, Lord Hawthorn leaned close to Eirin and whispered against her hair. \"Eirin, the fact of the matter is, we can live our lives looking behind us and thinking 'what if' but that doesn't accomplish anything. There is not a single person who blames you for anything that's happened. You couldn't stop your father's death or Phillip's and Melissa's actions. Please don't punish yourself for other's actions against you.\" \n\nEirin nodded her head against his shoulder and he felt her entire body shudder with a sigh. Holding her tighter, he almost couldn't go through with his plan for the night but he knew that he couldn't do that to her. He respected her too much to hold anything back from her.\n\nTaking her shoulders in his hands he moved her back until he could see her eyes. \"Eirin, I must speak to you. I heard from Mr. Prewitt today,\" he interrupted himself at the look in her eyes, \"no hold on, I'm going to tell you everything.\"\n\nThey rearranged themselves on the cushions so that they were facing each other, sitting cross-legged within touching distance. Lord Hawthorn could see the tension in Eirin's face and knew that she was afraid of what she was about to find out, but she was strong and he knew that she still wanted the information.\n\n\"First of all, I've had Melissa moved to Belle View today. They will keep her until she is well enough to be released. However, I have to tell you, after she arrived there she passed a mirror and saw her face. She had a sort of breakdown, somewhat worse than she had been. I doubt she'll ever be able to leave. The hospital also says that she is pregnant. They had to tie her back down to her bed again because she tried to hurt the babe.\n\nThe hospital asked me if I was responsible for Melissa and if I would therefore be responsible for the child. I told them that I would discuss it with you. Everyone would understand if you wanted the child sent to an orphanage, the child isn't your responsibility.\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's not the child's fault that she was her mother. The poor child, just think what could happen if no one wanted it! All children deserve love. No, no, no, I will take the child; will they let me have her?\"\n\nLord Hawthorn felt his breath let go as he realized he was waiting for her answer. He once again remembered his own mother's actions and knew in that instance that he would have to take his words of advice he had given Eirin. He had to let go of the past and move on.\n\n\"Yes, Eirin, Mr. Prewitt can arrange for you to keep the child.\" He watched as Eirin's eyes brightened at the thought of having a child and though he hadn't thought he could be anymore in love with her, he discovered he had been wrong. Eirin was more than any man could ever hope for.\n\n\"Mr. Prewitt also brought news of Phillip.\" He hated watching her face pale at the words but she needed to know. \"The investigators do not know what happened, but they found him naked in an alley behind a pub. He had been beaten and violated.\"",
        "He watched as her eyes narrowed in confusion then widen as understanding dawned. \"He was dead Eirin. They interviewed some of the patrons of the pub but couldn't find out very much information. \n\nApparently, he had run up several tabs around London and made enemies almost everywhere. He had been in the pub yelling and ranting for most of the night. In the end the investigators decided there were too many suspects and no way to narrow it down. The investigation is still open but they don't hold out much hope of solving it.\"\n\nLord Hawthorn just sat there and allowed Eirin time to absorb all the information; her face was a storm of emotion and he could tell that she really wanted to be sorry for what happened to him. In the end, her face took on an expression of resolve as she looked him in the eyes, \"He deserved it. I never thought I would be happy someone has died, but I can not forgive them. Yes, I agreed to take Melissa's child, but I can't forgive her.\"\n\n\"Eirin, he was a horrible person. I've been investigating him since we've been here and discovered many terrible examples of his behavior. Anyone could have done it. He had apparently conned lots of people.\"\n\n\"Some day I will ask you to tell me more about that but not tonight. I don't want to know anymore about Phillip tonight. I am happy he's dead and for now, that's enough.\" Lord Hawthorn watched as Eirin's shoulders slumped, as if hearing the news had worn her out.\n\n\"That was not all Mr. Prewitt and I talked about. I know you must be tired but I really want to get all this out there.\" Lord Hawthorn could feel himself getting nervous; he was now giving Eirin her freedom and the right to choose who or what she wanted. What if she didn't choose him? No, that was unfair to her, she had the right and he wouldn't take it from her.\n\n\"I returned all of your properties to you. The property from your father is entailed, so you can't take control of that yet, but I returned it to Mr. Prewitt to handle until your twenty-fifth birthday. As it turns out, your mother also had substantial holdings and none of those were entailed. She held the title of Countess from an old Scottish estate and that title has been transferred to you. \n\nIt came with several estates and quite an inheritance. You can take control of that immediately. Mr. Prewitt has assured me that he will help you to manage them.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\" Eirin's breath was coming in faster and faster and her head felt light.\n\n\"You don't have all of your money yet, but you have plenty to live off of. You have the allowance from your father's estate and complete control of your mother's holdings. You can stay here in London or go to any of your other houses. There is nothing holding you back now.\"\n\nEirin heard his voice as if it was traveling through a tunnel. She had promised Maria just this morning to give Lord Hawthorn a chance. She had decided this afternoon that the next time he came into her room in the middle of the night she would not pretend to sleep, but wake up and turn to him. This was the man who had brought her to London, tracked down her father's killer, managed her house while she hid downstairs and arranged for her to take control of her own holdings.\n\nYet through all that he had said nothing about himself. He acted as if he was going to leave. Would he just leave her like that? Did that mean he didn't really love her? She looked back up when she felt Lord Hawthorn take her hand in his.\n\n\"I have one more thing I wanted to give you. Then I'll let you go back to your room.\" Eirin's face was pale as she looked up at him and nodded.\n\nLord Hawthorn could hear his own breathing in his ears and saw his hands shaking as he lifted her hand to his chest. \"Yes, like I said, I wish to give you one more thing. I know I have done horrible things to you. I have no excuse and would not blame you if you decided you couldn't forgive me. I thought I had everything a woman would want. I didn't understand why you would have turned down my marriage proposal; I have money and estates, a title and the power that goes with it. \n\nNow, I realize that you don't need those things. You already have them. You could have any man in all of England. I know you don't need me but I have discovered that I need you. If I gave you something that can come only from me, something I have never given another woman, ever, and will never give to another woman, would you take it? I wish to give you my heart and my soul. I love you Eirin, I think I have loved you since the first night you were here.\n\nI was not fair to you and I know you don't trust me but I promise, if you will give me a chance, I will work every day to make it up to you. I don't want to marry you to save your reputation or mine; I want to marry you because I can't spend the rest of my life without you.\" Lord Hawthorn finished the speech he had been practicing all day in a rush. \n\nThis was it, she would either accept him or she wouldn't. He was so scared that he had lost her and for once in his life, he had no back up plan.\n\nEirin listened to Lord Hawthorn speak and felt her world tilting on its side. She had never dreamed anything so sweet in her life. She didn't notice the tears running down her face or how long she had sat there just looking at him until she felt his thumb on her cheeks. \n\nShe saw Lord Hawthorn's face fall and wondered what had made him sad but then he said, \"It's alright Eirin, I understand. I already knew there was a chance that you wouldn't forgive me. Now that everything is settled, I'll leave in the morning.\"\n\nHe moved to stand and she pulled him back down to her. She pulled so hard that he fell atop her, knocking her onto her back. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him, trying to communicate all her love for him through it. He pulled back from her and looked at her, his eyes full of confusion.\n\n\"I do forgive you. I don't know when it actually happened; Maria and I talked for a long time today and I realized that I couldn't run away from my feelings for you.\"\n\nEirin watched his eyes light up again as he leaned down to kiss her. She had expected his kiss to be hard but instead it was soft and languorous. She felt him lift his weight slightly off of her as his lips moved from her lips, across her cheek and down her neck.\n\nEirin moved her head to the side to give him better access as goose bumps ran down her arms. She tried to lift her knees to wrap her legs around his waist but her skirt wouldn't let her. She finally gave up and gave in to the feelings he was evoking within her. \n\nPropped above her on his elbows, his fingers were playing with the ends of her hair as his tongue made swirls around the base of her neck, above her shoulder. She felt him bite down gently and couldn't stop the moan.\n\nShe felt him reverse his direction as he kissed his way across her throat; stopping at the dip at the base of her throat to lick and nip her soft flesh. He then kissed his way up her chin and back to her lips. As hard as she tried to take the kiss deeper, she couldn't get him to cooperate. He sucked her bottom lip into his mouth but when she lifted her head to return the gesture he pulled away.\n\nEirin groaned in complaint only to see Lord Hawthorn smile down at her. \"I want to enjoy you tonight like it is the first time ever. I will never have enough of you so tonight I will take my time.\" \n\nWith that, he once again leaned down to take her lips. He felt her arms tighten around his neck and allowed himself the luxury of kissing her deeply; entwining their tongues so that he could taste the fire she held within her.\n\nEirin felt Lord Hawthorn pull away again and no matter how hard she pulled she couldn't get his lips back to her own. She gave up, however, when she felt him kiss her nose and then her eyes. Then she heard him whisper to her between each of the kisses. \n\nHe told her how beautiful her eyes were then they were golden and bright. He hoped she would start going outside again because he loved to see the way her glowed with the color of the sun. He took the time to describe each part he lavished with kisses and licks. With each word and each kiss, Eirin felt her breath catch. \n\nShe ran her fingers through his hair wishing she could feel more of him. Suddenly she felt a draft on her chest and looked down to see that he was unbuttoning the front of her dress. He unbuttoned a button then stopped to kiss and lick making her shiver all over.\n\nBy the time Lord Hawthorn had managed to completely undress her, Eirin felt as if she was floating through the room. She felt the warmth of the fire as well as the heat of his body. He had kissed every inch of her body including her legs and feet and her skin was tingling so that could no longer tell what was his mouth and what was his hand.\n\nShe gasped as she felt his mouth on her breast and his skin on her legs. She immediately wrapped her knees around his buttocks trying to pull him closer. Her back arched and she grabbed the back of his head knowing that no matter how hard she held him, he would never be close enough.\n\nLord Hawthorn released her hands from behind his head and held them above her own head with one of his hands. He then rested on his side and ran his other hand across her belly watching her suck in her breath as he went. \n\nHe knew he couldn't last any longer; though he wished he could draw it out more, his body was telling him to hurry. He settled himself between her legs and looked into her eyes as he entered her. \n\nThey had not had sex in a week and she was tight. He could feel her heels on his buttocks trying to make him move deeply within her. However, he wanted to savor every inch as he entered her. When he finally settled fully within her, he just stayed there willing his body stay still. Looking in her eyes, he once again told her how much he loved her.\n\nHe laughed out loud when she told him that if he really and truly loved her then he would stop playing with her. He withdrew and kissed her again as he reentered her. Within another few thrusts he felt Eirin clamp around him and could no longer withhold his own response. He sped up his thrusts as he emptied himself deep within her. \n\nFalling to his side, he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close. They whispered to each other of their love and plans long into the night; making love several more times until Eirin could no longer keep her eyes open and finally fell asleep. Lord Hawthorn stood and carried Eirin to the bed holding her close and cradling her head upon his shoulder. \n\nAs he fell asleep, spooning against her back, he thought he heard her once again whisper that she loved him. He fell asleep smiling.\n\nEpilogue\u2014One year later\n\nEirin was trying to sleep. She was so tired but something was wrong. Where the room had been warm just a minute ago, now she could feel a breeze against her skin. Her brows furrowed and she groaned as she reached down to find the blanket but there was no blanket to be found. Instead, her hand landed on warm skin. She turned her head and looked up into the eyes of her husband. His hand was making its way under her nightgown and she could feel it along the outside of her thigh.\n\n\"I was sleeping,\" her voice was husky and he could see a small crease against the side of her cheek where she had been laying.\n\n\"I was lonely,\" he smiled down at her. \n\nShe was just about to answer him when a cry from the cradle on her side of the bed caught her attention. She began to pull herself out of the bed to retrieve the squalling infant but Lord Hawthorn stopped her by crawling over her to slip off her side.\n\nHe returned to her cooing to the child who had stopped crying and was currently trying to grab his nose in one of her tiny, perfect, pink hands. He sat down on the edge of the bed in front of her; giving her his back as he continued to hold a conversation with the baby that only the two of them seemed to understand.\n\nEirin sat up in the bed and propped herself up on some pillows as Lord Hawthorn set the baby on her protruding belly.\n\n\"It's a good thing you like babies so much. When this next one comes, I have a feeling we will have our hands full,\" she said good naturedly as she cradled the baby on her shoulder.\n\nHe looked at her with concern, \"Do you want to get a governess?\"\n\n\"Don't you dare! I want all these babies all to myself.\"\n\nLord Hawthorn smiled at his wife's answer as he once again laid back down on the bed and pulled his wife to him, holding his family close."
