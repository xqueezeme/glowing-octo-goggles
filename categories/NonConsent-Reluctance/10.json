        "Epilogue\n\nThe shade of the large live oak reached across the whole of the grounds on the west side of the house in the late evening. Spanish moss draped long and still in the heavy southern air. Even the slight breeze from the nearby beach failed to stir the branches as humidity clung to everything, its own heavy draping. Below three children sat on a blanket in the grass, sweat beading on their small noses as they stared enraptured by the woman in a large wicker chair weaving stories.\n\n\"The villagers hurled rocks at her as she crouched on the roof. She felt her skin change, her fingers lengthen to grip the thatch more firmly, trying to pull herself away from the barrage. Her mother's voice called out her name, her human name. But no aid came, nothing to stop the bruising rocks pelting her.\"\n\nMargaret and Hamish both stared at Kenna, wide eyed, clutching Rohna's arms as she sat between them, ostensibly comforting her siblings but taking solace from their closeness as well. The light of the evening sun made its last stand as deep golden rays peaked out from behind the large tree at their backs, halos of red hair fiery bright around their upturned faces.\n\n\"She managed to look back, long enough to see her father holding her mother, comforting and controlling. His eyes met Saskai's and she knew there would be no rescue. There was only one last recourse. She called out to the moors, screamed in her pixie voice to the powers of the Fae. The fairy queen would not help her but the wild magic that saturated the air there had loved her music and maybe it would deem her worthy of saving.\n\n\"At the last moment, when all seemed lost, her grip slipping and the angry mob waiting below to swallow her up or rip her apart, she felt the cool embrace of magic as though she'd plunged into a deep river pool. The bombardment ended and the thatched roof was gone from beneath her hands. Saskai opened her eyes and saw the moors stretched out around her, the sounds of the village far away.\"\n\nHamish relaxed slightly but Kenna could see Margaret's grip still firmly latched to her sister's arm.\n\n\"Beside her was a silver flute, shiny as though freshly made. She sat up and brought the end to her lips, playing a sweet song of gratitude as the wispy fog embraced her. She stood, dancing with the magic deeper into the moors leaving only the echoes of her song behind her.\"\n\nKenna ended the tale, taking in the eager faces of her nieces and nephew.\n\n\"That's all?\" Rohna objected loudly before guarding her expression again. It would not do to have the others know she cared for children's stories. Kenna gave her a knowing smile.\n\n\"What happened to the baby?\" Margaret asked, her red curls swaying as she bounced in her seat. \"And what about Androu and Maugis? And the village? What about the cow's babies and all the children who called her freaky-odd?\"\n\n\"That can't be the end!\" Hamish exclaimed, his small round face growing red under his frown. \"Tell us more!\"\n\n\"Oh lovelies,\" Kenna cooed. \"Don't be upset, all stories have an end. Sometimes they make us happy and sometimes sad but we must end them.\"\n\n\"But what about everyone else?\" Rohna said, shucking her apathy when she sensed the younger two would not entice her aunt to answer.\n\nKenna gave them a soft smile. \"This is Saskai's story.\"\n\n\"So what happened to her? She couldn't go back to the fairy kingdom and the villagers wanted her dead. The only one who cared was the moor magic so where does she go now? What's she supposed to do?\" Rohna pressed the point, shaking Margaret's grip from her arm as she stood.\n\n\"Those are fine questions, Rohna,\" Kenna murmured.\n\nHamish dissolved, throwing himself down and missing the blanket to land on the green lawn. His piercing scream called the nanny who was hiding indoors from the heat.\n\n\"Oh Hamish stop! You will ruin your clothes!\" The nanny gathered up the screaming child. \"That's enough of all this, indoors for bed. It's quite late enough.\" Kenna noted the woman's diligent work to avoid any eye contact with her as she ushered her protesting charges into the house.\n\nKenna sat back in the lawn chair, letting the humid air blanket her as the sounds of the protesting children were quieted by the door slamming closed behind them. The shade could block the sun but it did nothing for the moisture that permeated every breath. And still she felt that familiar chill deep in her bones, where neither the sun nor the warmth could touch it. She closed her eyes, letting her head rest against the high woven wicker back. She hummed softly to the crickets, her only companions in the Carolina evening. Above, the sky turned from blue to pink as the sun set.\n\nShe might have dozed in the lazy crawl of twilight before something cool touched her arm and she gasped, jumping in her chair from the sensation. Fiona grinned down at her, face full of sisterly mischief.\n\n\"Brought you something cool to drink, love.\"\n\n\"Thank you ever so kindly,\" Kenna replied, taking the cup from her sister and straightening in her seat to bring it to her lips.\n\nFiona took the seat next to her. Insect sounds filled the space between them while they drank.\n\n\"That's a new version of the moor child's story,\" Fiona said conversationally. \"If I remember correctly the imp wasn't meant to engender our sympathies quite so resolutely.\"\n\n\"Stories are not set in stone,\" Kenna began, reciting a lecture they had both heard many times from their mother. \"One must always take into account the audience, the environment--\"\n\n\"The teller.\"\n\nKenna knew the exact look to expect when she glanced at her sister and she was not disappointed. The darkening sky offered little illumination now but the light from the house, its candles glowing yellow in the blue evening, shone on the outline of her sister's expression. Kenna had become all too familiar with Fiona's intense scrutiny these last few months.\n\n\"Indeed.\" She turned back, settling into the chair once more and closing her eyes. With any luck Fiona would be chased indoors shortly by the heat and Kenna would be alone once more.\n\n\"One might find it strange you don't relate more to the child who had been stolen away.\" Fiona had never appreciated subtlety.\n\nKenna cracked her right eye open. Fiona's gaze held fast.\n\n\"Sympathy is a strange creature. You can manufacture it for almost anyone with the right emphasis.\" Kenna picked at the fringe of her shawl.\n\nFiona didn't blink. \"Very true. After all, stories are not only what we recount but also what we choose to leave out.\"\n\nKenna took a deep breath and looked up at her sister. Months had gone by before Fiona had started pressing her to open up. Despite being separated for most of their adult lives, Fiona had the notion that Kenna should slip back into their sisterhood as if they had never parted ways so long ago.\n\n\"Fiona...\" she began but gave up almost immediately. She had been deterring her sister for too long, secreting herself away to avoid these exact moments. The children were an easy obstacle to her sister's questioning but she'd foolishly not accompanied them to bed so as to avoid the glares of their nurse. \"I have no desire to relive the past or to burden you with it.\"\n\n\"And I have no desire to force you to suffer it again but to relieve you of the burden you have carried with you since that day you stepped ashore and could barely bring yourself to embrace me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry sister, I've apologized for my behavior that day.\" She had balked badly at the clasping hold her sister had fixed around her. Her desire not to be touched for weeks had driven a wedge between them as she continued to reject Fiona's attempts at comforting her.\n\n\"That is not the point,\" Fiona said exasperated. \"You cannot confuse me with apologies for incidents that do not matter.\" She paused and Kenna planned her next step. \"I want to help you, to see you shuck this cloud of suffering you live in. I miss my sister and would give anything in the world to have her back.\"\n\nKenna considered another diversion, playing on her vanities might work, perhaps continuing to emphasis the wrongs Kenna was committing by denying Fiona the sisterly bond they had taken for granted as children. She could bring up their mother and watch Fiona circle the well tread earth of how much damage she had done to her two daughters with her dreams of restitution. There was also nothing stopping her from simply standing and going to her room with a firm 'goodnight.'\n\nInstead she looked up at Fiona, searching her face for her sincerity, seeking the affection she so easily gave. And there it all was, the wide round eyes that recalled their mother and the stubborn set of her jaw that was all her own. She knew, deep in her gut, that Fiona loved her as only family could.\n\n\"It is difficult to know what to tell,\" Kenna whispered. \"And what to leave out.\"\n\nFiona clasped her palms around Kenna's cold hand. \"Tell me everything, sweetness.\"\n\nKenna took a breath, wondering if she was making a terrible mistake. She glanced back at the warm house, seeing its tidy, normal existence, one untouched by murder and treachery. As darkness fell across the yard where she sat she could appreciate the distance between herself and those within. Their lives were free from the savagery and violence that had informed so much of her own. She could see Fiona's loving husband keeping vigil for his wife by the window, plumes of cigar smoke curling from his fist. They knew love. And she did not. It was unfair to poison their sweetness, to ask them to accept her crimes and those committed against her as part of their lives too.\n\nShe turned back to Fiona, to that open, easy face lit by the light spilling from the windows of her happy home. She who promised her love and comfort, normalcy and a family. \"I cannot,\" Kenna said at last.\n\n\"Kenna,\" Fiona said sounding more like their father than she ever had before. \"You cannot not hide in this shell forever. You must heal. I am only trying to help you come back to me.\"\n\nShe would never come back. \"I know Fiona.\" So she did what she did best and lied. \"I will. I promise. Not tonight, and perhaps not to tomorrow, but I will.\"\n\nFiona stood up, and moved around to face Kenna. Her body blocked the light from the house and so they were two dark figures, one shading and one cast in shadow.\n\n\"Will you truly, sister?\"\n\nKenna could not bring herself to do more than nod. She reached out with the hand Fiona had just abandoned and grasped her sister's fingers. \"Thank you, Fiona.\"\n\nHer sister returned the warm hold on her fingers. \"Goodnight, Kenna. We will try again tomorrow.\" She waited a moment longer before turning back to the house and disappearing into the safe interior.\n\nKenna made no move to follow. Fiona was right of course, she had been trapped in her own tragedy.\n\nThere had been no peace waiting for her on the other side of her reckless leap from Roland's cabin. Even when the navy had pulled her from the waters, their carpenter breaking the chain from her limb, there had been no perfect moments of freedom, no relief in her escape. That shadow stowed away with her even as solid ground met her feet, followed her back to her sister's home. The darkness shifted and changed from sadness to anger and back countless time, but at its core was an unyielding ache that refused to let her rest.\n\nShe remained still in her seat as the moon rose over the tops of the trees, the sounds of the house dying down to a whisper. Lanterns went out, the night crept in around her, encasing her in a silence apart from the day.\n\nIt was here she could free that darkness, allow her thoughts to roam where they would. Her secrets joined her in her vigil, whispered their truths to her soul and she knew there would never be happiness for her here.\n\nShe rose from the chair, leaving her shawl and slippers behind, and turned towards the tree line. She picked her way slowly through the wooded area between her sister's home and the beach, cursing quietly when the soft skin of her feet came down on a sharp stone. The sea was inky dark as the moon slipped beneath the clouds at her back. Kenna didn't slow, her bare feet picking over the familiar ground through the trees towards the gentles rush of the tides.\n\nShe should turn back, as she should every night, but never did.\n\nShe shed her dress quickly, leaving it in a dark heap on the sand by the tree line. Her shift soaked in the sea water as she waded further out into the tide. The fear of being found out had faded as each night she swam in solitude, all good proper folks behind closed doors in their homes.\n\nThe water no longer sang its siren song to her; the hope that had once lain just at the other end of the sea was gone. And still she struck out across the lazy waves. The dark water glittering as the moon slipped back into view. Her breath grew ragged as she swam further, the burn in her arms telling her it was nearly time to turn back.\n\nShe came to a stop, treading the warm sea, enjoying the press of the smooth water on her hands, running through her fingers and over her legs. She gazed out towards the infinite horizon, but there was nowhere else to run, no chance for her to find peace somewhere else. She mourned for that loss of hope, and the woman who had been forever looking forward who was now trapped in her past. It was only here, safely apart from the good people sleeping securely that she could finally face the true nature of her burden.\n\nRoland.\n\nI will find you, his promise was her malevolent and ever-present shadow. The words still seared her throat with unshed tears.\n\nShe was not foolish enough to long for him, or to wish she had taken another path. The sting of his betrayal, the hurt she felt when he'd denied her every choice still rang out in the hollow of her chest. She could still hear the anger in his voice as she defied him, when she would not diminish herself to be his possession. She knew he would find her, but after these long months doubt had begun to creep in. Even so, she'd clutched that fear so tightly it no longer seemed apart from her.\n\nShe turned back, following the moonlit path to the shore. As she swam she could feel his touch on her skin, the soft sound of his voice in her ear. It inspired all the same conflicting emotions in her. It shouldn't be possible to despise the very thing she yearned for, though it changed nothing. Salty water flowed over her arms, the taste bitter and familiar on her lips. She wished him there, if only for a moment so she could let down this mask she wore and feel his hands against her scars once again.\n\nThe sea floor brushed her foot before she saw the shape of a man on the beach. She stopped, her toes dragging furrows in the soft sand hidden beneath the black waves. There was no shock, no jolt of fear or anticipation, only a melancholy ache that filled her lungs instead of the humid night air. He moved, stepping forward and she knew for certain it was him.\n\nA strange wave swept through her, heartbreaking and easing at once. Her feet found solid purchase and she made her way out of the water slowly, feeling the weight lift off her shoulders even as it hung heavy in her chest. She'd understood for so long this moment would come, that he would claim her, and yet she hadn't known until she saw him striding into the water to meet her that she had resigned herself to it. The white light of the moon cast his familiar form in silver and black though his face was lost in the dark under the brim of his hat.\n\nHe stopped a few paces from her, up to his ankles in the water. She came closer, just beyond his reach before she stood still, peering into the darkness below his hat. She was so close, a step or two into the inevitable, and yet something held her back. That old, well-worn heartbreak still ached inside her, knowing she would have to betray herself after all she'd gone through to make her own choices and yet she did not have the strength or hope left to fight him. A shudder ran through her, old wounds cracked and tore again, betrayal and the acceptance that she could expect nothing more from him then he had shown himself capable.\n\nHis arm reached out towards her, palm outstretched for her to take. She need only fall over that edge.\n\n\"Kenna.\" His voice was painfully tempting and excruciatingly familiar. Her heart sang a joyous response and she still did not move.\n\nShe stared at the offered limb, calloused palms smoothed out in the moonlight. Every fiber of her wished for nothing more than to feel him against her once more. He made no move towards her but his hand hung temptingly close.\n\nKenna closed her eyes, pushing back the turbulence of her mind, letting the conflicting thoughts settle. The ever present knots in her stomach loosened, the strain in her neck and shoulders unraveled without her bidding. Her body cast off the tension she'd carried for so long and silent tears rolled down her cheek.\n\n\"Roland,\" she whispered, her hand finally finding his. He stepped forward, sweeping her into his arms in one swift motion. He picked her up, holding her tightly against him as she held onto his shoulders. More tears, unbidden and confused, soaked his shirt where she buried her head. His hand smoothed comfortingly over her back, running along the ridges of her scars over the soaking wet shift that clung to her skin. She melted into his deep embrace, the balm of his touch soothing after so many months of loneliness and worry. He should not have been able to allay that which that which he had a part in creating, and yet she knew it to be true.\n\nHis lips pressed against the wet hair on the crown of her head, he held her tightly even as she shook with sobs. \"If I'd known you were so distraught without me, I'd have come sooner.\"\n\nKenna could think of no response to his teasing. Her tears still came as if they were shedding the fear and itching worry that had plagued her, the creeping doubt and unbearable despair that she might have had to face life in her sister's home forever, throwing off the long shadow of her tragedy and finally setting her free.\n\nThe discord within her hurt, that she could feel more peace in the hands of her captor than in the embrace of her family. It tore her chest where her heartbreak ached and stoked its pain to full blazing glory. How could she lose herself like this?\n\n\"Hush, Kenna.\" He scooped her up, carrying her out of the waves and back to the beach. She quieted as he held her. \"If I'd found you content I would have left you in peace.\"\n\nShe knew better than to believe the sincerity in his voice. He let her feet down to the sand and she took a step back, out of his embrace.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" her voice was low and hoarse from crying. She couldn't muster a glare but she peered into the darkness below his hat. \"We both know you would have collected me no matter how well you'd discovered me.\" She spoke to him unmasked now, the Irish widow from her journey was gone now that Kenna was safely back in the company of her fellow Highlanders. The urge to speak to him as she'd known him was strong, but the need to shed any pretense was stronger.\n\n\"Aye,\" he said softly, his hand coming to her cheek. She stood still, confusion at the remorse she heard. \"But you are not well, Kenna. And so I'm here to offer you a way out.\"\n\nSome horrible spark of hope brightened her heart. \"Don't, Roland, please.\" She stepped away from him again. \"Do not pretend to offer me that which I had to take from you at so high a cost. I could not bear to suffer that again.\"\n\nShe saw his body tense, as if he wanted to follow her retreat, but he held himself still. \"Did you find your hope, Kenna? Was it worth it to risk your life to flee?\" She could hear his anger but he had not asked rhetorically.\n\nKenna hugged herself, the wet shift cooling her even in the warm night air. \"I would have died had I stayed with you, perhaps not that day, or the day after, but the slow agony of a person who would betray herself, her most fundamental truths, to become something less than human.\"",
        "Roland nodded, turning his head and looking out along the beach instead of at her. \"And now?\"\n\nIt hurt, the pain of being forced to bare herself when he offered nothing back, to accept that he had all of the power and she none, and that it calmed her all the same.\n\n\"You opened me up and carved a piece of my soul that aches in your absence. You took all of the shame I had suffered for years and bled it from me until I felt worthy, but then denied me any choice for your fear.\" She took a deep breath. \"You were right that I could never return to that life. And I have tried, desperately to do just that despite knowing it was futile, because the cost you demanded was too high. You would have me pay with my freedom, not only of movement but of mind. And I could not do it.\"\n\n\"You are not running from me now.\"\n\nShe tilted her chin forward, swallowing her need to hear him confess his own heart. \"I have nowhere left to run from you, Roland. But that does not mean I was wrong to do it.\"\n\n\"So you wish me gone once more or have you changed your mind?\"\n\nHe would make her say every last word before he took her, so she could never hate him again. \"I have confessed to you the state of my soul and it was not easily done, Roland. I have no sanctuary, no hope for some magical world where I can be free from fear of being found out as a murderess and the shame of what was done to me, and have the choice to live as I wish. Please do not demand anymore of me when you offer me nothing in return but the promise of possession.\"\n\nShe could feel him tense at her words, his back straightening and his body held taut as if he would leap at her at any moment. For a long moment he was silent and she was left alone in her vulnerability. She looked down at the silver sand between them, feeling it move between her toes as she curled her feet, rocking herself gently. She could survive belonging to him now, she reasoned; she was tired of a fight she'd so thoroughly lost with the world.\n\nAll the hopes and ideas that had filled her head from childhood, that drove her ever onwards seeking some life that was her due, disappeared under the weight of her need to be free of them. The slow eroding of hope that had begun with her mother's death, her father's arrangement with her husband, had ended here, on the shores of the New World when she finally realized she did not know what it was to be whole, or truly free.\n\nBut here, in the worst possible scenario by all accounts, she felt the first promise of peace.\n\nHe slowly took his hat off, the moonlight sliding over he features as he tossed it aside so it landed on the crumpled mass of her dress. In the dark he looked the same as he ever had and Kenna felt a dangerous stirring deep inside her as she gazed up at him. He met her eyes and she felt the pull of her desires, the whispers that promised her so much on the far side of her surrender.\n\nHe crossed the space between them in one long stride. His fingers caught her chin and his lips captured hers with an urgency she had not heard in his voice. They were warm and tasted of the sea. It was familiar and comforting, something she knew immediately she should resist feeling. But this was different. She had admitted it to herself, and now to him, that she was incomplete without him; there could be no fighting it. She responded, capitulating and allowing his heat to seep into her, to chase away the cold inside her. Her hands curled in his shirt, pulling her further into him as his arms pressed their bodies tightly together.\n\nHe broke the kiss before she was ready. \"You will not run from me again.\" It was said as a statement, but she felt the question he desperately needed answered again.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered back. He seized her again in a shattering kiss, all of his own suffering in the intensity of his desire to hold her and have it be true. She put her arms around his neck, her fingers lost in his dark hair as she shared her own longing with him. Her capitulation was not without sadness but she drowned it beneath the heady waves of his touch. He moved her backwards until her back came up against the smooth bark of a large sable palm. He pinned her against it with the length of his body pressed against hers, all the while his lips never broke their kiss. It was thrilling and terrifying, knowing how little effort it took him to completely control her.\n\nAnd suddenly he was gone. The weight on her limbs disappeared, the urgent kiss vanished and she blinked in the moonlight as he stepped away from her.\n\nDespite the dark she could see how he held himself back, his shoulders tight and slightly raised. She could feel the tension in his body even with the space between them and part of her yearned to soothe it.\n\nHe turned away from her and then paced back, his gaze back on the waves as though he could not bring himself to look at her as he spoke.\n\n\"You must decide, Kenna. I will not follow you if you flee to your sister's home.\"\n\nKenna held her breath. It couldn't be.\n\n\"I have seen how you suffer, and how your smile fools your family. If you prefer it, then go, but make haste.\"\n\nKenna could scarcely hold the blossoming hope at bay. It burned in her heart, threatening new tears. When he did not continue she stepped towards him. \"You still claim there is no justice, no consequence to our actions on the moral stage?' His jaw tightened, moonlight betraying the movement of the muscles beneath his cheeks. \"Are the wrongs visited upon us simply the consequence of existing in this world which carries us along, indifferent to its passengers?\"\n\nHe stepped towards her, within reach but still holding himself back. \"The world is indifferent, but I am not.\" He paused.\n\n\"Speak it Roland and be free of it.\"\n\n\"I will not take you again, not by force, not without a choice.\"\n\nShe almost laughed but controlled it. His state would not allow the slightest hint of mocking. The smile she had been holding back broke through, her face alight, skin tingling in her fingers and lips. His expression softened, and the longing he felt was written plainly for her to see.\n\n\"We are quite a pair, I dare say. I who will not run from you, and you who will not take me.\" Hope spilled into joy and she felt the tears break free. \"I fear that leaves us standing here for all eternity.\"\n\nThere in the moonlight, the waves crashing softly on the white sand, a moment hung perfectly in the air between them, where discord finally faded into joyous resonance. She stepped towards him, allowing the sweep of his arms to encircle her completely. He moved into her, bringing her up against the sabal palm once more. His lips found hers but there was still some piece of her mourning.\n\nThe kiss turned sweet, coaxing, tempting her with everything she had never truly had before. Could she give in? After all of this was she too stubborn to let go of her anguish and allow the possibility that he had given her the choice and she had chosen him? His hands ran along her body, the wood of the tree at her back recalled the wall of his cabin, the smell of him, the taste of his lips, it wove a melancholy memory into the rapturous present.\n\nHe pulled back, the hope in his face turned to worry. She tried to kiss him, lifting her face, offering her lips to his. His hands came to cup her cheeks, holding her still as he studied her. Understanding followed--she could never hide anything from him--and with it a small smile.\n\n\"Say it, Kenna. And be free of it.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, tears fighting their way out between her eyelids. Could she release herself at last, accept this way of the world, choose it over every other path? Knowing and speaking it were different things but to harmonize the ever warring pieces of herself she would have to do both, to choose him. It took every bit of strength she could find within her to say it, to allow the confession out of the carefully guarded place she'd locked it when it had first appeared, to bring it to full, blinding light in the open where it would never be denied again.\n\n\"I'm yours.\"\n\nIt hurt to say it but he seized her mouth again in a kiss that demanded she forget the pain. There was agony in her capitulation; there was no way to strip herself of all that she once held dear and not feel it acutely. But Roland took that anguish and twisted it around his tongue and fed it back to her as something much more intoxicating.\n\nHe broke their kiss. \"Say it again,\" he said, the satisfaction barely masked by the arousal in his voice.\n\n\"I'm yours.\" Such small words for so enormous a declaration. Even as her heart settled, her mind fought the idea. She would have time enough to consider it, later, far from this strange limbo between land and sea where the man before her promised to break down every last defense she could mount. The fight no longer flowed in her veins as ballads of fallen heroes once had; it sang a different song now, one she had not fully learned but she swore to herself she would.\n\nHer hands joined in as she reacquainted herself with his body. He hoisted her into his arms, her shift rucked up around her hips by his impatient hands.\n\n\"Roland,\" she gasped as he pressed his steel hard erection to her unprotected core. \"This is hardly the place.\"\n\nHe let loose a small growl that melted in her stomach, the heat of it spreading through her body. \"You will not deny me this, Kenna.\" His eyes pinned her in place as deftly as his hands had.\n\nShe recognized the relief in his gaze and she smiled back. \"Did you dream of me?\" she teased him gently.\n\nHe managed to loosen his belt even with her legs clasped around his waist. \"Only when I slept.\"\n\n\"Not night and day? I did not steal your every thought--\" He swallowed the rest of her pert response, tongue and cock invading her at the same time as she clung to him. Her body met the near painful stretch as he seated himself inside her once again with rejoicing, an intoxicating mix pleasure and pain running through her. She demanded only more as he began to thrust into her, their surroundings forgotten as she felt the intensity of his assault in the tingling of her fingertips, the creeping sensation winding up her spine. There was no warning when the pleasure hit her. She coiled around him as he muffled her calls with his claiming kiss.\n\nHe stilled, releasing her mouth to allow the deep inhales she took to keep from losing her senses. He waited for her to come back, pressing himself deeply inside her and holding them there. When her eyes finally focused she saw his smile before she realized he was returning her own. He began again, a slow torturous pace against her overly sensitive core. She bit her lip as he bottomed out, grinding against her and causing waves of pleasure as he brought her back to full shattering need. Her eyes rolled back and closed, she rested her head against the trunk, allowing him to devour her neck even as he kept up his measured strokes into her wet channel.\n\nFrustration rose as her body clamored for more of him, to feel him as intensely as she craved. Her eyes opened and found his fixed on her, and she understood what he wanted. There was no pride to keep her safe, no resistance to tighten her jaw and maintain her silence. He held a promise to her in that gaze, one that did not offer her ruin as he had in the past. All she need do was beg.\n\nShe took up the challenge of his teasing and set about breaking his control as quickly as he had her own. \"Please, Roland.\" she offered into the distance between them. \"Please, I'm yours, take me.\"\n\nThere was no time to bask in her success. He unleashed himself, and Kenna knew what it was to be consumed by another. There was no small part of her she could keep apart, no refuge of pain and fear to tether her to her own story. Her body sang an echoing cry her mind could not deter. Perfect resonance overtook her as the clash of their bodies reached crescendo. She took his face in her hands and swallowed the sounds of their climax as her lips met his in a bruising kiss.\n\nThat night, as the hooves of his horse beat the sandy road towards the bay, Kenna rested against him, anchored to his chest by one great arm. He still had not told her where they were going, not that it mattered. For the first time Kenna felt secure in the hold of another. Endless nights spent prowling the shores she had now abandoned coupled with his steady grip conspired against her and at last Kenna closed her eyes and slept."
