        "Ok, I know that the non-consent thing in this chapter is kind of a stretch, but all of the other chapters are posted here, so here you go. I hope you enjoy and thank you for all of the wonderful comments. \n\n----------------------\n\nBlake Denizen had invested in a stress ball when he'd finally broken his phone from throwing it across the room in frustration repeatedly. Cain Malcolm was going to get his way. What was fucking new. Golden boy had always breezed through life while everyone else had to work for what they had. Eli McAllister was wrapped around Cain's manicured little finger. Blake had received a letter that formally acknowledged his complaint and assured him that it had been dealt with accordingly. Cain probably hadn't even received a proverbial slap on the wrist. No, he had probably had a real good fucking time laughing it up with the General of the Army. They'd probably found the whole thing real fucking hilarious over a game of golf. As always, Cain would get his way. Blake squeezed the yellow smily face ball in his fist until his knuckles turned white. \n\nEvery time he'd had to talk to the son of bitch he'd wanted to scream. Cain had come in with his hostage girl to fix everything up with a real big fucking smile on his face. It had nearly driven Blake mad to have to be cordial with the prick. Cain, on the other hand, had found it extremely amusing to rub it in Denizen's face the entire time they'd had to work together. He didn't out right say anything, but he didn't have to. His perfect pretty boy face did all the talking for him with the infuriating arrogance that showed there so openly. He thought a lot of himself. The aggravating thing about it was that everyone else seemed to think a lot of him as well. It didn't seem fair that Cain should have money and looks. He had never had to even lift a finger and women opened their legs wide for him. How the asshole had any friends was beyond him. No he knew why he had friends, he had money. That's what it had always come down to, money, and Cain had been born with an abundance of it. \n\nEveryone at the snobby school he'd been forced to go to had flocked around him and his brother. Blake didn't really care for the brother one way or the other, but Cain had always gotten under his skin. As soon as Blake's dad had made him transfer to the big shot school to go with their new big shot money he'd hated nearly everyone there, but Cain had caught his eye especially. Cain was the hot shot of the school and he knew it. He'd looked down on Blake the moment he'd gotten there. He was the king of the snobby superficial bitches that spent their mommy and daddy's money left and right. The money that his own father had been so proud of had embarrassed Blake throughout high school. It was never enough with the rich. Everyone strove to be like the Malcolm's and Blake was the furthest away from that goal. He'd gone from the in crowd of his own school to the scum under Cain's foot. \n\nCain actually had the nerve to shove his military position in Blake's face, as if he'd earned anything. Blake had worked his ass off to get his position and Cain didn't do shit and was ten times as powerful. Blake ran a unit and Cain was one step away from running the entire army. Blake was proud of how far he'd come and Cain had laughed in his face. \n\n'Ah ah ah, that's General Malcolm to you, director'. Cain's voice replayed in Blake's mind once again. He squeezed his ball furiously. Cain was going to win. He would win like he'd won his entire fucking life. No! Not again! He would not lose to Cain Malcolm again. He was going to ruin that snarky prick's life if it was the last thing he ever did. \n\nIt didn't take him many phone calls to various friends he'd made over the years to find people who might be mad at the general. He smiled at the name he'd written down and underlined. \n\n\"Well well well, I think it's time we give Mr. Vincent Dutari a call.\" Blake said to himself, smiling for the first time in weeks. \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nMalia couldn't stop thinking that she should have stopped Cain from leaving. She didn't know what to say to him. His story had actually made her cry. She could vicariously feel the overpowering guilt that he must feel daily. He thought that it was his fault. That one moment that he'd surprisingly shared with her had shaped his life so completely. It had changed a hurt selfish teenager into an overly responsible man. But he was more than just responsible, he was living his life to make up for his past. She knew that he would never consider that debt paid. Before she knew Cain she had thought that he had no sense of honor or nobility. She'd thought that he would have done whatever he needed and wanted to do to get the end result he desired. Recently she'd come to know that his sense of honor was deeply ingrained, and when he'd violated it he didn't take it lightly. \n\nShe should have told him that it wasn't his fault. He wouldn't agree with her of course, but she felt he needed to hear it all the same. She didn't have time to think of the words before he'd left the house. He'd told the entire story straight-faced, though she saw the deep emotion lurking in his eyes. The memory had been haunting him for a long time. She could see the events play through her mind like a tragic movie. \n\nShe could see the lost teenager lashing out at his stifling family life that was dominated by public appearances. She could see how his strong pride would cause that rebellion to escalate, as he would die before he would back down. She imagined that his father had been very similar in temperament, causing a volatile mixture. She saw the pain there, when he talked about his father's death. He'd loved the man and she knew it had devastated him, no matter how aloof he may act. But Cain's pride was what kept him together. She saw the young man spiraling out of control as he refused to grieve for a man he'd openly hated, a man he'd loved. \n\nIt was this weakened state that had finally broken the pride that had been holding him together. She saw things as Cain would. He had continued to act selfishly, even after the death of his father. He'd therefore caused the death of a friend and the lifelong irreversible injury to his own brother. She knew what had been a terrible accident wouldn't be seen that way to Cain. A tear streamed down her face as she saw the scene in her head. Now Cain was running through the woods, trying to run from his own memories. She should go look for him. She didn't know what to say if she were to find him. He wouldn't accept any comforting words she had to offer, even if she could come up with any words to say. She couldn't sit in the recliner anymore, she needed to do something. \n\nMalia walked into the kitchen. She would make him dinner. She started going through the cupboards and refrigerator to prowl their contents. She wasn't sure what he liked to eat. She didn't actually know how to cook anyway. Hopefully this would be a thought that counted type of thing. An hour went by and she was pacing back and forth from the kitchen to the living room. Every time she passed the window in the living room she looked for Cain. She'd made spaghetti because it seemed like a fairly safe bet that he would like spaghetti and it was simple enough for her to figure out. The silver pot of meat sauce sat covered on the stove next to the pot of pasta. She couldn't do it anymore. She'd already changed into a pair of sweat pants and a t-shirt, as well as undergarments. She put a pair of tennis shoes on and walked out the front door. She didn't know how she was planning on finding him but she couldn't pace around anymore.\n\nThe sun had started to go down and the woods were darker than the front yard she'd been meticulously scanning. She slowed down as soon as she reached the trees. How was Cain running around in the dark, he would run into a tree or something. \n\n\"Cain,\" she yelled. She wanted to get out of here. She could have turned around and went back into the house but now a reel of worst case scenarios was running through her mind at warp speed. Cain could have been attacked by wild animals, or he could have fallen on a rock and hit his head, or someone could have assaulted him. She tried to physically shake the paranoid thoughts out of her head. Cain wasn't fragile or weak by any means. She shouldn't be worrying about him, but he wasn't in the best state of mind and he shouldn't be out here like that. She continued to walk and call out for him, though she didn't yell as loudly as she could. It seemed risky to her for some reason. She felt a large plop of water hit her cheek, followed by another on her forehead nearly immediately after. Fantastic, it was raining. She started to walk a little faster and yell a little louder. She didn't even know if she was going the right way. There were tons of foot trails that wound through the forest for miles around Finn's cabin. \n\nIt seemed to go from a grayish dark to a pitch black much too quickly. Malia was jogging now and yelling his name at the top of her lungs. The heavy cover of trees had kept most of the rain off of her, but it started to rain harder. It seemed like she was soaking wet in less than a minute. \n\n\"Cain!\" Malia's voice was starting to become frantic. She couldn't see the path anymore and even if she wanted to turn back she wouldn't know which way to go. This had to be the stupidest idea she'd ever had. Cain was probably sitting in the recliner back in the living room watching a TV show. Hopefully he would come looking for her. Malia heard a deafening crack much too close for comfort. She thought she might have felt the ground shake with the vicious thunder. She stopped and closed her eyes. If she didn't get her emotions under control quickly, she was going to start panicking. She breathed in and out as she heard more thunder crash through the night sky. She only felt minimally better when she opened her eyes again. She called out again and again as she walked quickly through the underbrush. She'd definitely abandoned the path. She tried to look around but it was pouring rain and she couldn't see anything but trees. As the thunder and lightning became more frequent and intense she felt the panic overtake her. She turned completely around and started to run. She needed to find the path again. Didn't lightning strike trees? There were probably wolves and bears in these woods. She could feel the paranoia rising. She screamed when she unexpectedly ran into what felt like a tree, except the tree fell when they made contact. \n\n\"Jesus, Malia!\" Cain yelled to be heard over the thunder and rain. \n\n\"Cain?\" Her voice was filled with relief that completely masked over the pain of hitting him full force. She'd knocked him down, luckily only on dead leafs and dirt. She was already laying on him fully so she hugged him in relief. \n\n\"I found you. oh my god I thought I was lost. Why didn't you answer me!\" She yelled at him. \n\n\"I did!\" He yelled back. She let go of him and looked up at his face, he looked angry. \"What the hell are you doing out here?\" \n\nIt was strange to have a conversation lying on top of someone so she rolled off of him and stood up. He groaned as he stood. He'd completely caught the brunt of the fall, and she'd been running pretty frantically, she hoped he wasn't seriously hurt. She was only sympathetic until his words finally sunk in. She had been out here looking for him and he was yelling at her? \"What do you mean what am I doing out here?\" She yelled, all of her fear easily turing into anger. \"I was looking for you, you ungrateful bastard.\" \n\n\"Ungrateful? What the fuck am I supposed to be grateful for? I had to come into the woods in a fucking thunderstorm to find you! Why would you leave the path?\" She'd scared him, but he'd scared her too and she was tired of him lashing out at her to deal with his emotions. \n\n\"Do you think I meant to leave the path? In case you haven't noticed, it's pouring rain and pitch black out here!\" She yelled back. \n\n\"So why are you out here?\" He spoke as if she were incredibly stupid. \n\n\"I already told you!\" \n\n\"I told you I was going for a run. Why would you come look for me?\" He'd stopped yelling, but it sounded like he was actively trying to speak calmly. \n\n\"I was worried okay!\" She yelled when she couldn't think of any plausible lie. \n\n\"Don't start pitying me, little girl!\" He was yelling again. \"I'm not some broken thing you need to comfort, do you hear me? What I told you changes nothing!\" He grabbed the tops of her arms as he spoke directly down into her face. \n\nMalia didn't believe him. He was panicking even more than she had been a few moments before. His stubborn pride was being threatened and he needed to reestablish his power. He wouldn't let her see him hurt. \n\n\"You're right! I shouldn't pity you! You're so god-damned irritating that you don't deserve me to worry about you, but I did anyway! So just get over it. And quit telling me nothing has changed, because as far as I can see it, nothing is the same! We had sex Cain! Then you called off the deal with Tristan, and told me your big secret story! Yet you keep telling me that nothing has changed, everything has changed!\" She was breathing heavily as she expressed her irritation. \n\nAfter a couple of minutes of her trying to catch her breath he lifted her chin up with his index finger. She couldn't see his face very clearly. \"Malia this isn't a happy ending kind of thing. I'm not going to fall in love with you.\" He said it full of pity, trying to avoid hurting her feelings. \n\n\"I don't recall asking you to!\" She tried to push him away but he resisted, still looking down into her face.\n\n\"I just don't want to give you the wrong idea.\" He was making things worse, he thought of her as a little incompetent girl. \n\n\"Cain, do us both a favor and stop worrying about my feelings okay?\" She stepped closer until her entire body was pressed lightly up against his. \"I promise you, you aren't nearly as irresistible as you think you are.\" She smiled up at him and pushed firmly away. This time he let her go. \"Which way is the cabin?\" She asked as she turned away from him.She was freezing and water continuously dripped down her face as the rain poured. \n\n\"I don't know.\" He answered simply. She turned to look at him quickly. \n\n\"What?\" She desperately hoped that he was joking. \n\n\"You heard me. I was following your obnoxious screaming through the woods. It didn't give me much time to leave a trail of breadcrumbs.\" He didn't sound like he was joking. Malia felt her stomach sink like a rock. \n\n\"Cain you know these woods. Please tell me you're joking.\" She wiped rain from her eyes. \n\n\"I don't really know these woods.\" He looked around the trees as there was a map dangling from one of them. \"I don't live here after all.\" \n\n\"You went running through the woods! How did you get back to the cabin then?\" She was starting to panic again as the lightning lit up both of their faces momentarily. \n\n\"Well, since I didn't decide to travel into the woods in the fucking dark, I could keep track of the paths I was taking. I definitely didn't leave the path and run through the trees screaming like a banshee.\" Cain said accusingly. \n\nShe ignored the verbal jab to placate her rising panic. \"Do you mean to tell me that we are lost in the woods in the middle of the night in a thunderstorm?\" \n\n\"It looks that way.\" She'd subconsciously moved closer to Cain again. \"I suggest you pick a path, looks like we're going with trial and error here.\" Cain shrugged at her nonchalantly. \n\n\"What?\" She looked at him like he'd grown an extra head. \n\n\"I don't see any other way we're going to make it back. Choose.\" He motioned at the path they were on. \n\nShe didn't know which way would lead them back to the cabin and which would lead them further into the woods. She'd been off the path for a while before he'd found her. Neither direction gave a slightest hint, as they both looked quite formidable. She chose to continue forward and hoped she wouldn't come to regret the decision. They continued to walk through the rain for what felt like a long time. Cain was simply following her silently. She could feel her nerves winding tighter and tighter as they continued to walk in silence. She finally stopped and turned around to face him. \n\n\"Did we go the wrong way?\" She asked accusingly. \n\n\"How should I know?\" He replied defensively \n\nShe gritted her teeth in frustration. \"Well what do you think? A little input would be nice here.\" She sighed. It had stopped pouring rain, though it continued to drizzle. \n\n\"You mean to say that you don't want to be in charge? But all throughout the day you were doing everything you could think of to show me just how powerful you were. My computer and bookshelves will surely quiver in fear when they see you again. Not to mention the poor soldiers from lunch. You wanted to be in charge, so lead.\" \n\nShe glared at him suspiciously as he continued with his gloating speech. \"Did you do this,\" she motioned to the woods around them, \"to prove that you have power over me?\" \n\n\"Now how would I do this? How would I know that you were going to be stupid enough to run into the woods, after I told you where I was going, in the middle of a thunderstorm, right as it was getting dark?\" \n\nShe wished she could see his face clearly. She wasn't good at reading his facial expressions, but maybe she would be able to tell if he were lying about this. \"Do you know where we are?\" She asked, still highly suspicious that this was another power play. \n\n\"I already answered that question.\" He replied irritated. \"I suggest you pick a direction and start walking if you want to get to the cabin tonight. \n\nMalia was cold, wet, and tired. Her mental facilities were running thin. She walked over to a large tree and sat on the ground at the base of the trunk. Cain stood over her looking down at her. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" He asked incredulously. \n\n\"I'm leading. At ease troop.\" She snarled up at him. \n\n\"Cute.\" He replied unamused. \"Stellar leadership skills. It's a wonder I haven't given you the reigns before now.\" \n\n\"I'm cold and tired of walking.\" She closed her eyes. The rain had finally stopped. \n\n\"As leader you should know that wearing wet clothing for an extended period of time is just asking for skin breakdown and infection.\" He sounded so proud of himself at her failure to lead. She was going to wipe that satisfied look off of his face. She didn't want to focus on the situation they were in, so she decided to try and have some fun. Her previous fear and adrenaline had drained her body and she was feeling almost giddy. \n\n\"Well then scout, take 'em off.\" She ordered. She folded her arms behind her head on the tree trunk in a faux relaxed posture. \n\nHe crossed his arms across his chest making his muscles especially prominent in the wet t-shirt that clung to his powerful frame. \"An epic misuse of power.\" He chastised. \n\n\"Ah, not so epic. I've seen worse.\" She looked at him accusingly. \"But what can I say? I learned from the best. Now strip.\" She attempted to mimic his authoritative tone but felt that there was no comparison. \n\nHe smiled. She could see his straight white teeth even in the dark. \n\n\"Oh, so I'm supposed to listen to you? Like you listen to me?\" He laughed cynically. \"No I don't have to. You have no hold over my life.\" He used an annoyingly high pitched voice to mimic her. \n\n\"I do not sound like that.\" \n\n\"No?\" He grinned arrogantly.\n\n\"No.\" She stood quickly and felt a little dizzy, but she righted herself on the tree trunk. The clouds had cleared and the moonlight made him more visible to her. He really was sexy. His hair was wet and spiky. His shirt clung to his impressive body, leaving nothing to the imagination. Her fingers itched to run across those imposing muscles. She walked closer to him. She shouldn't want this but she just couldn't bring herself to feel bad about it. She couldn't see a reason to keep fighting the attraction she had to him. She wasn't a virgin anymore, she thought with a little thrill. \"So this is where I rip the shirt from your body and show my dominance?\" She was close to him now. He wasn't smiling anymore which gave her a dose of feminine pride. She moved her hands up and played with the hemline of his t-shirt. She was pretty certain that she couldn't rip it in half, so she didn't try. She looked up at him, hoping he would obey her. She could feel heat pooling between her legs especially well since the rest of her body was cold and clammy. ",
        "\"Don't start something you aren't going to finish little girl.\" His eyes were dark as they glared warningly down at her. \n\n\"Little too late for that isn't it big boy?\" She looked down at his tented pants and smiled. There was something so thrilling about being the cause of his arousal. When she looked up at his face again he looked so deliciously menacing. \n\n\"Clearly the adrenaline was too much for you.\" He growled, looking irritated. \n\n\"Why? Because I want it tonight?\" She challenged him. He had kept her on edge all day and she suddenly realized how much she wanted this, how much she needed it. \"You would rather have me fighting you?\" \n\n\"Don't ever say that I didn't try to warn you.\" He snarled and lifted her against his body quickly. She squeaked in surprise before his mouth crushed in on hers. She wrapped her arms around his neck tightly and slid her tongue in his mouth. Her legs wound around his narrow hips. Her cleft was riding his significant bulge causing her to moan into his mouth. His hands were on her ass, holding her against him tightly. He walked until her back was pressed against the tree she'd been sitting by. Each of his steps caused a jolt of electrifying pleasure. She used his broad shoulders as leverage to lift herself minimally and slid back down on him completely. He broke their kiss as he groaned. She repeated the motion as she pressed her forehead to his and moaned appreciatively. Her mind was so exquisitely cloudy. She was completely in tune with her body's needs, everything else didn't matter. \n\nShe didn't need to lift herself again because Cain moved this time. He thrust his hips into her hard, making contact with her clit through their respective layers of clothing. Her fingers clenched instinctively into his shoulders. He repeated the agonizingly magnificent motion again. She opened her eyes to watch him. His brows were tightly cinched together in concentration that looked like it bordered on pain. His eyes were heavy lidded but open, he looked at her. She found it incredibly arousing that he was clearly as affected as she was. \n\n\"Put me down.\" She unwound her arms and legs from his body. He looked pained but followed her order, probably expecting her to change her mind. She wanted to try this before she lost her nerve, or her mind became too lost to lust to think at all. She slowly lowered herself to her knees in front of him. \n\n\"Malia.\" He groaned in warning. She loved when he said her name. \n\n\"I want to try something.\" She hoped he didn't stop her. She pulled his athletic pants and boxers down slowly. His erection sprang free and she finally got to see it closely. It was quite intimidating. It was long and thick and hard. She brought her hand up tentatively and grazed her fingers along the length curiously. She looked up at him to gauge his reaction. His chest moved up and down with the deep breaths he was taking. He was watching her with those heavy lidded eyes again. The unit didn't have the internet or television which made sexual acts a big sharing subject with the girls there, they had to share what they'd learned somehow. She hadn't exactly tried any of the things she'd heard, but she still thought back to all of the stories for reference on how to proceed. It had to be better advice than nothing. She brought her hand to the tip again and encircled the head, she couldn't completely touch her fingers together. She moved down his length slowly applying a little pressure. He groaned softly, egging her on. He was so hard and strong and hot. She pumped her hand up his rigid staff again. She never thought that this would be so arousing for her but there was something empowering about controlling his body's reactions. She brought her face closer and flicked her tongue out to graze the head of his cock. He hissed as he quickly sucked in air. \n\nShe kept looking up at him to gauge his reaction. He looked so predatory, it excited her. She covered her teeth with her upper lip and tongue and engulfed the head of his cock. His eyebrows shot together in a surprised frown. She moved her tongue back and forth to test the new sensation of having him in her mouth. He groaned which provoked her to take more of him inside. He stretched her mouth and she couldn't take nearly all of him. She slid her mouth back up to the tip applying suction as she went. The sound of his groan satisfied her immensely. She repeated the motion. She didn't get to try anything else before she was lifted up off of him by her arms. She looked at him confused. He didn't answer, he just held her there for a second with his eyes closed and his brow knit together. He seemed to gain his self control again and opened his eyes. They were dark and hungry looking. He kicked his shoes off and stepped out of his pants that were around his ankles. He walked, pushing her back, until her back was once again pressed against the rough bark of the tree. \n\n\"Mmm, Cain.\" She sighed appreciatively. \n\n\"Let's get some of these clothes off.\" He nearly growled. She raised her arms and he pulled her shirt off in one quick swipe. He reached around her and unlatched her bra faster than she thought possible. He took a moment to look down at her naked breasts appreciatively. \"Lose the pants.\" He ordered. \n\nShe arched an eyebrow. \"Lose the shirt.\" She countered. \"And the socks,\" He was naked from the waist down except for a pair of black athletic socks that didn't even come up to his ankle. \"they're distracting me.\" He laughed and groaned at the same time. She expected him to argue with her but he pulled his shirt off jerkily and brought one foot at a time off of the ground to rip the sock off and throw it into the small clearing behind them. She wanted to play more, it was so different from the night before, but her own needs were taking control as much as his were. She brought her feet up slowly and removed her shoes and socks. She lost the inch the tennis shoes had given her; he was so tall in comparison to her. It was so fascinating to her to compare how different their bodies were. She'd always wanted to be more petite and feminine but next to Cain's overwhelmingly masculine physique she was sure that if she'd been any smaller he would surely crush her. They seemed like a perfectly proportional pair, which thrilled her. He was hard where she was pliant, and bigger and stronger than her. The entire effect was overwhelmingly stimulating. He looked very impatient so she brought her hands up to the waistband of her pants. She bent down as she slowly slid the pants and panties down her legs in what she hoped was an attractive manner. Cain only looked at her for a second before he had her pinned against the tree once again. The bark was scratching up against her back in what should have been a painful sensation, strangely enough she couldn't seem to feel more than the briefest recognition that it was there. \n\nHe kissed her quickly and impatiently for a moment. Then he lifted her again by her hips, except it was significantly higher this time. She squeaked at the unexpected action. It seemed to be effortless for him to get her high in the air. She only had a second to wonder what he was doing before he stepped closer to the tree and let her legs dangle over his shoulders on his back. She tried to push him away when she realized his face was directly aligned with her seeping center, but he simply trapped each of her hands in his. Her ass was pressed against the tree and her weight was being supported by his broad shoulders. She felt nervous and excited in equal amounts at what she knew was coming. \n\n\"My turn.\" He moaned right before his tongue touched her intimately. She tried to move her hands in a defensive motion but they were firmly encased in his much larger ones which were pressed against her hips to steady her. He swirled his tongue around her clit expertly and all semblance of defending herself from him was gone instantly. Which was good because it freed up his hands to join in. She moved her hands to his head to hold on, but she wasn't trying to get away anymore. He moved his finger downward to find her very wet. He pushed one finger in and soon added another, moving them in and out slow at first but with increasing quickness. His tongue continued to do amazing things. As she moaned and arched her back uncontrollably he began to move with more intensity and speed. She could feel the orgasm cresting. Everything about him was magnifying the sensation: his expertise with her body, the heat his body created when next to hers, the fact that he had her pinned high on the trunk of a tree so effortlessly. She'd given herself plenty of orgasms, but not one of them could compare to the nerve tingling climax he caused in her. She felt jolts of sensation run through her body quickly and intensely. He kept egging her on with his tongue and fingers as she came. She was breathing heavily when he finally stopped. He looked up at her with a self-satisfied grin. She didn't have the energy to come up with a smart ass comment.\n\nHe lifted her off of his shoulders as easily as he'd put her there, but he didn't put her back on the ground. He lowered her until she was brought out of her daze by his strong, hard cock coming in contact with her mound. She'd been recovering from the full body orgasm but was brought instantly to attention by an insistent nudge just inside her outer lips. Her eyes instantly darted to his, which were once again dark and focused. He held her ass against the tree with one hand as his other came around to move his cock back and forth slowly and teasingly across her entire slit. When he reached her opening again he slid in, but only a little bit. She cinched her eyebrows in frustration. She didn't understand how he could work her up again so quickly. A second ago she could have sworn that she was so satisfied that she wouldn't need to come again in a year or two, now she was hot and bothered once again. He smiled at her knowingly. She wrapped her legs around his hips tightly, trying to pull him more into herself. He resisted only for a moment, probably to show her she couldn't physically force him to do anything, then he plunged inside of her quickly. She was very wet but there was still a hint of pain from accommodating his large staff. He started to move and the pain eased and then dissipated all together as pleasanter sensations took its place. She latched onto him tightly as his movements became harsher and faster. Each of his powerful thrusts brought his pelvic bone fully against her clit. She didn't think it possible but she came again. It seemed to be what Cain was waiting for because he lost all restraint that she didn't know he was using and chased his own climax. She held on tight as he gave a final thrust inside her and groaned as he came. She felt like she was drunk and disoriented as she was pinned to the tree by his hard muscled body. His head was bent into the curve of her neck as he attempted to catch his breath. He was still fully inside of her which was thrilling to her for some reason. \n\nThe feeling couldn't last forever. He pulled out of her and lowered her to the ground slowly. Her legs were very wobbly and unreliable so she leaned heavily against the tree. She could suddenly feel her back, scratched raw from the friction against the rough bark. He stepped back slightly and looked down at her face. She had a thousand emotions running through her mind at once, each competing with the next to overtake her. She was fearful at the powerful need Cain could effortlessly make her feel, but it was the same need that elated her. She also had a secret and satisfying pride that she'd caused him to unravel just as much as he'd caused her to. \n\nA gust of wind reminded her that she was naked in the cold wet woods at night. She shivered at the chill it caused her recently heated body. Cain walked over to his own discarded pants and picked them up. She watched him bend over, his muscles fascinating her in their efficiency. The pants dripped cold water as he lifted them. \n\n\"Fuck that.\" Cain muttered under his breath. She found this unbelievably funny and started to laugh hysterically. He arched an eyebrow at her. She was feeling good, her muscles felt like jelly which was a novel feeling. Cain picked up the rest of his clothing. \"Come on the cabin's not far from here.\" Cain said. She felt her good mood dissipate in record time.\n\n\"What!\" She yelled at his back as he started to walk down the path they'd been taking before. He ignored her and kept walking completely naked with his clothing and shoes in his arms. She scattered to get her own clothing before he got too far for her to yell at him, or for him to lose her which was a frightening thought. She ran to catch up to him. \n\n\"You said you didn't know where we were!\" She yelled, outraged. \n\nHe smirked. \"Of course I knew where we were Malia. I helped Finn build this cabin, took the better part of a summer.\"\n\n\"You lied to me?\" She yelled, annoyed that his long strides caused her to halfway jog to keep up with him. \n\n\"You deserved it.\" He said simply, as if it were a commonly accepted fact. \"Did you think you were going to get away with your behavior today scot-free? And we would have made it to the cabin eventually, except you had to stop and have a nervous breakdown.\" \n\nShe snorted indignantly. \"You were sure to take advantage of that weren't you.\" \n\nHe stopped walking suddenly, surprising her. He turned to slightly face her. \"Don't try to blame that on me, not this time.\" He warned menacingly. \n\nHe was right, she'd practically begged him. The revelation caused her cheeks to turn scarlet. \"You're right.\" she admitted less than enthusiastically. It seemed to be enough for Cain because he turned back to the path and continued to walk. It annoyed her that he didn't look ridiculous walking through the woods naked. Sure enough the cabin came into view, the lights still on through the windows. She suddenly felt her nakedness as they walked into the clearing surrounding the house. She crossed her arms over her chest as she walked slightly behind Cain. She was irritated that her gaze kept falling to his tightly muscled ass as he walked.\n\n\"I'm taking a shower.\" Cain announced as soon as they got inside. \"So don't come looking for me or anything.\" He smirked. \n\n\"Why do you get to go first? I thought rich boys were supposed to be raised as gentlemen.\" She was irritated with him and herself. \n\n\"You're more than welcome to join me.\" He laughed as he walked into the bathroom. \n\nShe mocked his snarky voice as she passed the closed bathroom door and heard the water hitting the tub. She went into her room and pulled a white terrycloth robe from the closet. She wrapped it around her shoulders and sighed as she finally got her cold dripping hair off of her back. She sat on the bed with her back propped against the wooden headboard. She was so tired but she definitely wanted at least a quick shower before she went to sleep. She didn't want to think too hard about the stickiness between her legs. She firmly decided that she wasn't going to regret tonight. She'd finally felt some control of her own sexuality. She'd finally felt like a woman worthy of attracting the beautiful, feral beast that was Cain Malcolm. She firmly resolved that she wouldn't ever regret that feeling. There was an attraction to him that she was done trying to deny, even if it would come to be her downfall. She'd lost the ability to fight as soon as he'd revealed his secret to her. She sighed as she realized that falling in love with him would be the biggest mistake she would ever make and there was no way of avoiding it. \n\n-------------------------\n\nFine! She wanted him to stop worrying about her feelings? That's exactly what he was going to do. He'd dealt with enough women to know when they could handle casual sex, and when they were planning a future springtime wedding. He'd tried to be a gentleman. He'd led plenty of women on in the past and Malia didn't deserve that. She had been trying her damnedest to sabotage him at every turn though. There was just so much he could take. He was a healthy heterosexual man and she was an attractive female. Add to that the fact that she'd recently gotten over her reluctance for sexual behavior and it was a volatile situation. Forget 'gotten over', she'd all but ripped his clothes off, and she'd thought about attempting that. He'd seen it in her eyes. Those ornery playful eyes that were the only reminder that she was so innocent and naive. Thinking about those eyes staring up at him as she brought her pouty lips to his cock made him groan. \n\nWhen he'd returned from his run to a pot of clumpy pasta he'd been irritated. He knew she would try and heal him like an injured puppy. But when he hadn't found her in the small house he'd started to worry. At first he'd through she'd ran away, but he couldn't see her doing that. She didn't have reason to anymore, unless she'd been so shocked and appalled by his story that she couldn't stand to be around him anymore. He'd lambasted himself for the paranoid scenarios that ran through his head. They'd caused him to look for her a little quicker and more frantically. Then it had started raining and he'd heard her screaming. He hadn't had enough time to form a reaction before he was hit full force by her running body. Once he found her the edginess he'd been feeling all came to the surface. He hadn't been planning on keeping her out in the woods in a storm, let alone condemning himself to the same fate, but she'd been pushing his buttons all day and he was suddenly highly irritated with her. He'd known where they were the entire time, which he could see she'd suspected. Then she'd sat by that damn tree and completely changed her mood. He still suspected it had been an adverse effect of too much stress and adrenaline. She'd been giddy and teasing and sexy. \n\nHe'd tried to hold back damn it! He didn't like the fact that she seemed to be able to change his mind when it had been firmly against the idea before that. He jerked the knobs of the shower and the water flow ceased instantly. He rubbed a towel through his hair and quickly over his body then wrapped it around his waist. He hadn't been in the shower more than ten minutes so he didn't feel like too much of a jackass for taking a shower first. He walked to his bedroom, she could hear the door of the bathroom if she wanted a shower. He donned a pair of black boxers. He was too hungry to sleep, though he was exhausted. He went to find something to eat. Malia wasn't in the front of the house, she had to be in her bedroom. He made a simple sandwich and didn't bother with a plate. He chewed as he walked back to the bedroom. Her door was cracked, she had to know he was done. He sighed as he approached her door instead of his own. \n\n\"Malia,\" he said as he opened the door. She was sitting against the headboard of the bed, asleep. Her head had fallen forward an was at an odd angle that he knew would hurt in the morning. She was in a giant fluffy robe. Her hair had mostly dried and was a mess, windblown and had what looked like a twig sticking out at the crown of her head. \n\n\"I'm too nice for my own good.\" He mumbled to himself as he walked over to the other side of the bed. He took the last bite of his sandwich to free his hands. He watched her as he chewed. What was he going to do about this maddening little girl who'd turned out to be a frustratingly sexy woman? He knew he should just wake her up, but she looked so worn down and tired. He slipped his arm under her knee, feeling an incredible warmth there. He slipped the other arm behind her back and lifted her up. She made a soft whimpering sound but didn't wake up. It was awkward to juggle her and try and pull the blankets down at the same time, but he managed without waking her. He laid her down with her head on a pillow this time and covered her with the sheets and quilt. Hell if he was going to try and change her into something more comfortable, there was only so much restraint he could show in one day. He pulled the twig out of her hair and left the room, turning the light off as he left.  ",
        "----------------------------------\n\nMalia woke up to a bright room. She looked over at the clock which showed it to be 12:32. She hadn't remembered falling asleep, but she must've been very tired to sleep through half the day. Suddenly she wondered why Cain had allowed her to. She'd assumed she would be going back to the base camp with him today. Her stomach growled viciously as she sat up in the warm bed. She walked slowly into the kitchen, every muscle she had was sore. Cain wasn't there but a note was taped to the refrigerator. \n\n'I'll be gone all day. I'm at work, so don't go looking for me. Feed yourself.\n\n-Cain' \n\nHis handwriting was pretty in a masculine sort of way. Of course it was, one more thing that was perfect about him. She was surprised he'd left her alone, it was the first time she'd been alone for any extended period of time since she'd first left the unit. She ate some fruit and yogurt and took a shower, she'd badly needed one. \n\nHer day spent alone was dreadfully uneventful. She didn't know what to do with herself and all of her attempts at entertaining herself just seemed to put her more on edge. Finally the black SUV pulled up and Cain stepped out. It felt to domesticated to meet him on the porch, but she was irritated when he talked to the driver instead of coming in the house immediately. She wasn't sure what she was going to do when he did come into the house anyway. Was she still mad at him? No. Should she be? Probably. It wasn't the most disturbing thought she'd had. The most disturbing was that she still wanted to jump his bones, desperately. He was wearing his usual expensive suit, and he looked amazing as always. She gave a disgust filled snort at her lack of willpower and turned towards the TV. She realized that she'd never turned it on just as he started to head for the door and made a dash to the power button so he wouldn't see how pathetic she was being, sitting in a quiet room waiting for him. He opened the door as she plopped back down in the recliner. She hoped he didn't notice the chair rocking with the force of her sitting. He looked at her suspiciously. \n\n\"You didn't cut open all the pillows? Catch anything on fire? Smash all the mirrors? Finn wouldn't be too happy with me if you did.\" \n\nShe shook her head, slightly annoyed at his mistrust of her. She hadn't had a single destructive thought all day. Her libido seemed to be too much in overdrive for anything else to seep through. What was wrong with her. He'd made her into some sort of sex freak. He looked at her strangely for her out-of-character compliance at his clear goad. She couldn't argue with him, it would only serve as foreplay. He looked at her, trying to discern her thoughts from her expression. She hoped he couldn't see what she was thinking. She blushed furiously and turned towards the television. \n\n\"Get dressed, we're going to dinner.\" He said somewhat offhandedly. \n\nShe quickly looked back up at him. \"What?\" She didn't know what else to say. \n\nHe walked into the kitchen and got a glass of water as he answered. \"It's my grandmother's birthday. We're going to dinner at her house.\" He took a drink. \"Tristan will be there.\" He added on as if it would be a selling point. \n\nShe usually would have argued with him she mused as she looked through the collection of clothing in the closet. Probably only for the sake of arguing, but she didn't like giving him his way so easily. She was glad that there would be other people at dinner to buffer their interactions with each other. She could get over whatever was wrong with her as long as there were other people around.\n\nTristan's grandmother's house was large, though nothing compared to Milan Manor. It was a brick building with immaculate white trim and flower-filled window boxes. There was ivy climbing up the tall chimney and beautiful flowers growing everywhere around the house. It was gorgeous. Malia felt as if it would be more appropriate to arrive in a horse-drawn carriage instead of the usual black SUV. \n\nBefore they exited the vehicle Cain turned to look at her seriously. \"For the sake of my grandmother's birthday I hope you will agree to a slightly different story as to how we met.\" \n\nShe arched her brow. \"Who are you going to tell them I am?\" \n\n\"I really don't have much choice, I wouldn't bring a colleague or subordinate here and I don't have any female friends. I'm not going to tell them the truth, it isn't their business. So I'll have to tell them that we're dating. We met in a meeting at a base camp in Lystra, it is a small town west of here. You were a secretary in the building the meeting was held in and transferred into central Phoenix.\" \n\n\"How romantic.\" She mumbled sarcastically. \n\n\"They shouldn't ask any questions.\" He assured her. \n\nAn old woman had came out the front door to stand on the stone stairs in front of the house. Cain got out of the car and opened her door before she could get it. She looked at him strangely but got out of the car. He smiled warningly down at her. So she was to play the lovesick infatuated girlfriend, fantastic. He put his arm around her shoulder as if it were the most natural thing in the world as they both walked toward the woman. She was about Malia's height. Her hair was completely silver and pinned up in a bun. She was elegantly slender, but she looked like she was strong despite her age. She smiled widely as Cain walked up to greet her. He let go of Malia as he gently embraced the older woman. \n\n\"Cain.\" The woman said with complete admiration. Malia suddenly didn't feel like she belonged her. Seeing his grandmother hug him with so much open love for him seemed like an intimate breach. \"And who is this?\" His grandmother asked as she held onto Cain's waist with one arm and faced Malia. \n\n\"This is Malia Yates.\" Cain smiled at his grandmother, clearly fond of her. Malia didn't know why she hadn't expected him to be so affectionate with his grandmother. He was just so closed off to her that expecting anything else was risky. \"We've been seeing each other for a few months.\" Malia was surprised when the woman pulled her into a hug. \n\n\"That's fantastic.\" She smiled at her. \"You're beautiful Malia.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" She replied, still stunned from the woman's reaction. \"Happy birthday.\" She tacked on because she couldn't think of anything else to say. \n\n\"Well thank you sweetheart. I have to celebrate to get this one to come and see me.\" She motioned to Cain. Before he could argue she looped an arm around Cain and the other around Malia and led them to the door. \"Come in, come in. Tristan and your mother are inside.\" The woman, who's name she learned was Kate, oozed an infectious kindness. She looked up at her grandson with such open love and admiration. Cain smiled down at Kate with the same smile Malia had seen in the picture on his mantle of him and his brother as small boys. Clearly he loved her very much. \n\nThe trio walked through a hallway and turned right into an open archway that led into a dining room. There was a fire crackling in the fireplace at the far wall. The large cherry table was set immaculately for five with pristine white dishes and crystal glasses. Malia felt her stomach drop when she realized she was going to have to eat in front of these people. Cain had criticized her table manners before, how was she going to fool these people? \n\nTristan walked into the room from another archway opposite them that looked like it connected a sitting room. He had his arm around the shoulder of who could only be his mother. She resembled the beauty queen in the picture Malia had seen, but there were some distinctions that could only be accounted for by time. Her light brown hair more than likely came from a bottle now and hung in a straightened bob at her shoulders. There were faint lines around her eyes and mouth. She still had a timeless elegance shining through her pale green eyes. \n\n\"Malia.\" Tristan smiled happily and left his mother to hug her. He also hit Cain's shoulder affectionately in greeting. \"This is my mother, Miranda.\" He brought Malia over to his mother. \n\nMiranda smiled politely and extended her hand. \"Pleasure to meet you Malia.\" Her voice was enunciated and almost clinical. \n\nMalia smiled in return and shook the woman's hand. \"The pleasure is mine ma'am.\" \n\nMiranda turned to her oldest son. \"Cain.\" She acknowledged him with barely veiled hostility. \n\n\"Mother.\" Cain nodded. \n\nKate hugged Tristan as lovingly as she'd done with Cain. His mother didn't seem to show the same fondness towards Cain. \n\n\"Now that everyone is here let's eat.\" Kate said to the room. Kate sat at the head of the table with Miranda on her left and Cain on her right. Malia sat next to Cain and Tristan next to his mother. The first course came out almost immediately after everyone was seated. Thankfully Cain surreptitiously showed her which utensils to use and how to eat the strange unrecognizable food. After several courses the conversation, which Cain's mother had been silent through, turned to Malia. \n\n\"Malia how did you and Cain meet?\" Miranda asked, looking across the table. \n\n\"We met at a meeting in, um, Lystra. I was the secretary there and your son is quite the charmer.\" Malia hoped she came off as genuine. She badly wanted to change the subject. \n\n\"You're from Lystra?\" She asked. \n\n\"Yes.\" Malia had never heard of the place, she didn't know where the corresponding area would be on a map she would recognize. She didn't know what being from Lystra even entailed, though Miranda made it sound like it had negative connotations. \n\n\"She transferred to central Phoenix about a month ago.\" Cain added, sounding much more believable than she had. \n\n\"You're living in the manor?\" Miranda asked incensed. \n\n\"Miranda don't start.\" Kate warned her daughter. \n\n\"Yes mother, Malia is living in the manor with Tristan and myself.\" He sounded weary instead of spiteful. Malia's discomfort grew at the clear antagonism Cain's mother showed for him. \n\n\"Why shouldn't you turn your father's manner into a brothel!\" Miranda seethed across the table. \n\n\"Miranda!\" Kate yelled, much louder than Malia thought she could, in outrage. \n\nCain was surprisingly composed in his response. \"I'm sorry you feel that way, mother. If you still lived in Milan Manor I'm sure you wouldn't see it as such.\" He spoke as if he were speaking to an unruly coworker. \n\n\"I guess I'll never know. I had to move away from my home because I couldn't bear to live with my murderous disappointment of a son!\" The hostility that had been clearly bubbling beneath the surface had risen for this woman. \n\nTristan and Kate yelled at Miranda simultaneously. Malia was stunned into silence. Cain simply sat in the chair seemingly unaffected by his own mother's savage outburst against him. \n\nMiranda stood angrily. She turned to Tristan briefly. \"I'm sorry Tristan I hope we can visit soon, just the two of us.\" She said briefly before she left the room. The remaining members of the table sat in silence for a moment. \n\n\"Cain,\" Kate touched his arm comfortingly. \n\nHe smiled weakly in return. \"It's okay. I can handle it. She's right.\" \n\n\"No she isn't.\" Tristan replied vehemently.\n\nMalia didn't want to see this side of Cain's life, not without his permission. It was too raw and vulnerable. She wanted to hit the woman that didn't love this man, her own son, unconditionally like he deserved. She put her hand over his that was resting on his knee under the table. She didn't say anything, she rubbed his large hand with her own and tried to send comfort to him through the small gesture. Eventually the four remaining diners talked about lesser things again, the weather and gossip of the town. Malia had trouble keeping up with the small talk and was mostly quiet throughout the rest of the formal courses. She had finally seen this beautiful brutal beast of a man, she'd seen some of his darkest secrets. Something had happened as she watched him take the unwarranted abuse from his mother. She'd wanted to protect him, not only from Miranda, but from the world in whatever way she could, for the rest of their lives. She knew in that moment as if it were the clearest thing in the world that she had finally fallen over the precipice she'd been flirting with, and there was no returning. She had went and fallen in love with Cain Malcolm. "
