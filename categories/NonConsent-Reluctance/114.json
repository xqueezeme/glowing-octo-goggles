        "Continuity correction: There's a segment of conversation between King Andebert Olbrecht and Orion in Chapter 5 where they ask each other, \"how did you know Queen Estrilda?\" Please assume that bit did not happen and that the two men are aware of the circumstances of each other's familiarity with Queen Estrilda, and that no further information was offered on that subject.\n\n***\n\nHe looked very different.\n\nThat was the first thought that crossed Agatha's mind. His long, shoulder length chestnut hair had been sheared off into a close crop, his face looked gaunt and his eyes were hollowed. He looked less imposing without his brown cloak, more... human. He still looked as handsome as ever and Agatha hated how her heart missed a beat when she saw him. After everything he had done to her, after the lies, the betrayal and the violation of her flesh, she wanted him. No, her body wanted him. There was a difference between the two, she reminded herself.\n\nOrion knelt in front of her and put his arms on either side of her ears, on the pinewood dresser.\n\n\"Have you come to gloat?\" Agatha asked, ignoring the storm of ambivalent emotions inside her chest. Her voice sounded sad and tired in her estimation, reflecting none of the anger that she felt towards him.\n\nOrion shook his head and stared at her with an unfathomable expression. He moved one of his hands and cupped her neck, his thumb caressing her jaw. Agatha slapped it away.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she spat, her anger lending strength to her voice.\n\n\"I came to see you,\" Orion said, his voice low.\n\n\"I'm indeed fortunate that the mighty Azure Rider has decided to grow a conscience,\" Agatha mocked, her anger growing sharply with every passing heartbeat.\n\nOrion smiled faintly. \"I have missed you too,\" he murmured, and tried to touch her cheek. Agatha slapped his hand away and said quietly, \"I'll kill you if you touch me again.\"\n\nOrion sighed and moved his hands away from her. He rose fluidly and said, \"there are some things that you need to know. Please take a seat.\"\n\nAgatha rose and adjusted her chiffon robe self consciously. Her maids now garbed her in it every evening, irrespective of whether Fredenand paid her a visit or not, and with one shoulder bared, she felt woefully uncovered in it in front of Orion.\n\n\"You probably do not care, but I will be in deep trouble if another man is found lurking in my wing. I am being watched and I think it is best if you leave,\" she said, calmly armouring herself with the dignity and propriety that Georgina had inculcated in her this past month.\n\n\"Do not worry,\" Orion said shortly, \"Georgina has assured us of privacy for a while. Sit down.\"\n\n\"Georgina...?\"\n\n\"Speaking of her, please remember to ask her to expose your ears when she does your hair,\" Orion said critically, eyeing the loose fishtail braid that lay swept across one of her shoulders.\n\n\"I cannot understand a word of what you are saying,\" Agatha said firmly, now certain that had taken leave of his senses.\n\nOrion pointed towards the bed in response and drew up a chair for himself. Agatha perched herself at the edge of her bed, pressing her legs primly against one another, confusion and curiosity momentarily overshadowing her anger. Orion took in her person with a preoccupied gaze once she was seated. Agatha twirled her fingers nervously on her lap and kept glancing towards the door of her chamber, terrified that a member of the Sacred Hand, or worse, Prince Fredenand would appear at the doorway any moment.\n\n\"You need to retain your strength if you intend to ride your dragon. The resistance from the wind is quite strong amongst the clouds. Eat more.\"\n\n\"Allow me to inform you of my current predicament,\" Agatha said cuttingly, her anger beginning to return at Orion's clear ignorance and asinine remark. \"Elpis is bound at the top of the Southeastern tower and there's no hope of me ever riding her.\"\n\nHe was quiet for a while. Then he enquired abruptly, \"how did you find Princess Sira?\"\n\n\"I think you should leave,\" Agatha responded coldly. \"I have worked very hard to redeem myself in Fredenand's eyes, and I would not like to fall out of grace with him. For as long as he is alive, anyway.\"\n\nOrion rose from his chair and started pacing restlessly. Then he knelt in front of her and urgently said, \"We do not have very long, but I need you to listen to me. You must not kill Fredenand. We will free Elpis and take you out on the night of the Prince's coronation. You are perhaps not aware but there's scores of guards posted at and near the southeastern tower, making a secret extraction nearly impossible at the moment. However, that will change on the night of the coronation. Guests will arrive from far and wide, from Lohenstraad, Luteri and from the lands beyond the sea, and the guards will be busy elsewhere, particularly as you have seemingly gained the Prince's favour and don't seem inclined to escape. I need you to continue this charade for two weeks, then we will come for you. Listen to Georgina in the meantime, do exactly as she says. She will tell you what to do on the night of the coronation.\"\n\n\"Who's we?\" Agatha asked suspiciously.\n\nOrion paused for a while, smiling a little. Then he said, \"I will return with your father.\"\n\n\"My father is dead, Orion,\" Agatha said slowly. \"Arthur De Clare was killed when-\"\n\n\"Arthur De Clare did not father you,\" Orion said impatiently. \"Your father is one of the fair folk, his name is Finthalion. Charming fellow,\" Orion grimaced, \"as you'll see soon.\"\n\n\"Fair folk?\" Agatha asked.\n\n\"He's an Elf.\"\n\nUnconsciously, Agatha raised her hand to her ears, tracing out the nearly imperceptible point in the otherwise rounded shell. All her life, she had thought that the awkward shape of her ears was due to a congenital defect. Fragments of a conversation with Georgina floated back to Agatha. She had said that her mother had gained the favour of an Elf... an Elf that no one had quite seen...\n\nAgatha stared down at Orion, her mind reeling from the revelation. \"When did you know?\"\n\n\"When I saw your ears,\" Orion said. He started speaking very fast. \"That, and the fact that neither Arthur De Clare nor Estrilda had green eyes, but Finthalion did. Finthalion was smitten by your mother when we arrived here, and ironically we had come here looking for the Chain of Damnation. The Chain of Damnation had been lost in transport between the two Elven territories a long time ago. I met Finthalion during my time with the Elves, and a few years after my return to Lohenstraad he contacted me and said he would be setting out on a quest to find the Chain of Damnation and whether I would like to accompany him up to Regstone. Elves are naturally shy folk, Finthalion even more so, and I think he simply did not feel comfortable walking into a human kingdom without having a human friend to accompany him. I flew up to Deep North, at the edge of the Ancient Forest and met him, and from there we flew to Regstone, looking for it. Incidentally, he rides an Azure Dragon too; Imperial and Azure Dragons live in perfect harmony in the Land of the Fair Folk, and... suffice to say, Elpis is not the first Thistle Dragon to have ever existed. King Olbrecht was then the chief of the Ministerial Council. He invited us graciously inside the Castle, offered us lodging and displayed exemplary hospitality, assuring us that he would do everything in his power to help us find this Chain of Damnation. Little did we know that he had used it to secure Elpis in the Southeastern tower of the very same Castle we were in. My suspicion is that he had used a mage or a witch to cast an Invisibility Spell over Elpis when we were here. After a few weeks, I returned to Lohenstraad. I left Finthalion here. From what I heard later, Finthalion left Regstone soon afterwards and he travelled around the world, looking for the Chain, but he could not find it.\n\n\"The Chain of Damnation can only be opened by an Elf. Since you are half Elven, I had hoped you would be able to open it, but it seems that I am still woefully ignorant of the nature of Elven magic. I will set out for the land of Fair Folk now, and I will return with Fin. If he decides to let me live after this, that is.\" Orion ended his explanation with a grimace.\n\nAn endless string of questions sprang in Agatha's mind, and she decided to ask the easiest one. \"How... won't anyone see Ice if you're here now?\"\n\n\"Siegel is very talented,\" Orion grinned, a familiar twinkle returning to his eyes.\n\n\"What... I don't understand,\" Agatha said faintly. \"There are two Elven territories?\"\n\nOrion rose and cupped Agatha's face in his hands. \"I will explain everything when I return,\" he whispered, his nose nearly touching hers. \"All I want you to do in the meantime is listen to Georgina, build your strength and not kill Fredenand. Please.\"\n\n\"I... okay,\" Agatha said faintly.\n\nOrion kissed her lips, the tip of her nose, then her forehead. \"You need to be brave for just a little longer,\" he whispered fiercely, then released her face and edged towards the open window behind him. \"Remember the hair, it's important,\" he said, before climbing out of the window.\n\nAgatha sat in stunned silence for a very, very long time.\n\n***\n\nThe man with a thousand plans.\n\nThat was what Penelope used to call him, laughing at him whenever he orchestrated elaborate contingencies to prepare for possible eventualities where things would go wrong. Orion felt grim as Ice streaked through the darkness above the twinkling, bustling city of Regstone, feeling more like the man with a thousand terrible plans. Penelope had always ridiculed him for his cautious attention to detail, and it had been caution, or lack thereof, that had taken her away from him. But for all the cautious planning in the world, he had not been able to construct an eventuality where the Disputed Corridor could be recovered without handing Agatha over to the Vandan crown. The only recourse that would have allowed Agatha to escape the cruel fate he had sentenced her to involved informing Finthalion about King Olbrecht's transgressions and allowing him to take the due course of action, but that also meant relinquishing any hope of recovering the Disputed Corridor and wilfully allowing another famine to strike Lohenstraad. For a very long time, Orion had wanted to make that choice. But, much as he tried, he simply had not been able to. He doubted whether he would be able to explain his rationale to Finthalion. People who had not witnessed hunger a day of their lives had a very different way of looking at the world, and Orion had learnt the hard way that even the most compassionate of them were naturally deficient when it came to comprehending choices that were not graced with the same privilege.\n\nAnd thus, he had slaved away, refining the details around a political subterfuge of machiavellian proportions, one that involved handing his woman over to Fredenand Olbrecht in exchange for the Disputed Corridor, and then rescuing her in secret without drawing suspicion to himself, thereby escaping culpability and saving a Treaty that was based on a bare faced lie.\n\nGrimly, he remembered the first time he had noticed her ears; it was shortly after she had lost consciousness on the courtyard in front of the Armoury after wearing herself out in an attempt to save his men. When he had laid her inert form on his bed and tried to move the thick black cloud of hair out of the way so that he could place a pillow underneath her head, he had noticed the unmistakable sharpening of the outer shell at an imperceptible point - a feature that most humans would mistake as a congenital deformity, but Orion had seen it for what it truly was almost immediately.\n\nHis first thought had been to send for Finthalion and reunite him with his daughter and work out a solution which would enable the Thistle Dragon to bond with her Rider. But the threat of winter loomed darkly in front of them, and he knew better than anyone that trouble was brewing in the Vandan borders again. Vampires were migrating to Vandan at an unprecedented rate and their troops posted in the Disputed corridor reported an unnatural influx of enemy soldiers. All of his entreaties to King Egbert to sit for a mature discourse with King Olbrecht had fallen to deaf ears; the man, like all kings before him, had refused to consider a proposition that would injure his overly inflated, misplaced sense of pride.\n\nIt had been the continued reports of empty granaries that had been the feather that had broken the camel's back, and Orion had sent his informers on a quest to bring him information about the handmaid who had escaped with Princess Esmeralda De Clare twenty four years ago. Georgina had been located easily enough; she had been recruited by the Sacred Hand soon after she had entered the services of Queen Consort Estrilda, and convincing her to work for him had proved to be easy. Georgina's unyielding loyalty to a Queen who had been long dead had surprised Orion greatly at the moment, but after he had gotten acquainted with Agatha, her fiercely honorable and tenderly sweet disposition, even and especially at the face of great personal adversity had all but pointed at a similarly endowed parent. It lined up with his initial impression of Estrilda from their short acquaintance so many years ago.\n\nGeorgina had explained to him that she had been assisted by two members of the Sacred Hand in her journey across the Vandan borders with the infant Princess. But then, on a stormy night, their carriage had been ambushed by a band of robbers and Georgina had careened out into the night in a bid to save Agatha. She had left Agatha on the first doorstep that she had seen and had run away in the opposite direction to chase the robbers away from her. When she returned a few days later, she was unable to locate the neighbourhood where she had parted with Agatha, and had spent the intermediate years in absolute misery, eaten alive by the guilt of a mission not completed. The old woman had burst into tears when Orion had informed her that the Princess was alive and well.\n\nAfter handing Agatha over to King Olbrecht, Orion had spent a month with very little occupation to distract him from the constant stream of unpleasant thoughts that pervaded his consciousness. He was a man of action and sitting idle, away from Council duties had only served to amplify his anger and helplessness, yet the charade had been crucial to the next part of his plan and he had had no choice but to stick to it. When Sir Alexander had returned from the Disputed Corridor, unknowingly he had furthered Orion's cause by squandering his reputation as far and wide as possible. Orion had learnt very early in life that contempt was the most easily engendered human response. Contempt bred underestimation, and underestimation often lulled his adversaries into a false sense of security. In this instance, the pretense of slow unraveling served two purposes. On one hand, it accounted for his continued absence from court and council meetings and allowed him to travel back and forth between Regstone and the land of Fair Folks while leaving the general impression that he was mourning in his tower or drinking himself unconscious in a tavern somewhere, one the other hand it lowered any threat he might have posed in the eyes of the innumerable Vandan informers that littered the court. In a way, Orion was grateful to Sir Alexander. The man's insistent slandering expedited the ruse of Orion's slow unraveling, while his general competence ensured that Orion would be able to take a hiatus from his duties without having the army fall apart at his wake. Orion had not corrected Sir Alexander when he had called him lovesick and irresponsible; after all, the most convincing of lies were based on a foundation of truth.\n\nHowever, the most important part of his performance was yet to come, and Orion had plans to carry it out when King Olbrecht inevitably sent his Dragon Riders to Rubenstraad when Princess Esmeralda disappeared. In the meantime, Orion simply prayed that Sir Alexander and Sir Blaxton would not tear each other apart. Both men were pragmatic and competent on their own, however, they were no good when it came to working together, and for as long as Orion could remember, his main function as the General had been to act as a mediator between the two men.\n\nSiegel had been a crucial part of his plan, for while Orion attended to rescuing Agatha, Siegel had constructed a fairly realistic apparition of Ice, presently occupying the top of his tower. Chamber maids were prohibited from entering his tower for the time being, and to every outsider, Orion was recuperating in his tower, willfully distancing himself from society. Jonathan was the only living soul who was aware of the entirety of his schemes.\n\nWhen Orion had narrated Agatha's fate and the motive behind it to Siegel, (conveniently omitting his profoundly personal interest in her) Agatha's erstwhile lover had received the news with surprising equanimity. Orion had chosen to meet him alone at a great risk to his person as Siegel was an exemplary wizard who was more than capable of killing him in the blink of an eye, even with Eustace's ward blocking his way, but Orion was a good judge of character and he had reasoned that Agatha's unyielding loyalty to the boy must have been rooted in firm foundation, and by translation he must be of a reasonably mature, pragmatic disposition. His gamble had paid off and he had returned from the meeting unharmed and with the newly appointed Chief Wardmaker of the Castle in tow (intended to be a replacement for Eustace). Siegel, besides creating an apparition of Ice, had also created a ward for Ice in an impressively short time, one that would keep him invisible as long as he wore it. Orion had been pleased to discover that the shield of invisibility extended to him whenever he was atop Ice, which meant they were presently flying through the clouds unseen like a pair of ghosts. Orion hoped to postpone the inevitable rift that would surface between them, because Siegel Lancelot was skilled, intelligent, useful and most importantly, displayed a degree of sensibility and integrity that was rare at his age. He did not wonder at Agatha's favouritism towards the boy now that he had met him, and he was not eager to have Siegel as an enemy.\n\nWith every aspect of the plan in its place, Orion now turned himself towards the most difficult part of his journey: informing Finthalion that he had fathered a daughter and that Orion had bartered said daughter for a piece of land, handing her over to a man who was infamous for his cruelty.\n\n'I don't want to die,' Ice hummed nervously. 'Two hundred is quite young for a dragon.'\n\nOrion willed himself to relax and reminded Ice that Finthalion owed him his life. Surely he would not kill someone who had saved his life twice? Orion could not be too sure. While Elves were notorious for not meddling in the affairs of humans --they had stayed cruelly aloof when Malthus Vuldrethe had started butchering Azure Riders-- they were also quite well known for protecting their own kin with a fervour that humans seldom displayed.\n\n'We could go to the other Elven territory,' Ice repeated for the thousandth time, 'any Elf can open the Chains of Damnation.'\n\n'The other territory is too far away. We will not be able to return in time for the Prince's coronation,' Orion reminded him again.\n\nAnd thus, they streaked in brooding silence through the pitch black darkness, with little to distract Orion from the memory of her haunted, emaciated frame. When he had given her away, he had been certain that Agatha would never forgive him for what he had done. What he had not foreseen was that he would not be able to forgive himself either.\n\n***\n\nOrion reached the edge of the Ancient Forest five days later. He disembarked from Ice well outside the wooded area, in the middle of the rolling prairie grasslands that stretched southward from the edge of the Forest, and started hiking towards the woods with long, purposeful strides. The Fair Folk lived further north, deep in the bowels of the Ancient Forest. Elves were social creatures, much as humans were, and the most densely populated city of the Elves, Ost-in-Edhil, was a further two days' walk from where Orion was located presently. Orion had learnt during his last sojourn with the Fair Folk that it was considered terrible manners for an outsider to fly directly into Ost-in-Edhil or any of the other Elven hamlets that littered the Ancient Forest. If lady luck favoured him, he would meet one of the Fair Folk inside the Ancient Forest by the next day, and then Orion would be allowed to travel on dragon-back into Ost-in-Edhil with his or her permission, but Orion understood that there was a slim chance of that happening, and had resigned himself to the prospect of hiking through the snow-covered woods for the better part of two days.",
        "Orion pulled the hood of his cloak over his head as the first trees began to appear. The snow under his boots had hardened into a slippery sheet of ice over the last few days and it impeded his progress a little. Orion hoped grimly that there would be fresh snow further north. He was on a tight schedule and could not afford unnecessary delays.\n\nThe bare, snow laden branches of oaks and willows stood silhouetted in eerie silence against the moon-lightened night sky. Orion knew from his last visit that a few miles in, the trees would come alive as he passed underneath them, the spirits of dryads and tree nymphs that resided in them stirring in the presence of a human. The writhing branches were not very pleasant to walk under, as Orion had learnt from experience, and even if he managed to dodge their clumsy swipes, he would surely get deluged in the snow shower that came loose from the flailing branches. For now, the soft whoosh of Ice's wings above the Forest was the only sound that he could hear, but unwilling to take any chances, he wrapped his cloak tightly around himself.\n\nThe dryads, like many other magical creatures that Orion had witnessed over the years he had spent here, avoided travelling southward into the Kingdoms of Lohenstraad and Vandan. They did not like the cold or the long nights of the Ancient Forest any more than he did, but ever since the Great War had started, they had had no choice but to migrate northwards. The constant violence of the war ravaged lands that lay behind him affected the magic inside these creatures, often pushing them over to the side of darkness, though not as frequently as it did that to witches or wizards.\n\nWhenever Orion was alone, like now, his mind travelled back to the source of all misfortunes that had befallen Agatha- the prophecy. He did not know who had truly begun it; in all possibility, it had started as a wild story spun by some lazy crack-peddling tarot card reader in a marketplace somewhere in Vandan nearly seventy years ago, but it had spread like wildfire through idle tavern chatter and general gossip. It spoke of a Thistle Dragon born under the shadow of misfortune, and a fated Rider born in the throes of a civil war. The prophecy proclaimed that when the Thistle Dragon claimed this Rider, the Great War would finally end and a new era of peace and prosperity would begin. When Orion had first heard of this prophecy, he had jokingly asked Ice if he had mated with an Imperial Dragon lately. To his utter horror, Ice had provided him with very gruesome details of his copulation with Ligviette, an Imperial Dragon who was bonded to Petronella Bartholomew. Orion had decided to leave Regstone before anyone discovered what Ice had done, and he had received apoplectic messages from Petronella throughout the next decade, berating him for not being able to keep his dragon under control. The first time Orion had received such a letter, he had responded that Ice was a sentient, powerful being, not a pet as Petronella clearly presumed Ligviette to be, and he had no intention of controlling his actions. He was sincerely sorry for the predicament Petronella found herself in, and was happy to be of service to her in any way to make up for Ice's presumed infraction. Needless to say, it only angered her further and caused her to send a volley of letters and curses wrapped in envelopes for the next decade.\n\nA faint rustling sound interrupted Orion's musings. Warily, he reached for his sword and lowered the hood of his cloak, straining his eyes to spot the intruder through the patchwork of moonlight that filtered through the bare branches overhead. A hooded figure approached him slowly, and Orion relaxed a little, recognizing the graceful gait of an Elf. He raised his hands in front of his face to show that he was unarmed, and for better measure, called out softly, \"I am Orion Lanthechild, son of Gervase Lanthechild and I come in peace.\"\n\nThe Elf stopped in front of him and lowered the hood of her cloak. Lyriel smiled radiantly at him, her porcelain skin shimmering faintly in the light of the moon.\n\n\"I know who you are, Orion,\" she said gently, her soft, husky voice reminding him of times he would much rather forget, \"I am simply surprised to see you here.\"\n\n***\n\nOrion glanced sideways at Lyriel as they walked through the gilded, ornate hallways of Thorondell, the main abode of the Elven Inner Council. The Elves were ruled by a pyramidal democratic system, at the head of which stood the Inner Council, containing seven members. Finthalion, Orion's longtime friend and partner-in-crime, now served as a member of the Inner Council, a fact that did nothing to ease his premonition of an untimely death sentence. Lyriel looked gracefully ageless despite the fact that she was nearing two hundred, and from the little that they had conversed, Orion had learnt that she still worked at the Loom in the eastern fringes of Ost-in-Edhil. He had planned to ask for a cloak for Agatha from someone at the Loom if Finthalion decided to leave him alive after today, however, Orion was not eager to have that particular conversation with Lyriel.\n\nLyriel led Orion into a dome ceilinged, white marbled hall that was empty except for a row of ornately framed, shimmering canvases of artwork on the wall, depicting the history of the Fair Folk.\n\n\"Wait here,\" Lyriel said gently, \"someone will usher you in soon.\"\n\nOrion nodded his thanks and glanced at the door on the far end of the chamber. It was behind that door that the Inner Council convened every fortnight, and since Lyriel had sent word before her about Orion's arrival with intelligence about the Chains of Damnation, the Council had assembled there at an impressively short notice. The double doors opened and Finthalion walked out with his arms spread wide, his woven blue cloak sweeping the white tiles behind him.\n\n\"Welcome my friend,\" he said in his musical, deep voice, a gentle smile on his face affirming the depth of his affections. Elves rarely smiled.\n\n\"You look well, Fin,\" Orion said, then strode towards him and returned the embrace. He followed Finthalion into the Council hall and considered the scene before him, recognizing a few of the faces seated around the burnished, oval table. There was Illimitar Jorieth, his longtime mentor, Almar Zummeris, Lyriel's father, and Elnaril Miralamin, the Rider of the only Malachite Dragon to have ever existed. They nodded and smiled at him, staring back expectantly with alert expressions or steepled fingers.\n\n\"Well, Orion,\" Fin said, assuming his seat by the table. \"Lyriel said that you bring news of the Chains of Damnation.\"\n\nOrion cleared his throat and turned towards Finthalion. \"Yes. It is being used to contain a Thistle Dragon atop one of the towers of the Castle of Regstone. She has been there for nearly sixty years now, which means we were duped when we travelled to Regstone. Incidentally, the Thistle Dragon in question, Elpis, has claimed.... your daughter... as her Rider.\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence across the room at this proclamation.\n\nThen Finthalion raised an eyebrow and said, \"my daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes. Borne by the late Queen Estrilda.\"\n\nThere was a single moment of deathly silence, then Finthalion rose from his seat and strode towards Orion. \"Come with me,\" he said, and marched out of the chamber. Orion followed him, and Illimitar Jorieth swiftly followed both. Finthalion led them to a discreet antechamber some way off from the Council hall. Once Orion and Illimitar entered the room, he shut the door and turned upon Orion, looking agitated and distraught, again, a rare occurrence for Elves.\n\n\"My daughter? Why are you telling me now? Where did you find her? You must take me to her right away, Orion!\"\n\nOrion sighed and rubbed his temple. \"Take a seat,\" he said to Finthalion, and nodded to Illimitar to follow in his example. Illimitar led Finthalion towards a stone-hewn divan by the wall. Illimitar had trained Fin and him together in archery, sword fighting, horse-riding and bodily combat for nearly twenty years, and Orion felt safer with the man present. He cleared his throat and started speaking, leaving nothing except his own relationship with Agatha. He had a suspicion that Finthalion would not be particularly pleased to hear of it. Finthalion's countenance became steadily stonier with every sentence he uttered, and by the end of a quarter of an hour, Orion was certain that he would not leave the place alive.\n\n\"So let me rephrase,\" Finthalion whispered once he had finished speaking, \"you discovered my daughter in a tavern full of men with ill intentions, and instead of informing me of it instantly, kept her like a lamb for slaughter and married her off to a good for nothing fellow against her will to serve your own ends?\"\n\nOrion winced and said, \"that would be the gist of it, yes. Please understand, I had no choice but to--\"\n\n\"YOU HAD NO CHOICE? YOU HAD THE CHOICE OF COMING TO ME, ORION, AND I WOULD HAVE FREED ELPIS FROM THE CHAINS OF DAMNATION INSTANTLY!\" Finthalion rose from his seat and roared at Orion, his face red and his grey eyes stormy. He raised a hand and Orion was thrown backwards against the wooden door behind him, the burnished paneling and two of his ribs cracking simultaneously from the impact. Finthalion raised his hand towards his suspended body and curled his fingers, his face twisted with rage and grief. Orion started to feel his airways choke from Finthalion's curse. Dimly, he heard the pacifying voice of Illimitar trying to dissuade Finthalion from killing his friend. And perhaps, he was successful, for the deathly pressure around Orion's neck eased, and he collapsed onto the ground on all fours, sputtering and wheezing, trying to blink away the white spots that danced at the edge of his vision.\n\nHowever, it seemed that Finthalion had decided that if he could not kill Orion, he would cause him as much pain as humanly possible, for Orion found himself sprawled across the floor from a hard kick in his ribs. Finthalion perched himself on top of him and drew his hand back for a strike.\n\n\"Fin-\" Orion croaked, dimly reflecting that he was the one who had taught Finthalion such an ungracefully human method of sparring. Finthalion, beyond reason, brought his fist down to connect with the side of Orion's face. He did not stop at one blow and Orion made no attempt to stop him even though he could have. By the time Illimitar had pulled Finthalion off of Orion, he was unconscious and his face was mangled beyond recognition.\n\n***\n\nOrion woke up to the soft, soothing hands of Lyriel drawing a damp rag across his face. She gave him an angelic smile as his vision sharpened. Orion realised that he was lying on a cot in an unfamiliar wooden cabin, similar in structure to the one he had occupied for nearly fifty years during his time here.\n\n\"I will never understand Finthalion,\" she sighed, dousing the rag in a bowl of water. \"He is ruled by his anger just as much as a human. His time with the humans has changed him, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" Orion asked.\n\n\"He is setting his affairs in order, with the intent to leave for Regstone as soon as possible,\" Lyriel informed him. Orion made to rise out of the bed.\n\n\"Hush, rest now,\" Lyriel reproved him ever so gently, trying to push him back into the covers. \"Your ribs haven't healed yet.\"\n\n\"Where is he, Lyriel?\" Orion asked again, disregarding her entreaties as well as the sharp stab of pain in his chest.\n\n\"He is in his home, Orion. Illimitar is with him. He is set to accompany Finthalion on his quest.\"\n\nOrion groaned and raised himself from the bed, and ignoring Lyriel's reprimands, shuffled out of the door of the cabin. On the little porch outside, he met with Illimitar, who seemed to have come to meet him.\n\n\"How are you doing?\" Illimitar asked kindly, cocking his head to get a better look at his fading bruises.\n\n\"He can't leave now. Take me to Fin, Illimitar,\" Orion responded with a groan.\n\nThey found Finthalion in his little wooden tree house, located in the middle of an oak grove. Finthalion ignored Orion studiously and turned to Illimitar. \"We don't have long, Illimitar,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Fin, you can't take her out before the Prince's coronation.\" Orion said urgently. \"If you take her out now, there will be utter carnage. There are nearly a hundred guards posted in and near the southeastern tower, and they are all alerted to the possibility of an abduction attempt like this. On the night of the coronation, they will be relocated to keep an eye on the guests that congregate from all over the land, and that is the window of opportunity we must be after. There would be a lesser number of witnesses, less bloodshed, consequently, a slimmer chance of Vandan attributing the blame on me and declaring the Treaty null and void. You must understand, Fin, my involvement in this matter must remain a secret, otherwise we will lose the Disputed Corridor almost certainly.\"\n\nWhen Finthalion spoke, his voice was chilly. \"If you think for a moment that the filthy, lying, scheming humans of your land will adhere to their meaningless declaration of peace when it does not suit their convenience, then you are a bigger fool than I thought, Orion. Despite all of your caution, the Olbrechts will blame you anyway, to save their own faces if for no other reason. \"\n\n\"I know,\" Orion nodded, \"but without a readily available reason, even Fredenand will not be foolish enough to start a battle in the middle of winter. Our men are used to the snow and the wind, their men are woefully deficient in that regard. Once the winter is past, the Thistle Dragon will be reinstated in Lohenstraad and Agatha trained to fight in battle. The Imperial Dragons will not join the war once that happens, because Dragons don't fight their immediate kin. That, coupled with our alliance with the Forgers will ensure that Fredenand will think twice before starting a battle so heavily ill-favoured.\"\n\n\"You think,\" Finthalion whispered, \"that I will let you keep her with you and let her risk her life for worthless, dishonorable humans like yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't think she'll care much for what you or anyone else thinks,\" Orion said mildly, privately impressed by Finthalion's deeply proprietorial regard for a daughter whose existence he had been unaware of a few hours ago. \"And if I remember correctly, the woman you once loved was one of the filthy, dishonorable humans that you seem to detest so much.\"\n\nFinthalion started towards Orion again, and Illimitar stepped swiftly between them.\n\n\"If you take her out now, all of her sufferings will have been for nothing, Fin,\" Orion reminded him.\n\nIt took the better part of an hour to convince Finthalion, and when Orion finally stepped out of the tree house, dawn had broken over the city of Ost-in-Edhil and the birds, fairies and pixies were stirring up quite a racket.\n\n***\n\nAgatha's spirits improved remarkably in the light of the new information that Orion had provided. A tinge of impatience coloured her nightmares now, for even in her sleep she knew that they were not real, and Fredenand's visits were rendered tolerable by the new hope that he would meet his demise fairly soon. The most welcome improvement, however, was in her handmaid's temperament. Georgina went from brusque and cynical to sympathetic and accommodating, offering her stories about her own adventures when she had escaped with Agatha or when she had worked undercover for the Sacred Hand. Agatha's days were no longer spent in bitter loneliness; on most afternoons, she was found listening to her handmaid's stories with rapt attention as Georgina did her hair.\n\nTwo weeks later, on a grey, hazy afternoon, under the shadow of a sprawling, gnarled oak tree, Agatha read her wedding vows to Prince Fredenand in front of a pot-bellied dome-headed high priest. King Olbrecht watched from afar with tearful eyes and Princess Sira scowled at them from his side, palpably uncomfortable in a whale bone corset and a flowing, jewel-encrusted red silk dress. Prince Fredenand was gentle and reverential to her that night, and Agatha nearly regretted putting the consumption curse on him a few days ago. After he finished, he pulled out of her and said that she wasn't half bad for one who had lost her maidenhood a while ago and Agatha's regret dissipated quickly.\n\nThe day of Prince Fredenand's coronation dawned grey and murky and despite the weather, Agatha felt shamelessly cheerful. She had thrown herself into her horse-riding lessons with Princess Sira for the past two weeks and her arms and torso were beginning to feel strong and supple again. When she sank into her bathwater late that afternoon, the unceasing patter of raindrops on the tiled roof above her chamber soothed her soul, and freedom felt so close that she could almost taste it in the damp, salty air.\n\nGeorgina took over her preparations for the coronation ceremony after she stepped out of her bath. Once all the other handmaids were successfully shooed out of her wing, Georgina dressed her in a chemise, then a heavy, suffocating whale bone corset, then another equally heavy woven red dress, studded with precious gems from the Forgers' Mountain. She completed her attire with a stiff cloak fastened at her neck, and Agatha, now feeling distinctly bad-tempered from the heat and humidity, tried to pry her legs open. They stood firmly clamped together from the layers of fabric swathed around them.\n\n\"How am I supposed to ride in this?\" She whispered desperately.\n\n\"Hush,\" Georgina said, \"I will change you into breeches before the time arrives.\" She directed Agatha to sit in her chair before the mirror, and while weaving her hair into an intricate web of braids, patiently explained her due course of action that evening.\n\n***\n\nPrince Fredenand's coronation was the grandest affair Agatha had ever witnessed in her life. It outdid the celebratory feasts in the Great Hall of the Rubenstraad Castle, the song and dance ceremonies held yearly in memory of the assassinated Prince Elrond, even the birthday celebrations of their own crown prince, Tristan Constantine. Nobles and high born lords came from all over the continent, the delegations from Rubenstraad clad in dour furs and leather (and sweating profusely in them), the nobles from Luteri in colourful robes cinched with embellished cummerbunds, lords from across the South Sea wearing luridly coloured, jewel-encrusted turbans and long, shimmering robes with intricate golden thread work. Agatha recognised Lord Archibald Mannering and Lord Algernon Rhynster in the Rubenstraad delegation; they stared inquisitively at her whenever they crossed paths, but Agatha was not brave enough to do anything more than offer them a tentative smile.\n\nThe food was more extravagant and diversified than anything Agatha had ever seen; vividly coloured exotic fruits were artfully arranged on silver platters, herb-roasted cheese-crusted lamb, chicken and partridge swam in thick, delectable gravy and fountains of mead, mulberry gin and red wine were placed every so often along the long tables.\n\nThe rites for the Coronation were over shortly, and Prince Fredenand, now standing tall and proud under the weight of the heavy, intricate crown atop his brow, joined the celebrations enthusiastically. Agatha kept adjusting the simple golden circlet wrapped around her braids and smiled vapidly as a seemingly endless queue of delegates offered her gifts and their compliments. She apologized for her husband's conspicuous absence from the throne beside her and ardently wished they would enjoy their stay in Regstone. The men walked away full of enthusiastic praises about the grace and the beauty of the new queen, and unanimously proclaimed that Fredenand was a very lucky man indeed. Then they immersed themselves in appreciating the food and the drink and the scantily clad curvaceous serving girls who sashayed past with laden platters and all thoughts of the new queen were hastily obliterated from their minds.",
        "The only exception to this was naturally, the Rubenstraad delegation, who came with the most expensive gifts of all, and lingered for the longest in front of her raised dais, proclaiming repeatedly that they aimed to be of service to her and would only be a missive away should she ever need them. She may be a De Clare Princess, but Rubenstraad was, after all, her real home, they said, and entreated her to look upon them as her kin. Archibald Mannering held her hand and kissed it, going so far as to proclaim that had he been aware of the existence of such a beautiful woman in their kingdom he would not have stayed unwed for so long. This statement, whispered theatrically for the benefit of the Rubenstraad delegation drew titters from the intended audience. Agatha responded to him graciously and privately thanked her lucky stars for not catching the eye of the strapping young man in front of her, and chose not to remind him that he, in fact, had met her about seven months ago, when she had been summoned to his manor to tend to a half conscious, bruised and beaten Lyla.\n\nA few hours later, when the guests and the hosts were sufficiently drunk and most of the serving girls had been drawn into the lap of an inebriated man somewhere in the room, Agatha raised her eyes and roved her gaze around the hall. The guards stood sentry around the exits of the hall and by the edge of the walls, keeping a sharp eye on the festivities, intent on preventing any unpleasant incident before it happened. Agatha wondered vaguely what would count as an unpleasant incident in their eyes; as far as she could see, a serving girl, stripped to her skin, was being passed from one lap to another. She grasped the edge of the table as the men impaled her on their cocks repeatedly, her eyes beginning to glaze over. She moaned dramatically, but Agatha could tell that it was fake and it was highly likely that she felt nothing at all by that point. The rest of the men laughed and egged on whoever had his turn with the girl, and no one seemed to care enough to interfere.\n\nAgatha rose abruptly from her throne and made towards the nearest doorway, unable to take it any longer. When she was stopped at the exit by the two guards manning it, she said cuttingly, \"I would like to retire to my bedchamber now. I don't think this is a place for ladies any more.\" They uncrossed their bars wordlessly and bade her good night after that. Agatha careened blindly through the hallways, her tears blurring her vision and arrived at the small antechamber Georgina had directed her to go to earlier that afternoon. She found Georgina waiting inside with a complete set of breeches, a shirt and riding boots. Georgina undid Agatha's layers of clothing in record time and Agatha pulled on the breeches, delighting in the renewed ability to fill her lungs with air.\n\nOnce they were done, Georgina opened the other door on the opposite wall of the antechamber. Orion stood outside, his face again shadowed by the hood of the brown cloak despite the hot and humid weather. He nodded briefly at Georgina and stretched his hand out towards Agatha.\n\n***\n\nAgatha barely felt anything when Orion wrapped a cloak around her shoulders and sealed a leaf-shaped clasp at the base of her neck. Her mind was far away, concentrating on Elpis, scanning the inky skyline of Regstone through her eyes. A tall, pale man with pointed ears and silver hair was chanting in an unintelligible language at Elpis's feet, holding her manacles in his palms, while another man, not as tall, but with similarly pale and delicate features watched cautiously from afar. The manacles glowed sliver-green for a few moments, then they fell open.\n\n\"Orion,\" Agatha said softly as he nearly dragged her through the deserted hallways, \"she's free. Elpis is free.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Orion said shortly. \"Faster, Agatha.\"\n\nAgatha concentrated on running then, on putting one leg in front of another, her heart hammering in her chest, more from restlessness and apprehension than the exertion of running. Orion brought her out into a sheltered courtyard through an unguarded set of double doors. He did not relinquish his vice grip on her hand as he sprinted out into the courtyard, his hand stretched out in front of him. Then he skidded to an abrupt halt and Agatha ran into his back, face first.\n\n\"Ow,\" she gasped, rubbing her nose, which had taken the brunt of the impact. She extricated her face from the folds of his cloak and gasped again. Where there had been nothing but thin air before, Ice stood with his wings half unfurled, his black eyes staring at her with evident amusement.\n\n\"How, what...\"\n\n\"Siegel,\" Orion responded shortly. Scooping her up in one of his arms, he climbed atop Ice, hastily drawing Agatha's legs on either side of the saddle in front of him. Ice unfurled his giant wings and took flight, the motion eliciting a very ungraceful exclamation from Agatha as she was thrown backwards against Orion's chest. Within a few heartbeats they were up amongst the low clouds that had been looming threateningly over Regstone all day. Agatha pulled the hood of her cloak above her head, faintly reflecting that the material of the cloak was finer and softer than anything she had ever known, but her mind was quickly occupied by more pressing thoughts.\n\nElpis was now flying across the clouds beside them, and behind him rode two Elves, one riding an Imperial Dragon, the other riding an impossibly large Azure Dragon. Ice seemed dwarfed in comparison to this new Azure Dragon. Agatha realized with a stab of disappointment that she would not be riding Elpis, not on this journey anyway.\n\n\"Who's the other one?\" she turned around and enquired of Orion, nearly shouting over the wind. A ribbon of lightning split the sky in half beside them, and Agatha jumped so badly that she nearly slipped from the saddle.\n\n\"Shh, it's alright. The other one is Illimitar Jorieth,\" Orion responded, wrapping a steel arm around Agatha's torso and pulling her more securely against his chest. \"Did anyone see you leave?\"\n\nAgatha waited for the clap of thunder to pass before answering. \"Yes, two guards. I told them that I was going to my wing, as Georgina told me to.\"\n\n\"Good girl,\" Orion said, resting his chin on top of her head, his thumb drawing soothing circles over the fabric of the cloak on her forearm. Agatha allowed herself to relax against him and mingled her consciousness with Elpis's, both of them savouring the taste of freedom.\n\n***\n\nThey landed on a patch of deserted prairieland after an hour of flying. Elpis had not flown a day since she was born and quickly tired of the long flight. Orion, Illimitar and Finthalion landed in quick succession behind Elpis once she made it clear that she was desperate for some rest. Ice disappeared from view as soon as they disembarked from him. Agatha lowered the hood of her cloak and turned nervously towards the two Elves, squinting at the one Orion had said was her father.\n\nFinthalion was taller than Orion, with long, graceful white limbs. His silver hair cascaded down to his shoulders and his large almond eyes appeared nearly dark in the dim light of the moon. Agatha fancied that he would have her eyes, green, but flecked with blue as a sign of his bond with his dragon. Illimitar Jorieth was shorter and stockier in stature, though he was nearly as tall as Orion, and had dark, wavy hair. Though none of the men had any of the telltale signs of degeneration to give their ages away, Illimitar's movements were graced by the assured calmness that age and experience often brought. Agatha felt properly dwarfed amongst the three men and the dragons.\n\nFinthalion strode towards her in lithe, fluid steps and knelt down before Agatha. He reached for her face with his hands and whispered, \"you look just like her.\"\n\nAgatha, who had heard this too often in recent times, barely nodded, avidly scrutinizing his strange porcelain skin and fine hair.\n\n\"We don't have long, onya,\" he said again, smoothing his palm over her hair, \"but I am so very proud of you. Orion will take you somewhere safe, and I will come for you after we have dealt with King Olbrecht.\"\n\n\"What will you do with King Olbrecht?\" Agatha asked, her voice sounding unnaturally high after his deep, musical voice.\n\nIllimitar strode towards them. \"King Olbrecht stole an ancient Elven artifact and deceived Finthalion intentionally when he went looking for it afterwards. Thievery is a crime punishable by death in Ost-in-Edhil.\"\n\n\"You'll kill him?\" Agatha asked.\n\n\"Yes, onya, it is what happens to people who steal ancient magic,\" Finthalion said. \"Illimitar and I shall travel to Ost-in-Edhil now and we shall return with the Elven guards soon. Andebert Olbrecht will be tried and executed in the High Court of Ost-in Edhil. You must stay with Orion until that matter is sorted, then I shall return for you and take you home. You will be trained in the Elven ways and you shall want for nothing for the rest of eternity. We do not have hunger in Ost-in-Edhil, nor do we have the senseless violence that rents your human world apart. It's a peaceful, beautiful place, teeming with the magic of nature. You will love it there.\"\n\nAgatha stared back at Finthalion, neither confirming nor denying his assumption. Orion shifted slightly at her side.\n\n***\n\nOrion brought her to a deserted cabin in the middle of a wooded area at the northern edge of the Great Plains. He carried her in his arms over the doorstep despite her protests and laid her down on a bed.\n\n\"Get some rest,\" he said, drawing the blankets over her. \"There's extra breeches in the closet and food on the table outside. I will be back soon.\"\n\nHe knelt down in front of the fireplace, which stood ready with fresh logs piled inside. He kindled a roaring fire, then glanced back at her. He seemed to hesitate for a moment, then he approached the side of her bed and planted a quick kiss on her forehead over the golden circlet. Then he was gone.\n\n***\n\nIce took less than an hour to streak across the Great Plains to Rubenstraad. Orion could feel the searing pain in his shoulders and flight muscles through the clairvoyant bond between them by the time he landed on the top of the Azure Tower. After muttering a soft word of thanks, Orion made short work of untying the ward from Ice's leg; Siegel had done away with the apparition a few minutes before, coordinating with his arrival with an impressive punctuality.\n\n'They are not here yet, but I can sense two Imperial Dragons drawing closer to Rubenstraad,' Ice informed him as Orion ran down the steps of his tower, skipping two at a time. 'Aaaah.... Ligviette is here,' Ice thought dreamily. Orion grimaced involuntarily. He was not looking forward to meeting Petronella. She had been a formidable woman even before Orion, or rather, Ice had given her a reason to detest him.\n\nOrion marched into his bedchamber, shed his flying garb quickly and hung them behind all other clothes in his closet, then seized a sleeping robe from another rack and rushed into the privy chamber. He cursed silently when he saw his face in the mirror adjacent to a wash basin; he looked grimy and windswept while he should have looked languorously unkempt for the little performance that was to follow.\n\n'Ah... they have landed in front of the Keep. It's Petronella and her husband Williamson, and Petronella looks very, very angry.'\n\n'Keep talking,' Orion thought, splashing water on his face and wiping it clean with a towel. It was not perfect, but there was no time for a bath. He wrapped the robe around himself and cinched the silk sash around his midsection.\n\n'Take off your shoes,' Ice reminded him. Orion kicked off his riding boots and slid into a pair of slippers. He cleaned the mingled mud and snow from the soles of the boots and stashed them inside his closet. Then he rushed out of the privy and ran his eyes around his bedchamber. Jonathan had laid out the set faithfully; half empty liquor bottles were strewn around his bedchamber, not enough to account for shoddy housekeeping, but enough to create the impression of a slowly unraveling, drunken man. Orion snatched one of the bottles from his nightstand, uncorked the top and sniffed inside.\n\n'They are inside now... Henry Baldric is talking with them, repeatedly assuring them that you had nothing to do with the Thistle Princess's abduction. He is now describing your sorry state to the two... I can hear Sir Alexander and Sir Blaxton chiming in... and now they have decided to pay you a visit because they don't believe Henry Baldric.'\n\nOrion raised the bottle and took a gulp, letting a little of the liquor dribble down the front of his robes. He wiped his chin on his shoulder, internally blessing the ephemerality of mortal memories. Had he pulled this little stunt amongst Elves, he would not have ever rebuilt his reputation. There was a sharp gong from the front door as someone rapped the dragon shaped door knocker on the wood. Orion stashed the ward of invisibility into one of the beaurus of his desk and waited. Soon enough, Petronella's shrill voice sliced through the sombre silence of the Azure Tower.\n\n\"Where is he? I want to see him right now!\"\n\n'Good luck,' Ice whispered in his mind as Orion shuffled towards the door of his bedchamber and stumbled down the steps, liquor bottle dangling from one hand, eyes unfocused and his countenance happily vacant.\n\n\"Who is it, Jonathan?\" He slurred as he reached the foot of the stairs. Petronella and Williamson Bartholomew stood closest, while Henry Baldric, Sir Blaxton and Sir Alexander lingered by the entrance to the visitor hall. Sir Alexander was eating an apple with an expression of mingled contempt and satisfaction on his face, Henry Baldric looked scandalized and Sir Blaxton simply looked disappointed.\n\n\"Petronella!! It's so nice of you to visit!!\" He smiled amiably with the happy abandon of a drunkard.\n\nWilliamson rushed upstairs past him without waiting for his permission. Orion smiled again, blinking stupidly at Petronella. \"So, what brings you here today, madam?\"\n\nPetronella laughed disdainfully. \"There was a time when I used to respect you, Orion. Sir Alexander was right. You seem to have lost your touch.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Orion said amiably. \"Now, what brings you here today?\"\n\nPetronella seemed to think that he did not deserve the compliment of a rational response. Sir Alexander drawled, \"apparently Aga... er, Princess De Clare was abducted from her bedchamber earlier tonight. If the handmaids are to be believed it was the work of Elves. Unfortunately one of those Elves rode an Azure Dragon, so you are now suspected of masquerading as an Elf and abducting the Queen Regent of Vandan. Obviously, since you cannot stand straight and possibly cannot process this conversation, we told them that there's no chance that you were behind it. But Lady Bartholomew insisted on checking.\"\n\n\"Elves?\" Orion asked dimly. \"I thought they didn't leave the Ancient Forest! Charming chaps...\" he smiled dreamily.\n\n\"Didn't you come to Regstone looking for some artifact with an Elf twenty six years ago? Mighty shy person, I remember. Refused to meet the Dragon Council.\" Petronella said, clearly still troubled by that perceived slight.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" Orion said cheerfully, \"Finthalion. Nice fellow. Was smitten by Queen Estrilda I believe but who wasn't? Even King Olbrecht was infatuated by her from what I hear.\" He waved the hand carrying the bottle for added effect and sloshed some gin onto the carpet.\n\nHenry Baldric looked like he dearly wished to dig a hole in the ground and disappear inside. However, Sir Blaxton, Sir Alexander and Petronella were all staring at him with cautiously controlled expressions. Orion felt a grim satisfaction as panic began to overshadow the anger on Petronella's face.\n\n\"We are in deeper trouble than we thought, then,\" Williamson said from the top of the staircase. He nodded wearily towards Petronella. \"They weren't lying, sweetheart. She isn't here and Orion has clearly been drinking himself to damnation for a very long time now.\"\n\n\"I knew it!!!\" Petronella whispered agitatedly. \"I told you that her ears looked strange, you laughed at me then! You never listen to me Will, this is all your fault!\"\n\n\"Yes of course, my love,\" Williamson said meekly. His love wrung her hands restlessly and said, \"Elves copulating with humans is practically unheard of... but if we kept the Dragon of an Elfling captive...\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't you release the Dragon once Esmeralda reached Regstone?\" Orion asked, his brow furrowed in deep concentration.\n\n\"The dratted chains would not open,\" Petronella said impatiently, then turned to Williamson and continued, \"we have to return immediately and organize our...\"\n\n\"Hold on...\" Orion interrupted her with the outlook of a dim man trying very hard to concentrate, \"Finthalion was searching for the Chains of Damnation when he went to Regstone...I believe it's an ancient Elven artifact that was traditionally used to secure only the most difficult prisoners...\"\n\nResisting the urge to laugh at the expression of stunned horror on Petronella and Williamson's faces, Orion squinted fiercely at the ground, as though trying to remember something, then shrugged and said amicably, \"well, can't remember what else he said about the Chains of Damnation... perhaps Sir Alexander is right, I am indeed growing too old.\"\n\n'Careful,' Ice cautioned him. 'Do not patronize them.'\n\nPetronella threw him one last dirty look and stormed out of the tower. Williamson followed her. Henry Baldric scampered after them, asking whether the terms of the Treaty would still be upheld since Lohenstraad clearly played no part in the Queen Regent's abduction. Sir Blaxton threw Orion an outraged glance and hurried after him. Orion heard Petronella's arrogant, disdainful tone from afar: \"You may keep the Disputed Corridor. Clearly, you need it more than we do.\"\n\nHowever, once the room was empty, Sir Alexander edged towards Orion with a carefully inscrutable face. Then, quick as lightning, he hurled the half eaten apple in his hand towards Orion's head. Orion's reflexes gave him away at this crucial juncture, he stepped aside with an alacrity that clearly proved that he was not under the influence of liquor, and the apple sailed harmlessly past his nose, hitting the wooden banister of the spiral staircase behind him. Sir Alexander advanced closer with a maniacal gleam in his eyes.\n\n\"I knew it,\" he whispered. \"I don't know how you did it, Orion, but that little rescue has your signature all over it. Petronella or Williamson may not see it, but I have worked alongside you for far too long not to.\"\n\nOrion remained silent.\n\n\"Be very careful, Orion,\" Sir Alexander continued, \"your obsession with that witch is dangerously clouding your judgement. You should have left her alone. They may not be able to prove your involvement with her escape, but it will not stop Fredenand from declaring war against us once spring arrives.\"\n\nWhen Orion spoke, his voice was perfectly level. \"You should not waste food like that, Sir Alexander. We paid too hefty a price for that apple.\"\n\nSir Alexander nodded at him once, then turned around abruptly and left in a swish of cloak. Orion closed one of the panels of the double doors, Jonathan took care of the other.\n\n\"I must say, master,\" Jonathan offered him a toothless grin as he pushed the bolts back into place, \"you are in the wrong line of employment.\"\n\nOrion volunteered a wan smile in response. It had been a very long night.\n\n***\n\nAgatha awoke in the early hours of dawn to the racket of birds. For a few moments she lay immobile under the sheets, her heart hammering in her chest from an unnamed terror, then comprehension caught up with her senses and she realized that she was not in Regstone anymore. As her heart started to slow down and relief flooded through her limbs she stopped gasping like a drowning person. She rose from the bed and plodded into the privy, barely recognizing the woman that stared back at her from the cracked mirror. Her face was still caked in the shimmery powder and the cheek tint Georgina had put on her last night, and the accursed circlet still sat firmly atop her brows.",
        "Agatha set about divesting herself of the crown, losing a sizable chunk of hair in her haste, and nearly threw it down the privy. But then, her newly discovered circumspect self caught up with her and she laid it down by the sink, intending to return it to Sira when opportunity presented itself. Agatha started scrubbing her face methodically to wash off the last remnants of the vile paint that she had started to associate with royalty and lies. Once she felt reasonably clean, Agatha busied herself in inspecting the cloak Orion had put around her last evening. It was made of a shimmery green woven fabric, and it flowed between her fingers like an unearthly liquid. The cloak sat around her shoulders in a snug fit, as though it had been expressly tailored for her, and despite the fineness of the cloth, it was deceptively warm. In fact, it was warmer than anything Agatha had previously worn. Suddenly she was certain that the cloak was of a magical origin.\n\nThe longer Agatha stayed, the worse her dread seemed to grow. Orion had said that he would be back soon, and she had no intention of waiting for his return. She reached out for Elpis with her mind, and found her soaring joyously over the woods that surrounded them. The woods grew around and into little farm houses similar to the one she was presently in, and Elpis's expanded view offered Agatha clarity: she was possibly in Orion's childhood home, in the northern fringes of the Great Plains, like Fred Webster had mentioned.\n\n'Come down here,' Agatha called out with her mind. Elpis folded her wings into her torso and glided into a nosedive. Once she landed in front of the house, Agatha marched out and clambered onto her back, huffing and slipping ungraciously. The biting cold numbed her fingers and did not help her cause, but a forceful desire to escape propelled her to overcome any hindrances that nature offered.\n\nHowever, once she was settled over Elpis's back, Agatha winced painfully. Elpis's scales were deceptively sharp and it felt like sitting on a bed of blunt, old daggers. Elpis chortled.\n\n'Are you sure you don't want to wait for a saddle, little one?'\n\nAgatha reached out and seized one of the burnished wedges that ran down along Elpis's spine. 'No,' she thought firmly. 'Take me to Rubenstraad.'\n\n***\n\nIn hindsight, their journey had been doomed from the beginning. Barely an hour had passed before the pain in Elpis's flight muscles was too sharp to bear. Agatha's leather breeches were torn asunder from the repeated chafing against the scales and Elpis's back was soon slick with her own blood. Belatedly, Agatha realized that riding a Dragon was not as easy as she had presumed and that there had been considerable truth in Orion's warning about wind resistance. Just as horse riding, it was a skill meant to be developed with time and patient practice.\n\nElpis touched down in a deserted, treeless part of the Great Plains where the land stretched out monotonously on all sides. Fortunately, the snow had thawed around this part of Lohenstraad and Agatha crawled under one of Elpis's wing, resisting the urge to whimper as her wounds healed themselves. The sun hung low over the horizon and the prospect of being lost in the darkness loomed terrifyingly at the edge of her consciousness. Agatha cursed the shortening length of the day and conjectured hopefully that between the heat radiating from Elpis and her ostentatious, magical cloak, she would probably survive the night.\n\n'Do not worry,' Elpis said, drawing her closer to her heated midsection, 'someone is coming.'\n\n'A shepherd?' Agatha asked hopefully.\n\n'No,' Elpis thought cheerfully, and through her superior vision Agatha could see the tiny blue speck on the horizon.\n\n\"Please no,\" Agatha groaned audibly and buried her face in the grass, huddling closer to Elpis as though hoping to become invisible in comparison.\n\nOrion did not speak as he disembarked from Ice and knelt in front of her. Agatha stayed curled up in a ball for as long as she dared, then without looking at him, repeated a question she had asked a few days ago.\n\n\"Have you come to gloat?\"\n\nOrion did not answer, so she raised her head and sought his face, and discovered that he was struggling to contain a smile.\n\n\"Where were you trying to go?\" He asked.\n\n\"Rubenstraad.\"\n\n\"Well, you seem to have traveled a hundred miles in the opposite direction. You would have crossed the borders of Vandan in another hour or so,\" Orion supplied helpfully, abandoning all efforts to hide his smirk. \"It appears that Elpis is as directionally challenged as you are.\"\n\nElpis snarled at him.\n\n\"I wonder,\" Agatha said cuttingly, \"if Elpis bites your head off at this moment, will you die or will your body grow a new head?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" Orion winced. \"I do not wish to recount that experience.\"\n\n\"Please remind me to offer my commendations to the person or creature that attempted this.\"\n\n\"You can't, he's dead.\"\n\nAgatha sighed and rose from the bed of grass to sit on her haunches. Orion noticed the sorry state of her breeches and kindly offered, \"why don't you allow me to take you back to the farm so that you may rest and I can make a saddle for Elpis? You need to stay hidden for a few days and I... owe you an explanation. After that, you may go wherever you please and I shall not attempt to change your mind.\"\n\n\"I will not go anywhere with you, Orion.\"\n\nOrion untied the ward from his wrist and pitched it towards Agatha, who caught it, surprised. She had never seen him without the ward.\n\n\"To be clear, please do not lose that, as Eustace is indisposed and I do not have an easy way of replacing it. Now, will you please come with me?\"\n\nAgatha pocketed the ward and allowed Orion to lead her towards Ice.\n\n***\n\nIn the subsequent days Agatha discovered a different side to Orion, which, though did not redeem his actions in her eyes, elicited an understanding of them. He spent most of his waking hours in the shed adjacent to the house, working on carving out a saddle with his father's tools. He obtained the wood from a cedar tree that he had felled the day after their arrival. When Agatha wondered at his dexterity in woodwork, Orion informed her that he had been training to be a carpenter under his father's tutelage when Ice found him. Even after Ice claimed him, he had continued to stay with his family and help out in his father's trade, and when he grew frail, Orion had spent a considerable number of years in the profession to keep his family afloat.\n\n\"Did you make these?\" Agatha asked, clearing cobwebs from multiple wooden sculptures of eagles and owls, and one impressively lifelike rendition of Ice.\n\n\"Yes,\" Orion admitted sheepishly. \"That is where my creative streak ends, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Orion, these are... beautiful,\" Agatha said, unable to mask the awe in her voice.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it's all pretty, but art does not put food on the table,\" Orion said impatiently, rhythmically tapping the end of a broad bladed iron chisel with a mallet. \"Why don't you chop up some firewood for tonight?\"\n\nWhen he was not working in the shed, he cooked for the two of them, and at night, he stretched out on a spare mattress by the fireside, leaving Agatha alone in the bed. On the nights when sleep eluded her, Agatha peeked at him from under the covers, drawing comfort from the familiarity of his sleeping form, at the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest. It was on these nights that she had to battle with herself to keep from curling up against him, the way she used to back in the camp in the Disputed Corridor. She remembered how she had fancied with the overactive imagination of a na\u00efve young woman that one day, he would wake up and decide to keep her with him forever, that he would perhaps marry her like Penelope. Agatha curled her fingers around the mason jar she had procured from the kitchen and resisted the urge to laugh when this memory occurred. She could not recognize that woman anymore; their time spent at the camp seemed like a distant, ill-formed nightmare, and the childlike, insecure woman once infatuated with the seemingly great, faultless Azure Rider had faded away into oblivion over the course of the past month. Instead, Agatha now saw him for what he truly was, a faulted, lonely human who simply tried to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nOn the third day, Orion explained the rationale behind his decision to hand her over to Fredenand. They had hiked to the top of the little hill behind the farmhouse and Orion talked for nearly an hour while the sun dipped behind the leafless trees in the horizon. Agatha listened calmly, already having gathered most of the information herself during the past month, but she sensed that the explanation was more for his catharsis than for her enlightenment. The information about Siegel was the only part of his plan that she had not already known, and she was not pleased at the prospect of having to face him so soon.\n\n\"I do not expect your forgiveness, Agatha,\" Orion said quietly in the end. \"But it is my responsibility to see you through the aftermath of the traumatic events that I put you through, and I would be grateful if you allow me to do that.\"\n\nHe was referring to an episode the night before where Agatha had woken up screaming and flailing in her bed, her heart hammering and her body drenched in cold sweat. The shivering and the palpitations had continued for a while after she woke up, and Agatha would not allow him near her at that state, sobbing hysterically if he came too close. In the end, Orion had knelt at the foot of her bed and had entreated her to breathe through her nose, and had counted for her benefit while she did it. This slowed her heart and the pressure on her chest eased up, and it was a while before either of them fell asleep again. Orion had kept her busy with menial, physically demanding tasks for the most part of the morning, determined to wear her out so that another incident like that did not happen. Even after she had chopped firewood for lunch and drawn water from the well, he had not been satisfied, and had dragged her along on a hike to the top of the hill behind the farm.\n\nAgatha learnt why the houses around them seemed deserted and overgrown over dinner that night. Orion explained that the people of his village had migrated to the nearest town looking for work when crops failed during the last famine, and they had not returned since. He had continued to return to his home sporadically, when the proceedings in Rubenstraad grew to be too exhausting for him, and had worked on keeping the forest from encroaching on the house during those visits. Agatha fell asleep on the table soon afterwards, worn out from the exhaustion of the day, and when she woke up in her bed the next morning, she felt better rested than before. Of course, Orion pulled the blankets off from her when she attempted to snuggle in for a little longer and virtually pushed her into the privy to ready herself for another day of back-breaking work.\n\nAt Orion's behest, Agatha wrote a letter to Sira, confirming what the maids and guards in Regstone on Orion's payroll (which tallied up to an impressive number, to the extent that Agatha was forced to ask where Orion was procuring the coin to maintain such an elaborate network of spies) had already been saying: that she had been rescued by two Elves, one riding an Azure Dragon and the other an Imperial Dragon, and that her father was an Elf named Finthalion and she had no intention of returning to Regstone. She enclosed the circlet with the letter and Orion travelled on Ice's back to a town considerably far away from their present location and to post it.\n\nOver dinner the next day, Agatha asked him about her parents.\n\n\"What do you want to know?\" Orion asked, picking at his salted fish and scratching his jaw in a preoccupied manner.\n\n\"How did they meet?\"\n\nOrion smiled and started talking.\n\n\"Fin and I went to Regstone looking for the Chains of Damnation twenty six years ago, as you already know by now. We stayed in one of the guest wings of the castle, and Queen Estrilda insisted on meeting the new guests when she learnt of our arrival. At first, Fin wouldn't; he was very shy of humans at that point, but then, at Andebert Olbrecht's entreaties, he agreed, and Queen Estrilda came to visit us. The idiot gaped at her like a blowfish,\" Orion grinned, \"and when Estrilda asked him his name, he stammered and said, 'You're very beautiful,' and subsided into an embarrassed silence. We were supposed to leave Regstone the day after, but Fin insisted on staying, and I had no business meddling in the affairs of a love struck Elf. It was winter and I was in no hurry to return to Lohenstraad either, you see, so I stayed with him, enjoying somewhat of a little vacation away from the snow and the wind.\n\n\"Two weeks later, he walked into my chamber, looking stricken and angry. He said that he had asked Estrilda to return with him to Ost-in-Edhil, and she had refused. He asked me to talk with her to see if I could change her mind, since I was the only human to have resided in Ost-in-Edhil until then. Accordingly, I visited your mother.\"\n\nHere, Orion paused to drink some water.\n\n\"What did she say?\" Agatha asked.\n\n\"When I tried to tell her about the virtues of the land of the Fair Folk, she asked, 'well, then, why did you leave?' and to that, I answered that I had shirked my responsibilities for long enough and wished to resume my duties in Rubenstraad. To this, she smiled sadly and said, 'then why can't you understand why I want to stay? Is it so difficult to imagine the same reason for me because I am a woman? If I leave now, there won't be anyone to carry on my responsibilities.' I had no answer to that, and left for Rubenstraad soon afterwards.\"\n\nOrion paused for a while and asked, \"have you given any thought to whether you will go to Ost-in-Edhil with Fin when he returns?\"\n\nAgatha did not answer his question, instead she asked, \"what does the land of the Fair Folk look like?\"\n\n\"It is quite beautiful,\" Orion nodded, \"Finthalion had not been exaggerating that. The woods are alive with dryads and tree nymphs, so if you go very near a tree, you might receive a playful swipe by a branch. The Ancient Forests are teeming with magical creatures: fauns, pixies, unicorns, you name it. But the best part of the Land of the Fair Folk is up in the skies. During the long winter nights, the skies pulsate with green, red and purple streaks of light. The Elves call them the Dancing Lights. No one quite knows what causes it to happen, the Elves claim it's a magic of a superior origin to theirs, some say it is from other-worldly beings.\"\n\nThey finished their dinner in silence afterwards, each immersed in their own thoughts.\n\nBetween spending time with Elpis and getting used to this strange new way of life, Agatha did not have much time to devote to her thoughts, and for that she was grateful, because they often wandered to a place where Agatha's conscious mind, with its newfound dignity, did not permit her to travel. Orion stayed uncharacteristically aloof physically, and this surprised her because he had never been able to keep his hands off from her when they had been together. Perhaps it was his way of apologizing to her for his past behaviour, she reasoned, perhaps he simply did not care for used goods, or perhaps he was afraid of Finthalion. Whatever the reason was, Agatha was determined not to speculate too much on this, having discovered a degree of self respect and self assurance that would not permit her to devote too much thought to a man who had never, to outward appearances, seemed to care for her. Her resolution came to a stumbling halt whenever she walked in on him working on her saddle in the shed, (it was nearly close to finish now) his shirt taken off despite the nip in the air on account of the exertion, his dragon's mark shimmering on his shiny, sweaty skin. On these occasions, Agatha usually lowered her eyes and walked away, berating herself for being attracted to a man who had done nothing but lie to her. She was too biased against him to view his insistent attempts to put more food on her plate or to tire her out during the day as signs of affection in any case.\n\nHer saddle was finished in a few days and Agatha spent much of the subsequent days flying around on Elpis. Elpis had improved remarkably with respect to her endurance, and could now fly for hours against a high wind without tiring. Though the days grew shorter, Agatha spent most of it outdoors now, and by the end of two weeks her limbs were lithe and strong again, her strength had returned in all its glory, her cheeks were rosy and her eyes sparkled. She found herself laughing often at Orion's dry comments and he, seeing her regain a semblance of the happiness and the effusive spirits that had caught his eyes in the first place, made a mistake: he asked her to marry him.\n\nAgatha choked on a bit of sourdough bread when she heard the proposal. Eyes watering, she shook her head vigorously at Orion, and when she had recovered sufficiently enough to talk, she gasped, \"I cannot, I will not, Orion.\"\n\n\"Still angry at me, I see,\" Orion muttered and returned to his food, apparently unconcerned at the rejection. It took Agatha all of her self command not to throw her dinner at his face at that moment.\n\n\"I am not angry at you,\" Agatha said, proud of how level her voice sounded despite the turmoil in her head. \"I understand why you did what you did, but do not mistake my civility for forgiveness.\"\n\nShe wanted to return to her food after that, to show him that she thought as little of his proposal as he clearly thought of her dignity, but she could not, and started speaking, all the pent up anger barreling out of her in one bitter invective.\n\n\"I am a human who deserves to be treated as an equal, Orion, not because of my status as a Dragon Rider, not because of my royal lineage, but for the person I intrinsically am, for the values and the skills that I have painstakingly accumulated over the years. You would never have the alliance with the Forgers had it not been for me, for my training as a physician. And I deserve to be treated as more than a pawn in your grand schemes or a body to warm your bed.\"\n\nOrion pushed his food away from him and turned towards her, his eyebrows raised in mingled incredulity and exasperation. \"Do you really think that I do not see that? That I want to marry you because I need you to warm my bed?\"\n\n\"I do not care what you see. From where I stand, there is no difference between how Lyon Rhynster and you treated me. Rhynster tried to sell me off for fifty gold pieces the day we met, and you exchanged me for a piece of land. Yes, you will say that it is simply not a piece of land, that it was a means to save the lives of hundreds of people, but it is your outlook that I cannot support, your tendency to keep people in the dark as long as they play their parts in your plan. For instance, I dare say Siegel does not know of what you did to me, I dare say that he still thinks that I was faithful to him until the very end, and you have used his services on the basis of this half truth, and like a coward, you have left it to me to tell him the truth.\"\n\n\"I can talk to him about it once I no longer require his services, which will be quite soon.\"\n\n\"You are reinforcing my point with that statement, Orion.\"\n\nOrion stared at her with an unfathomable expression, then said softly, \"you will change your mind, soon, you know.\"\n\nAgatha stiffened. \"Orion, if you try to seduce me now you will lose whatever redemption you have achieved in my eyes.\" Her voice now held the edge of a warning to it; she still had his ward but she had no wish to leave Elpis without a father. \"I value loyalty above all else, and you have already forced me to deviate from that once. I should have been allowed to move on from Siegel by my own volition, not with pleasure forced upon me by you, and if you do that again, Orion....\"",
        "\"I did not mean that,\" Orion grimaced. \"I simply meant that I have time on my side,\" he said lightly. \"All of my potential competitors are mortal, you see. And I am known for my patience.\"\n\nAnd with that ominous declaration, he disappeared into the kitchen with his half empty plate in his hand.\n\nAuthor's note: Hi there! Fear not, I have not forgotten that this is an Erotica. There's some good stuff coming up in the next chapter (which will be the last one) so please bear with me. ~Ash"
