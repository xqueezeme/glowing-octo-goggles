        "Thank you to YukonNights for editing this chapter. I appreciate the hard work.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nWhen Michael returned to the house, he didn't feel appreciably better than when he left. In some ways, he felt worse. His anger toward Mariah had faded, but his disgust with himself had grown. He still viewed his decision to move forward with the transmitter as the appropriate response to her headstrong recklessness. He wished he had handled it much differently, though. If he had been more patient, she might have come around.\n\nAllowing her to goad him into performing the procedure himself had been a terrible mistake. If she refused to see reason, he ought to have made her stay in her room until she agreed to take the sedative and let Nate administer an anesthetic. Had he kept control of the situation, the device would have been implanted safely in the comfort and privacy of her room. She wouldn't have had a chance to run off after the procedure. He wished he had at least stayed with her afterward so that he could make sure she had everything she needed and that she didn't do anything that might tear her stitches.\n\nHis biggest regret was the ugly, ridiculous threat he made afterward. Thinking about it now, he couldn't understand why it ever seemed like a good idea to tell her that the implant included a device that could be triggered to kill her. It disturbed him that he made the threat, but it bothered him even more that such a thought occurred to him in the first place. He hoped she knew he would never do such a thing, but he had to be sure. He had to tell her, even if she didn't want to talk to him.\n\nHe hesitated outside the door to her room. The last time he had barged in, it hadn't gone very well. He tapped on the door and got no response. He eased the door open. The lights were off, but the twilight from the windows was enough for him to see she was in bed. She was laying on her stomach, and all he could see of her from the door was her dark hair against the pillow and her arm tucked up next to her face. He took a few steps into the room to try to see her better, but Henry started snarling at him. He backed out quietly and retired to his own room for a restless night.\n\nWhen he opened the door between their rooms the next morning, Mariah was already sitting up in bed.\n\n\"Michael, you said that door could be closed when I wanted privacy. I would like some privacy.\"\n\nHe closed the door without a word. He went to the kitchenette and made coffee. He thought about bringing some to Mariah, but decided against it. It would only give her another opportunity to tell him to go away. He felt awful about what happened the day before, but he couldn't fix the problem by letting her constantly pull his strings.\n\nHe decided to spend the morning in the gym. Maybe she would be more agreeable after she was left to her own devices for a while. She didn't have a way to work on the project without him. She might be more appreciative of his company once she had time to realize that.\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\n\nMariah woke to a damp pillow. She flung it away in disgust. It had been years since she had cried in her sleep, and this was a lousy time to relapse. She hadn't had the chance to make sure her face was dry when she heard Michael opening the door between their bedrooms. Without looking in his direction, she asked for privacy. When the door closed, she breathed a sigh of relief and swung her legs over the side of the bed.\n\nHer back still hurt and the muscles in the area around the incision had gotten stiff, but it didn't feel like any cause for concern. A shower would feel good, but she needed to find a way to keep the incision dry. She splashed her face with cold water to wash away any evidence of tears before she ventured out to the kitchenette. The only sign of Michael was the still-warm carafe of coffee. She poured herself a cup before she turned to finding what she needed for a bandage cover.\n\nWhen she finished her coffee, she constructed a waterproof bandage cover using plastic wrap, paper towels, and waterproof tape from the first aid kit. What kind of weird rich guy bought a warehouse full of plastic wrap when the economy went off the rails? It seemed like an odd choice. She took an extra bandage from the kit, too. The fat cat who bought up all the first aid kits made a better investment, in her opinion.\n\nOnce she taped paper towels to the plastic wrap, it had enough body that she could tape it to her back without the plastic curling over on itself. It wasn't her best work, but it was good enough that she could take her shower. Even though she had to avoid allowing water to hit the bandage cover directly, the warmth of the shower was relaxing. When she took the bandage cover and bandage off after her shower to check the incisions, everything looked fine. She could see the incision she made, but the bruising around the area camouflaged it. Michael didn't know to look for a second incision, and she was confident that he would not notice. After she applied a new bandage, she sewed a pocket in another bra for the transmitter.\n\nAfter she got dressed, she knocked on Michael's door. She wanted to ask him about the schedule for the day. He didn't answer her knock, so she took Henry outside and had a nice romp in the backyard. When they came back in, Michael still wasn't answering his door.\n\nThere was a writing desk in her bedroom, and she found stationery in the drawer. She made a list of people she knew who used to work in construction. The list included notes about each person's immediate family and anything that might affect their suitability to come into the compound. When she finished, she tried Michael's door again. Unless he was in there ignoring her, he must have already left for the morning. Either way, she guessed his purpose was to teach her a lesson. The lesson he intended to teach probably wasn't that he was unreliable when he was angry, but that was what his behavior taught her.\n\nShe decided to visit the garden. If she could find Seth, he might teach her about natural pest control methods. She hoped he would let her help with the gardening, too. It would feel good to do something useful. The walk to the garden was enjoyable. The sky was a vivid, cloudless blue and the sun was warm against her face. The sun had dried the dew from the top of the grass, but droplets still clung to the dense growth near the ground. Since the weather patterns had changed, May at the foot of the Rockies in northern Colorado had been marked by prolonged flooding. This year, the floods ended sooner than they had in recent years, and by early May, most of the standing water was gone. Now, at the end of May, the hills and meadows were carpeted in the lush growth that followed the rains.\n\nShe had been able to replant her own garden in mid-May, and the new plants would only now be coming up, too late for a full growing season. That was another thing she hoped to learn from Seth. The plants in his garden were already beginning to produce. Even if he started them in the potting shed, or even the greenhouse, how had they survived the flooding? He couldn't have planted them after the flooding. The plants would have been too old by then to transplant without shocking them. He must have transplanted them before the flooding, and found a way to drain the water-logged soil.\n\nSeth was happy to see her. If he thought anything was odd about her showing up by herself, he didn't mention it. He let her help him plant marigolds between the cabbages and other leafy green vegetables to keep the cabbage worms away. After that, he explained his drainage system. The most important feature was the natural geography. The garden was planted on a gentle slope, about 900 feet uphill from a creek running through the bottom of a steep ravine.\n\nFrench drains were buried beneath the garden. The water they collected was funneled into a single pipe that ran below ground and exited the side of the ravine. The garden was protected from flowing surface water by a large, semicircular berm built uphill of the garden, and by angled ditches dug along the sides of the plot. The ditches weren't even visible now that the grass was tall, but they were enough to guide the flow of surface water away from the garden. It was an ingenious setup, but it couldn't be applied to a spot that didn't have similar physical features. It would be important to plan the new gardens and buildings around geography that was conducive to a similar drainage system.\n\nAfter Seth explained how the drainage system worked, they went through the rows of the garden to pick anything that was ripe. He had started the seedlings in the potting shed at the end of March, so there were already some tomatoes, summer squash, green beans and lettuce ready to harvest. The first radishes, onions and beets had been collected a couple of weeks ago. Cucumbers, peas and okra would be ready soon. They were just picking the last of the ripe green beans when the radio on Seth's belt beeped. It was Michael, asking if anyone had seen Mariah. Seth looked at her before he responded. \"She was here earlier. I think she's on her way back to the house for lunch.\"\n\nShe gave him a quick smile. \"I guess I'd better be going. Thanks for your kindness and your company this morning.\"\n\n\"I was glad to have the help, and the conversation. Do you want to use the cart I've got here to get back to the house?\"\n\n\"No thanks. I'll take a shortcut through the field.\"\n\nShe didn't want to get Seth in trouble, so she hurried back. She came in through the entrance in the west wing, and Marcus saw her when she passed the kitchen on the way to the stairs.\n\n\"Mariah! There you are!\" Marcus was all smiles, but she saw the signs of worry around his eyes.\n\n\"Hi, Marcus.\"\n\n\"Michael's looking for you. He asked me to radio him when you got here.\"\n\n\"Okay. Would you mind if I make a sandwich while you do that?\"\n\n\"A sandwich? Are you sure you don't want anything else? Everyone else had tapas for lunch, and I've got lots left over.\"\n\n\"That must have been good. Have you ever just really wanted something simple, though? I'd really like to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\n\nMarcus smiled. \"I know exactly what you mean.\" He found the bread and peanut butter and jelly for her and let her make her own sandwich. He even poured her a glass of milk. He waited until she was eating her sandwich before he radioed Michael.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of living in a ridiculously large house is that it takes a long time to get anywhere. By the time Michael arrived in the kitchen, Mariah was licking the peanut butter and jelly from her fingers. Not very ladylike, she realized, but do you really have to be ladylike when you eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? She finished her milk while she waited for Michael to say something. He didn't look happy.\n\nWhen she put her glass down, he beckoned her to follow him. She supposed he meant it to seem ominous. So, she trailed behind him like a wayward child being escorted to the principal's office. He didn't say anything until they got back to his private wing. Henry came running up for his hug and kiss, but instead of running off afterward, he stuck close to Mariah. He wasn't growling at Michael anymore, but he was keeping an eye on him.\n\nMichael escorted her to her bedroom and closed himself in with her. She wondered if he was going to try to lock her in. He looked angry enough to do something like that.\n\n\"Sit down.\"\n\nShe sat. It would have been ridiculous to do anything else.\n\n\"Where were you?\" Michael demanded.\n\n\"You know where I was.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell anyone where you went?\"\n\n\"It didn't occur to me that I should. Who would I tell?\"\n\n\"Anyone!\"\n\n\"Okay, Michael. I'll tell 'anyone' next time I go somewhere.\"\n\n\"You're not going to be going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\n\"Since you've already put a tracking device in my back, it hardly seems necessary to restrict my movements.\"\n\nHe tried not to cringe at the mention of the transmitter. \"It's necessary because you do things like running off without telling anyone.\"\n\n\"And you've got a device to track me down if I do. If you think you're going to keep me locked up, I'm leaving, and as soon as I get out, I'm going to have Dr. Becker dig that thing out of my back.\"\n\nMichael fumed silently. He had backed himself into a corner again. \"I didn't say I was going to lock you up. Take your dress off and lie on your stomach on the bed. I need to check your incision.\"\n\nHe expected her to argue, but she did exactly what he told her. It was disconcerting. He brushed her hair to the side and unfastened her bra strap. Mariah tensed, hoping he wouldn't feel the transmitter sewn into the bra. Her bra didn't cover the bandage, so she hadn't expected him to unfasten it. When she felt the tape around the bandage pulling away from her skin, she breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nAs soon as he got the bandage off, he could see that her skin was bruised and traumatized. He felt sick. He had done that to her. The black sutures looked spidery and foreign knotted against her skin. He sat down on the bed beside her. \"Please don't make things more difficult than they have to be, sweetheart.\"\n\nHe saw her cringe when he used the term of endearment. He stood back up, angry and rejected. It was no use talking to her.\n\n\"I'm not trying to make things difficult. I'm behaving as normally as I can under the circumstances. I knocked on your door three times this morning. You were already gone. I finished a list of people in the construction trade. Since I didn't know where you were, I found something useful to do. Then I came back. I don't think any of that merits being so angry with me.\"\n\nHe didn't have a response. The only fault he could find was that she had left without permission and without telling anyone. She probably knew better, but he hadn't told her that she couldn't. It had certainly occurred to him to do so, but if he told her she couldn't leave the house, she would probably have disappeared every time his back was turned, just to be contrary.\n\nMariah tried unsuccessfully to hook her bra back together behind her back. She got up and turned away from him to get her bra back on, then left to get a new bandage from the first aid kit in the kitchen.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Michael was instantly suspicious.\n\n\"To get the first aid kit from the kitchenette. I need to get a new bandage so the stitches don't get pulled when I put my clothes on.\" She wondered how much of an ass he was going to make of himself before he settled down.\n\n\"Lie back down. I'll get it.\" She laid back down, but she kept her bra on.\n\n\"Where can I get more bandages?\" she asked when he returned.\n\n\"I'll get some more, but from now on, I want you to come to me when you need a new bandage. I want to check the incision, and that way you won't hurt yourself trying to do it behind your back.\"\n\nShe didn't argue. It was probably best if he didn't realize how much she actually could do behind her back. There was less risk of Michael discovering the transmitter in her bra that way, too. She would take her bra off before she came to him for a bandage. When he unfastened her bra earlier, he could have felt the transmitter. In the future, she would wrap a little fabric around it before she sewed it in, so that the edges would feel less distinct.\n\nHe kept her with him the rest of the afternoon while he marked a line where the wall would go. It was a long process made awkward by carrying it out in silence. There was some spray paint in storage, but he didn't want to use it up spraying the ground. Instead, he used twine strung between sticks he stuck in the ground. At first, he didn't want any help from her at all, but he eventually started accepting the sticks she found. It went a little faster after that, but it was still slow. Twilight was gathering by the time they finished.\n\nIt was time for dinner when they got back to the house. He took her with him to the kitchen, intending to arrange to have dinner upstairs. He didn't get the chance. As soon as Mariah saw Marcus, she told him she was going to eat downstairs with everyone else. He didn't relish the thought of letting Marcus know that he was making Mariah eat upstairs, so he joined her in the dining room.\n\nThroughout the meal, she seemed so cheerful that he hoped she might not be angry anymore. She laughed at the funny stories, made her own contributions to the conversation, and smiled a lot. Everyone was obviously enjoying her company. Seeing her easy friendliness with everyone else drove home his own alienation from her. His mood was too sour to respond to everyone's attempts to engage him in the conversation.\n\nWhen Mariah left the dining room, he followed her to the elevator. She lapsed into silence as soon as they were alone. He watched her as they rode up. Her smile was gone, replaced by a neutral expression. He tried to start a conversation as they walked down the hall, but all he could get from her were short responses that didn't give him anything to work with.\n\n\"For someone who won't string more than a handful of words together now, you sure were enjoying yourself downstairs.\" He meant to be jocular, but he just sounded bitter.\n\n\"Not everything is about you or about me. There's no reason to make everyone else in the house uncomfortable. I was trying to be considerate, and the best way to do that was to appreciate their company.\"\n\nWhen she got to her room, she called Henry and Duncan in and shut the door. He tried to watch a movie in the lounge, but he couldn't concentrate on it. He went down to the library, but came back up when he couldn't focus on finding a book. The evening crept by as he bounced around between episodes of Law &amp; Order, Stranger Things, and Tom &amp; Jerry. When it was late enough to try to sleep, he knocked on Mariah's door to bring her to bed with him.\n\nWhen she opened the door, she stood blocking the opening. \"Was there something security-related you wanted to discuss?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Secrecy-related?\"\n\n\"Mariah...\"\n\n\"Do you want sex?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I think that covers my obligations. Goodnight, Michael.\"\n\nShe closed the door. He would have yanked it open and dragged her into his room if he trusted himself not to shake her until her teeth rattled. Sleep was out of the question after that. He went down to the gym for another workout. By the time he made it back to bed, he was no closer to figuring out how to deal with her. As he was falling asleep, he realized that he never told her there was no \"kill switch\" in the tracking device.\n\nThey fell into a pattern over the next week. Every morning, Mariah came to him to get a new bandage. She always asked about plans for the day. It kept the project's progress on track to some degree. They were at the point where they needed a staff meeting to discuss the project, but Michael was in no mood. She found other ways to be productive.\n\nWhen Michael didn't have Mariah with him, she was usually off doing something with one of the staff. He refused to let her use a computer to look up anything on the Elite Central Database, so she gave him lists of things she needed to research. That was how she got plans for beehives and chicken coops. She and the twins finished the beehives and placed them around the property. The chicken coops had to wait until the location of buildings was decided.\n\nWhenever Mariah disappeared, he found that if she wasn't with a staff member, she had told someone that she had left for a walk, or to pick flowers, or whatever her excuse du jour was for roaming around outside. It seemed she told a different person each time, no doubt her twist on her agreement to \"tell anyone\" when she went somewhere. Giving her a radio didn't help. She never outright refused to carry it, but she always left it behind. When he made her go and get it, she left it behind again at the first opportunity. He gave up on the radio and started keeping her with him all day long so she couldn't run off.",
        "When they weren't working on the project, she was making notes on a pad of paper. He looked through it one day while she was in the shower. There were lists of people, lists of supplies, lists of buildings, building diagrams, rules to consider for the people coming in, topics to look up in the Central Database, and a school curriculum.\n\nDuring \"working hours,\" as Michael had come to think of them, Mariah adopted a manner of coolly friendly professionalism. She smiled when appropriate, laughed when appropriate, and avoided arguments. After they finished their work for the day, they had dinner. Michael had given Marcus instructions that they would be eating upstairs until further notice. Dinner was a strained affair. She only spoke to respond to his questions.\n\nUnless Michael made a specific request after dinner, she went to her room. The morning after she fielded his knock at the door with a demand to know whether he was there about security, secrecy or sex, he reminded her that her third condition included companionship. He was surprised when she apologized for the incident. She didn't say whether she was apologizing for faulty contract interpretation or for her rudeness.\n\nSince then, she participated in whatever activity he requested. She even engaged in conversation, as long as he picked a topic and took the lead. With the exception of talking about the project, he hadn't found a way to get her to discuss anything because it was of interest to her. Once he vetoed all project-related conversation after \"working hours,\" she would only respond to topics he introduced.\n\nDespite his intentions to the contrary, it was only two days before he invoked his entitlement to sex under the third condition of their agreement. He thought sex might help him break through her barriers in a way he hadn't been able to accomplish by talking to her. She had often been evasive when he talked to her, but her sexual responses had always been honest. Now, he found something had changed. She performed beautifully, without complaint, but it was nothing more than a performance, the satisfaction of an obligation that she was determined to honor. Her responses were choreographed, and sex became an ironically lonely experience.\n\nThe first time he made use of his privileges after he implanted the tracking device, he called her into his bedroom to suck his cock. Remembering how distracted by it she was before and how content she seemed afterward, he thought it might put her in a better frame of mind. He hoped they could talk while she was calm and happy. Besides, he was aching to feel her mouth on him again.\n\nIt felt amazing until he made her look up at him. Her eyes were sharp, alert, and didn't hold a trace of emotion. He stopped making her look at him after that. Her tongue was as wickedly talented as he remembered, and her lips felt just as good wrapped around his shaft. She had gotten better at letting him push into her throat like he taught her. He was able to enjoy her throat rippling around his cock longer before she started trying to push away to breathe. After she swallowed the last drop of his cum, he searched her face for any hint that it meant something to her. Nothing. He sent her back to her room. The pleasure she had given him was fleeting. The hollow feeling that remained would last longer.\n\nThe next night, he wanted her spread-eagled on his bed. He did not intend to stop until she surrendered to his mouth. When she laid back gingerly, he realized that positions on her back were out of the question until the stitches were removed. He supposed he could have found another way to do it, but the dread on her face when she realized what he intended left him with no interest in pursuing it.\n\nIt drove home what he had lost. Her first night with him, not even a week ago, he orchestrated her pleasure, guiding her from one orgasm to the next like movements in a symphony. She hadn't been able to disguise her need for him, and after she fell apart beneath his lips and tongue, she had looked up at him with something akin to wonder. Now, her aversion sliced at his pride and his heart. He was hurt, but he was also angry. She had given him something precious and then stolen it back.\n\nRefusing to be denied, he had her climb onto the bed on her hands and knees. The way she slinked her way up the bed left him nothing to complain about. She didn't meet his eyes, and he didn't make her. After her unspoken rejection of his effort to give her pleasure, he didn't waste time with preliminaries. It had been only days since he made her admit that she needed him to touch her, but it felt like something long ago, between two different people. When he climbed on the bed behind her, he was laser-focused on getting himself balls-deep inside her. She wasn't as aroused as she normally was, but she was wet enough.\n\nHe sank into her with a sigh, and his eyes closed in satisfaction. When he opened them, he was looking down at the bandage on her back. He closed his eyes again, but his mind supplied the details obscured by the bandage. When he checked her incision that morning, the bruises were starting to fade from purple-black to brown and yellow. The black stitches still looked like spider legs sticking out of her skin. He couldn't look at her back while he fucked her.\n\nHe laid back on the bed and told her to ride him. That was exactly what she did, with a perverse pleasure in following his instructions as literally as possible. She rode his cock the way she wanted to do it, and he felt almost dispensable to the process. She contorted herself into a backward bend that he wouldn't have thought possible, with her hands backwards on his thighs and her back bent so sharply backward that his view of her ended where her breasts rocked back and forth on her chest. She had managed to find a position in which he was invisible to her.\n\nHe could tell from her breathing that she was enjoying herself, but her grinding motion on his cock wasn't giving him the stroking stimulation he needed. When he touched her clit, she sat up with a start. She was so oblivious to him that his participation startled her. He was thoroughly pissed off and thoroughly aroused at the same time.\n\nHe made her lean over his chest and rock up and down his shaft to the rhythm he dictated. She didn't complain. He fondled her nipples and got no response. He squeezed them harder, then much too hard. She still didn't complain. She held herself beautifully arched for him with her hands braced against his shoulders. Without prompting, she squeezed her pussy around his cock and rotated her hips when he paused. It was an excellent technical performance. When he was ready, he held her by the waist and jackhammered up into her. When he came, he felt triumphant. When she gathered her clothes and left, he felt defeated. It was what he asked for, but it wasn't what he wanted.\n\nHe hadn't attempted sex again after that. He'd had enough of her diligent performance of the terms of their agreement. The only reason he even insisted on her company in the evenings was because he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of getting out of it. It had been seven days since the ill-fated implant of the tracking device, and things were only getting worse. He went to bed that night without hope that the next day would be better.\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\n\nMariah woke up the next morning feeling slightly less miserable than she had for the past week. It was the day she could get her stitches out. She sterilized a pair of scissors from Michael's office and knocked on his door. It was a little earlier than usual. She didn't usually disturb him until after she had taken a shower and needed a new bandage.\n\nHe opened the door and eyed her skeptically. She was wearing one of the skimpy pajama sets he had chosen for her. That was nice. When she came to him for a new bandage after her shower, she always wore the bathrobe and let it slide down her back to give him access to the site. She was carrying scissors. That was concerning. He didn't want to hear Nate say, \"I told you so.\"\n\n\"Could you please take my stitches out? It's been a week.\"\n\nHe had forgotten that they came out today. \"Take your shirt off and lie on the bed.\"\n\nHe tried not to stare. He didn't need another case of blue balls. He took her bandage off. The bruises were fading, but it would probably be at least several more days before they disappeared. He was looking forward to getting rid of the stitches, probably even more than she was. He cut each suture and pulled out the thread. Good riddance.\n\n\"Okay. They're out.\"\n\nShe thanked him with what might even have been a genuine smile before she left to take her shower.\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\n\nMariah sighed under the hot water. It felt so much better to take a shower without plastic wrap taped to her back. She needed every pleasant experience she could get right now. Since Michael implanted the tracking device, his behavior toward her had become increasingly surly and often downright mean. She was surprised by how much it hurt her feelings. She had wanted him to stop playing at romance. Now he had.\n\nAfter Paula told her about Michael's history, she could see where a lot of his behavior came from. That didn't excuse it, though, and Michael had enough enablers in his life without her joining their ranks. She shouldn't have to pay the penalty for his tragic childhood. Still, she had been prepared to give him another chance if he had given her a reason to do so. An apology would have been a good start. An offer to remove the device he thought was still in her back would have been even better. But he made no effort to try to fix what he had done. He hadn't even bothered to tell her that he couldn't really flip a switch and kill her with his precious transmitter.\n\nInstead, he played silly games and hid from her, yelled at her, threatened to lock her up, tried to limit her socialization, and kept her with him constantly, even though he could hardly stand to be around her. She knew she shouldn't have been, but she was devastated when he demanded sex from her. It was always part of their agreement, but it had never been so callous. He could barely stand the sight of her and he knew all she wanted was to get away from him. She wondered if his insistence on sex under those circumstances was intended to be dehumanizing, or if he bothered to think about how she would feel at all.\n\nHer feelings now were the price she had always known she would pay for allowing herself to become too fond of him. She knew from the beginning that she wasn't doing herself any favors by allowing him to pretend affection toward her. When he ignored her subtle efforts to distance him, she should have been more direct. She should have been less concerned about hurting his feelings and more concerned with how miserable he could make her life if things got bad between them.\n\nIt was stunning how quickly things had deteriorated. She had only been here eleven days. It felt like months. It could take two years or more before their project was far enough along for her to leave with confidence that it would continue. At the very least, it would take a year, and that was probably much too optimistic. Every time she thought about the time stretching out before her, she felt like she was drowning. Like she felt now. Her chest was tight and there was a roaring sound in her ears. When she closed her eyes, she could see little silver sparks flying around behind her eyelids.\n\nShe decided she had better sit down to finish her shower. She gathered the shampoo and conditioner and detached the shower wand. The next thing she saw was the floor of the shower at eye level. She was lying in a heap and the side of her head hurt. She must have passed out from hyperventilating. She could not have been out more than a matter of seconds because the shower wand was still banging against the wall where she dropped it.\n\nShe pushed herself to a sitting position and grabbed the wand to stop the noise it was making. Acoustics in the shower were great for singing, terrible for banging and clanging. Shampoo was pooled on the tile floor. She picked up the bottle and replaced the top. Nearly an entire bottle of high-end shampoo that some rich jerk had hoarded was oozing toward the shower drain. She scooped up enough to wash her hair.\n\nWhen she rinsed her hair, the shampoo was still flowing sluggishly toward the drain. She aimed the shower wand at it to help it along. She backed up against the wall so she could rinse away the part of the shampoo puddle that she had been sitting in. Some of the water streaming from the wand hit her pussy. The wand's pressure setting was on \"jet,\" so the water hit with enough force that it was stimulating, even against the outside of her pussy.\n\nShe turned the stream of water to her nipples, but jerked it away immediately. The water pressure was too high and her nipples were too sore. Michael bruised them a few nights ago because he didn't care for the way she interpreted his demand that she ride his cock. Something had possessed her to give him a taste of his own medicine. She hoped he had learned how it felt to be used like an object for someone else's gratification, but she doubted it.\n\nRiding him like that felt good, though. Not nearly as good as it would have felt if she had any emotional investment in what she was doing, but it was the most pleasure she'd had in days. When she arched backward, his cock was pushed against the front wall of her pussy. She loved the pressure there, and she could increase the effect by grinding her hips. Then Michael had ruined it by reminding her that he was still there.\n\nThe injury to her nipples was very minor, but the swelling and increased blood flow from the healing process kept them distractingly sensitive to stimulation. In the right context, it might have been enjoyable, or at least titillating, but this was not the right context. Under the circumstances, it was just an itch that could not be scratched. She considered the wand again. Maybe she should at least try to scratch it.\n\nShe experimented with the water flow settings on the wand until she found one that concentrated the water in a single stream that was neither stingingly strong nor ineffectually weak. She was ambivalent about trying to bring herself to orgasm. It was rarely very satisfying, but her real irritation was the suspicion that she was only considering it because she had just come from Michael's room.\n\nHe had answered the door in sleep pants. His hair was rumpled and the anger hadn't settled into his eyes yet. Out of recently acquired habit, she dropped her gaze to avoid eye contact as soon as he looked at her. Her gaze had landed on the line of hair that started below his navel and trailed down past his low-slung pajama bottoms. She wished she had not noticed. It made her remember how attracted she had been to him before he turned nasty and hateful.\n\n\"Fucking Michael!\" Her voice sounded too weak when it echoed around the shower, so she threw the soap at the wall for emphasis.\n\nMichael nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard Mariah curse him. When she fell, he heard the noise and came to investigate. He had been standing in the open doorway trying to figure out whether he needed to intervene. A week ago, nothing could have stopped him from immediately checking her over. Today, he was looking for a reason not to investigate further.\n\nWhen he got to her bathroom door, he saw her sit up in the shower and grab the shower wand that was banging against the side. She was conscious, at least. He waited to hear or see something that would tell him whether she was hurt. She hadn't moved much, but he could hear the shower wand cycling through settings. He was ready to assume she was uninjured and leave when he heard her curse him. Then he heard a thud.\n\nHe thought at first that she had seen him, but she didn't say anything else. He was still trying to figure it out when he heard her suck in her breath. His ears pricked. He knew that sound. Not long after, it was followed by a soft moan. The glass walls of the shower enclosure were clear and untextured, but they had steamed up. He only had a semi-clear view where the water rinsed the steam off the glass. Behind the steamed portions of the glass, he could see little more than her basic shape.\n\nThen, she dropped the shower wand and it spun around before she could catch it. It sprayed the lower walls of the shower, rinsing away the steam. He could see all the way up to her chin now through the minor distortion of the water on the glass. He saw her train the water on her breast. She hissed and redirected the stream. He guiltily remembered what he did to her nipples.\n\nHe was distracted from his guilt when she crawled to the other end of the large shower to retrieve the soap. The way she moved on her hands and knees was provocative even when she thought she didn't have an audience. When she sat back against the wall of the shower, she started soaping up her breasts. She was using the soap to allow her fingers to slide across her nipples without hurting them. Her head tilted back against the side of the shower and he heard her moan again.\n\nHis cock throbbed. He freed it from his pajama bottoms and stroked it just enough to relieve the ache. His focus was on the scene in the shower. He saw her cup her breasts and run her thumbs over her nipples. He knew what they would look like if he could see them clearly. They would be so swollen that they looked tight. He could see through the glass that they were reddened. He missed keeping them sensitive all the time.\n\nShe moved the showerhead to aim the water against her pussy. Her knees were bent, with her feet planted shoulder-width apart. The leg nearest to him fell to the side and she reached down with one hand to spread her labia. When the water hit her clit, her hips jerked. He could hear her whining as the water played up and down her slit.\n\nFrom the beginning, he had enjoyed how vocal she was, but now he realized she had been holding back. She was so quiet that he wouldn't have been able to hear her if he hadn't been standing in the doorway, but her little noises went on nearly nonstop. Her whimpers blended with moans and gasps and mewls. He wouldn't even know what to call some of the sounds she made, but their meaning was unmistakable. They were full of need. He wanted her to make those unfiltered sounds of pleasure for him.\n\nShe began to pant, and he knew she must be nearing her climax. Her head was thrown back again, and her back slid down the wall of the shower each time her hips rocked forward. He could see that her pussy was spread wide between her splayed fingers. He wished he could see more clearly. She brought the showerhead closer to let the water beat down on her clit.\n\nHe started to make out words between her moans. She had never talked to herself like this during sex with him. She wasn't coherent. He heard \"please\" and \"more\" and \"need it.\" It reminded him of how he made her admit she needed him to touch her, to make her come. Then he heard his name, and his hand tightened around his shaft. He had a fluttery feeling from his throat to his stomach. Not coming was starting to feel like trying to stop up a fire hose.\n\nHer cries grew higher in pitch. There were no more words -- just a keening that sounded almost pained. Then she went silent. He could see the wand shaking in her hand as she came. When it was over, he heard her sigh with the same kind of relief he desperately needed. The shower wand fell back against the tile wall. He arranged his pants and was preparing to leave when he heard her throw the soap across the shower again.\n\n\"Fucking Michael.\"\n\nHe retreated to his shower to seek his own release. It was intense. It still wasn't what he really wanted, but for those seconds while it lasted, he was aware only of the blinding pleasure. His legs were still shaky when he finished his shower.",
        "After he dried off, he sank into the closest chair in his seating area and stared blindly out the window. He had reached two conclusions, but he had not wrapped his mind around either of them. The first was that the reason he had been so angry at Mariah was that she had rejected him. The second was that she still wanted him. He needed to think about what it all meant, but he couldn't gather his thoughts properly.\n\nHe was still puzzling over it when Mariah knocked on the door to ask about their schedule for the day. She looked the same way she had looked for the last week: professionally pleasant. There was not a hint of the passion he witnessed such a short time ago. Seeing her detachment tore at his newly rooted optimism. He knew he wasn't ready to be around her yet. He needed time to sort things out, so he told her they would not start until after lunch.\n\nLeft to her own devices, Mariah decided to see if she could entice some bees to the hives. She couldn't take Henry with her because he had a bee problem. The buzzing drove him absolutely crazy. He would chase bees in a clover patch for hours, lunging and snapping every time he heard a buzz. Fortunately for Henry, he wasn't very good at catching them. It was easy to tell when he succeeded, though. He sat straight up and looked very surprised and very foolish. Getting stung did nothing to quench his fury the next time he heard a buzz.\n\nThe twins had been begging to babysit him, so she decided to take them up on their offer. It would be more fun for him than staying in the house. Amy and Daniel were as excited to see Henry as he was to see them. Since they were trying to fix the roof over the old pool, he would have a new area to explore. She let them know where she would be and told them she'd come by for Henry before lunch. When they drove off in one of the golf carts, Henry jumped out and ran back to her for a hug and kiss, but then he ran back to the cart and didn't look back.\n\nWith Henry off on his adventure, Mariah went to gather what she needed from the herb garden. One of the articles Michael downloaded said that bees were attracted to lemongrass oil. She was going to rub some of the oily leaves on the hives. The article said bees were especially attracted to blue and purple, so she also took some sprigs of lavender to leave on the hives. She hoped that the color would entice the bees close enough to smell the lemongrass oil. Since she didn't have access to a cart, she was only going to try the experiment on the hives that were closest to the house.\n\nShe started with the two hives closest to the vegetable garden. She stopped into the potting shed to visit with Seth before she went back to bait the hive near the compound's gate. It was nice to spend so much time walking after being cooped up in the house for the last week. The last hive was in a clover field near the wall of the compound, about five hundred feet west of the gate. She was almost there when she saw something fly over the wall and land in the grass.\n\nShe approached it carefully, but when she got close, she saw that it was just a rock. She thought some thoughtless person must be throwing rocks over the wall for fun, but then she saw a rolled-up paper tied to it with a string. She unrolled the paper and read it:\n\n We've been waiting for you.\n\n Now we have Henry.\n\n He dug a hole under the wall.\n\n Run west along the wall\n\n until you see a rope ladder.\n\n Climb the ladder.\n\n Jump down on the other side.\n\n Go now or Henry dies.\n\nMariah dropped the note and took off running before the nausea had a chance to set in. Her insides churned like an icy slurry, except for her lungs. Her lungs were burning. She wasn't sure that someone really had Henry. She didn't know how anyone knew where she would be. She didn't know if this was some sick test that Michael set up for her to fail.\n\nNone of that mattered. All that mattered was getting to the ladder. A siren wailed three times somewhere behind her. She saw the ladder come down over the wall and ran to it. She heard gunshots, but she couldn't tell what direction they were coming from. It didn't matter. She was up the ladder and over the wall so fast that she barely had time to adjust for her landing when she dropped to the other side.\n\nFour of \"mayor\" Hawley's hooligans were waiting for her. She didn't resist when they grabbed her. Hawley's men ran towards town, dragging her along with them. She had burned through most of her stamina in her frantic dash to the ladder. It was all she could do not to stumble. They had run less than a quarter of a mile when a black jeep sped past and spun to face them. They pulled her off the road and started running into the field, but three more jeeps were speeding towards them. The men froze in indecision, and the vehicles formed a semicircle between them and the field. A fifth black jeep was bearing down on them at breakneck speed.\n\nEzra was already out of the first jeep. Jack, Andy and Yvonne jumped out of the others. Their guns were drawn and aimed. A few seconds later, the last jeep pulled up and Nate was out carrying a rifle fitted with a large scope. He was aiming past the group. Mariah expected at least one of Hawley's men to pull a gun of their own, but it appeared that the best they had was a knife. A smarter goon would have held the knife to her throat, but Jim Carruthers was not smart, even for a goon. He kept a grip on her arm while he brandished the knife at Ezra, who was about twenty feet away.\n\n\"Hands above your heads!\" Ezra bellowed. \"Mariah, walk towards me.\"\n\n\"I can't, Ezra. I'm sorry.\" If she went to Ezra, one of three things would happen the second she was far enough away from the men. The security team might shoot Hawley's men, the men might get away, or the security team might capture them. No matter what happened, Henry might be killed -- if they really had him -- when Hawley's men didn't come back with Mariah.\n\nEzra tried again. \"Mariah, you have to trust me. We saw the note. They don't have Henry. Come towards me.\"\n\nShe wanted to. She really did. She was not convinced Hawley's men had Henry. She also wasn't convinced they didn't have him. Ezra would say whatever he had to say to get her away from Carruthers.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nEzra moved closer. His pistol was trained on Carruthers' head.\n\n\"This is the last time I'm going to tell you. Get your hands up, now!\"\n\nFor some reason, Carruthers raised one hand and continued to brandish the knife at Ezra with the other. He was exactly the kind of idiot who gets people killed.\n\n\"What's his name?\" Ezra asked Mariah, gesturing towards Carruthers with the pistol.\n\n\"Jim Carruthers.\"\n\n\"Mr. Carruthers, I have your head in my sights. You're not even twenty feet away. I won't miss. Drop that knife.\"\n\nCarruthers dropped the knife and yanked Mariah in front of him and held her in a chokehold.\n\n\"You're not thinking clearly, Mr. Carruthers. You still have a way to get out of this alive, but that's not it.\"\n\n\"If I let her go, you'll shoot me.\"\n\n\"Where's the dog, Mr. Carruthers?\"\n\nCarruthers was confused. He didn't understand why the guard wanted to know about the dog.\n\n\"Just tell me where the dog is. That's all you have to do, Mr. Carruthers.\"\n\nCarruthers started babbling. \"I don't know. We don't have the mutt. I swear, we never had him. If that's all you\u2014\"\n\nMariah elbowed him in his solar plexus, and his breath came out in a whoosh. She stomped his toes and his arm loosened around her neck. She ran to Ezra. He pushed her behind him and told her to get behind the wheels of his jeep. She got behind the jeep, but she had to know what was going on.\n\nShe peeked around the back of the vehicle and saw Ezra zip tying Carruthers' hands behind his back. He found a gun when he patted Carruthers down. Mariah caught Ezra's look of incredulity when he realized that Carruthers had a gun on him the whole time he was ineffectually brandishing a knife. Ezra left him face-down on the ground. The other three men were still standing with their hands up. Yvonne, Andy and Jack kept their pistols trained on them.\n\nMariah heard the crack of a rifle. She looked around to find Nate. He was laying on the ground with the barrel of his rifle resting on a bipod stand. The rifle barrel was angled towards a small stand of trees quite a distance away. He squeezed the trigger again, and she jumped when she heard the crack.\n\n\"Jack!\" Ezra barked. Jack nodded and walked around to where Ezra had been standing. Ezra moved back to cover the jeep she was hiding behind, probably trying to shield her, she realized guiltily. One of Hawley's men drew a gun. She heard another gunshot, and the man fell to the ground. It was Bart Lundgreen. Jack had shot him in the shoulder. He started screaming when he saw his own blood.\n\nLundgreen made so much noise that nobody heard the engine of the approaching motorcycle. Yvonne noticed the plume of dust it kicked up and brought her gun up to follow its progress. After a second, she switched back to covering Hawley's men. The black motorcycle was one of theirs. As it skidded to a stop, the two of Hawley's men who were still standing panicked and ran. Mariah was relieved when the security team let them escape unharmed.\n\nHer relief died when she saw the motorcycle's rider. It was Michael. His glare was murderous, and when he saw her peeking around the back of the jeep, he looked like she was the one he wanted to murder. She ducked back behind the vehicle. It was not going to help her at this point, but it was her instinctive reaction. She wished that she had stood her ground, but it was too late now. She heard him tell Ezra to bring Hawley's men to the compound and radio him when they got there.\n\nA few seconds later, he appeared around the back of the jeep she was hiding behind. He was moving fast.\n\n\"They said they had Henry!\" she tried to explain before he got too close.\n\n\"I don't care what they said. Get in the jeep!\"\n\n\"Okay, but can you please radio the twins to see if they have Henry?\"\n\n\"I said get in the jeep! NOW!\" he roared.\n\nShe backed away from him, prepared to run if he lunged for her. \"Not until you check.\"\n\nMichael grabbed the radio at his waist and pressed the button to broadcast to everyone on the main channel. \"Where is Henry? If anyone has eyes on Henry, report immediately.\"\n\nAmy's voice came over the radio right away. \"He's with me.\"\n\nMariah slumped to the ground. The crushing pressure left her chest. She started shaking so badly her teeth chattered. She hadn't realized how terrified she was until she knew Henry was safe. Everything caught up to her at once. Michael grabbed her under the arms, and she staggered to her feet. She didn't resist when he yanked her to the door of the jeep. She climbed up and got in on her own. She was eager to get back to the compound. She needed to see Henry.\n\nMichael slammed the door closed and walked around to the driver's side, keeping an eye on her through the windshield. He started the vehicle as soon as he got in. On the way, he radioed Amy to put Henry in Mariah's room. He didn't say anything to Mariah. She tried to explain what happened.\n\n\"Michael, they threw a note over the wall. It said Henry dug out and they had him. It said\u2014\"\n\n\"I know what the note said!\" He slammed his hand against the steering wheel.\n\nThe gate opened as soon as they drove up. Daniel ran out of the guard house to check on them, but Michael kept driving. He drove right up to the front door. She started to get out, but he told her to stay where she was. He came around to her side and helped her down. His grip remained tight on her upper arm as he marched her to the front door.\n\nPaula met them in the foyer. She looked badly rattled.\n\n\"Everything's under control,\" Michael told her.\n\nPaula started fussing over Mariah, but Michael stopped her. \"She's fine, Paula. She's going to wait in her room while I get things sorted out. I'm locking my wing. I don't want anyone going in or out until I get back.\"\n\nPaula looked worried, so Mariah smiled at her. \"I'm going to lie down for a bit, but I promise I'll tell you all about it later.\"\n\nMichael pulled Mariah along with him to the elevator. When the elevator door closed, she tried to yank her arm away. He merely tightened his grip.\n\n\"You shouldn't worry Paula like that.\"\n\n\"You'd better be worrying about yourself right now.\"\n\nThe elevator dinged, and she started to walk out, but he didn't let go of her. His grip on her arm remained tight as he walked her down the hall to her room. When they reached her door, he spun her around and backed her against the wall. She thought he was going to yell at her, or maybe even hit her.\n\nHe grabbed the back of her neck and pulled her mouth against his. He shoved his body into hers, trapping her against the wall. He kissed her roughly, with a desperate urgency that made her stomach flutter. It felt like he was trying to devour her. He pulled back and looked down at her. He noted with satisfaction that she looked dazed. He pulled her to the door.\n\n\"You had better not even fucking think of coming out of your room until I get back. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Where are you going? Are you going back outside?\"\n\nHe grabbed her chin and made her look at him. \"Do you understand?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Out loud!\" he demanded.\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"Good.\" With that, he pushed her into her room and closed the door behind her and hurried down to the garage.\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\n\nMichael had been alerted to the emergency after the warning siren sounded. He switched his radio to the security channel and demanded to know what was happening.\n\n\"It's Mariah,\" Yvonne said, amidst the other conversation on the channel.\n\n\"What happened?\" Michael demanded, but everyone was too busy to answer him.\n\nThe security team was already responding to suspicious activity outside the compound before the alarm sounded. Yvonne had been monitoring a group of four men on the road outside the compound. Their presence was unusual enough that she alerted the rest of the security team. She recalled Andy and Nate from their perimeter patrols. Ezra was off duty in the gym. He ran up to join Yvonne in the security office.\n\nJack was on duty at the guard house. He was the one who noticed that Mariah was outside, not far from the wall. He was too far away to see the stone thrown over the fence, but he saw Mariah pick something up. He saw her read the note and take off running. He ran after her, relaying the information to Yvonne as he ran. That's when Yvonne activated the siren that sounded throughout the compound.\n\nWhen Michael couldn't get an explanation over the radio, he raced down to the security office. He could hear Jack on the radio reading the note Mariah dropped. Fuck! He yelled into his radio. \"She's going to go over the wall!\" There was no question in his mind that she would. Henry couldn't have dug out. There were ten-foot treated steel rods in the ground beneath the walls, but Mariah didn't know that. She still should have had better sense.\n\nEzra was already in the security office with Yvonne when Michael came tearing in. On the main screen, Yvonne had an enlarged view of the feed from one of the hidden cameras built into the wall of the compound. Four men were milling around so close to the wall that the camera couldn't get them entirely in view. She turned up the audio from the microphone on that section of wall. One of the men had a radio. It beeped, and a voice on their radio said, \"Throw the ladder now.\"\n\n\"Jack, there's going to be a ladder over the wall,\" Yvonne relayed.\n\n\"I see it,\" Jack reported between breaths. \"No bad guys. She's running for the ladder. I'm not going to catch up in time.\" They heard him yelling her name.\n\n\"Jack, fire some warning shots.\" Ezra hoped it would get Mariah's attention and discourage anyone from coming over the top of the ladder. It was maddening not being able to see what was happening inside the walls. The sound of the shots over the radio was deafening.\n\n\"She's up the ladder.\"\n\n\"Cease fire,\" Ezra ordered. They couldn't risk spooking the men into firing while Mariah was exposed.\n\n\"She's over the top.\"\n\nOn screen, Mariah appeared in the frame with the men. Michael's stomach churned when one of the men grabbed her by the arm. He was so enraged that he had to keep blinking to get his eyes to focus.\n\nEzra started barking orders into the radio. \"Nate, get up to the roof with a scoped rife. Shoot anyone who comes over the wall. Jack, get back here and head out in a jeep. Andy, you, too. Drive east of the gate until you see them. There are four of them and they have Mariah. Assume they're armed. The priority is containment.\"\n\nEzra turned to Michael. He continued speaking into the radio to keep everyone in the loop. \"Michael, I need you to take over for Yvonne. Yvonne, get to a jeep as soon as he's in position. I'm driving out.\"\n\nEzra grabbed a second radio and ran for the stairs. On his way to the basement garage, he turned the second radio to the regular channel. \"Daniel, this is Ezra. Get to the guardhouse as fast as you can. Arm yourself and man the gate. Switch to the security channel.\"\n\nEzra made it to the elevator as Yvonne's voice came over the radio. \"They're running east on the road. Switching over to Michael at coms.\"\n\nEzra was the first to the garage. He grabbed a key and left the key safe open for everyone else. His tires squealed as he pealed out.\n\nIn the security office, Michael's heart was pounding. Everything had happened too fast for him to object to being left behind. Now he couldn't abandon his post. He could only watch helplessly as the men dragged Mariah away with them. He switched the main screen from camera to camera along the wall, keeping them in view. One after another, Yvonne, Jack, and Andy reported that they were en route. Ezra radioed that he had Mariah and the men in sight. They were nearly out of the range of the last camera when he saw Ezra cut them off.\n\n\"This is Ezra. I'm in position. Nate, get out here as fast as you can.\"\n\n\"Roger that. Watch out for hostile fire from the trees to the south of your position. I saw a glint from a lens.\"\n\nOn screen, Michael saw three more jeeps come to a stop in a line between the men with Mariah and the field. He could hear everything through the open channel on Ezra's radio. When Mariah wouldn't come to Ezra, he'd had enough. He didn't even have the presence of mind to radio his intentions. He just ran full-out. He was down the stairs in no time, only to have to wait for the elevator to get to the garage. When the elevator door finally opened, he snatched a motorcycle key, mounted the bike and rode out like a bat out of hell.\n\nIt was the longest quarter mile he had ever driven. When he skidded to a stop, he saw two men run off into the field. His instinct to run after them was immediately overridden by his need to get to Mariah. Relief hit him when he saw her looking out from behind one of the jeeps. The other two men were on the ground. He would gladly have spent the next hour beating them to a bloody pulp, but he was not going to do anything else until he had Mariah safe and secure at home.\n\nNow that she was safely in her room, he wanted some answers.\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\n\nMichael was waiting when the security team returned. Yvonne stopped her vehicle in front of the elevator where Michael was standing. She rolled down the window to speak to him.\n\n\"I've got to get back to the security office. Do you want to use this vehicle, or should I park it?\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" he answered.\n\nHe caught up with the other vehicles easily. They were driving to another part of the basement complex, past the storage rooms. They came to a stop in a wide aisle between the armory and the practice range. Beside the armory, there were three small holding rooms. They emptied Carruthers' pockets, took his shoes and belt, and locked him in the first holding room.",
        "Lundgreen's shirt had been removed to bandage his wound before they drove back to the compound. Nate had instructed Lundgreen to keep pressure on the wound to slow the bleeding. He was in pain, but in no immediate danger. They took his belt, his shoes, and the contents of his pockets and sat him in a chair in the third room. They waited until the door was closed to talk about what to do with him. Nate wanted to take him back to town to be treated by Dr. Becker. Ezra was concerned about the way people in town might react to one of their own being shot by someone from the compound.\n\nMichael had no patience for the debate. \"I want to talk to him. If we get the information out of him, we can take him to the doctor after that. We can bring a bunch of food and medical supplies and give them to the doctor to distribute. Hopefully, people will care more about the supplies than they do about that asshole. Any problems with that plan?\"\n\n\"Works for me,\" Ezra answered.\n\n\"Me, too,\" Nate confirmed, \"but we should keep the interrogation short. The bleeding is controlled, but it isn't stopped, and he already lost a good bit of blood before we got him bandaged. We should not go more than forty-five minutes. I'd feel more comfortable keeping it under twenty.\"\n\n\"Let's get started then.\" Michael, Ezra and Nate crowded into the room with Lundgreen. Michael took the initiative.\n\n\"What's this prick's name?\"\n\nNate and Ezra shrugged.\n\nMichael leaned over Lundgreen. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Bart. Bart Lundgreen.\" Lundgreen didn't have any fight left in him. Getting shot was already more than he had signed up for.\n\n\"Okay, Bart. Here's the deal. These two men,\" he gestured to Ezra and Nate, \"are professionals. I'm not. I'm the man whose woman you just abducted. If you knew the things I'm imagining doing to you right now, you would never close your eyes to go to sleep again. Does that help you understand your position?\"\n\nBart started sniveling. \"It wasn't my idea, man. I swear. I just did what I was told.\"\n\n\"Did you hear anything I just said? I don't give a fuck about your excuses!\" Michael roared at him. \"I didn't ask you whose idea it was. I asked you if you understood your position. So tell me, Bart, DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION?\"\n\nBart cringed away from Michael. \"Yes!\"\n\n\"Good. Now this gentleman,\" Michael pointed to Ezra, \"is going to ask you questions. I really recommend you answer them as quickly and completely as you can. I'm not a patient man. I don't want to hear anymore whining or excuses out of you. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Y-y-yes,\" Bart stammered, nodding his head for emphasis.\n\nMichael stepped back to let Ezra do his work. It didn't take long to get the information Ezra wanted out of Lundgreen. Lundgreen was basically a grunt who answered to Carruthers. He was not involved in the planning. He assumed that Josh Hawley ordered the abduction, but he didn't even have first-hand knowledge of that. He didn't know anything about the planning of the operation. He knew the note they threw over the wall was about Mariah's dog, but he didn't even know they were bluffing about having Henry.\n\nLundgreen told them that there was a second group of men in a stand built in the trees on the hill near the compound. That's who had told them where to stand outside the wall and when to throw the ladder over. He thought they had a telescope, but he hadn't seen it. Once they had Mariah, they were supposed to take her their clubhouse at the lake. He did not know anything about what was supposed to happen after that.\n\nEzra stepped out of the holding room and motioned for Michael and Nate to follow him. Andy and Jack were waiting outside. Ezra sent Andy to collect some medical supplies and food to take into town along with Lundgreen.\n\n\"I think that's all he's got. If I keep pushing him, he's going to start making things up to keep us happy. If he wasn't wounded, I'd want to ask questions about this little gang Hawley's got going on, and about their clubhouse. I doubt he could give us information on any subject that we won't get out of Carruthers, though.\"\n\nDuring the questioning, Jack had been going through everything in Lundgreen's and Carruthers' pockets. \"Did you find anything?\" Ezra asked.\n\nJack shook his head. \"Just a couple rocks of blaze, lock picks, a bump key, some little screwdrivers, some wires, tokens, and what looks like house keys.\"\n\n\"We'll give Lundgreen his tokens back, but he doesn't need his drugs or burglary tools. We don't know if those keys are his own. I don't know about you guys, but I don't really care if he's locked out of his house. Are you in agreement with taking him to the doctor now, Michael?\" Ezra asked.\n\n\"Yes. I suppose you're going to insist on going back with him, Nate?\"\n\n\"I'd better. I'm sure he's going to be fine, but I should stay with him until he's in a doctor's care.\"\n\nEzra started giving instructions. \"Okay, once we get Lundgreen in the vehicle, I want him tied securely in the passenger's seat. Nate, you drive and handle the conversation with the doctor. Jack, you see to defense. When Andy gets back, take him with you. He can keep his sights on Lundgreen. All of you need to take a little trip through the armory and load up before you go.\"\n\nEzra walked over to one of the jeeps. Michael followed.\n\n\"What about the other guy?\"\n\n\"I think it will be helpful to let him chill for a bit. You should have seen him out there, Michael. He had a gun on him, but he was waving a knife at me from twenty feet away. He's not a bright boy. Let's give him time to think things through. I'd also like to talk to Mariah before I talk to him. She knew his name, so she might be able to tell me more about him.\"\n\n\"You're going to have to get in line to talk to Mariah. I'm going to go have a very, very long conversation with her right now.\"\n\n\"Just remember, Michael, she did what she did for the same reason you did what you did.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that? I'm not the one who got myself abducted.\"\n\n\"You left the compound and put yourself at risk because you were afraid that she was in danger. You were as likely to be a target as she was. She left the compound and put herself at risk because she was afraid her dog was in danger.\"\n\n\"That's different and you know it.\"\n\n\"Probably not to her. I saw her with Henry. He's like her child.\"\n\n\"She should have known better than to believe they had him.\"\n\n\"And you should have known that we had the situation under control.\"\n\n\"Jesus, Ezra. What would you expect me to do? If something had gone wrong, I was too far away to help. I had to come.\"\n\n\"Exactly. You had to come. I think she had to go.\" Ezra cleared his throat. \"I don't want to get all sappy on you, but I'm proud of you, Michael. As your head of security, I think what you did was a terrible idea, but as someone who cares about you, well, you did good.\"\n\nMichael laughed awkwardly. \"You're going to give me a big head.\"\n\n\"You've already got a big head.\"\n\nMichael shrugged. \"I'll let you know when Mariah's available.\"\n\nHe took one of the jeeps back to the garage portion of the basement complex. On the way up to the third floor, he thought about what Ezra said. He understood that Mariah didn't feel she had a choice, but she could have been killed. He couldn't tolerate it. He wouldn't tolerate it, and he was going to find a way to get that through her head. When he left her in her room, he had wanted nothing more than to claim her, to fuck her senseless and show the whole damned universe -- including her - that she was his. Now, he just wanted to tan her hide.\n\nShe jumped up when he opened her door. She looked nervous. She ought to be. Seeing her was bringing all of his still-raw emotions to the surface. He took her by the wrist and led her through the door to his room. He closed the door behind them. She fidgeted while he looked her over. Eventually, her nerves got the better of her.\n\n\"Michael? What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm deciding whether to put you on my bed and fuck you into the goddamned mattress or put you over my knee and light up your backside with a spanking you will never forget.\" He let her fidget for a bit longer while he tried to sort the swirl of emotions competing for his head space.\n\n\"I've made up my mind. I'm going to do both. Take your clothes off.\"\n\nWhen she made no move to remove her clothes, he circled behind her to unzip her dress. With a sweep of his hands, the dress fell from her shoulders to puddle around her feet. He unfastened her bra with alarming alacrity, pulled the straps down her arms, and flung it aside. The artificially cooled air stiffened her nipples. They stayed hard against the warmth of his palms as he pulled her back against his chest. He held her body firmly against his and ground his cock against her panty-clad ass. When she tried to move, he growled against her ear.\n\n\"Don't you have any idea how much trouble you're already in?\"\n\nHe was rough with her breasts, digging his fingers into her flesh as he squeezed and kneaded them. He plucked harshly at her nipples until he drew a whimper from her. His hands dropped to her hips and he hooked his thumbs under the sides of her panties. He yanked them down and prodded her to step out of them, then nudged her feet a few inches apart. With one hand beneath her chin, he pulled her head back so that she was looking up at him, then brought his hand down on her pussy with a smack. He watched her face as she shuddered beneath three more smacks.\n\nSatisfied that her pussy must be stinging, he moved to the bed and pulled her across his lap. His hand came down with a resounding crack, quickly followed by several more stinging smacks on top of the handprint that was forming from the first. As soon as he reddened one spot to his satisfaction, his aim shifted to the next, over and over until her buttocks were a uniformly vivid hue. She tried to squirm off his lap, but he caught her and held her with one hand while he continued the spanking.\n\nShe was trying not to give him the satisfaction of crying or begging, but it was getting too intense to ignore. She put her hand back to shield her backside, but he grabbed her wrist and held it against the small of her back. Her ass was already bright red and hot to his touch, but she was still trying to get loose, so he delivered a smack with greater force than the others.\n\n\"Stay still,\" he demanded through gritted teeth, and returned to spanking her.\n\n\"Punishment won't make me obey you.\"\n\nMichael answered her without letting up. \"This isn't just about punishment. One way or another, I will get your attention.\" He punctuated each word with a smack. \"Do I have your attention now?\" he asked, with another smack for each word.\n\nMariah refused to answer. Michael rained down smacks against the tops of her thighs, turning them as red as her tender ass. She still refused to answer.\n\n\"God damn it, Mariah! What will it take to get it through your head? I will not allow the woman I love to get herself killed!\" She froze. Michael noticed her reaction. \"I know you don't want to hear me say it, but I love you.\"\n\nShe tensed and rolled, throwing herself off his lap. She was up as soon as she hit the ground.\n\n\"How dare you! Don't you ever say that to me again!\"\n\nWhen Michael said he loved her, she suddenly realized that she wanted it to be true. Making that discovery with the falsity of his declaration staring her in the face was bitterly painful. She stood there breathing hard, her fists clenched. She started shaking. The pressure of built-up tears made her eyes ache. She had to get away before she cried in front of him. She darted for the door, but he was faster. He caught her wrist when she was only a couple feet away from it. She strained to reach the knob, but he pulled her back.\n\nHe spun her around and grabbed a fistful of hair at the back of her neck. Using his grip on her hair, he pulled her head back to kiss her throat. He held her like that while he kissed and nipped his way up her neck and back down again. At the crook of her neck, he bit down and sucked at her skin. When he was satisfied that he had left a mark, he brushed his lips back up over her throat and out along her jawline. His lips traced the shell of her ear.\n\n\"You're mine, Mariah, and I love you whether you believe it or not.\"\n\nHe covered her mouth with his to smother any protest she might have made. She had nowhere to go. He was still holding her in place with his hand tangled in her hair, and he wrapped his other arm around her waist to pull her hard against him. He crushed her lips beneath his until she yielded. As soon as her lips parted, his tongue swept in, stroking in and out. She was losing herself to him again, and she knew it. She couldn't move and she couldn't close her mouth, so she tried to keep her tongue away from his.\n\nHe raised his head. \"Kitten, you do not want to defy me right now.\"\n\nShe saw the look in his eyes. It was dangerous enough to make her think about the consequences of defiance, but it was the wild hunger in his eyes that called to her. When his mouth came down over hers again, she let him take full possession. When he finally released her, her breath was coming in shallow pants. He felt a rising sense of triumph when he looked her over. Her eyes were dark and she had the glazed look that signaled a haze of arousal. This was the real Mariah -- not someone playing a role to satisfy an obligation.\n\n\"Go lie on the bed.\"\n\nHe undressed quickly and followed her to the bed. She watched his approach intently. When he reached the side of the bed, she sat up. He caught her eyes flickering over him before she looked up to his face. He knew what she wanted.\n\nWith his hand on the back of her neck, he guided her mouth to his cock. She opened to him without resistance and his cock slid in smoothly. The vibration of her little \"mmm\" sounds traveled through his cock as she sucked. She leaned closer to suck him in deeper, but he gripped her hair in his hand again to hold her head still. He rocked his hips, pushing through her lips and sliding over her tongue at his own pace. Her tongue snaked back and forth against the underside of his cock until he was tingling and throbbing in her mouth.\n\nHe ignored her whine when he pulled away. When he traced her lips with his finger, her tongue flicked out to curl around his fingertip. For the first time since the siren alerted him to her jeopardy, he felt his tension ease.\n\n\"Good girl. Now lie back for me.\"\n\nHe noticed the bruising on her arm where that prick of Hawley's had his hands on her. A fresh wave of rage washed over him. He needed to fuck her. Now. When he climbed over her, she moved to allow him to take his place between her legs. His cock jerked at the sight of her spreading her thighs for him.\n\nThe sound she made when he pushed the head of his cock into her was something he never wanted to forget. He leaned forward until he was fully enveloped in her hot, slick pussy. It was exactly what he needed. He pulled back to his tip and watched her pussy swallow him as he pushed back in. The way she stretched around him always looked impossible, and it never failed to inflame his lust. With effort, he stayed still for a moment to feel the way her inner muscles rhythmically clamped down and released. Her rhythm was broken when his cock throbbed. It made her hips jerk upward.\n\nHe drew back and thrust in hard and deep, forcing a gasp from her. Her hips arched and her knees came up beside him. Staying firmly seated in her depths, he reached down to rub her swollen clit.\n\n\"Keep your eyes on me, kitten.\"\n\nHe stroked her clit until it was so sensitive that every time he touched it, her inner thigh muscles jumped and her pussy locked around his cock. Bracing his hands beside her shoulders, he stroked smoothly in and out. Her eyes stayed locked on his as she matched his rhythm. He tried to take in every detail of her as she laid beneath him: her dark hair fanned out over the white pillow, the mark that he made on her neck, her lips parted in little gasps, the desire in her eyes. He thrust in hard, and watched the pleasure play over her face.\n\nShe pressed her palm flat against his chest and ran it up over his shoulder. Urgent need outweighed his desire to luxuriate in her touch. She clutched at his forearms to steady herself as he pounded into her.\n\n\"Let me hear you, baby. I want to hear it.\" He wanted to hear the sounds he heard from her in the shower.\n\nHe reached between them and pressed his thumb to her clit. The effect was electric. Soon she was making all the little noises he had been wanting to hear. He leaned back and rubbed her clit faster. When she was close, he started fucking her hard and fast. When he paused to rub her clit again, she tensed and came to a shuddering, panting climax.\n\nHis head dropped and he concentrated on his own pleasure. He rammed her pussy, spurred by the need to fuck her like she had never been fucked before. She couldn't match his rhythm. All she could do was lie there and take what he was giving her. Her breasts bounced every time he drove his cock into her, tempting him to bite and suck them, but he couldn't stop now. He was too close. His thrusts grew more ragged until he plunged into her a final time and came with a guttural cry.\n\nHe fell beside her. They were both hot and sweaty, but he wanted her close. He took her hand in his and interlaced their fingers. They laid like that without speaking while their hearts slowed and their breath grew even. When they were cool, he turned on his side and tucked her body against his.\n\nIt was only mid-afternoon, but they were physically and emotionally exhausted. They dozed for at least an hour until Michael roused himself. There was still the matter of questioning their remaining prisoner. He hated to do it, but he made Mariah wake up, too. Ezra needed to talk to her before the questioning began.\n\nThey were sharing a shower when a terrible thought occurred to Mariah.\n\n\"Michael, they have Sarah!\"\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nChapter 5 is still in progress, so it will probably be submitted the last weekend in May, 2020.
