        "Finals are finally finished!! Summertime awaits! With months of hospital clerkships but let's not ruin a good thing just yet. Anyway, here is the next chapter I promised for when I finished. \n\nI want to say a special thanks to AwkwardMD for being my humor consultant on this chapter and I'm lucky to have one of the funniest writers on the site backing me up when I can't come up with a joke. \n\nEnjoy! \n\n***** \n\nCh. 6 \n\nThere were subtle differences in the grip he kept on her. At first it had seemed they were all the same; a domineering, controlling hand wrapped so completely around her upper arm. In the weeks that followed her first performance Roland had made such a habit of clasping her arm whenever they moved about the ship that she began to take note of when his hold was lower and looser, or when his fingers felt like strangling iron bands across her muscle. \n\nToday his thumb marched up the back of her arm instead of curling around its counterparts. His hand's position was lower, almost at her elbow and the weight of it would have been comfortable if she could admit it. As it was, his absolute control over her movement outside the cabin had initially flared her confidence, confirming that she'd gotten to him. But weeks later that triumph had faded and the familiarity of the routine had settled over her as she allowed herself to be steered down the steps and onto the lower deck. \n\nRoland walked just behind her as they picked their way past the swaying hammocks on the way to the galley. Loud voices erupted next to them and Kenna started, taking a step towards Roland. The contraction of his fingers and arm aided her momentum and she found herself pressed tightly against his side. Three sailors were shouting over a game of dice, their overlapping voices reverberating in the small space. \n\n\"That's not how it works!\" one of the red-faced men shouted. The other two, a small Welsh man she recognized as a dancer, if a poor one, and a larger African, stood their ground. \n\n\"Don't be daft, Ned, you can't change the rules whenever you lose,\" another called back, leaning in and squaring his shoulders. \n\nThe third gestured at the dirty cubes at their feet. \"If ya roll two of the same then you can't just claim the pot, you have t\u2014\" \n\n\"See? Even Osei knows the rules and he's only just learned,\" the second one jabbed a thumb towards the larger black man. \n\n\"Of course he thinks them's the rules, 'cause you taught him your sheep-fucker game with no thought to the real way you play a fucking game of dice.\" \n\nKenna saw the first man grip his knife where it was tucked in his belt. The other two were bristling and the Welshman had turned bright red at the mention of fornicating with cattle. \n\n\"You would know from sheep-fucking seein' as you've been diddling the dairy goat for nigh on two weeks now.\" \n\nThree blades whistled from their sheaths. In the heartbeat of silence that followed Roland stepped forward without releasing her, a large laugh rolling out towards the three of them. \n\n\"You can't tell me two fours is worth nothing on the pot.\" His voice was calm and full of good humor. Kenna felt it crack the tension up the middle, the air around the three men changing instantly as they turned their eyes towards him. But Kenna saw the set of Roland's shoulders, the strain that coiled in his neck and down his arm to where he held her behind him. The men pulled away from one another, the two arguing together put their knives away before the third would agree to do the same. They turned towards their captain and began speaking their grievances at once. \n\nHe turned back towards her, the men's voices still arguing over one another but with a distinctly less murderous tone. \"Head to the galley and collect our meals. I'll be there in a moment.\" He released her and Kenna immediately felt unmoored. For a full moment she kept her place behind him as he turned back to the arguing crew members. It should not have been be difficult to step away from him, and so she pivoted and scurried the rest of the distance to the galley, ignoring the edge of panic that came with the movement. \n\nThe cook waved her in past the small group waiting, bowls in hand. Some of them had stepped out to watch the ruckus and she recognized the Quartermaster making himself scarce as he slipped by her, the sour faced Master Gunner following behind. The latter was recognizable in that he was the only one who never came to hear her sing. The scowls she received when they did cross paths did not recommend him as an audience member so it was satisfactory for both parties that he stayed away. \n\nShe put her hands inside the enormous pockets of the coat she wore and curled her fists tight. The crew were usually chatty during the evening meals, she'd heard them joking and singing, some not altogether terribly. But she felt the room hush a bit as she moved past them unescorted for the first time. Some heads were bobbed in greeting but no one spoke to her as she made her way towards the cook and his assistant. \n\n\"G'evening Missus Bell,\" the cook spoke, as she neared him. \n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Munro,\" she gave him a small, tight smile in greeting, her hands still knotted in her pockets. \n\n\"Gid Evenin'!\" the assistant chimed in, pouring the mead as he bounced over. In contrast with most of the crew, Mr. Hansen was incessantly chatty around her. A fair few had tried to engage her in conversation these last few weeks, but none so doggedly. Mr. Hansen had subjected her to more stories than she could count, and she'd found each deliberate attempt to divert her more and more grating. \n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Hansen,\" Kenna said mirthlessly. She had years of practice putting people off and yet none of her icy looks or lack of acknowledgement seemed to deter the man at all. \n\nHe pushed a fop of dirty blond hair back from his face. \"Charlie is really quite fine, Missus.\" \n\n\"I will take your suggestion under consideration, Mr. Hansen.\" Her tone held no hint of humor but the man walloped a laugh and slapped his knee. \"I'm here for the captain's dinner,\" Kenna said, turning to the cook who was looking at his assistant with a detached air of incredulity. \n\n\"Of course, Mistress, it'll just be a moment,\" He jerked his thumb at the pantry and spoke in a deliberately sterner tone to the man still chuckling at nothing next to him. \"Charlie, get the captain's share and be quick about it.\" \n\nCharlie unwisely chose to ignore the order, or at least his enthusiasm for his next joke overwhelmed his reason, and perhaps his hearing as well. \"Beggin' your pardon missus, but did I ever tell you the one about the rabbit-\" \n\n\"Now!\" Mr. Munro's voice cut through whatever haze surrounded the young man's head and the gangly body leapt to obey. Kenna and the cook watched him disappear into the pantry. \"You'll have to beg his pardon, Mistress. He's got a bit ahead of himself and two left feet to find his way back.\" Kenna's lips twitched at the image of the awkward sailor circling himself on two feet twisting the same way. \n\nShe turned back to the cook and nodded, \"I assure you, Mr. Munro, I take no offence to his...\" She paused, considering her choice of words. \"...enthusiasm.\" \n\nMr. Munro was about to speak again but the shouting in the hall beyond them erupted again. Kenna jumped and turned to see Roland about to descend the last few steps into the galley. His eyes caught hers, his face serious but blank, before he turned back to see to his crew. Kenna felt a strange swell of pressure in her chest and deeper in her gut when she saw his expression, but instead of trying to decipher what it was she was feeling she turned back to Mr. Munro. He was lean for a cook, too strong-looking to let her imagine he wouldn't be put to better use on deck, but she had tasted his food and she wasn't surprised the crew kept him here. A good cook was worth more than another gunner. \n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Munro, is it not normally the quartermaster's task to settle arguments amongst the crew?\" \n\nThe cook raised his eyebrows a bit at her. Short of her singing or storytelling, few beyond the captain had heard her speak that many words together unprompted. He inclined his bald head in agreement. \"Aye, you're not wrong. But Mr. Dooley is still new to the job, and a bit too handy with the dice to keep the men from doing it. Perhaps he'll work his way into the role sometime soon, give the captain a bit of a rest.\" The man's large hands assembled several bowls on the cutting block and he turned to stir the stew. \n\nKenna was quiet, still considering what he'd said when Mr. Munro surprised her by speaking up again. \"He's not the worst we've ever had.\" He looked back at her and saw the question in her face. \"Mr. Dooley, I mean. We've had worse quartermasters aboard. Captain Dougray wasn't the most discerning of fellows.\" \n\nKenna's hands had begun to relax in her pockets but the mention of the man she'd stabbed drove her fingernails back into her palms. Her unease must have been obvious, for Mr. Munro picked up his story again quickly. \"Before Mr. Roland got voted in, less than a year ago, we had a Mr. Freeman on our crew. Good chap, blond as a Swede and red as a lobster. Aboard he was one thing, a fine sailor and a decent quartermaster. But the minute that man's feet touched the sand he was drunker than an Irishman at a funeral on his birthday.\" \n\nKenna relaxed a bit at the joke. Mr. Munro had a quiet way about him as well as a casual cadence, so she felt no need to ignore him as she did Mr. Hansen. \"Of course, what a man does on the beach is his own business but he had a bad habit of making a mess of our orders. Once we left with barely enough wood to mend the ship in a light rain much less after the storm that left us full of holes a week later. The next time it was sails and powder. But the last time did him in. He decided to have a go at the butcher's daughter right there on our order and got chased off without any of the meat for our trip, or the purse to buy more.\" \n\nMr. Hansen bounded back into the room, but he caught Munro's eye and snapped his mouth shut. He dropped the burlap sack on the block with a disappointed huff and moved back to serving the mead. \"Men will put up with a lot, and he was a good sort so we laughed off most of the other mishaps. But nothing turns mens' minds around like empty stomachs.\" Mr. Munro stirred the stew with a nod, silently declaring it done and took up one of the large, lidded bowls Kenna would be tasked with carrying. \n\n\"What happened?\" Kenna asked, no thought that she might not want to know the answer. \n\nMr. Munro looked back at her, his face studiously serious. \"He helped make stew. Lasted nigh on four weeks if I remember correctly.\" He poured the next ladle of the meaty liquid into the bowl with an intentionally languid movement. \"Best meals I ever made.\" \n\nKenna's eyes went wide when she caught his meaning. Her lips split into a grin of their own accord and she clapped her hand over her mouth as a laugh escaped her throat. The cook gave her the smallest of smiles, his face quietly triumphant as he finished fitting the meal together. Kenna could not keep from giggling into her palm and was unprepared to take the food when it was offered. \n\nShe composed herself just enough to take the burlap and stacked bowls and she gave Mr. Munro another grin. \"But how did you manage the keep for a full month?\" Her voice was still full of her laughter. She felt it in her shoulders, as if her laugh had shaken something loose. My goodness, how long had it been? \n\nThe mischievous smile that crept across the cook's face was unprecedented in her experience, but she decided she liked it all the same. \"It's a matter of packing salt in the right places, Mistress.\" \n\nShe laughed again and shook her head. She turned to Mr. Hansen to collect their mead, but he was staring at her slack-jawed. A prickling sensation erupted on the back of her neck as she came to realize the low hum of conversation that had been going on behind her had completely ceased. She swallowed at the sight of all those silent faces staring at her. \n\n\"Don't mind them.\" Mr. Munro spoke up behind her and drew her attention back to the only friendly face in the room. \"They just ain't never heard you laugh much less smile.\" He gave her another reassuring smile which she returned. \"Go on now,\" he said with a nod towards the steps. \n\nKenna let her hair fall forward as she moved past the men. Her smile had stayed with her, and she didn't need them staring and ruining the first bit of fun she'd had on this god-forsaken ship. Back on the lower deck the men were scattered, and Roland was having words with Ned who looked at least somewhat cowed. Kenna made her way over towards the pair but stopped short of joining the conversation. \n\nRoland jerked his head in the direction of his cabin and she took it to mean she shouldn't wait for him. She made her way with the burden, more used to the sway of the ship now but somehow still unsteady without the ever-present hand on her arm. \n\nWhen she reached the cabin she set out the food and drink and took her seat. The boat dipped and rolled with their pace. She knew they'd been making better time with the repairs complete. Roland had seemed more relaxed, in her estimation, because of it. But then the crew had started fighting more in the absence of the extra work. The loss of Captain Dougray had been more divisive than expected. It seemed the last quartermaster was not his only questionable hire and the crew was brimming with dangerous men who had been promised much more than they were going to receive. \n\nThe thought of the ill-fated Mr. Freeman brought her smile back. There was something in Mr. Munro's telling of it that had surprised her and made her laugh before her mind could drag her down with ill thoughts. She had let him tell her too, allowed herself a moment to wrap herself up in someone else's story instead of one of her own. She smiled and shook her head. It had been far too long since she'd done that. \n\n\"Something amusing, Kenna?\" She jumped at the sound of Roland's voice and turned towards the door, surprised that she hadn't heard him approach. Her smile disappeared and she ducked her head. The man's effect on her was still confounding and her body coiled in anticipation when she heard him speak her name. \n\n\"Mr. Munro told me of your predecessor and his unfortunate fate,\" she said softly. Roland strolled easily over to his seat and took it, relaxing and looking back at her over the table she had set for them. \n\n\"And what fate would that have been?\" Roland took the top off his bowl and dipped one of his biscuits into the liquid before looking back at her expectantly. \n\nKenna's lips twitched. \"He said your Mr. Freeman was a bit of a fish on the beach, in his cups as soon as you made land and it lead to him making a series of mistakes with your orders until finally he lost the crew an entire store of meat for the voyage.\" \n\nRoland looked back at her with a blank curiosity as he chewed. She decided he hadn't heard the story before and the thought occurred to her that she might be able to get a laugh out of him as well. \n\n\"As you know, hungry men are harder to charm, so it seems resentment built up until the crew found a way to relieve the meat shortage by volunteering their quartermaster to make the stew.\" She paused, trying to pull in the smile that threatened to overwhelm her lips and ruin the joke. Roland stopped his eating and looked back at her with an expression she could not interpret. \n\nHe leaned back in his chair again and studied her, the smile she'd been hiding disappeared under his scrutiny. \"You found this story amusing?\" his voice was similarly inscrutable. \n\nShe didn't entirely know how to answer. \"I suppose I found the absurdity of it comical, yes.\" A strange pit had started in her stomach. This is what she got for attempting levity with her jailor. \n\nFor a long moment Kenna did her best not to squirm under his look. Why must every interaction be so fraught? She looked down at the stew and decided she lacked an appetite. \n\n\"I didn't think that would have been the one,\" Roland said thoughtfully. She raised startled eyes to beg more of an explanation. \"A fortnight ago some of the crew made a wager on who would be the first to get you to laugh, or at least smile. I do believe you've made Mr. Munro quite a bit of money tonight.\" He offered her a small smile of his own and Kenna nearly fell off her chair when she sensed no mocking or sneering in the expression at all. \n\nShe thought it over for a moment and suddenly a great many interactions from the last several weeks made more sense. \"Poor Mr. Hansen,\" she said finally. \n\nRoland chuckled and Kenna swore the world had been turned inside out and she'd failed to notice. \"Indeed,\" he said in agreement and he began to eat again. For a moment Kenna could only stare but soon she too took up her meal. \n\n\"Why didn't you think I'd find Mr. Freeman diverting?\" Kenna asked when he had finished. \n\nRoland looked back at her. \"I thought you might take it seriously.\" Kenna's incredulity was poorly masked and he continued. \"The tales of what we pirates get up to have been often overstated, in many cases entirely invented. It seemed reasonable given your attitude towards the crew that you might think they were base enough to resort to cannibalism when frustrated with a meal.\" \n\nKenna tilted her head and took a long moment to look at the man across from her, for he was only a man. Despite her earliest impressions, Kenna knew that while his behavior and her shameful reactions to it were their own particular form of torment, he was no devil incarnate. \n\n\"Perhaps, living among them, I've come to see the stories about pirates to be vastly overstated.\" Her tone was light but she knew he would hear her challenge. But instead of the familiar predatory approach to quiet her, Roland chose to stay seated, his eyes studying her stiff posture as he defied her expectations. \n\n\"Perhaps.\" Was all he offered in response. For a moment she thought he would not speak again, but it was always his way to wait just a bit too long and set her off balance again when he began to speak. \"You did prove to be quite a challenge to the crew, despite seeming to prefer their company over mine.\" He turned his head in a mirror image to the way she had cocked hers moments before. \"At least at one point.\" \n\nThey had not spoken of her first song. His response had been a cooling of communication unless he was giving her orders, including the songs she was permitted to sing, or that she was only to take requests from the men. Their interactions inside his cabin had fared little better. He still used her often, manipulated her body into rapturous agony, but some barrier had been forged in her defiance and neither one of them had addressed it directly. \n\nSuch was their avoidance of the matter that Kenna found herself at a loss for how to respond. \n\nIt hadn't taken long after she'd finished the song for her to realize how foolish it had been. Had she succeeded she would have stirred a mutiny on a ship of pirates where she was still prisoner. Despite his use of her, the captain's treatment was not unendurable and the crew might very well have killed her or worse. She had never imagined success with the Golden Vanity. The impulse had been to injure him as he had done to her, with no thought to the consequences. She hazarded a look back at Roland and found him simply observing her, his face unreadable. \n\nWhat was she to respond to that? She could not admit the misstep. It had been her only triumphant moment, brief though it was. Was she ready to speak aloud the foolishness that had been behind it? She broke her gaze and looked away from him. He would understand from her face. She couldn't hide anything from him. ",
        "\"I hope your impression of me has improved for the next time. It was a little far off for the men to draw the conclusion you had intended.\" \n\nKenna's stomach dropped at his words but she tried desperately to keep that off her face. It was stupid of her, she who had survived so much, acting so impulsively. But she could not ignore the challenge as he had hers, and she spoke in his voice. \"Aye, I've spent the better part of two weeks planning an escape through the magic of song.\" \n\nRoland raised his brow and nodded, a look of quiet respect at her skill. But it was off, she could hear it. There was something different in the way her consonants resonated from her tongue to her palate. She frowned, the delivery of her words a perfect distraction from their content. They were too soft, her tongue too lazy to make them sound right. And her 's' was too long to follow his clipped delivery. \n\nShe tilted her tongue against the hard bone at the roof of her mouth, trying out his accent again in a hard 't' sound. She stopped abruptly and sealed her lips. The tightness in her face at her discovery lasted only a second but he saw it. He always did. \n\n\"Have you figured it out, Kenna?\" His voice was low and dangerous in her ears. She peeked up at him. How did he read her so completely? Even her father had been fooled when she wished him to be. Why could she not manage it with Roland? \n\nShe raised her head and looked back at him, taking in the slope of his nose and the angles of his jaw, both telling a different story now. She had speculated to herself of his origins, tucked away safely in her little space, imagining him being born out of a pit of snakes or sent from the fires of hell out into the ocean to trap her and drag her back with him. In some ways, this revelation was somewhat less surprising. \"You were raised amongst nobility.\" She tried to say it like he would, confident in the discovery. But it emerged a question. \n\nHis lips curled at one side but too subtly to be considered a smile or smirk. He looked at her for a long time before he spoke. \"I was.\" But he said no more, invited no response and yet he did not move or lift his eyes from hers. She did not feel that he was trying to intimidate her to silence but she could not decipher what he felt, or if he wished to continue speaking of it. Not for the first time she wished desperately that she was as astute as he. \n\nIt had been a fair while since she'd looked at him in the face for more than a moment. While she attempted to employ some of her faculties to interpreting his responses, the rest were busy ignoring the ache at her core that increased in urgency with his proximity. His skin was more sun-weathered than any other Englishmen on board which meant his blood was not pure, though his black hair and darker skin could not hide the patrician features now that the possibility existed; he had not just been raised by nobility, he was born of them. \n\n\"Your father.\" She said it softly, unsure if he wished her to continue down this line of thought. She was prepared to abandon it all, save it for when she could disappear into the crawl space and contemplate it in private. \n\nInstead Roland inclined his head ever so slightly, inviting her to continue. \n\n\"Your mother was not English. Italian, perhaps?\" His face remained still. She had figured it out but worried at insulting him, but his expression held no tolerance for her polite attempts to sidestep his less-desirable heritage. \"A gypsy.\" Again his head dipped slightly. \n\nThere could be many reasons why the illegitimate son of a noble and a gypsy would end up with an upper-class accent he couldn't entirely disguise, but she could only think of one that made sense to her. \"Your father must have loved your mother very much to raise you with all the trappings of the son of a lord.\" \n\nRoland's face betrayed nothing, or perhaps the lack of expression spoke volumes. Kenna stilled, feeling she'd made some blunder and should no longer continue. Roland's stare burned through her and she tried desperately not to squirm in her seat. Finally he lifted his gaze and turned his head, his eyes focused far beyond the walls of the ship. Kenna stayed quiet, waiting, praying she hadn't made her situation worse somehow. \n\n\"I don't believe you ever learned why Captain Dougray attacked your ship.\" She jumped when he finally spoke, the thoughtful tone more surprising than the words themselves. \n\n\"I understood it had something to do with an old grudge against Captain Jenkins, did it not?\" The change of topic was a relief, even if it was to speak of a man she had killed. It was clear to her that he had not simply abandoned the first line of questioning, and the potential connection between the two excited the wheels in her head. Kenna looked at him intently now that he had taken his eyes from her. He was tired, the weeks of endless work were beginning to wear on him. Her reaction to that realization troubled her in that it was not pure triumph or grim satisfaction at his troubles. \n\n\"Indeed. Jenkins was Dougray's commanding officer in the Royal Navy. I won't bore you with my rendition of the tale. Dougray had a knack for it and I could not do it justice. Suffice it to say that Jenkins made an error during his watch and when he was brought in to answer for it, he blamed Dougray, who being a simple sailor was not to be believed and was set to be punished. Jenkins chose the penalty and meted it out himself.\" Roland's eyes slid back to hers, holding her there. \"He was flogged before the crew.\" Kenna took a breath, the skin on her back seemed to tighten. \"It's impossible to say if Dougray was telling us the truth of the matter but he bore scars which no lie could exaggerate.\" \n\nKenna looked away, and felt a dreadful confusion settle into her chest. The scars on her own back grew heavy, her awareness of them fully engaged. For a moment she felt a flash of sympathy and guilt for the man she'd killed, whose face she still saw in her dreams as he died over and over again. But he had been a murderer, not just of the man who scarred him but of everyone on that ship and who knew how many before. The feeling of his hands on her, the evil intent in his eyes, No, she could not pity or excuse him. This deviation from Roland's original conversation was no longer welcome. \n\n\"I fail to see the connection between Captain Dougray's motivations and your parentage.\" She stiffened her posture as she spoke, the lack of proper garments having allowed her to sit without her back rigidly straight. \n\n\"Do you know why Captain Dougray met his end in his pursuit of Jenkins?\" Roland was staring at her but she refused to meet his eye, even if he did spare her the address of blame that was her due. \n\n\"No, I do not,\" she said, no longer trying to guess and play his games. She wanted to be done with this line of questioning and never speak of it again. \n\n\"Because he could not accept that the world did not care what happened to him.\" She did not gape as she wished to, but kept silent to allow this newest turn of the conversation. \"He could not live without imagining that his pain should be avenged, that the injustice had to be answered for. And he stirred the men to feel the same, to join in his quest for vengeance.\" She glanced up at him only to get caught in his intense eyes. \"The world does not care about injustice and pain. It will blithely continue despite all the wrongs visited upon us, and to imagine we deserve differently is to invite foolish choices and grave disappointment.\" He leaned forward, resting his chin on his fist as he held her there. \"Do you know who taught me that?\" \n\nThe answer was obvious, but the implications were terrible. \"Your mother,\" she whispered. \n\n\"Indeed.\" His voice held no anger and she could not understand why. \"My father educated me, kept me as he did in one of his many estates, because of an agreement he made with my mother. She had been difficult for him to control until he got her with child, and so he took the opportunity when it presented itself. But these types of things can only last for so long. My mother waited until I was old enough that I would not starve when he turned me out. When I was thirteen she took her own life to escape whatever he had inflicted on her for all those years.\" Kenna once again felt the dismay of pitying a man who deserved nothing but her ardent hatred. \n\nRoland continued, his tone no more emotional than it had been before. \"She could not tolerate a world that would leave her so, a family that abandoned her when she lay dying, the doctor who brought her back to health as a farmer nurses his prize cattle, the man who purchased her and kept her with him always so she could have no sanctuary from his desires.\" Roland spoke these horrors as though they had not occurred to the woman who birthed him. \"And so she left it, and in doing, condemned her child to be abandoned. Dougray could not let his injuries go unanswered in an indifferent world. You, Mistress Bell, suffer the same sickness.\" Kenna stared at him wide eyed to hear herself brought into these tales of woe. \"You believe the world should not allow the things that have happened to you, that are happening now, to occur. It has not dawned upon you that the cruelty you suffer is nothing unique, it simply is. I have accepted this truth\u2014all that has befallen me was not done to me, the wrongs I have borne were not part of a transactional cycle which must be met with payment or vengeance. I am not owed anything for my pain and neither are you. The sooner you accept this, the more likely it is you will survive.\" \n\nKenna stared at him, at a loss for what to say. Her instincts rejected every word he spoke. Of course there had to be some kind of justice in the world, retribution for sins and crimes committed. The very notion of civilization was based on the agreement between men that they owed each other actions and behaviors which would not arouse anarchy. When that was trespassed against, the guilty party must be held accountable. This was justice, in its divine and earthly forms. \n\nShe let her eyes sweep over him. He was a pirate, an agent of chaos. His existence was a challenge to that contract. Of course he would reject it, but that did not make it less true for her and everyone else not on this ship. Thus reassured, she dismissed his argument and settled herself firmly back in her own understanding. \n\nHe betrayed none of his thoughts to her. If he knew how roundly she had shredded his philosophy, he did not let it show. Instead he beckoned her with a curl of his fingers newly liberated from the weight of his chin. She hesitated, feeling the threat of his unspoken order, as if he could wring from her physically what she refused to compromise on mentally. \n\nShe stood, her back ramrod straight and she moved as though surrounded by yards of fabric. She would not simply give up on everything she knew of the world, the truths she believed in, just because some pirate was bedding her against her will. Let him believe whatever blasphemy he used to excuse his existence. She would not be taken in. \n\nShe came within reaching distance of him and stopped, her head high, hands folded before her. \n\n\"Do you know how I know your upbringing was similar to mine?\" He said, his voice low. Kenna did not look to him to give him the satisfaction of confirmation but once again she felt a stab of frustration that he had managed to see through her carefully curated disguises. Unlike him, she had altered her speech flawlessly to reflect her adopted station in life. \"It is because you don't believe me, because you cling to what you think you deserve never realizing that time has marched past and no one remembers whatever your family was anymore. No one is looking to restore you to any former life, and what is more, you don't warrant it. The natural cycle has given and taken with no concern towards you, and it will continue to do so long after we are all dead and gone.\" \n\nKenna did not know when she had lowered her eyes to his but by the end of his speech she was looking down towards his upturned face, drawn to the low purr of his voice which made even his nonsense seem palatable. \n\nHe raised his hand towards her hands. Kenna found herself a step backwards before she could think; the tightness in her neck and averted gaze told her she'd flinched as he reached for her. Her heart sped up; she hadn't meant to do any such thing. Surely he wouldn't be angry at what was merely habit. She quickly stepped back towards him, fingers shaking as she came back to where his hand hung in the air expectantly. \n\nThe large palms slid over her wrists and encircled one with his strong fingers. He tugged her gently until she came to sit on his lap, her posture still stiff and her nerves fraying as she tried in vain to calm herself. \n\n\"I have no interest in your pain, Kenna.\" He brushed the hair from her cheek, and she just managed to hold herself still when his hand appeared in her line of vision. \n\nCould that be? Her heart raced even as he settled her more firmly against his body. It was true he had never struck her but she had been terrorized in this very room, on this very table. She had seen it in his eyes when he had her, how closely he watched her face in her darkest moments. She looked down at her hands, realizing only then she was twining her fingers nervously. \"You like my fear, I've seen it. And pain is just another tool to instill the desired reaction from me.\" She could not look him in the eye from this close. \n\n\"I appreciate your fear only in as much as I can elicit the opposite reaction almost as swiftly.\" His hands pulled her shirt from the breeches and slid underneath the fabric to stroke her skin. \"I get to watch as it melts away even as you try to fight to keep it, until all that is left is pleasure.\" His hand crept to her side, the slide of his fingertips against her sensitive skin leaving tiny bumps in their wake. \n\n\"How can you do this,\" she steeled herself to continue, \"after all you've told me of your mother's fate?\" His hand never stopped, the other cupping her knee and sliding up the outside of her thigh. \n\n\"Therein lies the heart of it,\" Roland whispered, his breath against her neck far too gentle a caress. \"If the world is just,\" he punctuated his thought with a feather light kiss at the neckline of her shirt, \"then I would have learned a valuable lesson on how to treat others, that actions like those of my fathers were wrong and deserved a definitive and righteous reaction.\" He continued up the sensitive side of her neck, his kisses sending jolts of sensation across her body. \"But if I am right then there is no reprisal, either against him, or echoed in my own understanding of the civil contract.\" How could he speak of such things now? Kenna gasped as his lips found the angle of her jaw, the feeling radiating in creeping prickles across her scalp, in the tightening of her nipples and the pulsing heat that churned in her core. \n\nWas it she that pressed against him so licentiously? Had he not pulled her against him so that she felt his arousal against her hip? Surely she had not shifted so as he spoke. His hand slipped between her legs, coming up against the apex of her thighs and cupping her heat through the cloth. Was it her voice that moaned as he stroked her skin, his other hand dancing over her ribs to the underside of her breast? She felt herself sinking, the fear and nerves melting into the need that unfurled inside her. At least two days had passed since he had touched her, occupied as he'd been, and the gnawing anticipation reared its head now that she was no longer pushing it away. \n\nHe stood suddenly and Kenna toppled from his lap into his arms. He pushed her breeches off and settled her on the edge of the table, her legs spread easily for him as he took his place between them. She steadied herself with her hands against the table behind her. His hand found her swollen flesh and wasted no time spreading the cream she offered across her sensitive folds. His other hand slid up her neck, following the trail his kisses had left. His thumb found that sweet spot below the angle of her jaw and she leaned into his touch before she could think to stop. \n\nBut she did, her mind catching up, trying to stop what was already too far gone. She stilled her hips which had raised themselves to the stroking of his fingertips, his touch too light for their taste. She pulled her head straight, her neck stiff against his palm. That thumb pressed in, tilting her chin up until her eyes met his, and once again she was caught in his studying gaze. \n\nHis fingers slid into her, the walls of her channel clamping down even as she tensed her jaw to keep from moaning again. How shameless she had become. His thumb slid up, circling that bundle of flesh which he manipulated so easily. The path narrowed, a second finger stretched her, his eyes bore into hers, seeing past the fight, past her secrets and lies into that piece of her that desperately needed release. Her body twisted out from her control and she ground down onto his hand. Her lips parted and her back arced, and still he held her gaze. \n\n\"That's it, Kenna,\" his voice ran like fingers down her spine. \"This is when your fear and fight vanish.\" The pressure inside her rose, her eyes watered as she looked up, the tingling sensation running across her skin as it coiled in her core. \"This is when I have you.\" His words reached into her and pulled loose all the gathered sensations, stoking that dark need she could not bring herself to acknowledge. Kenna's eyes drifted shut as her body tensed on his rooting hand. In that darkness she felt the pleasure tear through her body, decimating her once again. \n\nAnd in that anguished climax, she felt the peace of losing herself. Her body and all violence done to it was left behind as she floated away. \n\nHis lips came down on hers, coaxing and gentle. In those brief moments before she came back to herself, she lifted her hands to his cheeks and pulled him in deeper. His hair slipped through her fingers as his tongue ran against hers and she made small, sweet sounds into his mouth. He had her. But the reprieve was short and the reality that she was caressing her captor slid her hands from his neck and down to his chest where she pressed her palms in. Her kiss faded and she pulled away to look up at him. \n\n\"Just because one steers the ship, does not make him captain.\" She spoke around his buried fingers, through the tremors that still ran up her body. \"Stoking a person's pleasure cannot mean ownership.\" \n\nDid she imagine the disappointment in his face as she pulled away? But there was his smirk planted on his tight lips. \"Perhaps not, Kenna.\" His fingers slipped from inside her and he straightened above her, forcing her head to tilt further to watch him. \"But your pleasure is a battleground you engage on constantly despite the fact that you always lose. Dominion of property is just a matter of circumstance, and of my ownership of you there can be little doubt, pleasure or no.\" \n\nKenna braced herself for his continued assault, forcing her legs to remain open and waiting, inviting no further argument with him. His easy claim to her person pricked her pride, as it always did, but she was still languid from her release and she let it go more easily than her nature should have allowed her to. But Roland did not move to remove his clothing or any more of hers. He stood there, considering her from his great height, his large muscled arms folded across his chest. \n\nThe pause in their activities made Kenna self-conscious and she closed her legs and pulled the large shirt down to cover her cooling sex. She did not look up at him but waited for some signal that he was to return to the coupling she had grown accustomed to. Two full days he had not taken his pleasure with her, he had barely been back to the cabin to sleep before leaving to answer some banging knock or warning bell. Her eyes crept up to his face and she saw his usual seriousness but without the glint in his eye as he pursued her, the relish he usually took in forcing her to feel his coerced pleasure. ",
        "Silently he reached for her hand and led her to the bed where she sat stiffly as he removed most of his clothing. He crawled onto the berth and pulled her to lie next him, her back cradled in his large chest, his arm draped over her. She shifted, confused when she felt no arousal pressed against her bottom, threatening the cleft there. \n\n\"Quiet, Kenna.\" He said when she moved against him. \"Go to sleep.\" \n\nShe never did fall asleep with him and that night was no different. She spent far too much time in the cabin and had ample time to doze and rest when she wasn't brought up on deck to sing or to the mess to tell tales which only occupied a few hours in the day. A few more were spent mending clothing or some other small task she could complete while locked away in the cabin, rope looped around her ankle when his hand could not be on her arm. All of that meant that she often lay awake at night, listening to him sleep when he was there or waiting for him to return when he was not. \n\nHours trickled by as she held herself still. The ship rocked on the waves, dipping as the winds increased and the sounds of the late watch trampled overhead. Beyond the cabin the night sky swirled with clouds and the lone man above their bed saw the flicker of what looked like a light far in the distance. When the rapping on the door started Kenna closed her eyes and feigned sleep even as Roland dragged himself from her side and secured her ankle before he left. When dawn crept into the room soon after, it found the bed vacant, only the trail of the rope dangling down from her crawl space. \n\nThat day she emerged from those shadows before he returned and brought her down. Instead he found her several hours later, asleep on the berth for the first time since he'd removed her chain. \n\n*** \n\nSo what did you guys think? Worth the wait? I hope so. \n\nSpecial thanks to DeathandTaxes and MasterfulJim for beta and editing help. \n\nAgain, thanks to AwkwardMD for her content help and talking through the characters and humor with me. If you are a fantasy fan and love good satire I cannot recommend highly enough her \"Terrible Company\" series over in SciFi. Seriously one of the funniest things I've ever read. And she just posted a new chapter I finally get to read now that I'm done with exams :). \n\nUnfortunately, thanks to the whole med school thing, I haven't started chapter 7 though I do have bits of it written (this is the first thing I've written out of order, and maybe not the best decision I ever made). I would love to be able to say when I'll be posting again but it may be a few weeks. I'm hoping to finish this story by the time school starts up again in September so send me a note to bother me and keep my nose to the grindstone. \n\nThank you all for being such lovely readers and being patient and encouraging with us part-time writers when life gets busy."
