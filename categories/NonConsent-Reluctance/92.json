        "Thank you to Deathmarch4 for his review and thoughts on this chapter. Your input helped tremendously.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nContinuity Error: In Chapter 1, Michael's private wing should have been described as the east wing rather than the west wing. \n\n____________________________________________________\n\nMichael woke up the next morning feeling energized. On his way to the kitchenette for coffee, he eased Mariah's door open to peek in. She looked serene, asleep on her side with her arm resting over Henry. Henry raised a furry brow at Michael. Michael backed out and closed the door gently.\n\nThe coffee smelled wonderful. He wondered how Mariah took hers. It had to be years since she had a cup. The thought of going so long without coffee made him savor his own. As he finished off his cup, he thought about his plans for the day. He couldn't wait to get his hands on her again, but he was also looking forward to getting to know her better.\n\nHe was coming to the realization that years of watching her over the security camera feeds had not conferred as great an understanding of her as he had believed. It was nerve-wracking, but it was also exciting. It wasn't that she was different; she was the same person he knew her to be, but his knowledge was incomplete. He had not anticipated all the dimensions of her personality that he hadn't had an opportunity to see on the video feed.\n\nWhat surprised him most was her vulnerability. The security cameras he could access were only in public places or offices. Even in public, people let their guard down sometimes. Although he believed he had seen Mariah with her guard down, he had never seen her in a truly private space until yesterday. And of course, he had never seen her grapple with a choice like the one he presented.\n\nHe knew Mariah hadn't wanted to give up any of her independence, but it was for the best. She would be safe and comfortable inside the compound and he was committed to doing anything in his power to make her happy here. He wasn't foolish enough to believe that she saw the safety and relative luxury of the compound as a fair tradeoff for the restrictions he imposed. She accepted his terms because he was offering something far more important to her. The project to alleviate the suffering in Ashland was exactly what she wanted, and he was uniquely positioned to offer it to her.\n\nHe had taken a huge risk by imposing a requirement that she offer her companionship and sexual submission. He knew how terrible it sounded. It was necessary, though. There was no way he could have had her right under his nose every day without pursuing her. She would not have welcomed his advances. Her hostility toward him during their first meeting demonstrated that much. He would not have stopped pursuing her, and it would have made it impossible to work together.\n\nBy establishing the nature of his access to her in the beginning, he prevented a situation that would inevitably sabotage the project. He realized how suspect it was that the solution he devised conveniently included sex with the woman he had wanted for years, but his rationale was sound. She accepted his terms voluntarily. It was done, and he wasn't sorry. His cock swelled as he remembered her wrists tethered to his bed last night, breasts bouncing as she absorbed his thrusts and shuddered around him. No, he was never going to regret that. On the whole, he'd been pleasantly surprised that she had accepted the sexual aspect of their relationship so well.\n\nSex was the one area where he truly had no idea what to expect from her. As far as he knew, she hadn't had any serious relationships since he began watching her. He assumed she had sexual encounters, but he had not had the ability or desire to find out about them. Once, he had seen a courier demanding sex before he would sell her the medical supplies she wanted. It had been weeks after that before he could bring himself to return to the video feeds.\n\nMariah's initially reluctant response to his advances yesterday did not surprise him. What did surprise him was the level of her attraction to him despite her clear preference to avoid intimacy. He had believed that one of the benefits of their arrangement would be that he wouldn't have to face the uncertainty of trying to seduce her. That was before he discovered the thrill of it. She was always evading, slipping away like water, but she couldn't hide her reaction to him.\n\nHe could see it in the way her eyes grew darker and unfocused. He heard it in the way her breath became quick and shallow, and the way it caught in her throat when he touched her. He saw it in the way her pulse beat in the hollow of her throat when her heart raced like a rabbit's. Her inability to disguise her natural response to him lent her an air of naivete that made him want to push her further.\n\nShe harmonized contradictions in ways he found as beautiful as they were bewildering. Despite her arousal, her diffidence never completely faded. It merely blended with a more sultry, lustful version of herself. The juxtaposition was intoxicating. One moment Mariah was standing there, not wanting to take her bra off, and the next she was greedily licking precum from his fingers. She was suddenly shy about being tied up, but then she was arching to meet his strokes in a truly wanton display.\n\nHe looked in on her again before he showered and shaved. It seemed she had woken and fallen asleep again before she made it out of bed. The covers were kicked off, and she was laying on her stomach with one arm hanging over the edge of the bed. He congratulated himself on picking out the aqua sleep shorts and little white crop top she was wearing. Her top had ridden up her back, showing off the curve of her spine.\n\nIt was her ass, though, that Michael couldn't look away from. One of her legs was bent at the knee and the other was straight. The position canted her hips at an angle that raised one buttock. The little cotton shorts clung to her and exposed the lower curve of her ass. He was itching to dig his fingers into those cheeks.\n\nMariah's hand twitched in her sleep, and he withdrew quickly. He didn't want her to wake up to the sight of him ogling her ass with a raging hard-on. Besides, he had arrangements to make before she woke up.\n\nAs soon as he was showered, shaved, and dressed, he went in search of Daniel. He found him in the garage with his twin sister, Amy, changing the oil in one of the compound's vehicles. In addition to being first-rate mechanics, Daniel and Amy did all sorts of handyman projects around the house. They had a natural aptitude for anything structural or mechanical, and possessed MacGyver-like imaginations. If you gave them some paperclips and tinker toys, they could probably build a spaceship. His request this morning was much simpler. They assured him it would take no more than an hour to complete.\n\nAfter he left the twins, he checked in with Marcus about the day's meals. Michael didn't know what he hoped to accomplish, but it made him feel like he was doing something to contribute to Mariah's care. He belatedly realized that he hadn't offered her dinner last night. He hoped she had eaten something since she had lunch with him yesterday.\n\nMarcus listed Mariah's breakfast options and offered to bring up a tray once she chose what she wanted. Michael was leaving the kitchen when an idea struck him. \"Marcus, could you make a lunch that Mariah and I can eat outside? I want to take her to see the pond this afternoon, and I think she might like a picnic.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Marcus assured him. \"I'll have it packed up for you before noon. That's a lovely idea, Michael, and such a beautiful day for it.\" He was pleased to see him taking an interest. Michael usually downed whatever was put in front of him as though eating was just an interruption, and he rarely seemed to do anything just for fun.\n\nWith Marcus's breakfast menu more or less memorized, Michael headed upstairs to check on sleeping beauty. He stopped on the way for a cup of coffee, cream, and sugar from the third-floor kitchenette. If she wasn't awake yet, the smell of coffee was sure to get her up. He knocked at the door to her room and let himself in without waiting for an answer. Mariah was awake and curled up on the window seat. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was tousled. She blinked sleepily at him.\n\n\"Good morning, kitten,\" Michael greeted her. \"Would you like some coffee?\"\n\nShe perked up immediately. \"You have coffee?\" She sniffed the air. \"Oooh... you do!\"\n\nMichael handed her the coffee, cream and sugar and watched her fix it the way she liked. She raised the mug to her mouth with both hands and looked at him over the rim as she took a long, slow sip. \"Soooo good,\" she announced. She closed her eyes to concentrate on the next sip. Michael thought she looked like a priestess having a religious experience.\n\n\"What would you like for breakfast this morning?\" he asked when she finally put the cup down.\n\n\"Thanks, but I don't want anything. I'm not really a morning person.\"\n\n\"You still need to eat breakfast, sweetheart. I don't think you even had dinner yesterday.\"\n\n\"But I had a big lunch.\"\n\n\"That was yesterday. It doesn't count for today.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of cream in my coffee. That's like drinking milk for breakfast,\" she argued.\n\nMichael was unimpressed. \"Don't be difficult, kitten. We've got lots of things to do today, and we can't leave to do any of them until you eat breakfast.\"\n\nShe shrugged and acquiesced.\n\n\"So, what do you want for breakfast?\"\n\n\"I'm not ready yet.\"\n\n\"When should I tell Marcus to have your breakfast ready?\" Michael asked suspiciously.\n\n\"In a couple of hours.\"\n\nHe sighed. When Mariah was at a disadvantage, she just rearranged the playing field. On impulse, he tried a different tack. \"You don't even want a blueberry muffin?\"\n\n\"There are blueberry muffins?\"\n\n\"Mmhmm. Marcus made them just this morning.\"\n\n\"Oooh... I'll go get one,\" she said, as though she hadn't just been arguing against eating anything before noon.\n\nHe opened his mouth to respond, then closed it again. He wisely decided against saying the first few things that came to mind.\n\n\"I'll go down and get it for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't need to do that. I remember where the kitchen is. I need to go down to let Henry out anyway.\"\n\nShe was looking for Henry's leash when Michael stopped her. \"I think you're missing something.\"\n\n\"My shoes?\"\n\nHe shook his head and smirked.\n\n\"A key?\"\n\nHe shook his head again. His smirk was getting bigger with every wrong guess.\n\n\"I give up. What am I missing?\"\n\nInstead of answering, Michael brought her to stand in front of a full-length dressing mirror in the closet. He stood behind her, looking over her shoulder at the reflection of her very visibly outlined nipples. He ran a fingernail across a nipple through the thin material and watched it harden. She sucked in her breath with a hiss.\n\n\"Still tender, kitten?\"\n\nHe brought his other hand up and cupped both breasts. With a few swipes of his thumbs, her nipples were poking obscenely into the pajama top. He pinched them one at a time, listening to the little sounds she made.\n\n\"I don't know if you want to go downstairs like that.\" Michael gave her breasts a squeeze and watched them strain against the fabric. When he released them, one of his hands disappeared down the front of her shorts. He was fast, and before she could stop him, his finger was sliding between her folds. He was pleased to find her already wet and even a little swollen. He met her eyes in the mirror as he licked the taste of her pussy from his finger.\n\nMariah was getting that dazed look that Michael was becoming fond of, but she suddenly shook herself out of it. \"I've got to take Henry out.\" She ducked out of his arms and rummaged around for clothes. She found a sundress that she liked. In the meantime, Michael took it upon himself to pull out a black bra and panty set for her. She rolled her eyes at him, but took the proffered lingerie.\n\n\"Go ahead and put that on while I find something else for you to wear. The dress you chose would look lovely, but you're going to need a skirt and blouse today.\"\n\n\"Are shorts an option?\" she asked hopefully. She hadn't seen any, but she hadn't taken inventory.\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\nRealizing that Michael intended to stand there and watch her put the lingerie on, Mariah took it into the bathroom and shut the door. She quickly washed up, brushed her teeth, and arranged her hair. Once she put the bra on, she knew why Michael selected it. She thought at first that it was the wrong size, but quickly realized the problem was the bra's design.\n\nThe bra only had half-cups, edged at the top with a band of lace. The cups were stiff, like a corset. Instead of holding her breasts in, the bra pushed them up and held them out, framed between the shoulder straps in what was essentially a display case. Her breasts jiggled in the cups whenever she moved, and the only thing covering her nipples was the lace at the top of the cups. A notch between the lace band and the bra straps prevented the lace from offering any containment. It was more like a decorative flap. The panties weren't much better.\n\nShe called out the bathroom door, \"Michael, could I please have a real bra?\"\n\n\"But Henry needs to go out.\"\n\nShe blew out her breath in frustration. Michael was not going to cooperate and Henry did need to go out. She was not going to force his hand today over a bra. She was certain that his plans for her would be the same regardless of which bra she wore.\n\nMichael seemed to be intent on keeping the sexual tension high. That was fine with her. She would much rather they both stayed focused on the sexual aspect of their relationship. It was a relatively safe way to avert the sort of conversations she wanted to avoid. She was uneasy about his displays of fondness towards her, and was even more uneasy about how likeable she was finding him. Maybe likeable was not the right word. More like not hate-able. Except when he picked out clothes. When it came to lingerie, he was a total pig.\n\nShe adjusted the bra as well as she could and ignored Michael's smirk when she walked back out, trying not to jiggle. \"You owe me a muffin,\" she told him, mostly to get the smirk off his face and his eyes off her chest. She was rewarded with a look of exasperation.\n\nHe handed her a cornflower blue peasant blouse with a low, square neck and a flared raspberry skirt. He even had a pair of sandals laid out for her. She threw on the clothes, eager to get downstairs. She eyed Michael's dark jeans and heather gray tee shirt. They looked unforgivably good on him.\n\n\"I thought blouses and skirts were the dress code today. Where are yours?\"\n\n\"I must have left them at the cleaner.\"\n\nAs they made their way to third-floor sitting room, she was still trying to figure out what she could do in a skirt and blouse that she could not have done in the dress. All she could get out of Michael was, \"You'll see.\" At the end of the hall, Michael got in the elevator. She decided to take the stairs with Henry, mostly to irritate Michael. She really was not a morning person.\n\nShe hadn't counted on Henry wanting to sniff each stair individually. When she reached the bottom of the stairs, Michael was already coming back from the kitchen with a muffin. Outside, she let Henry off the leash and he trotted over to the tree line to take care of his business. Mariah stood with Michael in the warm sun, eating the muffin. It was delicious. She noticed Michael wasn't eating anything, but decided to save that observation for the next time he tried to cram breakfast down her throat.\n\n\"Would you mind if I let Henry run around for a bit before I take him back in? He's been cooped up in my room and I'm sure he'd like to stretch his legs.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He already liked Henry. He also realized that being nice to Henry meant brownie points. It was a win-win. \"I was wondering, does he have stay in your room all the time?\"\n\n\"No, I was hoping he could have free run of your private wing. Duncan and Julia, too. If you don't mind keeping the doors to your wing closed, I could leave my room open for them to come and go. You'd just need to shut your bedroom door to keep them out.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Michael agreed. \"But if you want, they can have access to the whole house.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that.\" She leaned up and kissed his cheek. Michael knew when he was being manipulated, but he didn't mind a bit. She was welcome to ply him with kisses all day long.\n\n\"I'd better restrict them to your wing for now, though. The house is so big, and I haven't even seen it all to make sure it's safe for them and from them.\"\n\n\"Safe from them? You make it sound like they're arsonists or termites.\"\n\n\"No, they're merely vandals and thieves. If you had a teddy bear collection, Henry would steal the teddy bears and slobber all over them. If you had an aquarium, it would need to have a lid to keep Duncan out of it. That sort of thing.\"\n\nMichael laughed. \"I'll be sure to hide my teddy bears.\"\n\nHearing his name, Henry came bounding over to them. He made a play bow directly in front of Michael.\n\n\"He wants you to play with him,\" Mariah explained.\n\nMichael held up his empty hands. \"I don't have anything for you to fetch, bud.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to play fetch. Here, I'll show you.\" She charged at Henry and he took off. He looped and darted and dived, but never ran too far ahead of her. Sometimes, Henry and Mariah switched, and he chased her while she dodged and feinted. Michael couldn't tell what rules of the game governed who was supposed to chase who at any given time.\n\nMariah was out of breath by the time she walked back to Michael. \"Like that.\"\n\nTo Henry's delight, Michael rushed at him. Michael got the hang of it quickly, and soon he was anticipating Henry's setups. He settled into an easy lope when he ran after Henry, but when it was Michael's turn to be chased, he broke away with explosive speed. Not as fast as Henry, but impressive, and he was agile enough to swerve and turn on a dime. His movements had a natural grace Mariah found compelling.\n\nWhen they came jogging back, Henry's tongue was lolling out of his mouth. He flopped over dramatically at Mariah's feet.\n\n\"You broke my dog!\"\n\n\"Are you kidding? That vicious animal tried to run me down!\"\n\n\"Okay, Henry, you vicious beast. Time to get you inside.\" Mariah clipped the leash to Henry's collar.\n\n\"Hold on,\" Michael stopped her. \"I was planning to take you around the compound today to show you the outbuildings and introduce you to everyone. Would you like to take Henry with us? I was going to get a golf cart from the garage. He could ride in it or run along beside us.\"\n\nMariah gave him a big smile. \"I'd love that.\"\n\nIn the garage, Michael opened a key safe with his thumbprint and retrieved the key to one of the golf carts. Mariah counted seven of them, and the empty spots suggested that a few were currently in use or parked elsewhere. Michael came around to the passenger's side of the cart with Mariah. Once she was seated, he leaned over her and pulled the neckline of her blouse down below her breasts. He caught her hands when she tried to pull her it back up.\n\n\"No, Mariah. Let me look.\"\n\n\"But the camera...\"\n\n\"I'm standing between you and the camera. Nobody but me is going to see you, but I will see you, kitten. Just be good for me and we'll be ready to go in a minute.\"\n\nShe shivered in the cool garage. Her nipples were hard and puckered, and they were pushing against the band of lace that covered them. Michael folded the band of lace down, leaving her nipples exposed above the half cups of the bra. He stroked them lightly.\n\n\"I told you last night that I was going to enjoy playing with your nipples. Are they sore, Mariah?\"",
        "She nodded reluctantly.\n\nHe spent a few moments caressing her nipples to sensitize them. The soreness became a pleasurable ache. It was strangely soothing. She bit her lip and looked away. She didn't want Michael to see the way it made her feel, but he didn't allow her to hide. He tilted her chin up until she met his eyes. When he leaned down to kiss her, he was slow and gentle. He deepened the kiss until he heard her breathing become erratic.\n\nWhen he pulled away, she had the slightly dazed look he wanted to see. He gave each nipple a gentle pinch and flipped the band of lace back up. He raised the neckline of her blouse up to cover her breasts. \"Thank you, sweetheart. We can get going now.\"\n\nMariah tried to process what just happened as Michael drove the cart to the exit. Beside the tunnel Jack took yesterday, there was a ramp leading up. A button on the golf cart's dash opened a sliding panel in the ceiling at the end of the ramp, and they drove up the ramp and out into the sunlight. The exit from the garage came out on a small cement pad not far from the house. From there, Michael steered towards a path that curved around behind the trees at the back of the lawn.\n\nThe landscaped lawn ended at the line of trees. Beyond, the land was beautiful in its natural state. Small stands of aspen edged meadows and crowned hilltops. Wildflowers grew interspersed with the meadow grass. They drove over a wooden bridge that spanned a small creek and arrived at the edge of a cultivated field. A potting shed and greenhouse stood beside the field, and a golf cart was parked nearby.\n\n\"We grow our own produce here, and what we don't use finds its way to Lois's shop in town. Seth's probably in the greenhouse fussing over flowers. He handles the gardening and the groundskeeping and still finds time to grow flowers nobody knows what to do with. He's Paula's husband. I think you met their son, Andy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Andy helped bring up my things when we moved my stuff. Nice guy.\"\n\nA spry man with graying hair and vividly blue eyes hurried out of the greenhouse to meet them. \"Mariah, this is Seth.\" Seth nodded.\n\n\"I'm glad to meet you, Seth. Michael was just mentioning that you are responsible for all the landscaping. I don't know how you have time to do that and grow food, too, but it's gorgeous.\"\n\n\"Oh, I like to keep busy.\" He offered her a hand, then withdrew it with a laugh when he realized his hand was covered in dirt.\n\nHenry took the opportunity to introduce himself by snuffling Seth's hand and sneezing.\n\n\"This is Henry. He really likes dirt.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong with a little dirt!\"\n\n\"But it probably shouldn't be inhaled,\" Michael remarked. \"So, since the entire compound is one big gossip chain, I imagine you've heard that Mariah and Henry are staying with us, right?\"\n\nSeth's eyes twinkled. \"I believe the Missus might have mentioned it once or twice last night.\"\n\nHe turned to Mariah. \"Don't listen to him. Only about half of us are gossips. The other half just listen.\" He grinned. \"But don't let that bother you. Everyone is just happy you're here and excited to meet you.\"\n\n\"Michael, do I have time to show her around before you whisk her away?\"\n\n\"That's why we came to see you first, Seth.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" He took them into the potting shed. It held rows of trays of seedlings under lights. \"This is where I start them out. More of them survive that way. I like to keep an eye on the little 'uns anyhow. Starting the seedlings in advance gives us a head start on the vegetables that need to be replanted after they're harvested. If I pull up a carrot, I have a seedling ready to take its place,\" Seth explained.\n\n\"That's a good system. So, how do you know when to start the next batch of carrot seedlings to be ready at the right time?\"\n\nSeth looked like he had been waiting all his life for someone to ask him that question. He led them over to a desk and file cabinets in the corner of the potting shed. He pulled out two large ledgers and laid them open on the desk. \"I've kept planting records and harvest records since I started working here. I use them to forecast what we'll need and when.\"\n\n\"Could you work backwards from your records to figure out what supplies would be necessary to replicate your production elsewhere?\" Mariah wanted to know.\n\n\"Sure, I could do that.\"\n\n\"Mariah and I are talking about an agricultural project for people in town,\" Michael explained. \"We'll fill you in before long, but in the meantime, could you try to figure out the amount of land, seeds, fertilizer and tools that would be necessary for a family to maintain a garden that could produce enough to meet their own needs?\"\n\nSeth looked intrigued. \"I can estimate most of that. I can't be very accurate about how much produce is necessary to support each person because a certain young man has been pestering me into keeping the garden going at maximum capacity for years. Since so much of the produce goes mysteriously missing between here and the kitchen, it's hard for me to say how much is needed per person.\"\n\nMariah grinned. \"Young people these days!\" Michael rolled his eyes at her.\n\n\"Maybe you could get together with Marcus. I bet he could help with that.\"\n\nSeth nodded. \"I'll talk to him. Now, let me show Ms. Mariah the greenhouse.\"\n\nMichael and Mariah trailed around after him as he showed off the greenhouse. Two rows of orange, lemon, and lime trees were permanently planted in the ground down the center of the building, where the ceiling was highest. Seth explained that the citrus trees could not survive the winters outdoors. There was also a section of potted apple, cherry, peach, and pear saplings in several different stages of development, ready for the next several fall planting seasons.\n\nOther than the fruit trees, most of the greenhouse was empty during the summer. Mariah did spot a collection of orchids, though. Perhaps they were the flowers Michael thought nobody knew what to do with. Seth insisted on giving her a plant with purple blossoms for her room before they left.\n\nBy the time Michael got Mariah and Henry herded back into the golf cart, they were already behind the schedule he had planned. He was feeling a little frustrated until he looked over at Mariah and saw her happily examining the orchid Seth gave her. She had a little pollen on her nose, and he couldn't resist the temptation to brush it off with his finger. \"You had pollen on your nose,\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh.\" Mariah blushed, and he wondered why.\n\nWhen they left the garden, Michael drove to a long shed not far away. It was an industrial-looking building with large hanger doors along the sides. Inside, Michael showed Mariah an array of lawn and garden equipment, pointing out lawn mowers, tractors, combines, bobcats, and other machinery. Michael noticed Mariah's attention wandering as he went through the inventory. Catching her beneath her arms, he lifted her and sat her on the hood of a small tractor.\n\n\"My naughty little kitten wasn't paying attention.\"\n\n\"I was looking! I just couldn't tell which machines are which. That's all.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"And I'm not your naughty little kitten.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\" Michael grinned as he pulled her neckline down below her breasts again. He folded the lace down, exposing her nipples. \"I'll give you a pass for at least making an effort to look at the equipment, but since your attention doesn't appear to be devoted to the machinery, I'm going to find something else to occupy it.\" He outlined her areola with his fingertip. \"Any idea how I'm going to do that, kitten?\"\n\n\"I'm not a kitten.\"\n\nHe leaned forward to give her right nipple a sharp nip. He soothed the sting with the warmth of his tongue, then sucked her nipple suddenly between his teeth. She yelped. He kept sucking as he pulled back, until her nipple popped free. He blew across her wet skin, then repeated the treatment on her left nipple. \"Look at me, Mariah.\"\n\nShe tried to scowl at him, but her eyes were unfocused. Michael maintained eye contact as he slid his hand up her thigh beneath her skirt. \"Keep looking at me,\" Michael demanded when she started to look away. Her eyes widened when his finger slipped under her panties. He slid it up and down through her folds. \"So wet, kitten. So hot and wet.\" He fingered her clit gently. \"I don't think this is from hearing about the equipment. What do you think?\"\n\nWhen she ignored his question, Michael gave her clit a little pinch. \"What I'd like to know,\" Michael said as he returned to stroking her clit, \"is whether you were more excited because of what I was doing to your nipples just then, or more excited by the idea that I want to keep your them aching and tender all the time.\" He tapped her clit and Mariah squirmed.\n\nHe withdrew his finger and brought it to Mariah's lips. \"Open up, kitten.\" She wrinkled her nose and frowned, but she let him push his finger into her mouth.\n\n\"Suck.\" Mariah didn't look happy about it, but she did.\n\n\"You may not appreciate it, but I do. Lay back.\" When she did not immediately comply, he pushed back on her chest until she did. He quickly flipped her skirt up and pulled her thighs apart. His tongue stabbed into her channel, probing and circling.\n\nShe gasped and tried to sit up, but he held her still. He dragged his tongue through her pussy and stopped just short of her clit, ignoring her low whine. He repeated the long licks up through her folds until he was satisfied. Then he closed his lips around her clit and sucked it firmly. She shuddered.\n\nHe stood back and paused to admire his handiwork. Her pussy was swollen, flushed, glistening wet and looked oh-so-fuckable. With a sigh, he pulled her skirt back down and helped her sit up. He gave her nipples another tweak before he raised the lace band and pulled her blouse back up over her breasts. He lifted her from the machinery and set her back on the ground.\n\nHe took Mariah's hand and pressed her palm to his jeans where his erection strained against the denim. He felt her fingers moving beneath his hand and heard her nails scratch across the fabric when she tried to get a grip around his shaft through the thick denim. She was more successful wrapping her hand over the head of his cock. She squeezed it. Her grip shifted and she began rubbing her thumb and index finger firmly against the sides of his shaft, right below the head. He pulled her hand away. The idea was to drive her crazy, not the other way around.\n\nMichael pulled her along after him through the rows of machinery, back to the cart. She still looked dazed. He considered trying to get her attention, but he decided he would rather not distract her from the way she was feeling. Keeping her arousal high was turning out to be even more enjoyable than he had anticipated.\n\nHenry hopped in the cart with them, and Michael drove to their next stop. It was a large array of solar panels. Mariah was very interested, but he could tell that she was having trouble focusing. Her voice had a far-off quality, but she still had questions. Even though her questions lacked her usual sophistication, Michael thought it was clear she was taking in the details.\n\n\"Why is it in a box?\" she asked. \"The whole thing, I mean. Like a building that fell apart.\"\n\nIt took Michael a moment to decipher what she meant. A metal frame was built around the array. It consisted of vertical posts at each corner and horizontal posts in a rectangle connecting the tops of the vertical posts, like a line drawing of a shoe box. There were diagonal braces, but the panels were left as open to the sun as much as possible. Metal walls laid on the ground at the sides of the foundation.\n\nMichael explained. \"This is designed so that it can close to protect the array. Each of the solar cells is precious. We have some more panels in storage, but once those are gone, there is no way to replace them. We need to be able to protect them from storms. Everything is sitting on a big concrete block buried ten feet in the ground. The metal floor you see is a series of metal panels, bolted to each other and bolted into the concrete foundation.\"\n\n\"See that pillar in the middle of the array? We can use the chains you see going up to it to pull the walls up. They're on a motor we can start from inside the compound, but we have to finish manually. The roof is a flexible panel of overlapping plates that rolls out of one of the walls. We just pull the pieces together and bolt them to the frame.\"\n\nBack in the cart, Mariah was still mulling over the solar array. \"Do you think that if we got power to a solar panel factory, it would be possible to produce more panels?\"\n\n\"I don't know enough about how the factories operated to be sure, but I'm not optimistic. I found information about how the solar cells are made, but I still don't know if the factories have the facilities to make the materials used in their construction. If the silicon was produced somewhere else, powering the plant wouldn't help much. I don't remember all the details about how to make the silicon, but you start with sand and use all sorts of chemicals. It's pretty involved. The only reason I haven't given up on the idea is the hope that there's a large stockpile of the right kind of silicon already made.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound promising.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\n\nMichael started the cart's engine again. \"On a lighter note, do you think Henry might be ready for a break? I wanted to show you the pond. He has a disreputable look in his eye that makes me suspect he'll take a running leap into it. He'll get to see the pond eventually, but it might be best to show it to him when we're not going to be riding around in a golf cart with him afterward.\"\n\n\"Good point,\" Mariah agreed. \"Henry, he's onto you.\" Henry wagged his tail innocently.\n\nBack at the house, Michael parked by the front door. While Mariah took Henry and her new orchid upstairs, Michael picked up the picnic basket Marcus had ready for him in the kitchen.\n\nMichael beat Mariah back to the golf cart and stowed the basket in the locker on the back. He had time to radio the twins about their project before she got back. When she returned, he was back in the cart. Driving along the path he pointed out the night before, they reached the pond in only a few minutes. She was out of the cart as soon as it came to a stop.\n\n\"It's beautiful\"\n\nThe pond was surrounded by low-growing fescue grass. Gold and lavender irises proliferated around the water's edge and weeping willows grew on the banks behind them. The water itself was smooth as glass and sprinkled with lily pads. When Mariah walked to the edge, a frog jumped in with a loud plop. She poked around the edge of the pond for a while, looking under rocks, peering into the water, and smelling the irises. She came back to Michael with another smudge of pollen on her nose. He brushed it off and pulled her in for a kiss. \"Ready for lunch?\"\n\n\"But we just got here!\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" He pulled the picnic basket out of the locker on the back of the golf cart. As he hoped, Mariah was pleased and surprised. Marcus had thoughtfully included a blanket that they spread on the grass beneath a willow tree. The curtain of the tree's fronds made the spot feel secluded without impeding their view of the pond. Michael began unpacking the basket. He was going to have to thank Marcus again later. The picnic basket held chardonnay, wine glasses, slices of cheese and pear, a half-loaf of French bread, pasta primavera salad, and even some amaretto biscotti for dessert.\n\nOver lunch, they talked about the agricultural aspect of the project.\n\n\"I bet Seth is going to be excited to find places for all his extra plants,\" Mariah commented.\n\n\"I'm sure he will be. I wish I had half the energy he has. He's an old softy, too, so he'll be happy about growing food for people.\"\n\n\"He's not going to be able to do it by himself, though. How do you think he's going to feel about more cooks in the kitchen, so to speak? He seems pretty attached to his setup.\"\n\nMichael nodded. \"You're right. I think the best way to handle it is to keep our garden separate and under Seth's control. I want to keep our resources separate, anyway. If Seth wants help from any of the people who move in, that's great, but he can keep running it like he's running it if that's what he wants. I want to see him in more of a teaching role so that every family can have their own garden.\"\n\nMariah thought about it. \"You don't think the people who move in should share a communal garden? They could share the labor that way, and it would foster cooperation and trust. There's a problem now with people's crops going missing. It gets blamed on outside \"raiders,\" but I think it's really people stealing their neighbors' crops.\"\n\n\"I didn't know about that, but I'm not surprised it would be a problem. If your kids are going hungry, you're going to do what you have to do. And there are always people who are just fundamentally dishonest. A communal garden would just give them more opportunity to take things for themselves. I prefer individual plots for each family for other reasons, too. I think it is important for people to have direct responsibility over their own welfare. People need the satisfaction of benefiting from their own work.\"\n\nMariah pretended to cough to disguise the laugh that almost escaped. It wasn't that there was anything fundamentally wrong with Michael's idea. It was just funny to hear him talking about the satisfaction of hard work. In her admittedly limited experience, rich kids were rather prone to romanticizing the hand-to-mouth existence of subsistence farmers and other laborers as independent, noble, and rewarding.\n\nMichael had no idea what even a single day of working in a field would be like, much less planning for a winter after a failed crop. Before this was over, she was determined to make sure he experienced a day in the field, and see to it that he grappled with the problems the new compound inhabitants would face when things did not go as planned. She hoped he would meet those challenges well.\n\nDespite Michael's limited perspective, there was merit in what he was saying. She just was not convinced that the benefits of individual plots outweighed the benefits of communal farming.\n\n\"What if we did both?\" she suggested. \"We already know that we want the people inside the compound to grow enough to send extra food to people outside. We could set up a communal garden large enough to meet everyone's needs, and each family could have their own plot they can use to grow specific produce for themselves or extra produce for trade. That way we would get the efficiency and social benefits of the communal plot along with the individual incentives that the family plots could provide.\"\n\nMichael frowned at first, but he couldn't find any obvious problem with the suggestion. The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea. \"I think we should do that. Let's see what Seth thinks before we make a decision, though.\"\n\n\"Do you think he could spare any of those fruit saplings so the people in the compound could start their own orchard?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he could. We always have more fruit than we need. Seth just likes growing things, so he keeps growing them whether or not we can use them. It's not as if the extra fruit he grows goes to waste, since Lois is always happy to offer it in her shop. Still, we don't really need any more fruit trees for our use.\"\n\nMariah smiled. \"This is exciting. I can't wait to see it really happening.\" Michael smiled back at her. They finished their meal in companionable silence.\n\nMichael leaned back against the trunk of the tree as they finished off the wine. \"Come here, kitten.\" She scooted a little closer. \"No, on my lap, facing me.\" She shook her head.\n\n\"You're going to have to do it, so you might as well be good.\" She gave him a rebellious look. He quirked an eyebrow and began counting aloud. \"One... Two... Three...\"",
        "Mariah frowned. What was he doing? Was this some version of \"by the time I count to ten?\"\n\n\"Four... Five... Six... Seven...\"\n\nDid he really think she was going to come crawling to him because he was counting to ten?\n\n\"Eight... Nine... Ten... Eleven... Twelve...\"\n\nOkay, so not to ten. But what was he up to? How was counting supposed to make her do what he wanted?\n\nWhen Michael reached thirty, he stopped. Mariah raised an eyebrow. \"Giving up?\" she taunted him.\n\nMichael smiled. \"No, but I think thirty is enough for now.\"\n\nHis smile made her nervous. She tried to figure out what she was missing.\n\n\"Remember the third condition of our arrangement?\" he prompted. \"I don't think you're being very submissive.\" Privately, he thought she had been displaying beautifully submissive tendencies in small ways, but that was beside the point. She had fallen into his trap and he was going to make the most of it.\n\n\"But that only applies to sex,\" she argued.\n\n\"I promise you, kitten, what I am going to do to you is very sexual. Now, come here.\"\n\nReluctantly, she crept over to his lap and sat on it gingerly. She settled so far down his legs that she was practically sitting on his knees. He reached beneath the edges of her skirt and ran his hand up the outsides of her thighs until he reached her ass. With a firm grip on her buttocks, he pulled her up toward him.\n\n\"Pull down your blouse.\"\n\nShe pulled the neckline lower, but not below her breasts. Michael shook his head. \"If you don't know what I mean by pulling your blouse down, you're going to have to take it off.\" Mariah pulled the neckline down below her breasts, like he had done in the garage.\n\n\"Now, fold down the lace.\" When she hesitated, he gave her ass a little smack. \"Do I need to pull the lace off your bra?\" he prodded. She glared at him and folded the lace over.\n\n\"Happy now?\" she snapped.\n\n\"Yes, very,\" Michael answered, staring at her breasts. He splayed his fingers over her ass and squeezed the firm flesh. \"Hands behind your back, kitten.\"\n\nShe sighed and put her hands behind her back. \"Do you have to call me that?\" she complained.\n\nHe was preoccupied with the way her back was pulled into an arch when her hands went behind her back, and how the position pushed her breasts out so invitingly. \"Hmmm?\" He said distractedly. \"Why don't you want me to call you 'kitten?'\" He pressed his chilled wine glass, wet with condensation, against one nipple and then the other.\n\nMariah squirmed on his lap. \"Because 'kitten' sounds so soft and fluffy and frivolous.\"\n\nHe blew across her wet nipples until they were achingly hard. \"I suppose you'd prefer something fierce and scary?\" He softly sucked one nipple into the warmth of his mouth.\n\n\"Ohhh...\" She was caught up in the sensation for a moment, then shook herself out of it. He noted with dissatisfaction that it was the second time today she had managed to shake off the haze of arousal after she started slipping into it. \"Fierce and scary would be better, but 'Mariah' would do fine,\" she told him.\n\nHe pulled his mouth away and blew across the wet flesh again, then turned his attention to her other breast. He softly flicked his tongue across the nipple.\n\n\"You don't have to be fierce all the time, Mariah. This is one of those times. I'll make you a deal, though.\" He sucked her nipple briefly. \"I'll only call you 'kitten' when it's time for you to be sexually submissive. Like now. In return, you have to remember what it means when I call you kitten.\"\n\nShe shivered. He was making it hard to think again. He was kneading her ass and it made her sway in his lap. \"Now, since this was the second time today you've earned a punishment, we'd better get started before you rack up more.\"\n\n\"Punishment! What are you talking about?\" She angrily crossed her arms in front of her.\n\nMichael pulled her arms away from her chest. When she resisted, he reminded her, \"Third condition, kitten. Now you're up to three punishments.\" She made a growling sound and scowled at him, but didn't resist further. He pulled her arms her back again and held her wrists in one hand. With his other hand, he gently pinched one of her nipples. It was a short, light pinch, followed by several more pinches, growing firmer each time. Then he rolled the nipple between his fingers. He did the same to the other.\n\n\"Remember when I counted to 30 earlier?\" Michael asked. \"Those are the spanks you're going to get for refusing to come sit on my lap.\"\n\nMariah sputtered, \"You can't spank me like a naughty child!\"\n\nMichael toyed with her nipple. \"Of course not, kitten. It won't be at all like a child's spanking.\" He smirked. \"Now, let's get started before you manage to add a fourth punishment to your tally. I want you to get up and then lay across my lap with your head toward my left hand. And keep your blouse where it is. Don't cover your breasts again until I give you permission.\"<br ><br >The look Mariah gave him was venomous. When she hesitated, he started counting, \"One... Two...\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she grumbled. She scrambled up and knelt beside him. On her hands and knees, she lowered herself across his lap.\n\n\"Good girl.\" Michael ran his hand up the back of her thigh, sliding the hem of her skirt up. He flipped the skirt up over her back and sighed appreciatively. \"That's beautiful, kitten.\" He stroked the tops of her thighs, the lower curve of her buttock, and along the edge of her panties.\n\n\"As good as your ass looks in these panties, I want you bare. Get up on your hands and knees again for a minute.\"\n\nMariah complied without speaking, but he could feel her shaking with indignation. With his left hand, he reached beneath her to fondle her breasts. With his right hand, he pulled her panties down to her knees. He ran his hand over the bare skin. Without warning, he smacked her buttock. She squeaked in surprise.\n\n\"Okay, you can lay back down now, kitten.\" Mariah lowered herself hurriedly, apparently eager to get out of that position. \"Fold your arms so you can rest your forehead on them,\" he instructed. He stroked her bare skin for a moment before he brought his hand down firmly on her ass again, startling her again.\n\n\"That takes care of the two extra spanks you earned just now when you didn't lay across my lap for your spanking. Just thirty to go.\" He squeezed her buttock, then smacked it again before he moved to the other. Mariah remained stubbornly silent while he administered the next ten spanks. He was not using a lot of force, but the flat of his hand made a stinging smack every time it landed, and her skin reddened quickly. He paused to stroke her heated skin.\n\n\"How are you doing, kitten?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she snapped.\n\nHe landed another spank. \"Only fine?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked with irritation. \"I don't know what you want me to say.\"\n\n\"That's okay. I'll just find out for myself.\" Michael pushed her thighs apart and slipped his hand between them. She let out a hiss when he touched her pussy. She was even wetter than he expected. He slid his finger up and down her slit. \"It seems to me like you're feeling a little better than fine, kitten.\" With the wetness he gathered, he drew a little heart on her ass, then brought his hand down with a stinging smack across it.\n\nMichael returned to her pussy, circling her clit with his fingertip. \"I think you might be enjoying this.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to spank me!\"\n\n\"I know, sweetheart,\" Michael soothed her. \"But even if you don't want a spanking, it's making you feel good, isn't it?\" Before she could earn more spanks, he broke her stubborn silence by drawing his hand back and swinging his hand down so that the heel of his hand landed with a firm thud just above the opening of her legs. He caught her off guard, and she moaned.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she admitted.\n\nMichael caressed and soothed the spot he had spanked. \"You're not supposed to help it, kitten.\" His hand slipped between her thighs again and he stroked her pussy. \"I'm not angry at you and I'm not going to truly hurt you. I know you don't want me to spank you, and that's what makes it punishment, but I still want you to get pleasure from it.\" He stroked directly across her clit, making her gasp.\n\n\"That doesn't make any sense,\" she complained.\n\n\"It doesn't have to.\" He rubbed her clit again, and her hips jerked reflexively. He gently stroked her back.\n\n\"Ready?\" A moment later he gave her a smack, harder than the others. \"I asked you something, kitten. I expect an answer.\"\n\n\"I did answer! I nodded.\"\n\n\"You need to answer me out loud. I didn't see you nod. I can't look away from your ass right now. It's so nice and pink where you've been spanked.\" Michael traced spiraling patterns against her hot skin. \"Okay, ready now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she huffed.\n\nMichael smiled to himself and landed three spanks in rapid succession. \"You look so good across my lap.\" Mariah snorted.\n\n\"Still feeling feisty, hmm?\" He spanked her again. \"I want you to crawl further over my lap, so the tops of your thighs are resting on my leg.\"\n\nShe groused as she wiggled across his lap until she was arranged the way he wanted her. She could feel his erection against her thigh. The new angle raised and tilted her ass up, giving him better access to the area where her buttocks curved up from the top of her thighs. When he spanked her again, she sucked in her breath. Michael knew the spanks would feel different to her this time. The new angle allowed him to concentrate the force at an angle that would transfer right to her pussy. He spanked her twice more, a little harder -- not enough to hurt her, but enough to make sure she felt the jolt.\n\n\"Spread your legs for me.\" She hesitated briefly, but she complied. \"Further.\" With a sigh, she spread her legs as wide as her position on his lap allowed.\n\n\"Good girl.\" He stroked the insides of her thighs while he slid his left hand beneath her. She was wet before. Now she was drenched. \"Baby, you're soaking wet.\" He curled a finger up into her and pumped her pussy. She shuddered and moaned softly. \"That' so nice, kitten.\" He added a second finger and fucked her with his fingers until she was squirming against his lap. He withdrew his fingers and began stroking her clit.\n\n\"I'm going to start spanking again,\" he warned her. A moment later, his hand came down again, thudding against the juncture of her open thighs. She bit back a moan, but he heard the little sound she made. He trapped her clit between his fingers and rubbed it in circles. Every time his hand came down on her ass, he pinched her clit.\n\nShe was moving restlessly on his lap and Michael suspected she was close to coming. \"Just wait until you get a spanking at home, kitten. I'll bend you over with your ass in the air so I can spank your pussy.\" He landed another thudding spank. \"Can you imagine how that's going to feel, kitten?\" She shuddered. He worked her clit harder, tweaking it in a twisting motion. The last few spanks were firmer than the rest. She was whimpering by the time he was finished, but not from pain. He was sure she was on the edge of orgasm. He was also sure she would refuse to ask for it, but he gave her a chance.\n\n\"That was the last one, kitten.\" She let her breath out but remained tense. \"Would you like some more? If you ask, I'll keep spanking you until you come.\" He gave her clit another stroke. \"Do you want more spanks?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Out loud,\" Michael reminded her.\n\n\"No,\" she said obstinately.\n\n\"Okay, sweetheart. Spanking's over, then.\" He helped her pull her panties up and smoothed her skirt back down.\n\nShe backed off his lap and he helped her stand. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were bright. He couldn't resist kissing her. She held herself stiffly, but her lips were yielding, and he let himself get lost in the soft warmth of her mouth. When he pulled her closer, the press of her body against his erection made him groan. He desperately needed relief, and kissing her was only arousing him further.\n\n\"C'mon, kitten. There are still two more things I want to show you today, and you still have two more punishments to get through.\" Michael gathered up the blanket and packed everything in the basket.\n\n\"But you already gave me two extra spanks.\"\n\n\"Those were for not laying across my lap when I asked you to. Your 30 spanks were for refusing to come sit on my lap. You also crossed your arms over your chest after I told you to put your hands behind your back. And remember when we got the golf cart out of the garage? I pulled your blouse down and you tried to pull it back up.\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous! And in the garage, you hadn't told me I had to leave my blouse down.\"\n\n\"What about now? Right before your spanking, didn't I tell you not to cover your breasts until I told you that you could?\"\n\nRealization flashed across Mariah's face. She had rearranged her blouse when she stood up. \"But... I thought it was over.\"\n\n\"The punishment was over, kitten. I didn't tell you that you could cover your breasts.\" He hid his amusement over her guilty look. She did not see anything wrong with her behavior, but knowing she had been caught doing something she knew she wasn't supposed to do had the desired effect. He suspected that feeling guilty would make her much more cooperative.\n\n\"Why didn't you just give me all the spankings at once?\"\n\n\"Because your other two punishments aren't spankings. Now, please get in the cart. We can combine your next two punishments and you'll be all done.\" She sighed and sat down. Michael put the picnic basket in the cart's locker and returned to Mariah. He leaned over and brushed his lips across hers. Then he kissed the top of her ear, which made her shiver like it always did. \"You're doing so well, kitten. Just be good for me a little bit longer.\"\n\nMichael pulled the neckline of her blouse below her breasts again and folded down the lace. He reached into the half-cups of her bra to knead her breasts. When Mariah put the bra on, she arranged her breasts for maximum coverage. When Michael released her breasts, the were mounded precariously with her nipples perched well above the edge of the bra. Her nipples were already swollen, but he flicked them back and forth until they were achingly hard.\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out two little clips made of flexible medium-gauge wire. The wire was bent in an S-shape. Michael pulled the top of the S apart and placed it around her nipple. He squeezed it closed. A small chain was attached to the bottom of the S and a porcelain chime hung at the end of the chain. When Michael let the chain drop, she felt the weight of the chime pulling at her nipple. He repeated the process on the other side.\n\nHe stepped back to look at his handiwork. She was looking down at her own nipples to see what he had done. His cock throbbed. Reaching into his pocket again, he brought out a short length of satiny cord. He arranged her arms behind the bucket seat and tied them together at the wrists. He flicked each of the chimes, starting them swinging back and forth. \"Your tied wrists are your punishment for taking your hands out from behind your back. Your nipple decorations are for covering your breasts.\" He bent down to kiss her cheek before he walked around to the other side of the cart.\n\n\"You had these in your pocket the whole time!\" she accused him. \"You planned this!\"\n\nMichael grinned. \"I thought it was a pretty safe bet that you were going to get yourself in trouble at some point. Of course, I had no idea you would collect punishments so quickly. Not that I'm complaining. I'm happy to provide as many as you need.\" She shot him an aggrieved glance.\n\nHe started the cart and drove off across a field, away from the house. \"Wait! Michael, you can't drive around like this! Someone will see! Are there cameras here?\" Mariah sounded frantic.\n\nMichael stopped the cart. \"Relax, sweetheart. Everything is okay. Take a deep breath for me.\" He waited, but if she took a deep breath, he couldn't see it. \"Kitten, look at me.\" She met his eyes. \"Take a deep breath.\" This time he could see her chest rise and fall with a deep inhalation.\n\n\"There aren't any cameras here. I know you feel exposed. I want you to feel that way. I'm driving you to an empty stable. Nobody goes there. I'm not going to let anyone see you. Okay?\" She nodded. \"Do you feel better now?\" She nodded half-heartedly.\n\nHe tucked her hair behind her ear. \"That's my good girl. If you need to stop, you can let me know and we'll stop and talk about it.\" She was intensely annoyed when Michael spoke to her like she was a little girl. She was even more annoyed when she found it calming. In her current situation, she worried that she was too prone to accept reassurance wherever she could find it.\n\nMichael started driving again and continued until they reached a rough trail. This was where he expected things to get more interesting for Mariah. He knew she had been close to coming at the end of her spanking, and now her nipples were being pinched and tugged by the clips and chimes. Her pussy was still slick and swollen. The golf cart didn't have great suspension, and the ride ahead was sure to have her squirming.\n\nHe started down the trail and was not disappointed. Mariah's breasts bounced and jiggled. The chimes swung wildly. She was staring straight ahead, and he doubted she was really focused on anything around her. Her lips were parted slightly, and the rapid rise and fall of her chest made him suspect she was panting. It was mesmerizing, and it was only with reluctance that he spared a glance to the road ahead.\n\nThey pulled up to the stable and he came around to untie her. She made a show of rubbing her wrists, which was a sure sign that there was not a thing wrong with them. If her wrists really did hurt, she would have pretended they didn't. He checked them anyway, and there wasn't a mark on them. He had intended to take the clips off her nipples, too, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it yet. Instead, he led her inside.\n\nShe was surprised by the inside of the barn. It was beautifully appointed. The walls were paneled in white oak, and the floor was paved in brick. The stalls were airy, and there were long padded benches outside of them. The stable's windows were closed now, but each stall had its own large window at horse-height. Separate tack rooms adjoined each stall. Michael pointed out changing rooms and an office at the end of the barn.\n\n\"It's amazing. I've seen barns like this on TV, but I've never been in one so nice. It's so big, too.\" She inhaled. \"You can still smell the horses, but in a good way. How long has it been since there were horses here?\"<br >\n\n\"I don't know. There weren't horses here when the compound was locked down, though.\" He watched as she checked out the stalls and the tack rooms, breasts jiggling and chimes swinging. The constriction in his pants was becoming unbearable. While Mariah explored, he removed a cushion from one of the benches and placed it on the floor in front of another bench.\n\n\"Kitten!\" he called to her. She came toward him quickly, but slowed down when she saw the look in his eye. She came to him, though. She was surprised when he took the clips off her nipples. With the clips removed, her nipples started throbbing. He rolled them between his thumbs and forefingers. Suddenly, he had her face in his hands and he was kissing her. Without giving her a chance to react, he forced his tongue deep into her mouth. When she tentatively sucked it, he couldn't take it anymore. He pulled away from her with a groan.\n\n\"Kneel on the cushion, sweetheart.\"\n\nMariah settled to her knees on the cushion and looked up at him expectantly. He could see her gaze drifting toward the bulge in his pants, but she looked back up at him as soon as he spoke. \"Give me your hand.\" She raised her hand and put it in his, and he guided it to where his shaft was straining against his pants. \"Feel that?\" he asked her. She nodded with a little smile.",
        "\"I've been hard as a rock since you crawled over my lap.\" His voice was husky, and it made her shiver. He could feel her fingers trying to curl around his shaft through his jeans. He gently pushed her hand away and unfastened his jeans and pushed down his boxers. He sighed in relief as his cock sprang free.\n\nHe looked down at Mariah and the expression on her face made his stomach flip. He fisted his shaft and gave it a quick stroke. A clear droplet spilled over the tip. Her tongue flicked out over her lip. He had planned to ask her if she wanted to suck him, but after seeing the way she was looking at him, he had a better idea. He would make her ask for it.\n\n\"Do you like that, kitten?\"\n\nShe nodded, then remembered to answer out loud, \"I like it.\"\n\nHe gave his shaft another stroke, and he heard her make a little sound. \"What do you want, Mariah?\"\n\nShe dropped her eyes. He knew she didn't really want to say it, but he waited patiently.\n\n\"I want to taste.\"\n\nHe was sure that she wanted to do more than taste, but she was going to have to ask. He gathered the slick fluid on his fingertip and held it to her lips. She opened her mouth and he rubbed his fingertip over her tongue. He intended to pull his finger away, but she was too fast for him. Her lips closed around his finger and she sucked it further into her mouth. Her eyes were locked on his rampant cock the entire time. She was going to be the death of him.\n\nSlowly, he pulled his finger from her mouth. \"Is that what you wanted?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, but...\" she trailed off uncertainly.\n\n\"But what?\" he prompted her. \"Tell me what you want.\"\n\nHer eyes met his. She realized what he was doing. He was going to make her say it. For a moment, he thought she would refuse. Then her eyes fell to his cock again. He gave it another stroke and she squirmed, squeezing her thighs together.\n\n\"May I please suck your cock?\"\n\nHis cock jerked in his hand. Those words sounded so good coming from her lips.\n\n\"Of course you can, kitten. But you need to understand something. If you suck my cock, I'm going to end up fucking your mouth.\" She looked up at him and nodded.\n\n\"Out loud.\"\n\nHer forehead creased. She wasn't sure exactly what she was supposed to say. She started to say something and stopped, trying to figure it out. Finally, she asked, \"May I please suck your cock until you fuck my mouth?\"\n\nJesus Christ. That was not what he had been expecting. He shuddered and took a deep breath, trying to calm his excitement. He had only expected her to tell him that she understood what was going to happen.\n\nHe didn't trust himself to speak. He stepped closer and put his hand on the back of her neck. He guided her mouth to his cock and then let her have free rein. Her hand curled around his shaft and he watched as she guided the head back and forth over her lips, smearing them with his precum. Her fingers rippled upward as she stroked him, coaxing another drop that she delicately lapped from his tip.\n\nHer lips parted and slid down over the head of his cock. She began sucking slowly and steadily, building the sensation, and before long he could hear her little satisfied noises. She tongued the spot where the head of his cock met the underside of his shaft, then drew back and swirled her tongue around his cockhead. She sucked him deeper. As her mouth sank down his shaft, he felt her cupping his balls, rolling them and gently squeezing in time to the rhythm of her sucking.\n\nHis hips jerked forward. She looked up at him with those hungry sex-kitten eyes and began rocking her head, sliding her mouth up and down his length. Each time her head bobbed, she sucked him deeper. When his blunt tip bumped the back of her throat, she moaned, and the vibrations made him shudder. Her mouth was filled with his cock, but she kept trying to suck in more.\n\nHis restraint snapped. With a growl, he grabbed the back of her neck and held her in place as he thrust his hips forward. She braced her hands against his thighs to steady herself as he fucked her mouth. She struggled to keep her lips tight around him, but his movement kept breaking her suction, making wet, sucking sounds she could not control.\n\nHe pulled back so that only the head of his cock remained in her mouth. She fluttered her tongue over it. She pointed her tongue and twisted it against his tip, then circled her tongue in an outward spiral. When she reached his flared crown, she flicked her tongue around the edges before she returned to sucking in a simple, steady rhythm.\n\nHe thrust suddenly into her mouth and held her in place. Without moving his hips, he used his hand around the back of her neck to control the movement of her mouth up and down his cock. She shuddered. With Michael moving her mouth up and down over his cock at his own pace, she couldn't use her lips and tongue as well to pleasure him, but the effect as she struggled to accommodate him was raw and powerful for them both. He pulled her all the way off his cock and watched her reaching for it with her tongue.\n\nHe quickly pulled her mouth back down his length and pushed against the opening of her throat. Her throat was tight and his cockhead was wide, but he was determined. \"Swallow around me, kitten,\" he instructed, \"and keep swallowing. I want to feel your throat around me.\" Her mouth and the back of her throat moved against him as she complied.\n\nHe rocked slowly in and out, timing his forward advances with her swallows. The opening of her throat began to give way, allowing him to advance further each time. When he slid in far enough, he tightened his grip on the back of her neck and held her still until he worked himself into her throat. Her throat convulsed. He could hear and feel her whimpering. He held himself still to let her adjust.\n\n\"Keep swallowing, kitten. Just try to relax and keep swallowing.\" She followed his instructions and her throat massaged his cock. He slid in deeper. Reluctantly, he pulled back to allow her to breathe. Her eyes were watering. \"Deep breaths through your nose, kitten.\" Moments later, he pushed into her throat again, overcoming the resistance more easily this time. This time, he didn't stop until he was completely embedded in her throat, with her face pressed to his groin. He held her there until her throat started to spasm. He pulled her up for breath.\n\n\"That's it, kitten,\" he whispered hoarsely. He gave her a chance to take several deep, gasping breaths, then worked himself back into her throat. He thrust slowly and smoothly, sliding through the rippling muscles as she kept swallowing around him. He pushed in and out, picking up speed until he had to pull out of her throat so he could fuck her mouth in earnest. Holding her steady with his hand on her neck, he pulled back and rotated his hips, rubbing his cock against the insides of her mouth before he plunged back in.\n\n\"Hands behind your back.\" He pulled her back so he could watch her breasts thrust toward him. He imagined them squeezed around his shaft. He pushed back into her mouth so fast that she started choking. He kept fucking her mouth without letting up. With her hands behind her back, she was less able to keep her balance. She was relying completely on his hand around the back of her neck. His thrusts pushed her back and his hand pulled her forward. Something about the way she swayed helplessly as he fucked her mouth drove him to his climax.\n\nHe threw his head back and yanked her down on his cock. His hips jerked in short thrusts, pumping his ejaculate into her mouth and down her throat. He felt her struggling to swallow as he flooded her mouth, but he didn't let up until she swallowed the final spurt.\n\nHe held her there, caressing her face as he enjoyed the heat of her mouth for a long moment. When he tried to pull back, she whined softly. He relented, allowing her to suck very gently while he stroked her hair.\n\n\"I have to sit down now, kitten.\" The backs of his thighs were quivering. He sank down on the nearby bench. Mariah pushed her cushion closer and settled between his knees with her legs curled beneath her. She rested her cheek on his thigh. He trailed his fingers through her hair and listened to her breathing grow calm.\n\n\"Come here, baby.\" He pulled her up on the bench beside him. He didn't get a chance to kiss her before she curled up and laid her head on his lap. Leaning back against the wall, he caught his breath. When he closed his eyes, images of Mariah with his cock in her mouth flashed through his mind, making him twitch. He traced her lips with his fingertip. Without opening her eyes, she captured his finger and sucked it softly. She rubbed her cheek against his thigh.\n\nIncredibly, he could feel himself stiffening again as the minutes passed. He thought about making her straddle a bench, with her head on the bench and her ass in the air while he fucked her. Soon, his mind was filled with the possibilities. He could use the cord in his pocket to tie her to a saddle rack in one of the tack rooms. There was an office down by the changing rooms. He could make her lie back on the desk or bend her over it and take her that way. He could take her outside and fuck her bent over the hood of the golf cart.\n\n\"Mariah?\" he brushed the backs of his fingers across her cheek and her eyes fluttered open. \"Sleepy,\" she muttered. She nuzzled his thigh and her eyes closed again. Bemused, he continued stroking her hair. He had never heard of getting sleepy from sucking cock. He was certain she had enjoyed it, but he was so perplexed by her sleepiness that he felt like he had to check. He carefully nudged her from her side onto her back, so that she was face up in his lap. She turned her head to press her cheek against his leg.\n\nHe gathered her skirt over her waist and slipped his hand beneath her panties. She was still slick and swollen. He idly stroked up and down her slit. \"Too sleepy,\" she complained. He smiled and continued stroking. He supposed this was just another of her idiosyncrasies. When he began stroking her clit, she grumbled and tried to turn back to her side. He stopped her and shifted her further into his lap, so that her head and shoulders rested on his thighs.\n\nWhen his hand slid beneath her panties again, she complained and tried to close her legs. He gave her pussy a little smack and she stopped. \"Be good for me, kitten, and I'll let you lay here a little while longer.\" Her forehead wrinkled, but she remained still when his fingers returned to her wet heat. He stroked slowly, not trying to rouse her, but not letting her rest, either. He just touched her the way he wanted to touch her. He pushed a finger into her channel and watched her face as he slowly finger-fucked her. She put her forearm across her eyes, but he moved it away. \"Michael,\" she mumbled.\n\n\"Shhh,\" he hushed her before she could complain again. He thumbed her clit, and he could see a muscle jump in her thigh. She scrunched her face and turned her head away from him. He pushed a second finger into her and began thrusting more forcefully up into her pussy. Her inner muscles clamped down around his fingers and she moaned.\n\n\"Look at me, Mariah.\" He watched the reactions on her face as he worked her pussy. He curled his fingers upward and her lips parted. He kept stroking while he rubbed his thumb in circles around her clit. She whined and her hips tilted up. He rubbed back and forth across her clit until she was squirming against his hand. She was shuddering now, but he kept raising her pleasure. His cock was throbbing again and he wanted her badly, but he was going to make her come on his fingers first.\n\nHe thrust his fingers into her because he loved hearing the way her breath caught when he did that. \"I'm not going to let you rest until you come for me, kitten.\" She bit her lip and shivered hard. She knew he meant it. His thumb kept brushing back and forth across her clit, making the pleasure climb higher until it burned. Her chest shook with shallow pants and her hips lurched. He strummed her clit faster and pressed his fingers against the front wall of her pussy. Her muscles clenched tight around his fingers and her hips jerked upward.\n\n\"Give it to me, kitten,\" Michael demanded. His voice was dark and lustful, and it sent a shudder through her. He buried his fingers deep and kept thrusting until the tension in her body shattered and she came with a cry.\n\nMichael picked her up quickly, eager to drive himself into her while she was still spasming. He pulled the bench away from the wall and stood her astride it. He bent her down over it so that she was resting on her elbows and yanked her panties down. He grabbed her hips and plunged into her, fucking her at a brutal pace. He reached down and twisted and pulled at her nipple. He groaned when her pussy clutched at him. He did it again. And again. Every time he tugged her nipple, her muscles contracted around his cock.\n\nHe needed more. He held her steady with one hand on her waist. With his other hand he massaged her pussy. He bent over her back and reached down to trace his finger around her opening. Feeling her flesh stretched tight and giving way to his cock was inexplicably erotic. He followed her slit upward to her clit. Her nerve endings were still jangling from her climax, and her hips lurched the instant his fingers brushed her clit. He straightened up and rammed into her, determined to cram her full of his cock. He rotated his hips and his cock shifted inside of her. She was moaning and mumbling incoherently. He smacked her clit and thrust into her savagely. She screamed and her body locked up.\n\nOnce her orgasm started, it just kept rolling through her, wringing her out, making her twitch and spasm. Michael kept fucking her, jackhammering into her with so much force that it was hard to brace herself. If he had not been pulling her back against him with his hand on her waist, she would have collapsed against the bench. Michael's breathing was ragged and his legs were shaking, but he didn't want to stop. He forced back his orgasm so he could keep fucking her.\n\nMariah was panting, but he gradually realized she was trying to say something. He paused and ground himself into her. \"What is it, kitten?\"\n\nI need it.\" It was all he needed to hear. He drove into her and clutched her to him. Her channel pulsed around him as he erupted. He felt as though he was bursting like a firework and every muscle in his body clenched. Her pussy kept milking him until the sensation was too much. He groaned and pulled out of her.\n\nHe sank down on the bench and pulled her back against his chest. He brushed her hair back from her face and kissed her temple. There were so many things he wanted to say, but knew he shouldn't, so he just held her in silence. She tilted her head back against his shoulder and kissed his jaw. She was rewarded with the rumble in his chest that she enjoyed so much.\n\nHe was reluctant to move, but he could see from the angle of light outside that it was getting much later than he intended. He sighed and kissed the top of her head. \"Come on, sweetheart. We'd better get back home.\"\n\nIt sounded strange to Mariah to hear him talk about going \"home.\" It was his home, of course, but it was not hers. She thought about that as they arranged their clothes. Michael folded the flap of lace on her bra up over nipples. He was pleased to see how reddened and swollen they still were. He tweaked them gently, just to hear her gasp, and pulled her neckline up over her bra so that her breasts weren't exposed. He looked her over. Her lips were red and kiss-swollen and her clothing was disheveled. Hopefully, they could get back to his private wing discretely.\n\n\"Wasn't there another place we were supposed to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"I was going to take you to see the building with the pool in it. The pool's empty, but there must be something we can use it for. It'll have to wait until tomorrow, though.\"\n\nThey drove back to the entrance to the garage's tunnel by a much smoother route than they came. Mariah's mind was swirling with misgivings deep beneath her overall feeling of sated contentment. She tried to identify what was bothering her, but her mind wanted no part of it. She felt good right now. The sun was warm on her shoulders and the breeze was cool across her face. Her pussy ached pleasantly. Her entire body was steeped in the relaxation of sexual exhaustion. She didn't want to look any closer at the worries that flitted through the deeper recesses of her mind.\n\nThe garage felt chilly after the warm sun. Michael brought in the picnic basket. In the elevator, he pushed the button for the third floor. Mariah pushed the first-floor button. She looked up at him. \"So we can bring the basket back to Marcus,\" she explained.\n\n\"I'll bring it down to him later.\"\n\n\"But I wanted to tell him thank you. Everything was so good.\"\n\nHe kissed her forehead. \"We can do that later, sweetheart. I'll explain when we get upstairs.\"\n\nUpstairs, they were greeted enthusiastically Henry. Michael closed the doors to the private wing on their way in, so Mariah left her door open. After he jumped up for his hug and kiss, Henry trotted off down the hall, snuffling all the way. Duncan was curling around Michael's legs, but he was already eyeing the door.\n\n\"Are you sure nobody will open the door or come down this way? I'm worried they'll get out.\"\n\n\"I'm sure. Paula will let you know what her cleaning schedule is, but I asked everyone to give us some privacy.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you want to talk to Marcus earlier?\" Mariah wanted to know.\n\nMichael chuckled and pulled her into the closet and stood her in front of the mirror. \"Take a look sweetheart.\" She looked at herself in the mirror. \"You look very well-fucked.\" Mariah turned red and looked away. \"Personally, I think you look delicious and want to see that look often. I'd be proud to show you around the house just like this, but I thought you would rather have a chance to clean up.\" Mariah's blush deepened. It amazed him that she could still blush at anything after everything he had done to her today.\n\nWhen they walked back out of the closet, Mariah stopped so suddenly that he almost ran into her. \"Why is there a door?\" She was referring to a door on the opposite wall that had not been there before.\n\n\"It connects to my room. I had the twins put it in while we were out.\"\n\n\"The twins?\"\n\n\"Daniel and Amy. I forgot you haven't met them. I'll introduce you later.\"\n\n\"But why is there a door?\" Mariah persisted. The uneasy feeling at the back of her mind was growing again.\n\nMichael turned her to face him and put his arms around her. \"What's wrong, sweetheart? It's so we can leave the door open so Henry and Duncan and Julia can go back and forth at night. So you don't have to go back to your room to sleep.\"\n\nMariah understood now. He had no idea that she wanted to sleep in her own room. She didn't know what to do. She couldn't just tell him that she didn't want to share a bed. Seeing the hurt in his eyes would not be worth it, and she would probably have to do it anyway. But right now, she had to come up with something to say. \"Oh, I see what you mean,\" was the best she could do.\n\nHe tilted her chin up. \"Baby, I want you to tell me why you were upset when you saw the door.\"\n\nShe needed to find a middle ground, to give him some idea about her need for privacy without telling him she didn't want to sleep together. \"I'm adjusting to a lot right now. One of the things that gave me a lot of reassurance was knowing I had my own room. When I saw the door, I guess I just worried about not having any privacy.\"\n\nMichael's face fell, and she felt awful. She knew he had thought he was doing something she would like. \"It's a door, Mariah. It opens and closes. When you need privacy, we'll just close it, okay?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I was just surprised and hadn't thought it through. It was sweet of you to think of that.\" So much for holding her ground. She needed to get ahold of herself. Just because he gave her a hurt look with those big brown eyes did not mean she needed to fold like a cheap deck of cards. The fact that Michael didn't recognize her boundaries made it more important for her to maintain them.",
        "She leaned up to kiss him. \"Thank you for being so thoughtful,\" she said, in contravention of everything she had just reminded herself. He smiled, but he didn't look entirely convinced. She needed to change the subject.\n\n\"I think I'd better take a shower. I won't be long.\"\n\n\"I'll join you.\"\n\nInternally, she sighed. No boundaries. A minute later, though, he was massaging shampoo into her scalp and she was thoroughly enjoying it. After he rubbed conditioner into her hair, she grew so relaxed that she let him soap her up.\n\n\"That feels nice.\" She nuzzled his chest, but caught herself before she went completely mushy.\n\n\"Your turn,\" she announced.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. \"I don't think you can put your hands on me without starting something you're a little too sore to finish.\"\n\nAbashed, she turned away. She wasn't trying to start anything. Michael wasn't sure how to interpret her expression, but he could see that his offhand comment had shut her down. \"I'm sorry. I was just teasing you.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" she shrugged. Michael was beginning to recognize \"it's okay\" as her standard response when she just did not want to talk about it. They would have to work on that, but right now, he wanted to fix his blunder. He thought about it as he shampooed his own hair.\n\nFinally, mercifully, he realized he was overthinking it. He held the soap out to Mariah. \"Please? I promise I'll behave.\"\n\nMariah took the soap. She really did not want to do it anymore, but she began lathering her hands and rubbing them over his skin. He was so still and quiet that she forgot her discomfort with the situation as she focused on her hands sliding over the planes of his body. She loved the way his muscles seemed to flow beneath his skin. She thought he was beautiful. Then she realized how ridiculous the thought was. She didn't even like pretty men.\n\nShe huffed when she reached his groin. He was hard again. \"You said you'd behave!\"\n\n\"I am being behaving. I'm not dead, though, and there's a beautiful woman running her soapy hands all over me.\" He wrapped her in a hug. \"Baby, every erection I get is not a demand. If you want to wash my cock, I'll enjoy it very much, but then we'll rinse off and get out of the shower and go on with our day. If you don't want to, that's fine, too, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay. Thank you for telling me that.\" Mariah's gratitude was genuine. It wasn't as reassuring as he probably intended it to be, since he could make a demand any time he wanted, and all he had to do was call her \"kitten\" to make it mandatory. It helped, though. It was good to know that her world didn't have to revolve around satisfying his every sexual impulse. Especially since he seemed to have a sexual impulse about every two minutes.\n\nShe gently washed him. The weight of his balls cupped in her hand was nice, and she did enjoy her hand sliding over his cock without consequences. She liked the texture of it and the way it fit against her palm. She finished up without lingering unnecessarily, but she thought she might enjoy doing it again some time, with plenty of unnecessary lingering.\n\nAfter they dried off, Michael returned to his own room to get dressed. Mariah was still drying her hair when he returned. When she finished, she found him in the closet. To her dismay, he was fishing around in the lingerie drawers. He found the dress she originally chose that morning and offered it to her, along with the bra and panties he picked out. She was surprised when he left her alone in the closet to get dressed. She was even more surprised when she put on the bra and panties he had chosen. She had given up hope that the lingerie drawers contained anything comfortable, but the soft fabric and stretchy lace felt wonderful.\n\nWhen she was dressed, she found Michael sitting on her bed rubbing Julia's chin. Julia had her neck stretched out and her eyes squeezed. Her purr was audible from several feet away. \"Nicely done,\" she told him. \"Julia doesn't usually warm up to people so quickly, and she's already showing you one of her favorite ways to be pet.\"\n\n\"Is it weird that I feel honored?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it would be weirder if you didn't.\"\n\nOnce Julia was satisfied with the state of her chin, she curled up for a nap. Michael eased off the bed to avoid upsetting her. It was amazing how quickly Julia had wrapped him around her little paw. Henry was suspiciously quiet, but when Mariah called him, he came running. She put him on the leash. She was taking Henry along when Michael showed her the rest of the house and introduced her to everyone.\n\nWhen they reached the third-floor sitting room, Michael told her that the west wing through the opposite door and the west wing on the second floor held the staff's quarters. The security team's rooms were on the second floor, and everyone else's rooms were on the third. Michael didn't feel comfortable invading their private space, so he just described the layout.\n\nEach person's quarters included a living room, bedroom, bathroom, and small kitchen. At the very end of the west wing, there was a recreation room and large kitchen. Since his father's death, Michael had encouraged the staff to make use of the common areas of the house, but in the evenings, people still gravitated toward their own quarters.\n\nMichael continued the tour on the second floor. On this floor, the west wing housed the quarters for the security team. A large conference room faced the stairs and extended into the east wing. Past the conference room, Michael showed her a communications room with telephone and videoconferencing equipment.\n\n\"It's all still plugged in,\" Mariah observed. \"What can you use it for? Who could you talk to?\"\n\n\"You already know that people with the means were able to isolate themselves from the consequences of The Fall.\"\n\n\"People like you,\" she reminded him.\n\n\"People like my father. At least that's how I've always thought of it. I suppose I should include myself in that category. Anyway, those people were able to maintain limited satellite communications.\"\n\nMariah's jaw dropped. \"Do you mean there are people still communicating in real time?\"\n\nMichael nodded.\n\n\"You can talk on the phone?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's not quite like when we used to call each other on cell phones, though. There aren't operational cell towers or repeaters or anything like that. You need an unobscured line of sight to the satellite to send or receive the signal. If you have that, you can call anyone else who has access to the interface with the satellite that you're using.\"\n\n\"Do you have internet?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. But we have a copy of huge portions of the internet before it went down. Do you remember the Wayback Machine online?\"\n\n\"Yes. You could use it to see older versions of web pages. It was useful if you wanted to see information that had been taken down, and it was a good way to catch organizations changing their stories.\"\n\nMichael nodded. \"Exactly. That archive had hundreds of billions of web pages stored on it, and we have a copy of all of it. That's not all, either. We have lots of government archives, including intelligence agency archives. Those contain all sorts of information that was public, all gathered in one place. We've been able to add copies of the data from libraries, universities, and private companies, too.\n\n\"Instead of browsing an internet that takes you to servers hosting information all over the world, now there's a huge central database. Since there aren't that many people with access, it's possible for the servers to keep up with the demand. If more people were accessing it, there would be serious logjams.\"\n\n\"Who has the database? Is it safe? Are there backups?\"\n\n\"Slow down, sweetheart. I'm going to try to answer all your questions, but you are getting into areas that take a whole lot more explanation. All the data that has been copied is on a huge network of servers in an old NSA facility in Bluffdale, Utah, near Salt Lake City. It's controlled by a man named Gregory Quinland. There is no single backup of the data, but there are backups of parts of it that are held by different people across the country. In most cases, the original data is still out there, too. The Wayback Machine's data is still on the original servers in San Francisco. We only copied it.\n\n\"The people who have access to the data are the people I've been talking about who had the means to isolate themselves during The Fall. They formed an organization. Gregory Quinland built a huge meeting center in Bluffdale, with lodging and shops and a medical center. The organization uses that meeting center. I've been trying to avoid it, but I suppose I might as well tell you what they call themselves and the organization. I can already imagine what you're going to say.\"\n\n\"So, what is the name?\"\n\n\"The Elites.\"\n\nMariah looked at him for a moment and then burst out laughing. \"The Elites? Seriously?\"\n\nMichael shrugged. \"I know. It's ridiculous.\"\n\n\"That sounds like the name of some snobby prep school's fencing team.\"\n\n\"I'm just glad we aren't calling ourselves \"The Spartans.\"\n\nMariah smirked at him. \"So. you're one of 'The Elites.'\" She used air quotes.\n\n\"Hey, I didn't make it up.\"\n\n\"Okay, setting aside the ridiculousness of the concept you Elites have of yourselves\u2014\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't include me in it like that,\" Michael interrupted.\n\n\"Setting that aside, why is this a big secret? Why doesn't everybody have a chance to access these communication abilities?\"\n\n\"That is where we get into a much bigger discussion for later, about the organization's goals and its internal politics.\"\n\nMariah frowned and leaned back against the wall. \"You know I'm going to ask again later, right? I'm not just going to forget about it.\"\n\nHe raised his hands defensively, \"I promise I'm going to tell you everything I know. I just can't possibly tell you everything at the same time. We'll talk about why the organization is so exclusive and secretive later. Right now, I'm still trying to answer your question about why everybody can't access the data independently. How much do you know about the communications collapse during The Fall?\"\n\n\"Not very much. It started with the electricity, and without electricity the communications equipment worthless. The electrical grid started going down, even in places where it was not damaged by storms. People told all sorts of stories about why it happened -- domestic terrorists, computer viruses, environmental activists, the government, aliens, you name it.\n\n\"Not all of it went down at once. The President said it was the states' problem. Some of the states tried to fix things, but each state had a patchwork of utility companies. Maybe it was just incompetence. There were some places that got the power up again, but it went right back down and nobody knew why, at least not that I heard of.\"\n\n\"I can add a little about the electricity,\" Michael volunteered. \"The grid was hacked. It didn't get a lot of attention, but the government issued a report in 2018 about Russian hacking inside the U.S. electrical grid. It was not only Russia, but they were the worst offender. It had been going on a long time before the 2018 report, but by then it was very widespread. There was no single \"grid\" in the U.S. Like you said, it was a patchwork. Hackers got into some parts of it before others.\n\n\"The consensus, at least publicly, was that the hacking had only been designed to collect information. The report stated that the hackers never took control of the systems in a way that would allow them to influence the way power was distributed. That was the official story. The truth was that the hackers left behind backdoors and different kinds of vulnerabilities to allow them re-entry into the systems, and they left code in place that could accept new instructions. I'm not a computer guy, so I'm probably not getting that quite right, but it's the general idea.\n\n\"The government knew at the time what the hackers left behind, but the only way to fix it completely would have been to reinitialize everything. All the networks running the grid would have to be taken down one region at a time and restarted with new programming and new security measures. They couldn't do that without disrupting people's lives and admitting the extent to which they'd been asleep at the switch. The Administration had no interest in exposing it, and Congress was still trying to figure out how to use Facebook. So, nothing got done. When the Russian GRU went rogue, they introduced the viruses that shut everything down.\"\n\nMariah shook her head. \"I wish I could say I was surprised, but it all seems sadly predictable. I don't know how aware you are of the evolution of political attitudes since The Fall, but this is a perfect example of why people feel the way they do.\"\n\n\"Actually, I don't know a whole lot about it. From what I could see on the video feeds, people just stopped talking about politics.\"\n\n\"People stopped talking about politics because they were disgusted and embarrassed that they let the politicians get so far out of control. Democrats blamed Republican politicians for causing the problems, and Democratic politicians for letting it happen. Republicans blamed Democratic politicians for causing everything and Republican politicians for letting it happen. Most of the time when there's a huge governmental failure, people talk about it afterwards because they're either still arguing about what happened, or they're saying, 'I told you so.' This time, there's nothing to argue about. There's no dispute that both parties destroyed the country. Nobody I know calls themselves a Democrat or Republican anymore.\"\n\nMichael nodded. \"Honestly, that's pretty reasonable. But what about independents and third-party politicians?\"\n\n\"People recognized that most independents were just partisans with their fingers in the air to see which way the wind was blowing. Third party candidates had been viewed as election spoilers for a long time. None of them did anything to warn people what was going on. The bottom line is that a politician of any stripe is about as welcome as a skunk at a lawn party.\"\n\n\"It wasn't the sort of thing that came up at the dinner table at our house,\" Michael said, \"but I can understand why people feel that way. If people knew the rest of the reason the grid stayed down, they would be even angrier. Most of the equipment just needed new programming, but the federal government was not communicating with or assisting state and local governments.\n\n\"It was about the same time that the storms got so bad that it wasn't practical in most places to have power lines and other components above ground. Local governments did not have the resources to move things underground. Ashland still has power when the power plant is operating because the software got reprogrammed. The plant's limited operation is only due to maintenance problems and lack of fuel.\n\nMariah sank into one of the comm room's chairs. \"Knowing how easily it could have been fixed is a pretty bitter pill to swallow. It's going to be hard to ever get anybody interested in civic engagement again.\"\n\nMichael nodded. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"If electricity was restored, would people be able to communicate through the satellites?\"\n\n\"Restoring electricity would only be the first step. There's also a question of the satellites' capacity. Also, it would not work for anyone without a direct line of sight to one of the satellites we are able to use. There aren't very many available to us anymore.\"\n\n\"What happened to the others?\"\n\n\"Hostile countries, and later hostile factions, started hacking each other's satellites. You probably never heard anything about it because the electricity had already taken down communications by that time. National governments usually left the satellites intact but unresponsive to their programmers. The factions that started hacking satellites after national governments fell were much more destructive. They frequently altered the satellite's orbital trajectory to crash into another satellite. After they collided, they became space trash and took out other satellites.\"\n\nMichael continued, \"Not all the satellites that the national governments hacked were destroyed by the other satellites. Some of them were in higher orbit. Others just got lucky. We were left with a small number of satellites that would be functional if there was a way to communicate with their programming. Then, one day, a group of the remaining satellites started responding again.\n\n\"Nobody thinks it was spontaneous. Somebody figured out how to do it, but we don't know who it was or who they worked for. The other strange thing about it is that they left it accessible to anyone who knows enough to use the satellites, but they locked the programming down tightly enough that nobody's been able to make changes.\"\n\nMariah's forehead creased. \"So basically, some unknown person reestablished communication with the satellites, made them usable for people to communicate, and prevented anyone else from blocking anyone, and nobody knows who or why?\"\n\nMichael nodded. \"That sums it up.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether the power grids are still up in other countries?\"\n\n\"I don't know definitively. Before we were completely cut off from the rest of the world, most countries had already gone dark, meaning that they weren't communicating with the outside world. It seems reasonable to assume that wouldn't have happened if their grids were still up, but there could be other reasons. We do know that the power grids of other major world powers were also hacked. If there are countries left with functioning power delivery networks, they are probably small countries that might not have been targeted.\"\n\n\"Are people besides \"The Elites\" using the satellites?\"\n\n\"Almost certainly.\"\n\n\"Do you know who?\"\n\n\"I've been told that we don't. But, besides not knowing a great deal about how these things work, I seriously doubt I'm being told everything. That's a conversation we should save for later, though, or we'll never get through the tour.\"\n\n\"But it's so intriguing!\"\n\n\"It will still be intriguing later. Now, on with the tour!\" He gave her a playful swat on the way out of the communications room.\n\nThe security office was across the hall from the conference room. The room held several desks, computers, a control station for remotely controlled gates and other equipment, and a wall of screens cycling between video feeds. Nate was monitoring the screens and Yvonne was busy on a computer. They looked up when Michael, Mariah and Henry came in.\n\n\"Mariah, this is Yvonne. She's a member of the security team. She also handles our information technology issues.\" Yvonne was a tall, thin woman of Persian descent with a pronounced New England accent. Mariah wondered how she had ended up in Colorado.\n\n\"I'm pleased to meet you, Yvonne. I'm looking forward to learning what IT is like since The Fall. Until today, I didn't know there was any IT left.\"\n\nYvonne's smile transformed her face. At rest, her features were severe, almost ascetic. Smiling, she looked like she had a wonderful secret that she couldn't wait to tell. She had an almost girlish habit of tossing her shiny black bob, as if she were used to longer hair.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to having someone who can help keep these boys in line,\" Yvonne said with a grin. \"They're a handful for just Paula, Amy and I!\"\n\nMichael snorted. \"You three tyrants are definitely not in need of reinforcements. I'd like to think Mariah will be a good influence, but I seriously doubt it.\"\n\n\"Mariah, I believe you already met Nate.\" Nate was one of the guards who came out to get Mariah after \"mayor\" Hawley took a swing at her. He looked exactly like Mr. Clean would look if Mr. Clean was a very dark-skinned black man. Mariah hadn't seen a lot of Nate. He was serious and taciturn, but she'd caught a glint in his eye that made her think he was hiding a wicked sense of humor.",
        "\"Hi, Nate.\" Mariah gave him a little wave, thinking of the rather unfortunate first impression she must have made. \"I apologize if I hit, kicked, bit or swore at you yesterday, and promise to be nicer in the future.\"\n\nThis time, she was positive that she saw a glimmer of humor in Nate's eye, but he remained stoic. \"Not at all, Ms. Williams. We were pleased to be of assistance.\"\n\n\"It was much appreciated,\" Mariah lied, \"but please, call me Mariah.\"\n\nMichael was ready to move the tour along. \"I'm just showing Mariah around the house. We'll try to get together with everyone in the next few days. She's working on a project with me, and we'll need your input.\" Before they left, Mariah introduced Henry, who surprised her by having the sense to recognize that he was in the presence of people who were not exactly \"dog people.\"\n\nAfter they left the security office, Michael asked, \"Was that Henry's best behavior?\"\n\n\"It must be. That's the first time I've seen it.\"\n\nMichael walked her through the rest of the east wing. The northeast corner was dominated by a large file room, newly useful after the demise of the paperless office. The rest of the space consisted of eight unused offices. Michael suggested they could be used by some of the people they hoped to bring in soon.\n\nIn the last office, Michael pulled her to him for a kiss. His chest felt warm and comfortable, and she realized that she was relaxing against him. Was it too early to blame it on Stockholm syndrome?\n\n\"Let's get going, sweetheart. I'm looking forward to just relaxing once you've met everyone, and I know you're tired.\"\n\nThe first-floor tour didn't take long because Mariah had seen most of it before. The house's main entrance opened onto a large foyer that wrapped around the staircase and led back to the formal living room, where she first met Michael. The west wing included the dining room, kitchen, breakfast bar, supply room and sunroom.\n\nThey stopped in the kitchen to see Marcus. \"Thank you for the picnic lunch, Marcus. We really enjoyed it,\" Mariah told him.\n\nMichael clapped him on the shoulder, \"You thought of everything. Thanks for making me look good!\"\n\n\"I'm glad you liked it,\" Marcus beamed.\n\nHe stopped them when they turned to leave. \"Do you have a moment to talk about dinner? I'm making pad thai.\"\n\nMariah's face lit up, and Michael couldn't help laughing at her.\n\n\"Don't laugh at me! We don't all have kitchen wizards. I haven't had Thai food in a decade.\"\n\nMarcus looked pleased. \"Will you be eating down here, or would you like me to bring some upstairs?\"\n\n\"Would you mind plating some up for us?\" Michael asked, \"I'll come pick it up if you give me a call when it's ready. I owe you a picnic basket, too.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nPoor Henry was disappointed when they left the kitchen empty-handed. Michael patted his head consolingly. \"Don't worry, old man. I have a feeling you get handouts.\"\n\nThey walked back through the foyer to reach the east wing. They passed an entertainment room on the way to the gym in the northeast corner of the house. That's where they found the twins. Somehow, they had managed to turn their elliptical track programs into a race, and they were egging each other on. When they saw Michael and Mariah, they dismounted and staggered over, panting.\n\n\"They're a bit competitive,\" Michael remarked.\n\nThe twins looked like male and female versions of the same design. They both had fantastically, brilliantly red hair. Amy had brown eyes and Daniel had green eyes, but their features were so similar that the difference in eye color was easy to overlook. Their skin was normally quite fair, but they were both red in the face from exertion.\n\nThey were still bent over with their hands braced on their knees when they started introducing themselves. \"I'm Daniel,\" Daniel said at the same time Amy said, \"I'm Amy.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Mariah greeted them. \"I think you probably met Henry already, right?\" Henry was beside himself with excitement. He met the twins earlier when they were installing the door, and they were his kind of people.\n\nAmy and Daniel gathered around Henry as soon as they caught their breath. They spent the next two minutes telling Henry what a good boy he was, how handsome he was, how brave he was, and what a fabulous specimen of dog he was. The words, \"goodshie-woodshie baby boyshie\" were thrown around, as was, \"dogshie-wogshie.\" Even Henry's carpentry skills were complimented, as it seemed that they had made him their official apprentice during the door installation.\n\nMariah smiled at Henry's fan club. \"Thank you for putting in the door, guys. Henry is going to enjoy running back and forth.\"\n\n\"He's the best!\" Daniel proclaimed.\n\n\"We adore him!\" Amy added.\n\nMariah grinned. \"I adore people who adore Henry.\"\n\n\"What about me? Am I chopped liver?\" Michael feigned dismay.\n\n\"Henry would love chopped liver!\" the Henry-besotted twins answered in nearly perfect unison.\n\n\"He's going to have to settle for Thai. That's what Marcus is making for dinner.\" Michael said. \"We're going to take ours upstairs,\" he added quickly. \"It's been a long day.\"\n\nWhen they left the gym, Marcus pointed out the library at the furthest end of the wing. \"You remember the library, of course.\" Mariah's cheeks colored. She remembered the library vividly.\n\nBack in the elevator, Michael pulled her to him again. He kissed the top of her head. \"You've met everyone now, sweetheart. Time to get you back to my lair.\"\n\nMariah yawned. \"It's not even dark outside and I'm sleepy.\"\n\n\"Let's head for the lounge. The furniture in there is great for naps,\" Michael suggested.\n\n\"I'll meet you in there as soon as I check on the cats and feed everyone.\"\n\nWhen Mariah joined Michael in the lounge, he was stretched out on the chaise lounge portion of the sectional. When she started to sit beside him, he pulled her into his lap instead. \"You're grabby,\" she complained.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" he agreed, stroking her hair.\n\nShe yawned again. \"Stop that. You're making me yawn.\"\n\nMichael kept stroking her hair. \"You must have worn yourself out somehow.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you had nothing to do with that?\" Mariah looked back at him with an arched brow.\n\n\"I have an alibi. I was with a smokin' hot babe all day long. She was insatiable.\"\n\n\"A likely story.\"\n\nMichael turned the television on. All the entertainment centers in the house were connected to a huge digital library. He selected an episode of a Japanese animated sci-fi about space-faring bounty hunters. \"How about this?\" he asked Mariah.\n\n\"Sure, I remember that show.\" His arm was wrapped over her stomach, and laying back against his chest was much too comfortable. It didn't feel like she only met Michael yesterday. Maybe it was because he kept acting like she was his long-time girlfriend. Maybe it was because she was just too tired to perceive things properly. A few minutes later, she was asleep. The sound of her slow, even breathing was making Michael sleepy, too. He wanted to stay awake, but it was hypnotic.\n\nThey both woke with a start when the house phone on the end table rang. It was Marcus, telling him that their dinner was ready. Mariah was curling into the corner of the sectional when he went downstairs. He hoped he would be able to wake her up enough to eat.\n\nMarcus placed their dinner on a rolling cart that Michael didn't even know they had. He felt a little sheepish rolling it to the elevator like a hotel waiter, but it was better than making multiple trips. When he got back upstairs, he was surprised to find Mariah not only awake, but holding the door to the private wing open for him. \"I thought you'd have your hands full,\" she told him.\n\n\"Our kitchen wizard found this cart somewhere. Do you want to eat in the kitchenette or in the lounge?\"\n\nMariah was in favor of eating in the lounge. As with the picnic, Marcus had thought of everything. He even included a chilled bottle of vodka, a bottle of Midori melon liqueur, two martini glasses, and instructions for making Midori martinis written on a napkin. It was a sweet touch.\n\nMariah was pleased to find chopsticks. She tried unsuccessfully to convince Michael that the noodles were easier to eat with chopsticks because of their tendency to slither off the fork. Michael was amused to see that Henry was adept at taking handouts delicately from chopsticks without touching the utensils, but the beggar certainly did not spurn the bites he cadged from Michael.\n\nAfter they ate, they passed the time with poker and innocuous conversation. Mariah was a truly terrible poker player, but the more she lost, the more interested she became in the game. Michael found it entertaining to watch her refine and shift strategies. He could almost see her thought process. Before long, they were both yawning, and Michael declared an early bedtime.\n\nMariah hadn't managed to pirate one of Michael's tee shirts yet, and she was unwilling to ask, so she had to make do with another of the skimpy little sleep sets in her closet. She really wanted to sleep in her own bed, but she was sure that Michael would want to join her there. The last thing she wanted was for him to make a habit of sleeping in her bed. At least sleeping in his bed left the option to leave and return to her own.\n\nMariah was still scheming about how to achieve Michael-free sleep when he came through the adjoining door. \"Why do you look so guilty?\" he asked. Without waiting for an answer, he took her hand and led her to his bed. She curled up on her side of the bed, but he drew her close to him. She planned to move back to her own side once he fell asleep, but soon she was enjoying his warmth and was asleep before he was.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nChapter 3 is written and will be submitted once it's edited.
