        "This chapter was ridiculously difficult to write, but I'm happy with the finished product. I hope you all will agree. Sorry for the crazy long wait. No sex in this chapter either, sorry it would have been forced (in the writing sense, not the sex itself ;) ) if I'd added in there. Well enough talking, here it is. Enjoy\n\n---------------\n\nThis house was ridiculously large. Really over the top for two people. Gwen had looked for Tristan in all of the usual places she would expect him to be. He really didn't go very many places. He hardly ever left the house. But she couldn't find him. He wasn't in the library, he wasn't in his suite. Gwen was starting to lose her nerve. She'd been so prepared to talk to him finally, and now for once she couldn't find him. She wasn't going to ask anyone where he was. Gwen was quiet enough that she didn't think anyone suspected her of having a debilitating crush on Tristan. She wasn't about to give them any reason to suspect anything now. \n\n\"Looking for something?\" Gwen jumped when a voice rang out directly behind her. She jumped 180\u00b0 to face the unknown speaker. Thankfully she'd used the restroom recently.\n\n\"Ohmigod, Tristan!\" She instinctively brought her hand up over her chest. Her heart was racing. \"You scared me to death.\" At least in her fear she wasn't stuttering anymore. \n\nHe genuinely looked apologetic. \"It wasn't my intention, my sincerest apologies.\" He looked at her like she was a skittish horse. Fantastic, he thought she was even more neurotic than she probably was. She couldn't blame him. Every encounter they'd ever had really did suggest her insanity. \"I was actually looking for you.\" He continued politely. \"I was wondering if you might be able to help me with something.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. Does something need cleaned? Did I miss something?\" She nervously rambled. Tristan hadn't been displeased with any of her work, or anyone's as far she knew, as long as she'd worked at the manor. She feared that there was a first time for everything. \n\n\"No, no,\" he smiled reassuringly, \"Nothing like that.\" He smiled wider. \"I need a young woman's opinion on some redecorating I've been up to lately. I just realized that they are in short supply here. Do you feel up to it?\" \n\nShe nodded, dumbfounded. Surprisingly Tristan grinned at her and took her hand in his much larger one.Before she had time to react he pulled her along, through hallways that had seemed like mazes to her when she'd first started working at the manor. She watched him walk in front of her. It never ceased to surprise her how graceful all of his movements were, considering his condition. He moved so fluidly. Even if he hadn't been using prosthetics it was impressive based on his size alone. He was tall and muscular, yet he moved like a very masculine, well trained ballerina. Gwen smiled at the mental picture of Tristan in a tutu. Okay, maybe more of a skilled quarterback. \n\nThey reached the west wing and Tristan let go of her hand. She wasn't sure if he'd ever even realized that he'd been holding it. She hated this part of the manor. It was widely unused, and she would occasionally have to vacuum and dust the entire wing alone. It was tedious, but that wasn't what bothered her. The wing was downright scary when she was alone. Those thoughts seemed monumentally silly now when Tristan was next to her.\n\nShe was wondering why he'd brought her there. She didn't have to wait long to find out.\n\n\"Come here.\" He spoke like and excited child. She smiled in response and walked into a room she was very familiar with. It was one of the largest ones in the hall. She was surprised to find it completely bare. The floors where pulled up, some of the drywall was missing, not to mention all of the furniture. The room had been gutted. She instinctively gasped. \n\n\"Oh my gosh! What happened?\" \n\nHe looked at her, still grinning. \"Malia has twin brothers who will be staying with us for a while. I wanted a fresh canvas.\" He looked downright eccentric as he said it. \n\nGwen burst out laughing. When she could catch her breath she attempted to speak. \"Tristan,\" she laughed, \" You tore apart a beautiful, highly luxurious, historical suite, because you wanted a fresh canvas?\" \n\n\"Pretty much.\" He smiled charmingly. She finally noticed that he was studying her face, and looking at her strangely. She sobered instantly. \n\n\"So, um, what do you need help with?\" \n\n\"Colors, lighting, et cetera. I hired a company to instal a jungle gym in here. They're going to instal tunnels and a ball pit and a slide that goes through the floor.\" \n\n\"Wow.\" Gwen responded. \"How much time do you have, aren't they going to be back in a week?\" \n\nTristan grinned. \"Yep.\" \n\n\"That's very, um, ambitious of you.\" \n\n\"If you have enough money, people will work as fast as you need them to.\" The sentence would have seemed like bragging from anyone else. He said as a simple fact. He'd lived with an abundance of money his entire life. \n\n\"Isn't this a little over the top?\" She asked gently, trying not to rain on his parade. \n\n\"It is.\" He grinned at her. \"That's why it's so much fun. We could use some kid friendly areas in the manor anyway.\" He shrugged. \"Cain is going to swallow his tongue when he sees it.\" He was back to smiling. \n\nShe laughed softly. \"So what do you need help with?\" She asked after an awkward silence. He brought her over to a flimsy table by the far wall. It had blueprints laying on the surface as well as a lot of other things strewn around. Tristan handed her a booklet of paint swatches. \n\n\"I know all of the fun things I want to put in here, but I have no idea what colors should be where, or go together, or whatever.\" He sounded charmingly clueless. \n\nGwen nodded as she flipped through the many colors. \"This should be fun.\" She looked up to see Tristan smiling at her. This was going to be her chance. She had a reason to talk to him now. She didn't even have to make anything up. \n\n\"I never got a chance to thank you.\" He had his arms casually crossed across his chest. \n\nShe looked up from the colors she was flipping through. \"For what?\" She asked confused. \n\n\"For taking care of me when I was, indisposed.\" He was studying her face again, which made her nervous. \n\n\"Malia did-\" \n\n\"No, I remember. It was you. Malia has plenty of good qualities, but nursing is not one of them.\" He chuckled.\n\nShe smiled at that. \"I hardly did anything.\" \n\n\"Oh, don't be so modest. You had to clean up my vomit if I remember correctly.\" He looked slightly ashamed. \"Not one of my finest moments. So thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\" She answered simply. She felt different. She felt braver. For once she had the courage to make her move. She just didn't have any idea what her move was going to be. Luckily he saved her from another stuttering embarrassment.\n\n\"You want to know a secret?\" She shrugged at his unexpected question. He smiled charmingly at her. \"I didn't bring you up here just to have you pick out paint colors.\" \n\n\"You didn't?\" He had walked very close to her. \n\n\"No. Mostly I wanted to thank you.\" He paused, he was very close now. Gwen felt breathless. \"Which I did.\" His voice was soft, as if being so close made whispering instinctual. \n\n\"You did.\" She agreed in as soft a voice as he'd used. Gwen was staring at his lips, they were so close. She was a almost sure he wanted to kiss her, but she waited and he remained there, just watching her. Gwen didn't hesitate to raise on tiptoes, grabbing his broad shoulders for support, and meet his alluring lips with her own. She watched his reaction, her eyes half-lidded. At the initial contact his eyes went wide with surprise. She tentatively brought her tongue out to glide along the crease his closed lips made. It was the only move she needed. He made a deep noise in his throat as his arms wrapped around her back, pulling her close. He opened his mouth, letting her tongue explore and impatiently did the same with her mouth. She squeaked in surprise when he unexpectedly moved his hands to her ass and lifted her easily to better meet her mouth. He didn't walk to deposit her anywhere, just held her in his arms in the middle of the room, seemingly effortlessly so their mouths would be at the same level. She groaned appreciatively at his physical strength. The kiss was very hot, as it contained all of Gwen's longtime repressed attraction.\n\nSomeone knocked on the open door and cleared their throat. Gwen's eyes shot open, as did Tristan's. He slowly lowered her to the ground and turned to face the doorway. She was now shielded by his large frame and used the opportunity to straighten her clothes as well as her head. Tristan spoke to the newcomers as if nothing had happened. \n\n\"Ah yes, you must be from Dixon contracting. Come in, please come in.\" He ushered the four men into the room friendlily. He began to speak enthusiastically about his plans for the room. Gwen felt terribly exposed and started to walk towards the side wall so she could slip out as unnoticed as possible. Tristan had her wrist in his grasp before she even moved away a full stride. He was still speaking to the men, but his intent on her staying was clear. She didn't pay any attention to what he was telling the contractors, but eventually they all nodded in agreement and started hauling various equipment into the room. \n\nTristan then smiled down at her. \"You really didn't plan on escaping me so easily after that, did you?\" And once again Gwen was at a loss for words. \n\n------------\n\nBeing back at the manor had turned into a tortuous dance. It reminded Malia of the circling of two predators before they attacked each other, going for the kill. She was trapped in the middle, trying desperately to placate all parties involved. Her parents' hostility was hardly hidden. Cain's patience was wearing thin, which was at least harder to detect. Malia could see it in his guarded dark eyes. She missed those few precious days when he'd relaxed at the cabin. She felt incredibly selfish for taking that away from him because her fragile feelings couldn't deal with a casual relationship. As they'd distanced from each other she'd wondered more and more if she could actually handle that kind of a relationship. As the pain grew stronger any kind of connection seemed better than the new indifference he showed her. She never realized the physical pain that could manifest from her emotions. It felt like there was a huge hole in her chest.\n\nMalia needed to pull herself together or she would never be able to handle all of the people around her. She needed to stop thinking about herself. It was preferable to think about everyone else. She didn't want to be her right now. Tristan was holding everything together by a thin string at the moment and it was time she did what she could to help him out. She didn't have to be happy, she just needed to make them think she was. She could fall apart when she was on her own again, like she had for the past few nights. Malia closed her eyes and concentrated on her breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. When she opened her eyes again she was as ready as she was going to be. Time to talk to her family. \n\nShe walked into her parents' new suite. Olivia was already there with them. Derek and Aiden were more than likely enjoying the insanely elaborate room that had been built for them. She smiled at Tristan's eccentricity. Time to fake it like no one's business.\n\n\"Hi.\" Malia smiled widely. \"Sorry I had to talk to one of my friends for a second.\" She lied, probably the first of many. She'd been trying not to hyperventilate in the attached bathroom of her new room. \"Do you like it?\" She asked exuberantly, trying to stay focused on the positive aspects of being at Milan manor. \n\nHer parents looked relieved to see her, even though she'd seen them almost consistently since they'd left the unit. In fact, her brief departure to breathe had been the only time they'd been separated all day. How long would they look at her that way, would they do it forever? Olivia hugged her for probably the twentieth time that day. She didn't mind yet, she'd missed her little sister too. Her parents refrained this time, they'd had their share of group hugs for the day. It seemed it was time to redefine their 'normal'. \n\n\"It's definitely big.\" Kristen finally answered.\n\nJack snorted. \"That it is. This place could house the entire unit comfortably.\" Okay, so much for staying positive. \n\nMalia tried to keep smiling. \"Everyone here is so nice. Mrs. Smith makes an amazing triple layer chocolate cake. She made some for tonight, just for you guys. All of the food is amazing actually.\" Malia could give a genuine smile about that at least. She was glad to be away from reheated casseroles. \"And you met Tristan. He's very sweet and funny.\" \n\nJack raised an eyebrow. \"He seemed insane to me.\" \n\nEveryone laughed. \"Only a little.\" Malia said. \n\n\"I liked him.\" Olivia added. \"He was interesting.\" Malia's serious sister had a strange respect for people who were anything but serious. \n\n\"Do you like the rooms?\" She asked them as a group. \n\nNo one answered right away. Kristen finally spoke. \"Malia are you okay? Really okay?\" She sounded sad. \n\n\"Yes.\" Malia answered immediately. \"Of course I'm okay. My family is here with me now.\" She smiled, though she wasn't sure how convincing it was since it wasn't returned by her parents or sister. It was time to breach the subject she had been avoiding. \"Cain didn't hurt me, he wouldn't do that.\" Strangely enough it was the most convincing statement she'd made all day. When had she started believing that. She used to believe, with good reason, that all Cain would do to get what he wanted was hurt her. \n\nKristen's motherly stare bored into her. She stared back straight-faced. \"I'm okay mom, really.\" She reassured. Kristen studied her for a moment and nodded. Whether Kristen believed her or not was undetermined. Malia looked at her father. \"I know you're mad at Cain, and justifiably so. I just want you to try and be civil to him, okay? For me?\" \n\nJack clenched his jaw. \"You're going to pull the 'for me' card?\" He finally replied. Malia smiled and walked over to hug her father. \"You know my weakness princess.\" He kissed the top of her head. She finally let go and turned to her mother to hug her just as affectionately. \n\nThe four talked for hours in her parents' borrowed suite. Eventually Derek and Aiden came in looking for their family members. Malia hugged both of them. \n\n\"Jeez Aiden you must have grown a foot.\" Malia exclaimed, though he looked unchanged. \n\n\"What about me?\" Derek said angrily. \n\n\"Eh, not so much.\" She laughed at Derek's obnoxious angry face. She listened to them tell a story, though didn't take in a word with their uncontrollable interrupting of each other. Eventually one of the kitchen staff Malia didn't know came to announce dinner would be in an hour. Malia was surprised it had gotten so late. She had felt better for the first time in days as she spoke and interacted with her family again. It had been a beautiful distraction, but Malia knew it wouldn't last. \n\nTristan and Cain were standing in the dining room as she led her family in. Everyone had finally gotten rid of the ugly grey jumpsuit they'd inhabited for years. She never ceased to be surprised at Cain's resources as she browsed the newly stocked closets. Her brothers looked adorable in their black suits that matched their father's. Malia's mother wore black slacks and a coral filmy blouse. Malia had excitedly played dress up with Olivia, who'd shown as much enthusiasm about the closet as Malia had at first. She'd chosen a dark purple dress that showed off her legs. Malia had picked a simple black dress with a high neck and knee-length hemline. Malia noticed her lacy lingerie had been replaced by white and beige bras and panties. She became unreasonably sad at the discovery. It felt like he was trying to erase the memories she'd become most fond of. \n\nCain was laughing at something Tristan had said as Malia walked into the room. He kept his smile as he greeted her less than friendly parents. Olivia was more accepting of his greeting, not so indifferent to his masculine beauty. Malia mentally rolled her eyes. Dinner was delicious as she'd promised. Conversation was led by the over-exuberant version of Tristan. Eventually the discussion turned to the units. \n\n\"So, General, what is the future for the units. The population is happy to let entire communities rot in ignorance for some perceived past wrongdoing? How long will the people pay for their 'mistake'?\" Jack asked. \n\nCain didn't look at all intimidated by the confrontation. \"The units are more of a political issue than a military one at the moment. The reestablishment of a government has been a long and difficult process that is even now still ongoing. No one wants to breach the issue of the units for fear of the effects on their political careers.\" Cain sounded honestly disgusted. \n\n\"The advocate groups for the liberation of the units have been increasingly growing.\" Tristan added. \"The records for the units are sealed, so people looking for their lost loved ones have always supported their release. Others are recently joining their cause as the anger from the war has lessened. I believe there are even more supporters than is let on.\" \n\n\"So as this political pissing contest takes place the segregation that will be inevitable once the units are finally freed will only continue to grow?\" Jack asked outraged. \n\n\"Cain has repeatedly let his disagreement of the units be known.\" Tristan answered placatingly. \n\nCain looked like he wanted to roll his eyes at his brother. \"It isn't in my power to do anything about it.\" He finally elaborated. \"I take orders like the rest of the military. Our family isn't as influential as we once were, the politicians hardly go out of their way to please one man's opinion.\" \n\n\"We are less influential because of your opinions. You did what was in your power.\" Tristan finally addressed Cain instead of Malia's family. He turned to Jack and Kristen again. \"Our late father had differing opinions on the units than Cain. It is because he chose to publicly announce his less popularly held opinion that we lost some of our friends in high places.\" Tristan snarled, sounding negative for the first time all day. \"They were mad because they couldn't buy your allegiance. We're better off without them.\" \n\nCain looked annoyed again. \"The point is,\" He said slowly and deliberately, \" the liberation of the units is covered in so much red tape that it will take time, but it will eventually happen.\" \n\nThankfully Jack seemed semi placated by Cain's statement. Conversation turned to the history of the manor. Malia ate her chocolate cake and watched Cain's mouth move as he spoke. He didn't look in her direction once. She finally looked away, only to find her mother staring at her. Malia smiled but had no doubt about the less than reassuring effect it had, she didn't have the energy to fake it anymore. \n\n\"I noticed a courtyard,\" Kristen interrupted, \"it's a beautiful night. Malia will you show it to me?\" Malia wasn't sure which sounded worse, being forced to watch Cain be unaffected by their emotional distance, or being forced to talk about it with her mom. Luckily choice wasn't a factor. \n\n\"Of course.\" Malia answered. She could see Cain finally glance at her in her peripherals. She stood and left with Kristen. She had never felt awkward around her mother until now. They were close, they joked constantly and talked about everything. She'd never tried to hide anything from her until now. Malia could feel the same emotional barrier forming between herself and her family that she felt with Cain. Soon she would be alone, surrounded by people. \n\nThe courtyard was beautiful at night, as was to be expected. There were outdoor lights strategically placed to illuminate the brick path that wound through the gardens. ",
        "\"The flowers here are beautiful.\" Kristen finally broke the silence. \n\n\"Everything here is beautiful.\" Malia said forlornly. \n\n\"And everyone, it would seem.\" Kristen added meaningfully. Malia frowned and looked up at her mother. \"You weren't trying to hide the fact that you've been staring at General Cain Malcolm for the past hour, were you?\" Malia shrugged and felt completely defeated. \"You're in love with him?\" Kristen asked. \n\nMalia was surprised at her mother's conclusion. She'd never been prone to emotional fickleness. It was unlike her to make a connection to anyone that deeply so quickly. If she hadn't felt it so completely herself she would have never believed it possible. Malia looked down at the bricks she was walking on. \"It doesn't matter if I am or not. He doesn't love me.\" \n\nKristen nodded thoughtfully. They continued to walk through the gardens in silence. \"I can remember being pregnant with you like it was yesterday.\" Kristen grinned, breaking the silence. \"Your father was a mess, utterly terrified for nine months. He would read all of his med school textbooks and tell me all of the things that could go wrong.\" Malia smiled at the mental picture. \"We were so young. I should have been terrified right there with him, but I wasn't. I felt absolutely peaceful, and when he would storm in telling me the percentages of babies born with extra or missing appendages I would just laugh at him and kiss away his fears. When we found out that you were a girl, with the standard two arms and two legs at that, I became even more peaceful and optimistic. I saw all of the future memories we would make. My own daughter to raise and love and watch grow into a woman. Your future was so bright. And then there was the war and we went to the unit and I wasn't sure how the future would pan out anymore. But I was sad that you wouldn't get to do all of those things I'd wanted for you. We didn't get to shop for prom dresses or plan a graduation party. I guess somewhere down the road I'd just assumed I'd never have to help you through your first broken heart either. I hadn't exactly mourned that one.\" Kristen paused and looked thoughtfully into the garden. \"You know I thought I was in love once before I met your father. I was sixteen and he was a senior. He was an asshole and I was heart-broken when it ended. When I met your father it's not like it got better. It was more like it had never really been that bad. I realized that I never had really loved anyone until I loved Jack. But I didn't know that until I fell in love with him.\" \n\n\"Are you saying I'm not in love with Cain? I only think I am?\" Malia frowned. \n\n\"No. Only you know how you feel. I'm just saying that life goes on, whether you want it to or not. And no matter how negative the future may look today, life will bring you good things as well as the bad. You are in control of your perspective in the mean time. So today you're in love with him, but tomorrow? A week from now? What about twenty years from now? It's your perspective, you decide. But I will tell you something, unrequited love is a much more romantic notion than it is in practice. You don't deserve that Malia. If he doesn't love you, he doesn't deserve you. That's just my opinion on any man in general. My opinion on that man in particular, is that he will never deserve you.\" \n\n\"Oh really? You don't like him? I would never have guessed. Dad likes him at least right?\" Malia said dryly and laughed when Kristen raised her eyebrows in response. \n\n\"You'll be lucky if he's still alive when we go back in.\" Kristen smirked. \n\nAs they walked back towards the house Malia started to worry. \"Mom, you aren't going to tell dad what I told you, are you?\" \n\nKristen was silent for a moment. \"He only wants to make sure you're okay, that you weren't hurt.\" \n\n\"I'm fine.\" Malia insisted. She didn't want to talk about what her and Cain had and hadn't done, not with her parents. \n\nKristen sighed. \"I'm not going to tell him, but know that if you need us, we're there okay?\" \n\n\"Okay.\" Malia hugged her mom. She'd missed her so much. \n\n---------------\n\nTristan loved trying to influence people to believe things they hadn't before believed. Right now all of that energy was focused on Jack Yates. Kristen at first had seemed as angry as her husband, but he found she was more observant and protective. Jack was looking for revenge. Tristan felt like he'd made some leeway at dinner with the discussion of the units. Cain would never let go of his pride enough to tell them that he had advocated on behalf of the units for years. Tristan wasn't under the same restraints. \n\nThe relationship that had formed between his brother and Malia was new however. He'd seen it as a possibility, but sticking them together in a cabin for a week could have gone either way. He was glad that it had gone the way it had. Matchmaker Cain could use some of his own medicine. Cain deserved to find love, even if he was proverbially kicking and screaming. Tristan smiled to himself. He'd been smiling a lot lately.\n\nHis slow growing relationship with Gwen Thompson had been completely unexpected. He had been planning on thanking her, but when he found her she looked different to him. She was very beautiful with her well-defined bone structure, bright blue eyes, and golden hair that ran down to the middle of her back. However he'd noticed her very rarely before. She had an uncanny ability to blend into the surroundings, though it shouldn't have been possible with her face and body. He remembered looking into those eyes when he had been nearly delusional with fever and feeling like it was the first time he'd ever truly seen her. \n\nWhen she'd laughed at him for gutting the room something inside him shifted, something that had been dormant for years. She was so aloof he'd been almost certain that he'd been the only one feeling it. Then she'd kissed him, she'd made the final move. He'd felt like he'd been hooked up to jumper cables. How could he not have noticed this woman for over a year? Tristan had a talent for reading people, seeing their motivations, but he didn't see a thing when he looked at Gwen. \n\nIt was like her thoughts were under lock and key. He found himself just staring at her, trying to see what she wanted. So when the contracting team interrupted them he'd been surprised that she'd tried to slip away from him. He'd felt like the wind had been knocked out of him from that unexpected kiss and she was seemingly unaffected. After he'd given the team some semblance of instruction he'd pulled her to the suite across from were they'd been. The room that had become Jack and Kristen's. She'd looked nervous and unsure and a little scared, which had bothered him. She'd been the one to initiate the kiss but maybe he'd taken it too far when he'd lifted her up and clung to her for dear life. He'd hoped that that wasn't the case.\n\n\"I'm sorry about that.\" Gwen had motioned to the room they'd left. \n\nTristan had cinched his brow at that. \"Really? I'm not.\" She'd looked up at him then and he believed then that Gwen Thompson could be the woman he spent the rest of his life with. He could get used to looking into those blue eyes and trying to solve the puzzle that made up her psyche. \"I want to see where this goes,\" He'd decided to be upfront with her as he wasn't sure what persona to adopt since he couldn't read her very well. \"what if we take this slow?\" \n\nShe looked up at him as if she were confused for a moment and he found himself getting nervous. Then she'd given a slight nod that had made him inexplicably happy. He didn't know this woman, yet he felt like everything was going to work out. However now he wanted to bite his own tongue out as he had suggested 'taking it slow'. It seemed he was in a constant and painful state of arousal. He'd loved every moment of trying to coax information out of Gwen, but being in her presence affected him greatly. \n\nHe'd learned that she had grown up an only child of a single mother. Her father had ran off when he'd learned about the pregnancy and hadn't been heard of since. Gwen's young mother had been forced to move back into her parent's house with Gwen. They'd lived peacefully in the country farmhouse. Gwen's grandfather was a veteran and wouldn't hear of joining a unit when the war was in its prime. Their distance from pretty much anything had made it a non-issue. Gwen hadn't been formally educated, but she'd been a sponge to any teaching her family had offered her. She'd read consistently with lack of any peers around to entertain her. She had been the one to insist leaving the farmhouse in search of employment. The shock of going from communicating with only three others her entire life to an entire staff had been nearly debilitating. When she'd described how much she'd wanted to run home in those early days her face showed a hidden pride in herself, it had been an achievement for her to stay. \n\nHe'd gotten the entire story over the span of a week, with plenty of effort on his part. He'd used information about himself as a bargaining chip. She'd known a surprising amount of information about him already, which made him wonder how any work was getting done with the amount of gossiping being transferred amongst the staff. He'd told her things she didn't know. He'd told her about the dog he'd found when he was eight and had proceeded to hide in the manor for weeks when his parents had adamantly forbidden him to keep the mangled mutt. He'd told her about his overbearing mother who was viciously unfair to Cain while she overcompensated her 'affection' towards him. He'd told her about his sweet, plotting grandmother who had an ulterior motive for most things, though always with pure intentions. He'd kept the conversation light on his part, trying to avoid scaring Gwen away with his emotional scars just yet. He'd tried to make her laugh as much as possible. Her laugh made him smile. However her laugh had proven fatal to him. He wanted to kiss her again, he wanted to do much more. Not yet. He groaned in frustration. \n\nThe phone rang on the end table by the couch he was slouched on. He picked it up on the second ring. \n\n\"Yes?\" He sounded tired, even to his own ears. \n\n\"Tristan sir, you told me to inform you if Jack Yates approached Master Cain.\" It was Clint Jepson, a longtime member of the security team who was currently in the vault that was the security room, looking at a wall of monitors that surveilled numerous areas of the manor. \n\nTristan sighed into the receiver. \"Where are they?\" \n\n\"He looks to be heading towards Master Cain's office sir.\" \n\n\"I'll intercept.\" He finally replied, dreading having to be in a faux chipper mood again. He was usually genuinely in a good mood, but the forced diplomacy had been taking a toll. \"And Jepson?\" \n\n\"Yes sir.\" Clint replied. \n\n\"Once again, please cut out the whole 'master' thing.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" The dedicated guard replied. Tristan smiled at the phone.\n\n\"Goodnight Jepson.\" He laughed and hung up the phone, knowing repeating that particular order to the man was futile. \n\nTime for damage control. He knew that Jack would want to exact his revenge on Cain. He just wasn't sure how to deal with it. There was one thing he was certain about, if Jack confronted Cain physically it wouldn't end very well. Cain could take a lot of shit before he exploded, but Tristan didn't think is patience extended as far as to overlook being punched in the face. The mental picture made him smile. \n\nTristan knew the manor very well. He took several hidden service hallways that had long been forgotten to get to the hall in front of Cain's office before Jack did. Tristan made it a point to casually walk down a side hall to 'run into' Jack. He didn't expect Jack to be fooled, he wasn't stupid, still it was more polite than to acknowledge he'd been spying on the man. \n\n\"Jack!\" Tristan feigned surprise. \"Have you taken to late night walks as well? I've become quite the insomniac myself lately.\" Unfortunately that was true, but mostly due to sleepless nights thinking about Gwen.\n\n\"I plan on speaking to Cain, Tristan. Do you plan on protecting him, or letting him own up to his mistakes?\" \n\nAh so bullshit time was over. Tristan smiled sheepishly. \"Mr. Yates, if you knew just how driven Cain is by responsibility you would see the humor in that statement.\" \n\n\"I've not been able to see the humor in much lately.\" Jack replied stone-faced.\n\nTristan was still dressed in his dinner suit. He lifted the leg of his pants to expose his silvery alloy ankle and shin. \"Did Malia tell you I was a double amputee?\" \n\nJack cinched his eyebrows, but didn't let any other expression betray his reaction. \n\nTristan smiled and dropped his pants leg back into place. \"I'd imagined she wouldn't have. I don't tell you to make you uncomfortable or evoke sympathy. I just want to clarify some of the motivation behind Cain's actions.\" Tristan gave his first genuine look to Jack, and it was one pleading understanding. \n\nJack gave a resigned sigh. \"I'm listening.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" Tristan nodded. It was so difficult deciding where to begin. The events that led to the fateful winter night had been intertwined in Cain's life since before he was born. \"I guess you would have to understand our father to understand why Cain was the way he was in his youth. We come from a line of military men. My father had more political aspirations than his predecessors. My mother was socially ambitious as well. I'm not blaming them, Cain made his own choices. For a long time he tried to rise to the standards they held for him as their first-born son. He seemed to always be working for approval from our father that never came. He was so hard on Cain. So eventually he gave up. He started drinking, doing drugs, sleeping around. He did anything to blacken our parents' hard-earned reputation. He finally had dad's attention.\" \n\nTristan smirked cynically. He remembered watching Cain spiral downward and feel completely helpless to stop it. He'd begged his role-model to stop, only to be brushed aside. He'd felt like Cain had abandoned him. It was a dark time for his entire family.  \n\n\"They had horrible fights. They said things family members should never say to one another. Then one day our father died. He had a massive and unexpected heart attack. I think Cain felt responsible. His behavior worsened. He was on a self-destructive path that no one could save him from. One January night I saw him go outside with two of his friends. They were drunk and high. I followed them to try and get Cain to come back inside. He never listened to me, but I had to try. I was so scared he was going to end up killing himself. I caught up with them at the overlook of the lake. I saw someone jump into the icy water and all of my nightmares came to life. I jumped in instinctively, no hesitation. I can still remember hitting the water. It was so cold it hurt. It was so hard to think, to look for my brother. Every move was painful, but eventually I couldn't feel it so much anymore. I started to feel numb, and get very tired. It was so hard to move and I kept loosing my focus. Later I realized that Cain hadn't jumped, his friend had. He'd died in the water that night. I came very close myself. Cain called the security team and they rescued me. The doctors couldn't save my legs. But I was never angry with Cain, he was alive. He was also different. If I had to sacrifice my legs to save my brother from himself, it was well worth it. He was back, he cared again. Except he had a new burden to carry, one of unbearable guilt. He felt responsible. He hasn't had a drink in seven years, he joined the military and worked his ass off to become a general. Anyway, I was feeling sorry for myself one night, I'd had too much to drink. I told Cain that I wanted to get married and have children. I believe I told him that no one would want to marry a cyborg like myself. The truth was I shut down a little bit that night seven years ago too. I stopped thinking about my own future. I pitied myself.\" Tristan hadn't realized this about himself until very recently. Gwen had made him see that he hadn't been going after what he wanted anymore. He had been using his disability as an excuse to stop living his life. \n\n\"Cain felt like it was his fault. He felt like he'd ruined my life, and I let him feel that way. I guess a part of me was mad at him for giving up in the first place. Cain shouldn't have kidnapped your daughter. I can never make an argument to justify that. He wanted to find someone I couldn't easily dismiss. Someone from a unit couldn't be returned. He knew I would be obligated to get to know her at least, to try and help her. He wanted to fix his mistakes.\" Tristan was surprised at how easily the story had fallen from his lips. He usually didn't talk about that night. Cain was so much harder on himself than their father had ever been. Tristan was afraid he would never forgive himself. He tried not to add fuel to the fire of his guilt. Jack looked conflicted. This man wasn't used to holding a grudge, it was wearing him down. \n\n\"Why did he want Olivia.\" Jack finally asked, sounding more emotional than he looked. \n\n\"He thought her medical experience would make her more open to my condition. I am prone to skin infections that can get pretty bad.\" \n\nJack nodded. He finally spoke again. \"I'll give him a chance to redeem himself. It's what Malia wants.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" Tristan responded sincerely. \n\n\"He's lucky to have a brother like you.\" Jack added. \n\n\"I'm lucky to have him too. I hope you'll come to see that as well.\" Tristan smiled, feeling immensely relieved as he and Jack walked back to their respective rooms. \n\n----------------------------\n\nCain could feel the alcohol course through his veins like a long lost friend. The burn as it ran down his throat was so long past due that it was almost foreign to him. The warmth spread along his body like a caress. His muscles released their never-ending tension into the padded leather office chair. \n\nWithout knowing how he got there, he found himself standing in front of the door that would lead into Malia's new suite. The hall was dark and deserted, all of the pristine white doors firmly closed. He didn't hesitate to open the door and enter, closing it behind him without any care or consideration to the noise he was making. He took another swig from the bottle he didn't remember bringing with him. \n\nThe room was mostly dark, moonlight shining through the open balcony doors seemed to illuminate only the bed in the middle of the room. The white duvet was on the floor giving him a perfect view of the inhabitants of the bed. Malia's dark hair pooled around the pristine white pillow as her head arched back into it. She wasn't alone.\n\nThe blond man was there, on top of her. He seemed to be enjoying himself ver much as he thrust quickly in and out of Cain's woman. Cain was glued to the floor, though he desperately wanted to rip the asshole off of Malia. She seemed to be in clueless ecstasy as well. Her arms encircled his pale scrawny neck as she met his thrusts with her hips. She moaned and pulled blondie closer. Cain felt the bottle slip from his fingers and heard it loudly crash to the wood floor. Malia continued to be entranced, unfazed by the violent noise. The blond man looked at Cain and grinned knowingly as he started to move faster and more deliberately violent. \n\nFinally Cain could move again. He nearly ran in his haste to get to the man in the bed. He was going to kill him with his bare hands. Malia was his, untouched by ay other man. Cain grabbed him by the back of his neck and pulled him off of malia effortlessly. As he thought of all of the ways he would torture the prick the man dissipated into the air. \n\nCain looked down at Malia lying naked in the white bed. She looked scared as she looked up at him. She started to scramble towards the far edge of the mattress and Cain pounced on her, pinning her in place, her back to his now very aroused front. Cain's clothes were gone, dissolving just as the blond man had a moment before. His erect cock nestled comfortably between Malia's trapped thighs. She began to struggle in earnest, sobbing and screaming. ",
        "\"You're mine.\" He growled in her ear irritably. Strangely enough he could smell the alcohol on his own breath, reminding him of its presence. \n\n\"Cain, please! You're hurting me!\" She screamed desperately. Cain frowned, he wasn't actively trying to hurt her. He just wanted her to stay still, to stop trying to get away. He lifted his weight and flipped her over quickly to face him. He held his weight on his forearms. He wanted to get sick when he saw her pain filled expression. \"Cain, please,\" she repeated, softly this time as torrents of tears leaked down her face, \"you're hurting me.\" \n\nCain woke up with his head on his desk. He felt physically ill from the emotional turmoil of the too vivid dream. He sat back in his chair and took deep breaths with his eyes closed. Cain could feel a tension headache starting to form. He had tons of paperwork to sift through after his brief hiatus from his home office. He was also personally involved in future arrangements for Malia's family. He would rather them be gone sooner rather than later. Except that wasn't exactly true. He didn't want Malia to leave. She was funny and beautiful and so innocently sexy it made him ache. He didn't want her to leave because if she left it would just be him and his responsibilities again.\n\nIt was selfish and she didn't deserve it. He was hurting her, he knew he was, but he couldn't give her what she wanted. He was too damaged to be in a relationship with Malia. He wasn't able to be a husband and a father, like she would expect, like she deserved. She was his escape from responsibility, not an addition to it. \n\nHe stared at the papers that scattered across his desk. He needed to work. He'd been telling himself that for the past two hours. Yet all he seemed able to do was sit in the leather office chair and stare at the messy desk, and sleep apparently. Malia's face at dinner had been bothering him all night. It was the same pain filled face that had invaded his dream. He hadn't been able to openly look at her like he'd wanted to, but he'd felt her stare throughout his tasteless dinner. He usually loved watching her eat, her face was so expressive as she enjoyed the various courses. He'd consciously avoided even glancing her way though, not in front of everyone, not when he couldn't keep his own emotions under control. But he'd gotten the chance to look at her, just once, when her mother had asked her to join her for a walk. Malia hadn't been looking at him but he could see the pain nonetheless. \n\nHe wanted her so badly. He wanted to be able to kiss her again and show her all of the things she'd been missing. He could still see how she looked at him wet from the rain and pinned to the tree by his own body. She was so sexy. He also wanted to talk to her though, he wanted to make sure she was okay. He wanted to goad her into saying something deliciously smart-alecky. She had a quick with that brought out his competitive nature. He loved to verbally battle with her and see who would come out on top. \n\nThe phone rang, making him jump and interrupting his musings. He picked it up, annoyed. \"Yes?\" His voice was abrupt. \n\n\"Master Cain, I'm sorry to interrupt you sir.\" It was Jepson. Cain sighed. The old man had been working at the manor since before Cain was born. He was traditional, running things the way Cain's father had. \n\n\"It's fine Jepson.\" Cain interrupted an apology he didn't deserve from the old man. \"And it's just Cain.\" \n\n\"Yes sir.\" Jepson answered, though Cain knew it was useless to try and correct him. \"Miss Milly Clayton is requesting entrance into the manor. She wishes to speak with you sir.\" \n\nCain sighed. \"Transfer the call to me Jepson, but don't open the gate.\" \n\n\"Yes sir.\" He answered professionally. \n\nMilly didn't wait for something as tedious as a 'hello'. \"Cain!\" She yelled into the receiver and he moved it slightly away from his face. \"Your security team isn't letting me in.\" She sounded comically outraged. \n\n\"You don't live her Milly.\" He explained, as if speaking to a child. \n\nShe paused, clearly taken aback. \"Hmm, am I to take it that Cain Malcolm does not wish for the pleasure of my company?\" \n\n\"As the screened phone calls didn't seem to make much of an impression I figured a reinforced wrought iron gate might do the trick.\" \n\nShe laughed snidely. \"Well, well, we are feeling testy tonight. Problems with the equipment Cain?\" \n\n\"Go home Milly.\" He sighed. Milly's manipulative banter was like a sordid parody of Malia's quick wit. Milly paused for a moment. \n\n\"How has you cousin been Cain? The young girl staying with you while her parents are away.\" She clarified. \n\n\"Why do you ask?\" Cain guessed Milly was talking about Malia. A cold chill ran up his spine at the bitch's interest. \n\n\"So touchy. I'm simply politely inquiring.\" Nothing Milly did was simple. She was the definition of conniving. \n\n\"Milly I want you to listen to me well. You and me are long over. There is nothing now or in the future between us. You are going to go home and end all contact with myself as well as anyone associated with me personally. Milly you do not want to get on my bad side, I assure you.\" His voice sounded cold and menacing, even to himself. \n\n\"Wow, very intimidating General.\" She replied unfazed. \"I do believe I've heard that tone before, but I've never had the pleasure of having the words aimed at myself. I'd reconsider who doesn't want to get on whoms bad side Cain.\" With that she hung up. Cain gritted his teeth and used all of his restraint to gently set the handset back down. \n\nThe restraint it took, however, seemed to completely deplete his reserve and he found himself getting up and leaving his office. He didn't think too much about the hallways he was taking until he was directly in front of a tall white closed door in a silent hall with similarly closed doors on all sides. This wasn't a good idea, he thought briefly before opening the door as quietly as possible and slipping inside. \n\n----------------------------\n\nMalia had visited with her sister after dinner, they'd briefly talked about their less than certain future. She felt guilty that she wanted to be alone all night when she hadn't interacted with any of them in so long. She just felt like she needed to think. She needed to let the advice her mother had given her simmer in her mind. Gwen had visited her after her sister had left. It had seemed like she wasn't going to get the chance to be alone until late into the night. \n\nHowever, Malia had welcomed Gwen's visit. She was more animated than she had ever seen her. She'd told Malia about kissing Tristan and her subsequent embarrassment. Malia was ecstatic and happy to be focusing on someone else for once. \n\n\"It was exactly everything I ever thought it would be.\" Gwen had said excitedly. \"Except more, you know?\" \n\nUnfortunately she did know. Malia simply nodded, not wanting to take any feelings of optimism away from her friend. Gwen had sobered, however. \n\n\"It's just, he hasn't done anything since. Like at all.\" Gwen frowned. \"I just wonder if he didn't feel the same connection that I did. Maybe he just wants to be friends.\" She then looked sad. \"Maybe he just wants to go back to a professional relationship.\" \n\n\"I highly doubt that.\" Malia had laughed. \"You are gorgeous Gwen. Like beauty queen, goddess-like gorgeous. He's probably just as insecure as you are, which is unfounded in both of your cases. You should talk to him. Talk to him like you're talking to me now.\" Malia smiled reassuringly at her. \n\nShe smiled back. She was finding herself, Malia could see. \"You're right. Thank you Malia, I wouldn't have talked to him in the first place if it weren't for you.\" \n\n\"I didn't do anything.\" Malia replied. \n\n\"You did. You're so courageous, and you don't even see it. When I left my home, my family, I was absolutely terrified. I did so willingly and knowingly. You were taken forcefully from yours and you had the courage and will to fight for your family, for yourself. You're brave Malia, and stronger than you realize.\" Gwen seemed to see that Malia needed to be alone then. \"Thanks for listening to me.\" She smiled. \"I'm going to get some sleep and think about what I'm going to say to Tristan. You should sleep too, you've had a busy day.\" \n\n\"Geez you've gotten downright bossy Gwen.\" Malia smiled. \"Shut up already.\" She said in jest. \n\nGwen smiled and stuck out her tongue at Malia as she left the room. \n\nMalia was exhausted, but her mind refused to take the hint. She laid on her side and thought about Cain. She felt like there was an inherent attraction between them, uncontrollable and instinctive. But would the feeling last forever? She desperately hoped not, not if she couldn't be with him. Her mother had told her he didn't deserve her, she was probably right. But it wasn't about equality and fairness, it was emotional. Right now her emotions were telling her to do whatever possible to be with Cain. \n\nShe could go to him. She could tell him that she wanted whatever relationship they could have, even if that meant purely physical. It was so tempting. Instant gratification, and it would most certainly be oh so gratifying. Maybe they would even grow to have a future. He could fall in love with her eventually. \n\nThe thought made her stomach clench. How pathetic a picture she would make, waiting for him to deign to love her one day. Her mother was right, Gwen was right, she didn't deserve that. She was stronger than that. She'd come to the manor with a will to fight him, to be reunited with her family at any cost. And yet somewhere along the line she'd lost that strength. She felt like she'd been a puppet to his will lately. Malia clenched on to that anger because it was preferable to the pain. \n\nOn that thought the door to her bedroom opened quietly, silhouetting a tall figure briefly before it closed again just as quietly. She knew that figure, intimately. She turned on the small lamp that was on the nightstand. Cain looked surprised as he stood just inside of the door. \n\n\"Oh, you're up.\" \n\n\"I am.\" She sounded blunt, spurred on by her recent track of thoughts. \"What are you doing her Cain?\" \n\nHe was slightly taken aback by her tone. As had always been the case, he didn't respond well to her authoritative streak. \"I live here.\" He stepped closer to her bed, substantially more confident. She sat up against the headboard and folded her arms across her chest. \n\n\"Did you want something?\" She sounded even more irritated, because she was.\n\nHe laughed sardonically. \"Little girl, I want quite a few things.\" He looked her over lecherously, clearly trying to get a reaction. When she stared back at him unamused he sighed resignedly. \"I wanted to make sure you were okay.\" \n\n\"I'm fine, thank you.\" She said dismissively. He clenched his jaw, aggravated at her response. \n\n\"If tonight was your version of fine, you should invest in acting classes.\"\n\n\"Why? Because it would be incomprehensible that someone should not hang on your every word. I'm surprised that no one jumped your bones right there at the dinner table, with females being in your presence.\" \n\n\"Keep your voice down.\" He growled, looking downright angry. \n\nMalia laughed snidely. \"That's right, you're trying to play knight in shining armor now. Please, if one of us is failing at fooling anyone it's you Cain. My parents have seen you for the person you really are from the beginning.\" \n\n\"Malia.\" He said warningly. \n\n\"What Cain. I should be quiet? You came in here. Why? To see if I was okay? Of course I'm not okay Cain. Did you think that I was okay, that I would just be okay? I'm trying here.\" It took everything she had to keep the tears that threatened to fall at bay, but she did. \"I can't be with you Cain, not if you don't want me. And if I can't be with you, then I need to learn to be without you. I'm trying.\" She repeated. She clenched her jaw as hard as she could to keep from breaking down. The fact that she accomplished it gave her a minuscule twinge of pride. \n\nCain looked highly taken aback. She needed him to leave. If she was going to stay strong, to not burst into tears, she needed him to leave. But she desperately wanted him to come to her. She wanted him to tell her that he wanted her just as badly as she wanted him. She wanted to hear that he loved her, that she was more than another lay to him. She wanted him to just kiss her, to just offer a sliver of hope that they could one day be something more. If that thought made her pathetic or weak she would live with that. If only she could have him it would be well worth it. \n\nCain nodded and turned to walk to the door. He left without looking back and closed the door behind him. Malia felt a very real physical pain in her chest as that door latched closed. Her heart had finally broken. There was no hope for any of girlish dreams. Cain didn't care about her and he never would. \n\n----------------------\n\nCain threw up in the trash can in his room's kitchenette. God what was wrong with him! Why the fuck had he gone in to see her? She was right, he couldn't be involved with her emotions if he wasn't willing to tell her that he loved her too. And he wasn't ready for that. But something was bothering him, literally making him sick. \n\n'I can't be with you Cain, not if you don't want me' She'd said so matter of factly. Of course he fucking wanted her, he wanted her more than he'd wanted anyone before in his life. But it wasn't enough, and it never would be. He would never be able to live up to what she deserved. He'd wronged her so much already. He was trying to fix his problems, not make them worse. \n\nEven with all of his success, he felt like a chronic fuck-up. His father had seen that side of him, not because he was an unsatisfiable man, but because that side of Cain had always been there. Cain had the potential to do whatever he set his mind to, but there was the part of him that would always work to undermine his progress. He couldn't pretend with Malia. Cain felt like his life was just one wrong move from crumbling around him all the time and he would not bring other people into that, not people he cared about. Tristan was his brother, Finn was his friend, he couldn't change that, but he would not bring another person into his life that he knew he would only eventually disappoint. \n\nBut it hurt more than he thought it would, seeing her in pain. He missed her so much. She felt like the missing piece of himself, every aspect of him that was lacking. Why the fuck not just get it over with, Cain thought, as he poured amber poison into a crystal glass. If he couldn't have Malia he could have this. He shot the drink back, ending seven years of sobriety. It burnt as it went down, though not the satisfying burn of his dream. \n\nHe needed more than one drink to get the picture of Malia out of his head. He threw the glass across the room and grabbed the bottle. Damn it he needed the blissful cloudiness quicker than he could get it. He slunk down into the beige lounge, bottle pressed against his lips. He knew he would end up here one day, staying sober was just prolonging the inevitable. He would feel better, just as soon as the bottle was empty. Then it would be okay again. \n\nHis door opened without any preamble. He didn't bother to look over, he simply took another long swig. \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" Tristan asked harshly as he walked over to Cain. Cain took another quick drink before Tristan could grab the bottle from him viciously. Cain didn't try to fight him for it. \"What are you doing?!\" He repeated angrily. \n\nCain finally looked at his younger brother. Tristan looked shocked and furious, and maybe a little hurt, but Cain's vision was slightly blurry now so he couldn't be sure. He was wearing boxers and a t-shirt, clearly having been woken up. \"What does it look like I'm doing?\" Cain answered. \"I'm enjoying a drink.\" \n\n\"Yeah? So that's the plan? Just throw seven fucking years away Cain? You're just going to give everything up and go back to that asshole you were before?\" Tristan sounded very angry. \n\n\"What's it to you? I get it Tristan, I fucked your whole life up. I'll never be able to live it down okay. So sorry, sorry I'm such a shitty brother, such a shitty person. I should have just left seven years ago.\" \n\n\"No, you don't get to use that as an excuse for this. I have never held that night against you Cain. If you feel guilty, that's on you. I have never given you a guilt trip about what was an accident. I'm sorry you think that you've ruined my life. Clearly we have different perspectives on that, because my life has never been in a better place than it is right now. If you got your head out of your ass you might be able to see that. But no, you're so worried about making things even that you can't see anything that's right in front of you. I don't give a shit about what happened seven years ago. But tonight? This?\" He motioned to the bottle in his hand. \"I'm not going to do this again. I will not watch you do this to yourself again.\"\n\nThis is where a younger Cain would have told his brother to go to hell, but he didn't feel that emptiness anymore. The alcohol wasn't taking away his guilt, his responsibility. Instead he felt unbearably vulnerable. He barely made it to the trash can again before he got sick. \"I think I'm in love with her Tristan.\" He mumbled, his head still in the trash can. \n\nTristan waited until Cain stood again, still feeling nauseated. \"That's a good thing right? She loves you, you love her.\" \n\nCain just shook his head. \n\n\"Cain, don't think about what she should feel or what you should feel, who deserves or doesn't deserve whom. If you do love her, then you of all people can find a way to make it work.\" He raised the bottle again and looked menacing. \"But this, this isn't the way to accomplish that, to accomplish anything.\" \n\n\"It's just.\" Cain frowned, trying to voice more feelings than he was comfortable sharing. \"I feel like I'm not in control of anything anymore. The only time I wasn't in control before, it wasn't good. You know?\" \n\n\"You can't control other people Cain. You have to trust people to love them. You need to trust that Malia won't let you get to that place again because she loves you. Just like I won't let you get there again.\" \n\nCain shook his head in denial. \"No one could stop me before. I couldn't stop myself. It's like I wasn't in control of my own body anymore Tristan, you don't understand. I'm terrified of loosing my control like that again. But part of me wants it, desperately, and that terrifies me.\" \n\n\"You aren't twenty-one anymore Cain. The fact that you're scared of loosing control shows me just how much you've changed. The old you didn't give a shit, about anyone or anything. You're not going to turn into that person again Cain.\" He sounded absolutely adamant, completely sure of himself. \n\nCain's head was spinning. He needed to pull himself together. Tristan was right. He'd worked too fucking hard to throw everything away now. If he couldn't live without Malia, he would find a way to have her with him. He would beg for forgiveness on his knees to her parents if he had to. The feeling that he might just love her too made him feel sick to his stomach, which wasn't exactly reassuring. But he suddenly had an overwhelming desire to go back to her. He needed to tell her that he wanted her. She needed to hear that he cared about her immensely, and maybe, just maybe he even loved her too. She didn't have to find the blond douche to fill her with babies. That thought was reassuring. He surprisingly didn't feel any fear in thinking about having children with Malia. He could raise kids, if he set his mind to it, if Malia was there to help him. He was getting way to far ahead of himself. He needed to go to her first and foremost. \n\nCain walked back to the room he'd recently fled, leaving Tristan in his own room without an explanation. He wasn't nearly as conscious about the noise he was making this time around. He would feel okay once he told her. They could be together. They would figure it out together. He opened the door and turned on the light-switch. It only took him a second to take in the empty bed. Malia wasn't there. Then he noticed turned over nightstand by the balcony doors which were now open. Cain's heart sank into his stomach. ",
        "---------------------\n\nMalia couldn't hold in the tears forever. Cain had just left. She'd opened her heart to him repeatedly and he always left her. She felt so alone. The door to her room opened almost immediately after he left. Malia was irritated that he should see her cry when she'd succeeded thus far in keeping her tears to herself. \n\n\"I said go away Cain!\" She nearly yelled. She didn't want to draw attention to them any more than he did, but she could only take so much in one night. She heard him walk towards the bed, but she didn't dare turn around to face him. He would know that she was crying anyway but she didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing her. She felt weight sink into the other side of the bed and turned suddenly shocked. If she was shocked about thinking Cain was getting into the bed she was absolutely appalled to find out it wasn't him at all. \n\nBefore she could think to make a sound a hand was over her mouth, crushing into her jaw and cheeks, and a very solid body was on top of her, holding her into the mattress. \n\n\"Miss me girlie?\" A sinister voice whispered directly into her ear. Goosebumps raised on every inch of her body. She'd heard that voice before in this very house, in a very similar situation. The deja vu made her want to vomit. It was the man that had almost succeeded in raping her on her first night in the manor. The man Cain had stopped. Vincent Dutari. The room was dark, but she recognized him completely. She whimpered into his hand. \n\n\"In and out Vincent.\" Another voice said from across the room. She didn't recognize it at all. \n\n\"Yeah yeah.\" Vincent replied. He suddenly and harshly flipped her onto her stomach with seemingly very little effort. She tried with all of her might to buck him off, but he was completely covering her, using his body weight as an advantage. The hand that wasn't covering her mouth was imprisoning her wrists. She just needed to get his hand off of her mouth and she could scream to alert her parents next door. She tried to get her jaws open enough so she could bite him. Unfortunately he seemed prepared for this line of thinking. He clenched her jaw so hard she was sure it would break. His face was directly by her ear. \n\n\"You ruined my life girlie, now I'm gonna ruin you. If your precious general ever finds you again you're gonna be so stretched out you'll be useless to him even if he wanted to fuck you again.\" His voice was a taunting whisper that sent chills up her spine. \n\nMalia's eyes went wide and she couldn't help another weak whimper from escaping. He quickly let go of her wrists and brought both hands to her mouth. He switched the hand that was covering her mouth for the other one. Malia suddenly smelled a too-sweet odor and realized that this hand had a cloth in it that was now covering her nose and mouth. She tried to bring her arms up to fight his hands but she could feel the strength seep from her muscles. She tried to fight the sleep that was claiming her, it would mean her torture and death. She tried not to breathe in any more of the poison, but it was an act in futility. The world got darker for Malia."
