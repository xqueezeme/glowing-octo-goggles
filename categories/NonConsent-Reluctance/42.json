        "ETA: This is the revised version of Chapter 9, the last revision before I post the final chapter, so if you're re-reading this or are new to the series, we're now totally caught up and ready for the conclusion. I'll be posting Chapter 10 in two parts, as well as a teaser for Aella and Trevino's story. I can't thank you enough for your continued support and patience. \n\nAuthors note: You'll notice there's not a ton of exciting action in this chapter. Ch. 9 is mostly setting the stage for the conclusion of Ivy and Hunter's story, which will play out in Ch. 10, possibly 11. However, sadly, we are approaching the end. I've heard from a lot of you that you'd like to hear about Aella and Trevino, so I plan to continue with their story once this one has finished. They're both complex characters with dark pasts, and I look forward to telling their story. \n\nThank you all for sticking with me! I know I say this every time, but it's so true and I can't not say it. Your support and feedback are overwhelmingly supportive and helpful. If not for you guys, I don't think I'd be able to put the stories in my head to page. This is something I've truly grown to love, and I owe all of it to those of you who, somehow, read and enjoy the stories I write. \n\n I've made you wait and teased you with the wrong chapter, so without further delay, here's Chapter 9. \n\nIf this chapter had a soundtrack....\n\n\n\nHeavy in your Arms, by Florence + The Machine, from Lungs\n\nWicked Game, by Theory of a Deadman, from Wake Up Call\n\nPieces, by Red, from End of Silence\n\nWhite Flag, by Bishop Briggs, from Church of Scars\n\n...\n\nHeavy boots pounded like thunder against the stairs leading up to the cabin porch. Blood stained hands gripped the knob of the entrance door, throwing it open with a resounding crack, the lightning to accompany the veritable storm brewing behind the Alpha's tempest eyes. All thoughts revolved around one single thing, one single purpose, the only reason, he would have argued in that moment, that he was currently pulling air into his lungs.\n\nProtecting Ivy.\n\nHis heart struck a staccato rhythm as he reached their bedroom, sifting through the protective burrow of pillows and blankets (and where the hell had she gotten all of this?) she had created, both furious and terrified when her too-thin frame did not materialize when called upon.\n\nSucking in a pained breath, he burst through the hall and into the kitchen, finding a small, blonde female perched upon a kitchen stool, slender fingers flying across a clacking keyboard. Aella.\n\n\"Ivy,\" he rasped, sure that if he did not find her soon, he would perish. Aella startled and looked up at him with a surprised, fearful expression. And why wouldn't she be afraid? How he must look, towering over her, sucking in deep, barely controlled breaths, blood still spattered across his neck, face, and exposed forearms.\n\n\"Sh-she went for a run. She's with Trevino, he wouldn't let her leave on her own.\" The female swallowed thickly, the downward glance and slouched shoulders indicative of her submission. She was terrified; the sharp, unpleasant scent of a distressed Omega pulled the man a little closer to the surface and just barely suppressed the instinctual predator currently fighting for control. He closed his eyes. Clenched and unclenched his fists. Took as deep of a breath as his lungs would allow. Another deep breath. And another, before he trusted himself enough to open his eyes without killing the skittish female with a single look.\n\n\"They should be back any minute,\" Aella's small voice pulled him further back into the land of the living, though he was still frantic with need.\n\nHe nodded once, not entirely confident he would be able to speak without shouting and snarling. Aella was a sweet girl, an incredibly strong one, wo had gone through unimaginable terrors with the man whose blood was still drying on his dark fatigues. She was also quite possibly the fated mate of one of his closest friends, a man he owed both his and Ivy's life to. If he didn't leave now, he risked terrorizing the girl, which was the last thing she needed. No, she wasn't his Omega, but he was an Alpha, and it was instinctually ingrained in his DNA to want to protect all of those belonging to the submissive dynamic.\n\nHe turned, about to walk back the way he came, when her voice, still small and cautious, sluiced through the fog of instinct and stopped him cold. \"You'll kill her, you know.\"\n\nIce cold shock, more than anything, made him turn back around. Before he could say anything, Aella spoke fast, her words suddenly louder than her fear of him. \"Not physically, of course. But there's more than one way to die, you know?\" Her little fists were balled up on her legs, a curtain of silken gold hair hiding her expression aside from the downward curve of her lips.\n\n\"This is all so new to her. You took her away from everything she knew. Her uniform. Her job. Her purpose. Her family.\"\n\nHe snarled. \"I am all the family she needs now. I will give her a new purpose. A better one.\"\n\nAella scoffed, her fear of him apparently wrestled into submission once she realized his intentions were not to harm her. \"I've heard those exact words before. So many times.\" She looked away, swiping quickly at a stray tear before she thought he could see. \"You hold your possessive instincts back. You try to make her happy. I see that. But it's in your nature to try to make her fit you.\" Finally, she looked up at him, and the overwhelming sadness he saw in her glacier blue eyes made him sick with the need to comfort and shelter.\n\n\"That girl is strong, Hunter. But there is only so much she will be able to bend before you break her. And the girl you try to piece back together? She will never be the Ivy you love right now.\" \n\n\"You don't know what you're talking about.\" His voice was considerably calmer, even as he clenched his jaw so hard he feared his teeth would crack. \"You don't know everything.\" Though every fiber of his being physically punished him for not turning around to hunt down his mate, he was inexplicably rooted to the spot.\n\nNever taking her eyes off his, now that she'd found the courage to meet them, she cocked her head to the side and continued. \"Don't I? It's subtle, but it's still there. Mixed in with the part of her scent that became yours when you claimed her.\" A corner of her mouth twitched, but he couldn't tell if she was holding herself back from smiling or frowning. \"I've known since the moment I stepped off that plane in Torrin. I'm not surprised you didn't recognize it. And she would have no idea of what the shift should feel like. So much else was changing for her.\" She looked down again, absently winding a lock of sun-gold hair around her finger.\n\n\"She's already been through too much. I'll protect her. I can provide everything she needs.\" Hunter looked distractedly down the hallway leading to the front door, impatient and frustrated.\n\n\"Is that all you think she wants? Your protection?\" Aella's soft voice drew his attention toward her once again. He opened his mouth to answer, then closed it.\n\nAella's lips twitched up in a knowing, sad smile as the front door slammed open, turning back to her computer with a soft hum.\n\n\" -- didn't need you to come along in the first place, you big, stubborn oaf!\" Ivy's irritated voice tore his attention away from Aella and her heavy words as he turned back to the cabin entrance.\n\nTrevino grunted his response to his irate mate.\n\n\"It was a fucking hedgehog, you crazy asshole! What the hell did you think it was, a fucking trained assassin? Thought it would kill me with its adorable little -- Oof!\" \n\nIvy had walked straight into Hunter, so intent on verbally chastising one of the deadliest Alphas on the planet that she hadn't noticed his hulking form blocking her path. She stumbled back, gaining a few footsteps away from him before he shot his hand out to capture her wrist. \"Hunter! What are you...\"\n\nIvy trailed off as she caught sight of his expression. If he'd been thinking clearly, he would have at least attempted to contain some of the predator that had once again seized control, but once again, his world had narrowed down to the Omega gazing up at him with those viridian eyes narrowed in confusion. The need to both protect and dominate flowed so thickly through his veins, he was certain it would eventually stop his heart, regardless of Aella's words.\n\n\"What's wrong, Hunter? What happened?\"\n\nInstead of answering her, he just walked her backwards, his grip on her wrists just short of bruising, until they had reached their room, kicking the door shut behind them. He would explain. He would explain everything, would unravel the mystery of Aella's words, but later, and when he was buried so deep inside of her, they wouldn't be able to make out where she ended and he began if they tried.\n\nNot remembering when or how he had stripped them both completely bare, he lifted her up, growling in pleasure when their skin touched. Clutching her to him as if he was a man drowning, and she the only one who could save him, he carried her to the pile of pillows and blankets he knew to be her nest, arranging them both in the middle just before he drove into her fully. A sweet little gasp escaped her devastating lips, and he drank in her moans and cries as he took her with as much restraint as he could muster.\n\nThe predator that had emerged the moment he learned the truth would simply not allow any harm to come to the female beneath him. It would go to any lengths to shield her, even from himself, if needed. Two warring impulses fought a savage battle, one snarling and tearing at the other, neither able to fully gain the upper hand. One side wanted to take her slowly and gently, worshipping her body in a sensual display of his affections. The other side wanted to fuck her furiously until she screamed his name. He found an uncoordinated rhythm, sometimes drawing out of her with agonizing restraint, other times thrusting himself into her so hard she lost her breath.\n\nGrowling in frustration, he finally abandoned all thoughts and merely restrained himself just enough not to harm her with each lashing stroke. Too soon, they came together, and the feel of his knot trapping his released seed deep inside her womb, was an altogether different and infinitely more pleasurable sensation, now that he knew what was nestled inside. And her little body took it all and more, the slick walls of her pussy contracting around him as she cried out, finding her own release, milking him of every drop.\n\nHe watched as the thin ring of deep, rich emerald around her darkened eyes slowly faded back into the sea-glass green he loved best.\n\nWhen their breathing evened out, and Ivy was nestled safely beneath him, completely caged in by his massive body, his thoughts roamed free of the fog of instinct. The animal was sated, placated by his dominant, protective position above and around her. Aella's words danced through his head, demanding impossible things.\n\nIvy wanted the freedom she had come to expect while living as a Beta female. Her multiple escape attempts had proved as much. His primal self thrashed and tore against the idea of leaving her alone and unprotected for even a second. It was impossible to reconcile the two competing desires, and he was unwilling, unable, to compromise when it came to her safety.\n\nShe would never be able to do the things she had once loved, at least not in the way she had been going about them before. Faded anger still broiled in his veins when he thought about where he'd found her, so close to sacrificing herself for the sake of the young Beta soldiers on that bloody field in Torrin. It still made his heart seize and his jaw ache.\n\nDespite her strong aversion to how things were, Omegas were hardly able to step foot outside without a chaperone. Their scents were too tempting, the pull too powerful to allow them to roam free.\n\nIt was safer this way. In an ideal world, yes, Omegas would be able to walk down the street without fearing rape or kidnapping. They'd be able to take jobs and live alone, outside the safety of a compound. But this was not an ideal world, and he would not risk her life for the sake of giving her the freedom she was so desperate to reclaim.\n\nIvy stirred, possibly in response to the frustrated growl that had interrupted his purr for a moment. Her little hands curled around his shoulders as she tried to bring his attention back to the present moment. \"What's wrong, Hunter? Did something happen?\" She swallowed. \"If it was about my run, Trevino was no more than two steps away from me at any given point. Well... I mean, if you excuse the few seconds he was off tackling the formidable adolescent hedgehog on my behalf...\" She huffed. She was so fucking adorable. \"The animal lost a few quills and may never look at that stretch of sidewalk quite the same way again, but I think she'll survive.\"\n\nHe met her concerned gaze and smiled. \"No, precious. Nothing happened, and I am not upset about the run. So long as one of the Alphas are with you, you may take quick trips around the cabin.\" And there it was again. The impossible balance of allowing her independence and protecting her from harm.\n\nHunter felt his knot receding. Ivy hissed as he slowly pulled out, a mixture of his fluids and hers seeping from her swollen sex. He dipped his head to flick his tongue lightly over her nipple. Both peaked in response, and he groaned as his lips locked around the dusky skin at the center of her firm, perfect breasts. His tongue swirled around the swollen bud as he sucked more supple flesh into his mouth. Relishing the little gasps and moans he elicited, his hand closed around the opposite breast, massaging and kneading, before deft fingers plucked and pinched until the abused bud was a deep red color. God, she was so fucking perfect.\n\nHer breath hitched as he rocked his semi-hard cock against her clit, and her small cry of pleasure, along with the gush of slick that coated it, brought the appendage to immediate attention.\n\nReleasing her nipple with an audible pop, Hunter planted an elbow on each side of her head, keeping her completely caged beneath him, as he examined her as if she would suddenly disappear from him forever. Her slender legs wrapped around his thick waist, her heels digging into the back of his thighs as she rolled her hips up to meet his rock-hard erection. He was grinning as he detangled himself from her, holding her still with a hand that fully spanned across the width of her stomach.\n\nShe held her breath, looking down at him as he sucked and nipped and kissed his way down her delectable body. He paused between her legs, locking eyes with his Omega. Would he ever get used to that thought? The tingle of pleasure that climbed up his spine whenever he thought of her and thanked whatever kismet had spilled her, albeit a bit clumsily, into his path. She was his fated mate. She was his everything.\n\nHer eyes had darkened again, a small ring of emerald green the only hint of color. Her chocolate colored hair fell in messy locks around her shoulders. \"Breathe, Ivy.\" He nearly growled the command, his voice a few decibels lower than his usual deep timbre, noticeable even to his own ears.\n\nShe sucked in a breath and gasped as his tongue flicked over her clit. Thick fingers parted her folds as he lapped up their mixed fluids seeping out of her like a slow-moving stream. He pushed his thumb inside as his tongue moved back to her clit, pleased when he felt her inner muscles clench around the intruding digit, before he replaced it with two drenched fingers.\n\nHis lips closed over her clit, causing her hips to nearly buck off the bed when he bit down gently, simultaneously curling his fingers to find the spongy spot that always made her come undone. A heavy forearm, sinewy muscles clenching and relaxing as tension slowly built inside his core, came down across her hips in order to hold her still. He breathed a laugh against the sensitive nub when she tried to squirm closer and growled in frustration. His tongue replaced the slick fingers that slowly pulled out of her tight channel.\n\nThe sounds she made were torture. Each gasp and moan made his dick twitch until he was impossibly, painfully hard. Her slender fingers came down to clench his hair, until a warning growl that vibrated against her clit had her drawing her hands back and above her head, one hand grasping the wrist of the other. Good girl.\n\nShe tasted fucking incredible, and if not for his cock's insistent twitches, he could have stayed there all day, lapping up whatever she gave him like a man starved. Instead, he focused on bringing her to climax, swirling his tongue expertly over all the right spots, in the exact way he knew made her crash the hardest. Leaving his heavy arm across her hips, he shoved two fingers back inside her slick, warm, inviting pussy. If he wasn't inside her soon, he was sure it would cause permanent damage to his aching cock. As her moans and cries became more insistent, her breathing now coming in desperate pants, he added a third finger, fucking her in earnest until her hips bucked violently against his arm and a scream was wrenched from her chest in the form of his name.\n\nSitting up, he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his eyes boring into hers as she came down from her high. His other hand stroked her swollen labia, eager to burrow himself into her slick heat.\n\nEnough of this. Hunter's massive hands wrapped around her ribs, his thumbs flicking against her still erect nipples. He lifted her easily, her tiny frame even smaller from the time she spent under Maverick's sick care. It did not escape his attention how her hip bones had jutted against his forearm, or how pronounced her ribs were beneath his hands. His jaw clenched as he forced away a distracting pang in his chest, demanding that all his attention should focus on his squirming Omega.\n\nThey crashed against the far wall, his hands wrapped around her to shield her from the collision. He supported and protected her with the reassuring press of his body. His lips crashed against hers, and she responded beautifully, as hungry for him as he was for her. Ravaging her, he swallowing up the sounds of her pleasure, sinking his teeth into her bottom lip before he invaded her mouth with his tongue. Domineering and commanding, he slid in and out of her mouth in a rhythm that would match the pace of his thrusts as soon as he was inside her.\n\nReaching between them, a calloused hand fisted his cock and squeezed once before he lined himself up and shoved into her in one rough stroke. A ringing in his ear, a distant voice demanding he handle her with the utmost care, turned his desperate rut into a pace slightly more accommodating for the small female writhing on his throbbing cock. She whimpered as he slowed, tugging on the back of his neck with her linked arms, trying to force him closer. \"No, don't stop,\" she panted, breathless. \"Fuck me, Hunter. Please. Fuck me hard.\"\n\nHis control snapped. Releasing a low growl, he resumed his prior pace, rutting between her spread thighs without mercy. Her back, slick with sweat, slid up and down against the wall in time with his pummeling strokes. The clenching and pulsing of her tight heat struck its own rhythm around him until she tensed, and her pussy clamped down around him like a fucking vice. She cried out, the sound muffled when his hand came over her mouth to hide the sounds that had certainly already escaped the confines of the four walls around them.",
        "The sensation threw him over the edge. His palm released her and slammed against the wall by her head, the fingers of his other hand groping and digging into the firm globes of her ass. With a few quick, deep thrusts, he locked her to him and spilled himself within her warmth. His cock continued to pulse and jump inside of her as her pussy leisurely milked him of everything he had. He would never get enough of how she matched him exactly. She was made for him, a perfect fit in every way.\n\nHunter dropped his forehead to rest on hers. \"I will never love anything, or anyone, as much as I love you,\" he told her in a deep, rasping voice. He dragged a knuckle up and down her jaw before cupping her chin, foreheads still pressed together. \"You are everything.\" When he pulled back, her glistening eyes held all the answers he had been searching for.\n\nIvy could be stubborn and irrational. She had infuriated him, more than once, with her seemingly endless attempts to escape him and what it meant to be Omega. She overstepped boundaries, challenged his patience, and lived by her own set of seemingly uncorrelated and random rules. But these things were a part of her, and every single breath she took was precious and treasured.\n\nHunter carried her back over to the bed, laying her down gently. Guilt clogged his throat like a dam. He should never have been that rough with her, regardless of what she had asked for. What the fuck had come over him? He lifted up as much as possible, scanning her body for injuries. Concern etched deep lines across his forehead when he saw her wince. \"I hurt you. Fuck.\" He ran a frustrated hand through his dark hair, hating himself for the weakness he'd shown when he gave into the moment.\n\n\"N-no,\" she stuttered, fighting against a yawn. \"My legs are just a little sore from running,\" she lied. This time, she let the yawn loose, stretching slender arms above her head and arching her back like a cat. Unable to stop himself, Hunter leaned forward to grip her wrists. Slowly, he slid his hands down her arms, watching as goosebumps speckled across her silken skin in response to his light touch. She was so fucking beautiful. He flipped and rotated with her cradled against his chest, gently arranging her listless limbs in a position that was comfortable for them both.\n\nHis arms moved around her, pulling several blankets up around where they lay, already nestled in between a border of pillows and cushions and throws. Taking the blankets Hunter was throwing up over them, her slender hands made quick work of arranging them the way she wanted. Twice more, with heavy, comfortable down blankets, and they were deeply burrowed down into her soft, comfortable fortress of fluff. He suppressed a chuckle as he remembered her unique way of referring to her nest. The fact that his scent now saturated the sacred place pleased his predator greatly, and he felt it settle with a hum of pleasure.\n\nHis big hands stroked lazily down her back and sides, pulling soft sounds of contentment from her lips, letting his purr seep into her body. When he felt her loosen and relax fully beneath his touch, he took a deep breath, preparing himself.\n\n\"Ivy...\" he began, threading his fingers through her chocolate locks. \"We have something important to discuss. I need you to be brave for this next part, do you understand?\"\n\nHe felt her nod, still content to float in the comfort he was giving her.\n\n\"Do you remember when Dr. Cole came to check on you?\"\n\nAgain, he felt her nod, his fingers twisting in her hair at the movement.\n\n\"Pyle was able to retrieve your medical file from the institution where you'd been kept.\" His voice remained calm, soothing; the voice used to keep a small animal from startling. \"In your file was a list of medications they had been giving you.\"\n\nA tremor ran through her body at the mention of the asylum, and he threw more effort into the projection of his purr, hoping it would help protect against dark memories. He paused to give her a few seconds to adjust to the painful directions his measured words were taking her.\n\n\"There were plenty of sedatives and sleeping pills, which we had expected. But there was more on the list, things we were not expecting.\" His body tightened like a coil of its own accord, unaware that the threat to his mate was now obsolete. \"They were giving you a cocktail of fertility drugs and hormones.\"\n\nIvy tilted her head back, resting her chin on his chest, her brow furrowed as she met his gaze. \"I don't understand. Why would they...?\"\n\nHis palm cupped the back of her head, tilting her head to once again rest her cheek to his chest. \"You're an Omega, Ivy. Despite how you were raised, under the impression that Beta blood ran through your veins, it has always been this way. The hormones they were giving you should have pushed you into estrous.\" He paused, one arm wrapped around her waist, the other resuming the soothing work of threading his fingers through her hair.\n\nHer entire body tensed, as if readying for a fight. \"Shhh,\" he breathed against her ear, leaving a trail of soft kisses up her temple and across her forehead. She twisted and pushed at his hands until she faced him fully, regarding him with skeptical, alluring eyes.\n\n\"My smart girl,\" his deep voice rumbled. \"Tell me why fertility drugs would not have had an effect on you.\"\n\nShe frowned and looked down. A few tension-filled seconds passed. Her eyes widened. A look of shock mixed tragically with dread spread across the face that now encompassed his entire world. The bond pulsed uncomfortably, displeased with the hurricane of emotions swirling through his mate.\n\n\"No,\" she insisted desperately. \"No, I can't be. It's a mistake. It's a mistake, Hunter.\" Her words were pleading and distressed. Sad eyes met the devastated look on her face, his heart crushed by the turmoil rolling off her in waves.\n\n\"Cole tested your blood and urine.\" Hunter swallowed, hating the way the bond twisted and cut through him, as sharp as any blade. \"The signs have been there for a while. Your frequent nausea. Your increased sex drive, the fact that I have made three trips to the market to get you your favorite combination of boiled eggs and peanut butter.\" The Alpha wrinkled his nose, wondering how he had missed the signs. He had chalked her nausea up to nerves, her increased sex drive to the strengthening bond, and the disgusting combination she scarfed down as if she was starving to the all-around quirkiness he was growing to love so much. This was the girl whose favorite meal was macaroni and cheese with mashed peas and taco sauce.\n\nHe kissed the top of her head. \"You're pregnant, Ivy. Now that I know, I can pull the scent of pregnant Omega apart from the others.\"\n\nHer body tensed and trembled in his hold. She shook like a live wire, terrified and resolute in her denial.\n\nA strangled sound escaped her, and she struggled to sit up, to move away from him. His knot held them together, but that didn't stop her from trying anyway, causing herself to grunt in pain. He flipped them and used his bulk to press her much smaller body into the mattress, denying her the escape she sought. \"Stop, Ivy. Be still. You're hurting yourself.\"\n\nShe growled, squirming still despite her inability to move. He kept her pinned beneath him until his knot had abated enough to start moving again. With forceful strokes, he pumped in and out of her slick channel. She fought it at first, snarling and baring her teeth at him, until his steady thrusts and the weight of his body tempered her struggles. \"That's it,\" he crooned, reaching between them to circle her clit with his thumb. \"Clever girl. Precious girl. That's the way, Ivy,\" he praised her as he felt her movements beginning to synchronize with his. His other arm hooked her knee and lifted, allowing him to sink even deeper into her velvety heat. He kissed the tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nIvy went rigid for a moment. Her pussy clenched around him painfully. She cried out, clutching the sheets by her head as another orgasm overtook her, as if she was trying to keep herself afloat. And he would be there to prevent her from drowning. Every fucking single time.\n\nHis spine tingled, and electricity sparked between the places they were touching. A pained groan tore from his throat as he spent himself inside of her pulsing walls, his knot trapping her for the third time that day. He looked down at her lovingly, possessively, cupping her chin and running his thumb across her jaw as she calmed. She was flushed and sedated, eyes half lidded and soft. He propped himself up on his elbows, pressing little kisses to her nose, temple, eyelids, jaw. She sighed contentedly, settling into the space between consciousness and sleep. He flipped them again, pulling blankets up over them. Spent and exhausted, he let his purr lull her to sleep. Just holding her, relaxed in his arms, all soft-limbed and sweet sighs was more than he ever knew he wanted.\n\nHer reaction had been disappointing, but not entirely surprising. She had been traumatized, beaten, forced by a monster who reveled in breaking souls. She'd barely had time to recover from any of it. In time, she would realize that she was safe here, with him. There was nothing that could harm her or take her away, ever again. When that happened, when she trusted him completely, she would come to appreciate and accept her new situation.\n\nThe fact that she had been pumped with drugs both infuriated and petrified him. Cole would come back soon, perform a full workup on Ivy and the little one, but there were defects and abnormalities that may not be detectable until later in the pregnancy or even until after birth. Would the infant be blind, or deaf? Would it survive the next three months of pregnancy? Would their daughter have trouble breathing or need machines to keep her heart beating?\n\nDespite his nearly overwhelming fear for Ivy and his child, he decided that it ultimately did not matter. The moment he held the infant in his arms, he knew, he would be totally, deeply in love, despite anything that might have gone wrong. How could he not? He was already entirely dedicated to his little family, his mate and the precious thing slowly growing in her womb.\n\nOmegas had a shorter gestational period than Betas, only about five months. By now, she would be two months along. Her belly should start showing any day now. He stroked a hand down her side, imagining the swell that would grow larger beneath his palm every week. If or when it came down to his life or hers, as they faced off with Ivy's fuck of a biological father, there was no question. He would die for her, for them. He would offer his neck to the bastard, hold a gun to his own head, if it meant keeping her safe. He promised himself that nothing bad would ever happened to her again.\n\nSettling her deep into her little nest, he rose from the bed, careful not to wake her. Retrieving a warm washcloth from the attached bathroom, he gently cleaned her before replacing the soft materials of her fortress.\n\nThe Alphas had a few things to discuss. The task they now faced was dangerous and complex, and he had made a promise he intended to keep. Breathing deep, he pulled tactical pants on and a black tee-shirt over his head and walked out the door with resolute steps, leaving Ivy to what he hoped would be pleasant dreams.\n\n.....................................................\n\nWhen she awoke, night had fallen. Hunter was behind her, one arm wrapped tightly around her waist, the other draped over her shoulders. She kept still and silent, listening to the steady rise and fall of his chest, his deep breaths nearly lulling her back to sleep. Beneath the hypnotic rhythm, his warmth promised love and safety as he curled around her protectively. All the same, a sense of urgency and panic shot through her. The desire to run was undeniable.\n\nCareful not to wake the Alpha from his deep sleep, she untangled herself from his arms, slipping out of bed silently. She looked around the dark room, weighing her options.\n\nShe had acquired some new outfits since they had been here at the safehouse. Hunter had brought back a variety of garments whenever the Alphas made a run into town. The mixture of her preferred ripped jeans and band t-shirts with his preference of dresses, frills and lace, made her smile. The big guy was trying, at least.\n\nShe placed her hand over her lower stomach, tentative mental fingers reaching out to find the life Hunter claimed was inside. With a jolt, she brushed over some signal, some invisible link connecting mother and child, and she knew without a doubt it was true. Swallowing hard, she fought down a sob. There was no choice here. When had she ever had a choice, since this all began?\n\nThere was no choice when Hunter took her away from Rico battalion. No choice when Kentucky betrayed her and broke her heart. No choice when Maverick beat on Aella, who turned out to be totally fucking amazing. No choice when Maverick kidnapped her, stuffing her into a facility where he shoved so many drugs down her throat, she hadn't been able to walk or think straight. Falling in love with Hunter didn't change the fact that, since he'd found her back in Torrin, she had lost all control over her own fucking life.\n\nAnd now, she couldn't stop the thing that never should have happened from being true. There was nothing else to do about it. She had to leave, to find a way to... What? Where would she go? Her parents were dead. Kentucky was dead. The only person still alive from her previous life was her alcoholic uncle, who'd been slowly drinking himself to death since the tragic accident that took his wife and daughter. He was barely able to take care of himself, nevermind try to hide and care for a pregnant Omega. But it was a place to start, right? Even if her stay was temporary, if she could just crash at his place for a while, she would have the space to come up with a better plan. Would he accept her? Could she somehow go back to her old life, plus one? Create aliases so that Hunter would never find them?\n\nShe wasn't some helpless, defenseless damsel, despite being treated as such during the last few months. She knew she could do those things, even if her uncle wouldn't take her in until she could get on her feet. But did she really want to?\n\nA lump formed in her throat as she looked down at her sleeping Alpha. He would go to any lengths to keep her safe, especially now. How could she leave him? How could she take this baby away from him? Being apart from him for two weeks had been torture. His storm-cloud eyes had filled her dreams every night. She'd heard him, purring for her, promising to come for her. But what was the alternative? Stay and condemn the precious creature inside of her to a fate of subjugation and submission? There was no power in the world great enough to take her child away from her and shove her into a secluded, high-walled compound, to wait until some arrogant big-wig decided her fate, decided which old, wrinkly fuck she would belong to.\n\nFuck. That. The thought alone enraged her.\n\nNot to mention, the danger her daughter would be in if her biological father ever found out. Hunter couldn't even guarantee their safety from that evil beast of a man, and there was no assurance that whatever plan the Alphas were cooking up would work to bring Hickson down. Her mate had promised her that she was safe, that she'd never be taken from him again, but she wasn't stupid. Hickson was powerful and had endless resources, and yes, they had some badass motherfuckers on their side, but that just might not be enough. She couldn't take that chance.\n\nThis was the only option she had. Ivy would raise her daughter as she had been raised, as a Beta, with all the hardness and challenge and joy that entailed. She would cloak both of their dynamics in a safer manner. She would find a way.\n\nSteeling her spine, she walked to the closet, dressing in layers as opposed to carrying luggage. Rummaging through Hunter's things, she found a thick stack of bills held together with a silver money clip. Considering the choice between leaving some and taking it all, she finally stuck the wad into her pocket. He kind of owed her, after all, for removing her source of income and ensuring she relied on him. Possessive, controlling bully.\n\nShe took a deep, steadying breath as she finally turned around to say goodbye to the giant, scary Alpha that she had inexplicably fallen for, hard. Would he eventually forgive her? Would he even look for her, after he woke up and discovered her betrayal? She ran her fingers lightly through his dark hair, pressing her lips to his temple gently. Despite her bravado, she could do nothing to stop the tears from finally cascading down her face, drawing wet lines down her cheeks like warpaint.\n\nShe fought back a desperate sob, pushed down the part of herself that rallied and raged, demanding to wake him up before she did something stupid. Her hand hovered over his cheek, wanting desperately to touch him, just one last time. Instead, she whispered, nearly silently, words that she would have thought impossible two months ago. Just three little words. They rolled off her tongue so shockingly easily, but the force of them, once spoken out loud, was enough to nearly cripple her. Not giving herself the chance to reconsider, she staggered to the door.\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n................................................................................\n\nThe problem was, Ivy wasn't entirely sure of where, exactly, the safehouse was located. As such, she had no idea where to go. She did know where her uncle lived, close to the base where she was stationed when not deployed, and chances were, it was far enough away to warrant a long bus ride.\n\nA few miles down the dark road, under a sky devoid of any stars, she arrived at a little convenience store and gas station. She walked in, grateful for the thick layers she wore and welcoming the warmth that spread from the bright lights of the little shop.\n\nShe browsed the aisles, deciding on a jar of peanut butter, a jumbo pack of stuffed cookies and a bag of salt and vinegar chips. She dumped her items on the scratched red counter, frowning at the realization that no one besides a pregnant woman would find her stomach rumbling in anticipation of how divine the combination of the three foods would taste like.\n\nShe looked up at the cashier, a tall, comely Beta with bright green eyes that nearly mirrored her own. He raised an eyebrow at her selections. \"That all?\" he asked, making quick work of ringing her up and dumping her snacks into a bag.\n\n\"Uh, actually, do you know if there's a bus station anywhere nearby? Also... Could you tell me where we are?\"\n\nThe Beta frowned, regarding her with a suspicious look that made goosebumps pebble across her skin. He sniffed the air, narrowing his eyes. After an uncomfortable moment of silence, he dropped his face back into a neutral expression, and some of the tension fell away from her body.\n\n\"You here with anybody else, sweetheart? You on a road trip or somethin' like that?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" she mumbled.\n\nHe leaned across the counter to out the clear glass wall that led to the gas pumps and parking area outside. Ivy winced. It was late, or rather early. No cars lingered in the lot, no worry-free civilians filling their tanks.\n\nHe glanced back at her, his brow furrowed in what looked like concern, rather than hostility. \"Darlin, are you okay? Are you in some kind of trouble?\"\n\nHer heart raced, trying to think of a way to answer that wouldn't screw everything up. She eyed the off-white plastic phone on the wall behind him. Her muscles tensed back up, her Omega instincts kicking in at an unexpected moment. She was ready to flee if he decided to call someone to come collect her.",
        "\"No, no -- Nothing like that. I'm fine. Just... You know. Trying to get home.\" She forced an unnatural sounding chuckle and winced again.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Listen, I'm gonna tell you where the station is, because I don't want a sweet, pretty little girl like you, an Omega no less, wanderin around the streets, lookin for it. But please, be quick about it. Some nasty men are out there, and they'd be more than thrilled to find an innocent thing like you out there on your own.\"\n\nNodding, she tried to placate the man who was so inexplicably concerned for her safety. \"That's exactly what I was planning on doing.\" Not a lie. \"I've already run into some of those nasty men, and just barely got away.\" Also not a lie. \"My uncle is sick, okay? I just need to see him one last time.\" Not really a lie. Just partially a lie.\n\nOkay, that one was kind of a lie.\n\nHe shrugged, managing to look both concerned and unaffected, and reached behind the counter to pull out a map. Who even used maps anymore, outside of land nav training? With her phone confiscated by the infuriating Alphas who now ruled her life, she was lucky ol' Green Eyes here had kept this crinkly relic of the past.\n\nUnfolding it in front of her, he pointed at a woodsy area on the northern border of Lostra. \"We're here,\" the man said solemnly. He flipped the map over, revealing a close up of the area he had pointed to before. \"Here, precisely.\" He marked a street on the map with a black sharpie. \"The bus station,\" he continued, \"is here. You're lucky it's so close. Just walk south until you hit the intersection. Take a left. You should be on a street with sidewalks. The other directions don't have sidewalks. Okay?\"\n\nHe glanced up at her to make sure she was tracking, and she nodded enthusiastically before he continued. \"There's a little strip of businesses and shops about a half a mile down the road. The station is just past the first stoplight you'll come to, right...\" he made another mark on the map, \"here. Listen, take this,\" he told her, folding the map back up and handing it to her. \"And this,\" he said, writing something on a scrap of paper he had pulled from the register. \"I would take you myself if I had someone to watch the store. Call me if you find any trouble. Or... If any trouble finds you. We clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes thank you. Thank you so much.\"\n\nThe corner of his mouth twitched, but he held onto his somber expression. \"Welcome. Use that number. Don't worry bout the time.\" He looked at her pointedly. \"And get right back on home. Trouble don't care who gets in its path. It just knocks 'em down and keeps on goin.\"\n\nShe gave a small smile. For whatever reason, Green Eyes had been genuinely kind to her, and he didn't deserve to see the tendrils of frustration that were beginning to thread through her thoughts. A sweet, pretty little Omega like her shouldn't be out at night alone. She inwardly bristled. She doubted anyone from her old battalion would ever have described her as sweet.\n\nBossy, yes. Bitchy, definitely. Irritating, absolutely. A pain in the ass, even. But never sweet.\n\nAnd innocent? BAH! That was rich.\n\nShe took the bag he handed her and turned around, walking toward the door. Glancing back over her shoulder, she smiled again. \"Really. Thanks.\"\n\nGreen Eyes nodded once, then went back to reading some book he had hidden behind the counter. She narrowed her eyes at the cover. A fair-haired beauty, wearing a bright pink, lacy little number, locks of gold blowing in the wind, held onto the chiseled chest of a man towering over her. She chuckled.\n\nFeeling just a little bit better despite the act of betrayal she was about to commit, she slid through the door, breathed a deep lungful of the chilly night air, and started walking. Fuck it. She was a sweet little Omega, and she was walking alone in the middle of the night. Take that, universe.\n\nA little defiance was always good for the soul.\n\nMoving away from the warm lights of the gas station, she shivered, but not from the cold. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck had her whirling around to search the shadows for whatever was watching her, but no one was there. She shivered again, the creepy sensation nearly impossible to ignore. But what could she do? Run back to the gas station and admit defeat? Beg him to take her back to Hunter, her head hanging in shame? Give up on a tolerable future for her daughter? Such a large part of her wanted to go down that road, the road that led back to her mate. But the part of her that was desperate to protect the little life nestled deep inside of her, the defiant part that wanted to prove that she could do this, she could win against the world, was ultimately stronger. She watched the shadows for a minute more but could see no movement or signs of life. Shrugging, chalking up the strange feeling to nerves, she turned around and kept walking.\n\n...........................................................\n\nRaptorial eyes tracked the retreating figure of the Omega, her lithe body swallowed up by the shadows that closed around her the further she got away from the gas station. He had half a mind to storm into the brightly lit shop, grab the Beta who had captured her attention for longer than necessary, and shatter his face against the register. Just who the fuck did he think he was?\n\nGrowling under his breath, he abandoned his violent fantasy and stalked toward Ivy instead, her steps hurried, her body tense. Didn't she feel him? Was she blocking out what the bond was telling her, even as it dug deeper into her mind and body? He had been awake the second he felt her struggling with some unknown decision. Curious to find out exactly what had her so conflicted, he'd let her go, following behind on silent feet as she left him.\n\nShe had left him. For fuck's sake, they still weren't over this?\n\nIt took them only about thirty minutes to get to the bus station. Hunter stayed close in case there was trouble, but far enough away to remain hidden from the occasional quick glances over her shoulder. Just having her inside, somewhere warm and relatively safe, took some of the pressure off his chest. He waited a few moments while she stood in front of the schedule board, either trying to find or decide on a place to go. She would be staying right the fuck here, unbeknownst to her. He could guess at the reason she had run, but ultimately, it didn't matter. She was his.\n\nAnd he was never fucking letting her go.\n\n..........................................................................................\n\nIvy gaped at the massive tits on the heavily makeup-ed, huge haired, gum smacking ticketmaster. \"Holy shit, are those real?\" She squeaked, then clapped a hand over her mouth. When was she ever going to get a hold on what came out of her mouth? Probably never.\n\nLuckily, instead of being offended, the redhead chuckled. \"Sure are, hun,\" she said, winking conspiratorially. She adjusted her bra and pulled the front of her shirt down to reveal globes the side of fucking watermelons. And not those tiny seedless ones, either. Nope.\n\n\"Woah, those are... impressive?\" Were they? Or were they a pain in the ass to take care of, like little annoying pets hanging from your chest? Regardless, the redhead beamed at her, the bright pink of her lip gloss sparkling in the artificial ceiling lights. Shit, this woman was over the top. No half measures for this chick. Ivy admired her for that.\n\n\"Where you heading, hun?\" The incredibly well-endowed ticketmaster smacked her gum noisily.\n\n\"Where. Right. Ah.... I think...\" she trailed off. This was it. There was no going back, if there ever had been. She closed her eyes against the pain that flared up in response to that thought.\n\nKeeping her eyes shut, she pushed the words past her lips without thinking about what they meant. If she did, she wouldn't be able to do it. \"I'd like a ticket to Weatherpine, please.\" The station wasn't very close to her uncle, but once she got there, she would call him and hope he would be sober enough to come pick her up. The bus was scheduled to arrive early next evening, so the chances of that were pretty slim, but she would figure it out when she got there.\n\n\"You got it, sweetie,\" the Big Breasted Beauty said in a high, saccharine voice. \"That'll be --\"\n\n\"Better make that two,\" a deep, rumbling voice said from right behind her. A voice she instantly recognized, a voice her soul recognized. Ignored and suppressed, the bond sprang to life, deluging her in a barrage of emotions she couldn't even begin to understand.\n\nAh, shit. She hung her head, a heavy sigh on her lips. An icy sensation spread through her stomach. Ivy didn't know if it was relief or disappointment, but it quelled some of the nausea she'd had since leaving him.\n\nScratch that. It was definitely relief. Not that she'd ever admit to that.\n\nThe Big Breasted Beauty (BBB) narrowed her eyes at a spot above Ivy's head as two roughened hands grabbed the counter on either side of her, caging her in.\n\n\"Oh really?\" BBB said sweetly, flashing a worried look at Ivy's tensed posture. \"Because I'm not quite sure the lady wants company.\"\n\nWhat? This girl was... she was defending her? How had she run into two people in a row that were willing to go out of their way to keep her safe? Was she just emanating some sort of helpless vibe? It was oddly touching.\n\nHunter growled from behind her, his hands drawing closer to her sides, his front pressing into her back. The BBB was faster, and apparently more dangerous, than she looked. With a movement that was nearly too quick to track, but one that still left aftershock jiggles of her watermelons, she had an intimidating can of pepper spray aimed at his head.\n\n\"Listen, asshole,\" she said in a voice that had dropped several octaves. \"You're gonna back the fuck away from her, and I'm gonna personally walk her to that bus and wait until it drives off.\" Keeping the nozzle aimed at him, she grabbed a walkie talkie from behind the counter and spoke into it. \"Frank? Gonna need you out here, sweety.\"\n\nThere was a crackle of static before a sleepy voice came back through. \"Godammit Sandy, you make me get up to make the coffee one more damn time, I'm gonna turn your ass red.\"\n\nSandy whined back into the radio. \"But you make it so much better than me, Frank!\"\n\n\"Woman, it is six scoops of grinds and a pot of water. It aint that hard to figure out how to work a shitty little coffeepot, now let me sleep!\"\n\nIvy stood frozen, gaping at the scene unfolding before her. Was she dreaming? What in the fuck was actually happening?\n\nHunter slowly wrapped his hands around her upper arms and was steadily dragging her away from the counter. Sandy's eyes shot up to his and narrowed, as if she was just remembering they were there. \"Get out here, Frank, NOW!\" she hissed into the radio.\n\nA door opened from behind Sandy, and a light-haired man, muscular for a Beta, walked out of the office on the other side of the little room. His shirt was wrinkled and untucked, and his hair was rumpled from sleep. Bloodshot eyes assessed the situation he'd been woken up to fix.\n\nA little belatedly, the security guard (if his mussed-up uniform was any clue) fumbled for his gun. Hunter already had his weapon aimed at the larger-than-normal Beta. \"I wouldn't do that,\" Hunter admonished calmly. Sandy let out a little cry, and started to rush toward her (coworker? Boss? Boyfriend?) ... Her Frank. Whatever they were to each other, it was clear they cared for one another. Frank held his hand up in Sandy's direction, stopping her with the simple gesture.\n\n\"We're all right, baby,\" he told her, trying for a comforting voice that almost, almost hit its mark. Whether for Sandy or himself, or both, he was nervous. He locked eyes with Hunter and nodded, and she felt Hunter nod back. \"Take a break, baby. Go make that coffee now, yeah?\"\n\nSandy made a noise of worried protest. Ivy gripped the forearm holding the gun over her shoulder. \"Stop it, Hunter. Please? Stop scaring them. She just wanted to help.\"\n\nThe Alpha grumbled grumpily. She tilted her head up to look at him. Eyes dark as a midnight storm stayed locked on the perceived threat of Frank. Well, shit. This had escalated quickly.\n\n\"I'm serious,\" she said, trying to wriggle out of his grip, which, of course, only made his arm tighten around her. \"Leave them alone.\"\n\nShe swallowed and raised her chin, looking back at the wide-eyed bus station couple. \"He's my mate, not my abductor. We're just... We had a fight. I went a little crazy.\"\n\nFrank, thankfully, slowly crouched to drop the gun on the floor and kicked it away, holding his hands out in a gesture of peace.\n\nNo longer facing a threat to her safety, Hunter dropped the barrel down toward the floor, a soft click telling her he had put the safety back on before he took half a step away from her and slid the gun back into the holster at his side. She turned and gaped.\n\n\"Wait... Is that my gun? What the fuck are you doing with my gun? That was a gift, Hunter! Give it back.\" She held out her palm, as if it would be that simple.\n\nHe smirked, his eyes doing all the talking for him. They quite clearly said, \"Yeah, sure. Nice try.\"\n\n\"Not the time or the place, Ivy,\" his deep voice warned quietly. He turned his attention back to Frank. \"We'll be going now,\" he said, reaching into her pocket and drawing out the stack of cash. Ivy groaned. Was she really that incompetent of an escapee? He pulled a few bills from the stack and leaned over to put them on the counter.\n\n\"For the tickets,\" he explained.\n\nIvy smiled brightly at the busty red-head as they backed away toward the door. \"Thanks Sandy. Nice to meet you!\"\n\nSandy startled as if she'd been in a trance, her apprehensive and bewildered eyes meeting Ivy's. She hesitated, then smiled back. \"N-No trouble, hun. If you, ah, if you need anything...\" She trailed off, once more fearlessly glaring at Hunter. \"Well, you know where to find me.\"\n\nIvy smiled again as Hunter's big hand wrapped around her upper arm, tugging her toward the door. They walked a block or two before he released her, pulling out his phone and tapping at the screen.\n\n\"Hunter, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to -- \"\n\nHe held up a finger, silencing her. Without looking up, he continued tapping away on his phone.\n\n\"Just let me -- \" she started again, and was met with yet another finger-of-silence. She huffed a frustrated breath. \"You're not even -- Gah! Stop that!\"\n\nHunter finished whatever he'd been typing, slipped the phone into his back pocket, then finally turned to look at her. She immediately regretted wanting his attention. A storm of fury, hurt, disappointment and relief raged on behind his gleaming, tempest eyes.\n\n\"Why?\" he growled, stalking toward her until her back hit the brick wall of the building behind her. His hands came down on each side of her head, and he leaned down until they were at eye level.\n\n\"It won't change what's going to happen next, Ivy. But I need you to tell me why.\"\n\nShe shuddered, turning her head away. That very much sounded like a threat, and he had never really threatened her before. Well, except for when he said he'd chain her to the bed in Torrin if she tried to escape again. And there was no way he would ever find out that the thought of him chaining her to the bed was kinky enough to be kinda hot, and thus, had been entirely ineffectual as a real deterrent.\n\nHis hand gripped her jaw, pulling her gaze back to him. She could feel the restrained fury in his fingers, but even as his grip tightened, he was careful not to hurt her.\n\n\"What...\" She scowled as the word came out in a high-pitched squeak, like a mouse caught in a trap. She cleared her throat and tried that again. \"What's going to happen next?\"\n\nThe corner of his mouth tugged up in a look that was both terrifying and ridiculously attractive. Fucking hormones. Fucking Alphas.\n\nHe tsked at her, the cocky bastard. \"You first,\" he said in a somehow sultry voice. She could admit that he deserved an explanation. Steeling herself, she started talking.\n\n\"I...I didn't want to leave you. But I had to try.\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed.\n\n\"Wait, Hunter, just hear me out. I can't bring a child into this world. I won't send my daughter, our daughter, away to some secret compound when she's big enough for some old and wrinkled diplomat to stuff his dick into her. I was going to... I just wanted to give her a chance, you know? I was lucky enough to be able to live my life for myself. I know you don't see it that way, but I'm grateful for what my dad did. He gave me freedom, made me strong, and he kept me away from...\" she gulped. \"Well, you know. I just wanted to give her the same thing.\" She placed a protective hand over her belly and looked down.\n\nA finger hooked under her chin and brought her face back up to his. \"It won't be like that,\" he murmured, his eyes softening as they searched her face. For what, she didn't know.\n\nShe felt a quick flash of irritation. \"How? How can you know that? Can you promise that? I mean, look at Aella, how Maverick held Cody over her head and her and Eva over mine. Look at my biological parents, and what a royal clusterfuck that ended up being. Look at --\"\n\nHe cupped both sides of her face, cutting her off. His fingers stroked her temple, down her hair, where he played with a loose strand. \"Yes,\" he purred, helping to ease some of the tension from her shoulders. \"It will be different. We are different.\"\n\nShe scoffed. \"Oh yeah? How so?\"\n\nHe lowered his head and slanted his lips over hers. His tongue flicked the seam of her lips, coaxing her to open, and possessively dominated her mouth when she did. She gripped his arms, holding herself steady as he plundered, taking more than she had offered, like he always did. He broke away, leaving her breathless and flushed, needy and desperate for his touch.\n\n\"We are fated mates, Ivy.\" He kissed her forehead. \"There is no stronger bond,\" he continued, kissing the tip of her nose. \"Hurting you would cripple me.\" He kissed her left eyelid. \"Hurting our daughter would kill me.\" Kissed her right eyelid. \"Losing you would stop my heart.\" Kissed her chin. \"You understand? These aren't metaphorical, empty sentiments. They are very literal, and very real facts. You, and her, and the bond, are wrapped around my heart. Physically. It beats now, only because you're mine.\"\n\nShe looked at him, her gaze suspicious and assessing, but there was nothing in his expression besides sincerity. Surrendering, she leaned into him. Her body wracked with sobs as she let his words take root. He pulled her to him, holding her head against his chest and murmured words of comfort into her hair.\n\n\"Let it out, now. That's it. Just trust me, Ivy. Let me carry this for you.\"\n\nShe struggled to stop the waterworks, tired of feeling so emotionally drained, all the damn time. The bond pulsed with renewed energy, drawing them together like magnets. His claiming mark, it's shiny pink skin slowly marking her with unmistakable permanence, began to throb in time with her heartbeat. With a start, she realized the great flaw in her plan. The bond she was trying so hard to suppress would never have been severed or truly weakened.\n\nA future she hadn't wanted had been chosen for her. She swallowed past the lump in her throat and faced the truth of his words. They were different. They were fated. Regardless of how it had all played out, they were always going to end up here. She had always been his, just like he had always been hers. They did match each other. Their scents, their bodies, their souls, fit together so well, it was impossible not to see that, this thing they shared? It was special.",
        "Her muffled words were lost to the damp spot on his shirt. He drew back, fingers tangled in her wild hair gently pulling her head away from the place on his side she had burrowed into. She immediately missed his warmth, his comforting scent, the soothing vibration of his purr against her cheek.\n\n\"How did you-\" she hiccupped, \"find me?\"\n\nThe dark, primal eyes of an animal bored into her own for a moment too long. \"I told you, Ivy.\" He wove a second hand through her hair, clenched his fist until her face was lifted to his. \"I will always come for you.\"\n\nFuck. Did he have to be so... so... Hunter-ish all the freakin time? Any more of that, and she'd start swooning.\n\nWait... She was swooning. Or, at least, she was swaying. All the blood drained from her face. Her vision blurred, and the sounds of the night around them were wrapped in cotton. She gasped, clutching his forearms as he cradled her skull in his palms. \"I don't feel so good, Hunter. I think I need to...\" Instead of finishing, she went limp, stopping just short of the pavement by Hunter's arms wrapping around her, lifting her up.\n\n\"Ivy? Fuck! Ivy, wake up for me now. Open your eyes, baby.\"\n\nHis voice sounded like it was miles away. Still, she struggled to obey him, if only to assuage the undercurrent of desperation in his words. The world around them had taken on a blurry haze. She felt like she was underwater, the current pulling her deeper and deeper into a vast, dark space. She saw a dark car pull up to the sidewalk, felt him place her gently into the back seat.\n\n\"What happened?\" a silky voice asked, honey laced with worry. Yes, what happened? What was happening? She slipped silently under the waves before she could hear the answer.\n\n......................................................\n\nAn efficient, professional knock sounded at the door. Hunter grunted, never taking his eyes off Ivy's too-still face. Cole strode into the room, stopping when he saw her pale skin and sunken eyes before pulling up an extra chair to the bedside by his patient.\n\nShaking his head, he began taking items out of the simple black case he had brought with him. \"Omega pregnancies drain the body of reserves. The shorter gestation means their body has to supply more nutrients in less amount of time.\n\n\"Her protein levels are dangerously low. Her metabolic numbers indicate severe malnourishment. She most likely wasn't eating enough even before she was taken.\" He drew a clear fluid into a syringe, flicking the side to expel any air bubbles. \"Vitamins,\" he explained, glancing up at Hunter, who watched his every move like a fucking hawk. \"She'll get an injection twice a day. I'll start an IV to keep her hydrated and to make sure her sugar levels stay up. I've left Aella instructions for when she regains consciousness. She should be following the diet I've outlined until about 2 months following the birth.\" Swiping the inside of her elbow with an alcohol swab, he stuck the needle into her arm and used his forefinger to depress the plunger. Ivy didn't so much as flinch.\n\n\"I'll start seeing her daily. I'll do blood tests and monitor her weight and fetal growth every Monday. In two weeks, we can do an ultrasound.\"\n\nHunter watched as the physician found a vein in her delicate wrist and inserted an IV, hooking it up to a big bag of fluid that he left hanging on a tall pole beside her bed. Trevino had brought it in just minutes ago, his dark eyes lingering on her motionless form. He'd opened his mouth to say something, then shut it, simply nodding to the larger Alpha before turning to leave the room.\n\nCole cleared his throat. \"Hunter. We should talk about the possibility of possible birth defects from --\"\n\n\"Stop,\" Hunter interrupted with an irritated growl. \"We will not be discussing that further. Unless it's something that will kill either of them, you will not be mentioning it to me again.\"\n\nCole gave a curt nod. He stood, re-checking and adjusting the equipment he had set up, and leveled a look at his friend and old colleague. \"I'll do everything I can, Hunter. I'll be here whenever you need me. But she needs to rest and relax, let herself heal and let the baby grow. With the condition she's currently in, any additional stress could result in a termination of the pregnancy. Get her out of this, Hunter. Do what you have to do and take her home.\"\n\nHunter stroked a thumb over her jaw, her skin too cold, too pale, too clammy. He wanted to shake her awake. He felt powerless against this invisible foe, gripping his mate in its sharp claws. He placed a hand over her stomach, felt life thrum under his touch as it sucked the strength he fed it through its mother's bond.\n\nAlmost all Omega and Alpha pregnancies resulted in female infants. Rarely, a male infant was thrown into the mix, but as far as Hunter knew, all Omega/Alpha offspring, male or female, resulted in an Omega dynamic later in life. For unknown reasons, Beta and Alpha matings no longer resulted in that dynamic. Only Omegas could give birth to Omegas.\n\nThe life pulsing beneath his palm was almost certainly a tiny baby girl. An Omega, like her mother. He thought of Ivy's words back at the station. She was now painfully aware of how Omegas were treated, like commodities, like prized possessions. Hunter had never thought of the Omega compounds as anything other than a safe, guarded place for the most vulnerable of the country's population. But Ivy's own blossoming awareness had spurred uncertainty and skepticism about things he had always just accepted. Her fears for their daughter ran so deep, she was willing to leave him in hopes of giving her a chance at a better future.\n\nHe'd made a promise to her. A promise he intended to keep. If he had to tear apart the world to build up a better one for his family, then that was exactly what he would do.\n\nA sharp knock sounded on the door as Fowler walked in, his wide frame leaving a distorted shadow across the bed. \"We're ready,\" he growled in typical Fowler fashion. Aella darted into the room from behind the giant's back, a child to Fowler's beast. She approached the bed, stroking a calming hand over Ivy's dampened brow.\n\n\"I'll take care of her, Hunter,\" she said softly, her voice soothing and reassuring. He nodded, finally looking up from Ivy's sickly pale skin.\n\nHe locked eyes with Fowler. \"Let's fucking finish this.\"\n\nPyle suddenly appeared in the doorway, his crooked teeth on display as a wicked grin spread across his face. He fist-pumped the air, jumping up and down on the balls of his feet like the giddy, psychotic man-child he was. \"Fuck yeah!\" he yelled-whispered, cognizant of the resting Omega.\n\nFuck. Yeah."
