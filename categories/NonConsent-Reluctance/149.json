        "Venlen stood at the desk, gripping the letter from his brother with a shaking hand. He had ordered the desk be moved from the office down the hall, refusing to leave Laiyla's side. The letter had been delivered this morning, but with his hands full of his recovering Fae during the few hours she had been awake, he hadn't gotten to it until now. They would have to leave earlier than he would have liked, it would seem.\n\nMy dearest brother, \n\nPrudence tells me you have finally caught up with the Seeker. I offer you my congratulations. I am eager to meet the pretty young thing, and I wonder at the length of time it has taken for you to return home. \n\nI do hope you have not run into any... shall we say, trouble. \n\nI know it is silly for me to think I must remind you of the reason I sent you after her to begin with. There is a terrible rumor amongst some of the bolder ladies of the court. They mistakenly believe that you have taken the Fae girl for yourself. \n\nI encourage you to return hastily, so that you can put these ladies' delicate minds at ease. \n\nRegards,\n\nYour King.\n\nHe was breathing in heavy, violent breaths. The threat that read from between the lines of the letter was clear. Damien had wanted Laiyla secured and brought to court, where he might use her to the advantage of the crown. Venlen had always thought it a flawed idea. Lystra, the last Seeker, the one he had killed after years of fighting off her evil magic, had turned corrupt and power-hungry. She had developed dark, powerfully sinister magic that went beyond normal Seeker abilities as the corruption had spread through her like slow dripping molasses. It had been what had made her so very dangerous.\n\nFrom the very first reconnaissance of Laiyla, Venlen knew that she was untouched by this darkness. She had been sent away to protect her from that kind of influence. He had met her adopted parents, although they hadn't known it. They were good, kind and compassionate. Venlen had known then that his brother's plans for her to follow in her grandmother's footsteps, to use her powers to protect his position on the throne, were deeply flawed.\n\nVenlen had thought then that when he eventually brought Laiyla back to court, when his brother had met her and had seen how different she was from Lystra, he would change his mind. Laiyla could still be useful, just in ways that did not require the darker part of her abilities.\n\nNow, everything had changed.\n\nHe crumpled the letter in his hand and threw it across the room into the fire. He took to pacing the length of the floor, throwing angry glances toward the bed where Laiyla lay curled under layers of blankets. Her wounds were just beginning to heal, the fever finally releasing its grip on her. When she slept nestled against him, her nightmares were easily redirected by his gentle humming and stroking, but they were still occurring nightly. She was not ready to leave yet.\n\nIt didn't matter. If he stayed away any longer, his brother would start to send his men. The thought was not exactly an intimidating one. His own men were battle tested, ruthless, relentless. Their numbers were modest, but the way dark followed wherever they went struck fear into all they encountered. The Army of Night. Damien could send hundreds of his best warriors out to meet him, and it wouldn't matter. They would be slaughtered easily, fed to the dogs. But starting a war with his brother was not something he wanted.\n\nHe was resigned. They would have to leave tomorrow. Which meant he needed to test the bond, needed to see how well he would be able to wield her magic. He had already selected a task for the occasion.\n\nHe barked an order at the guard outside. The healer rushed in a moment later, green robes swishing around his feet as he hurried to where Laiyla lay unconscious on the bed. Venlen gritted his teeth as he watched the healer's fingers dance over the bandages on her legs and thighs, shoulders and forearm, then finally her neck and the thin line that curled around her breast. A threatening sound escaped his throat as he watched the healer rub salve onto this last wound, as his hand worked carefully around the small curve of flesh. The man winced and there was a tremor in his hand as he finished his task. With a sigh of relief, he stood and turned to Venlen.\n\n\"Your highness. Her wounds are improving every time I see them. Her fever is almost gone, the tonics are helping. In three or four days, she may be ready for more activity.\" He looked nervously at the door and wrung his fingers. \"From a strictly medical standpoint, sir, she may benefit from some time outside.\" He coughed and stared down at his feet, straightening his robes.\n\nVenlen glared at the man, his anger flaring. She may benefit from some time outside. His anger quickly turned internal as he let the implications of those words rush through him. He had taken a forest Fae, a Seeker, and had trapped her inside, had practically dared her to run from him. And when she had... His eyes softened as he watched the steady rise and fall of her chest.\n\n\"We must leave tomorrow. The trip will be long. You will come with us. If she arrives healthy and happy, well then, so well you.\" He left the rest unsaid.\n\nThe healer gaped at him, his eyes round with horror. \"Your highness!\" he gasped. \"She is not ready! If you try to move her now, I can make no guarantee of her health!\" His voice had an edge of panic to it.\n\n\"She is Fae!\" Venlen roared, stepping toward the man. \"She is stronger than you think! Staying here is no longer an option. Gather what you need for the journey. If you cannot find something or need something in greater quantities than what you have available, tell my men and they will get it for you. Gold is not a factor.\" He reached into his pocket and took out a small sack, the currency inside clinking together in a way Venlen had seen men kill over. He tossed the sack at the man, who fumbled nervously before catching it in his hands and looking inside. His eyes widened.\n\n\"Before you begin preparing,\" Venlen said, drawing the man's attention back to him. \"I need her awake for several hours. Prepare a tonic and then leave us.\"\n\n..............................................................................\n\nThe smell of peppermint and sage swirled around her. Calloused fingers smoothed back her hair, stroking her forehead. His low hum vibrated through the room. \"Come back to me, \"\n\nShe tried to shake her head no, to snuggle deeper underneath the layers of quilts and blankets that covered her, but the movement sent jolts of pain through her and she groaned. She opened one eye cautiously and saw Ven crouched beside her bed, watching her face with an intensity that sent goosebumps up and down her spine. She sighed resignedly and turned her head back into the pillow, the pain in her neck flaring in response. \"I'm not having sex with you.\"\n\nHe chuckled softly, the sound sending heat to her cheeks.\n\n\"Just a few hours for me, keonai mouv. Then you may sleep again. Come. I have food ready.\"\n\n\"Soup?\" she mumbled into the pillow. She loved Sonya, but the thought of another meal of soup and bread made her stomach revolt.\n\n\"Not soup.\"\n\nShe lifted her head in curiosity, peeking out over her nest of warmth and comfort at the table in the center of the room. He hadn't lied. It wasn't soup.\n\nSlowly, she stretched her aching limbs and moved away from the heavy bulk of blankets. She kicked her legs over the side and let her feet dangle. She felt his eyes appraising her every movement, and heat rose to her cheeks as she looked down on her naked, wrecked body. She sucked in a hiss at the sight of herself.\n\nBandages covered her. Some of them covered slices and cuts she could remember getting, others she had no memories of. Her honey colored skin was camouflaged with colors of deep purple, blue and yellow from where bruises of differing ages painted her. She thought of the brutality she had been subjected to during her short time with this man. Although Venlen had not touched her roughly since finding her half sliced open and half raped by Raul, she could mark his violence on her body easily enough.\n\nAs if reading her mind, Venlen brushed his fingertips across a yellowing bruise gripping her wrist, right near the raised pattern that marked her as his. His eyes searched her face as he knelt in front of her, his massive hand enveloping hers protectively. Endless pools of midnight sky threatened to drown her as she looked back at him. She wanted to reach out and touch his face, trace the line of the scar that ran down his neck, feel the softness of his dark hair curled around her fingers. Instead, she looked away, back down at the bruises on her wrist he continued to stroke his fingers over.\n\n\"We will eat first,\" he announced, and stood up to walk to the wardrobe crates by the door, dropping her hands back lightly in her lap. Ruffling through the contents, he brought up a floor length soft fabric dress with long sleeves. It looked warm and comfortable, its color reminiscent of the skin of a summer ripe peach. He held it out to her, and she took it, sliding it over her head as she eased herself to the floor. While the dress fitted her comfortably, the folds of fabric seemed to hide the bulk of dressings and bandages underneath. She looked down and gave an experimental twirl, delighting at how the fabric swirled gracefully at her feet. It reminded her of the soft white gowns Eila used to wear.\n\nShe walked to the table where a pleasant aroma greeted her. Large bowls filled with a rainbow of fruits and vegetables sat to the side of a tray, a large cut of meat smothered with a dark sauce and heaps of sliced mushrooms dominating the center. Smaller plates filled with side dishes of mashed potatoes, steamed carrots, creamed corn and freshly baked bread surrounded the generous portion. Beside the tray, a picturesque slice of apple pie dotted with cream topping waited for her. Her stomach growled, and she wondered how long it had been since she had eaten food that smelled and looked this good. Happily, she reached for a fork, pushed the tray to the side, and began to dig into the pie.\n\nShe had shoveled two thick bites into her mouth and was chewing with bliss when a hand slid the plate out of her grasp and the tray was pushed back in front of her. She snarled and looked up to where he sat across from her, his eyes dancing with amusement as he held the dessert far out of reach.\n\n\"You will eat the things of substance, first. Your body is craving sugar because of the amount of energy it has taken you to begin to heal. You need many nutrients, not just sugar. When you have eaten enough, I will give you back the pie.\"\n\nGrumbling, she began sampling bites of food from the different dishes on her tray. Everything was rich and delicious. He let her eat in silence, and as promised, when she had eaten as much as her stomach could comfortably fit without being stuffed, he gave her back the plate of pie, which she finished off eagerly. She sat back in her chair, sighing. \"Thank you,\" she said quietly.\n\nHe stood up and took slow steps around the table toward her. His closeness during the times in the night she cried out and thrashed against phantoms was comforting, as much as she hated to admit it. Even though there were times that the phantoms she thrashed against were memories of him. The hold of his strong arms, the resonating hum of the Oden lullaby he favored, the feeling of his fingers trailing through her hair... They settled her, calming her in a way so strong she suspected the magic of the bond was much more than partly to blame. But when he came toward her like this, the look in his eyes hungry and predatory, pure strength and dominance emanating from every inch of him, she had to force herself to meet his gaze with her shoulders back and head held high, despite the icy tendrils of fear that gripped and threatened to paralyze her.\n\nHer neck strained to hold his gaze as he loomed over her, moving so that his knees brushed the chair she sat in behind the fabric of her dress as he pushed her legs apart. She froze as he knelt down, flinching back when his hand reached out behind her neck and swept her forward into his lips. New pain sprouted from where he gripped her, his long fingers brushing against the tender areas beneath the bandages. She groaned against his mouth and then realized her mistake when she felt him react excitedly, the hem of her dress being brought up around her thighs. Never breaking their kiss, he scooped an arm around her waist and brought the fabric of her skirt up around her stomach as he positioned her ass on the edge of the seat. His knees hit the ground as he broke off his searing kiss, kneeling before her as he brought his mouth down to between her legs, his strong arms pushing her legs to the side despite her attempts to bring them together.\n\nShe gripped the seat of the chair to keep herself from diving her fingers into his hair. She felt his breath, warm and heavy, before his mouth fell on her, devouring her.\n\nShe arched her back against the scream that threatened to escape her as his tongue swirled mercilessly against her clit. He hooked an arm around her lower back, his other hand keeping her splayed apart, as he sucked and swirled that swollen bundle of nerves. His fingers massaged the sensitive skin around her slit as his mouth worked. As two fingers parted her folds and slipped inside her, she felt the loose grip she had on her control breaking, and she bucked her hips up to meet the thrust of his hand. Her muscles clenched in protest when his tongue abandoned her clit to move down to where his fingers speared her, lapping up her fluids as they coated his hand in response to the pleasures he was forcing from her. He leaned up and crushed her lips against his mouth as he forced his tongue into her, making her taste herself. She recoiled, even as her traitorous body strained against his fingers, wanting more, needing more. Happy to oblige, he deftly unfastened his belt with his free hand as he continued fingering her, as his tongue continued roughly exploring her mouth. His cock sprang free, hard and pulsing, and he drew his fingers out of her and coated himself with her wetness.\n\nHis hands encircled her tiny waist and he easily lifted her up off the chair as he lowered himself to the floor. He settled her on top of him with her knees straddling him, gasping as she felt his erection beneath her. He lifted her a few inches and positioned himself at her entrance, now dripping wet from his attention. She squirmed in his grip as her mind screamed at her to stop this mess. \"Be still, keonai mouv.\" He commanded, and she went limp in his hands, only distantly registering the way she had obeyed him without meaning to. \"Look at me,\" he said in his deep, rumbling voice, and again, she reacted instantly, her eyes meeting his without second thought. He thrust into her, burying himself completely in her as she arched her back and cried out in surprised pain and pleasure.\n\nThis new angle gave her more of him, stuffed her full of him in ways past couplings hadn't done before. She gasped as he eased out of her and then pumped back in and it seemed like every time he moved into her, there was more and more of him to fill her up. It felt horrible and wonderful. His hands never left her sides, manipulating her body to move on top of him the way he wanted. Her fingers clutched at his knees as he bent her back, his cock moving into her with unforgiving force, rubbing against something inside her that threatened to rip open and spill out. Her breath came in heaving gasps as she struggled to use her hands, her knees, her feet, anything to help lift herself up out of the way, to brace herself against his relentless movements. He held her firm, moving her up and down the length of his shaft in time to his bucking hips, as a sound erupted from him, low and dangerous and full of needful pleasure. \"Do not even think about fighting me, Laiyla.\" Her heart raced at his words, but her mind went blank and she relaxed in his hands, opening and offering herself to him. The slow building pressure gripped her in its intensity as he quickened his movements, that area inside her invoking waves of pleasurable torture with every deliberate thrust. She tried to move against him, reaching for the release threatening to undo her, but he held her still and ground into her with his own measured rhythm.\n\nUnease flared in her. Something was wrong.\n\nHe watched her writhing in his hands from his place on the floor, knowing what he was doing to her, how he was stretching this moment out for her and denying her even thoughts of undermining his intention. The feeling of her tight walls stretching for him as he commanded her to relax almost drove him insane. His eyes rolled up to the back of his head and he shuddered as he kept her locked in his hands above him. She whimpered and squirmed, not daring to move her lower body but desperate to be free of the torturous pressure racking her shivering frame. The sound was exquisite. He buried himself in her deeper, reveling in her submission and acknowledgement of the dominance he held over her body.\n\nWhen he was at the very edge, when he knew he could not hold on to himself any longer, he finally let her go. \"Come for me, .\"\n\nThe rich timbre of his voice tore through her, and at nothing more than his word, the terrible pressure that had her gripped in its torturous claw finally toppled over and she screamed out at her intense release. Hot waves of come shot deep inside of her, and her body squeezed and pulsed around him, greedily milking his cock of every last drop. His head was thrown back, the muscles in his neck and chest tight and straining, his hands clenching around her where he still held them around her waist, and she had no doubts she would have yet more bruises tomorrow. She fell forward, and keeping her hips locked around where their bodies were still joined, he held the back of her head as he pressed her to his chest.\n\n\"What have you done?\" she growled. Tears threatened. She dug her nails into her palms, biting back panic at what she was beginning to understand. He didn't answer her, and a slow-building fire began burning in her middle as she felt the truth of his actions wash through her.\n\nShe pushed herself off him as a strangled sound of anguish escaped her. Powerful arms clamped down on her, refusing to let her break from where they were still joined. An arm escaped, and she slapped a hand across his face, the impact leaving a red handprint on his cheek. She gaped at him, stunned and hurt and angry, twisting in his arms to try to free herself.\n\n\"This will stop. You will not move. Calm yourself.\" The air was thick with the danger in his command. Without the distraction of sex, this time she could feel his grip, icy and threatening, constricting around her mind as her muscles became relaxed and she stilled and fell back against him. The tears came freely now as she struggled to think. How was he able to do this? When the scrape of her mental claws had harmlessly bounced off him days ago, he had told her that she was no longer able to hurt him. How was it possible for him to flip her power against her, then? Shouldn't it have been impossible for him to hurt her too?\n\n\"I brought you only pleasure just now,\" he told her, in response to her thoughts. There was a tone of annoyance in his words, and she could have sworn he was bristling.\n\n\"Get out of my head, reisnaig,\" she snarled angrily at him.\n\n\"I will once you are calm, and I know you will not hurt yourself trying to fight me.\" His voice was infuriatingly soothing, his words almost humming as he held her to his chest. His fingers played with her hair, stroking it and smoothing it.",
        "\"How could you?\" she seethed, refusing to let go of her anger. \"Was any of that real? Or was it all just a mind fuck?\" She got no response, and the feeling of being hypnotized crept over her as she felt soft calm envelope her. When he moved her, she was limp and relaxed, and her breathing was even.\n\nHe stood up with her in his arms, finally withdrawing from her. Fluids dripped down the inside of her thigh as he straightened her dress around her. She let herself be carried as he walked toward the door. She tensed as they reached it and he pulled it open, carrying her into the hallway, and toward the door. He had never taken her outside before. They reached it, and he pushed it open into the night.\n\nWhat she saw made her mind go blank with fear. There was an army standing outside. Soldiers dressed in the dark fighting leathers she often saw on Venlen stood in ranks, flames from the torches they carried throwing their large bodies and scarred faces in shadow. Horses larger than she had ever seen were being bridled and readied, their snorts and stomps shaking the ground below them. Everywhere she looked she saw weapons; Archers carried bows and arrows across their backs, maces and throwing axes adorned the hands and belts of giants, and some men carried swords she suspected were taller than her. Dogs snarled and snapped at each other as collars were fastened around their necks, their thick fangs dripping malice and saliva.\n\nDeath. Everywhere she looked, she saw death.\n\nLaiyla had never fought more than five or six men at a time. She was adept with a dagger, and was an accomplished archer, and her less challenging adversaries rarely even required the use of her powers. Her practiced body was quick and lithe, and she could dodge and sprint and deal carefully placed blows with ease. If she hadn't been so overcome with the pain of the bond when she had run into Raul, he would have been easy to fight off.\n\nThis sea of destruction before her was altogether different.\n\nDespite the way Venlen hummed to her, despite the way his grip in her mind commanded her to calm, she shook violently.\n\nWhen his men saw him, they stopped what they were doing and faced him with their fists smacked first to their chest, then up to him in a warrior's salute. Two living giants strolled up through the center of the mass of bodies, their heads towering over the crowd as they parted the deathly sea. They came to stop just feet away from where Venlen stood with her in his arms, and fell immediately to their knees, their heads bowing down in synchronized movements.\n\n\"Your men are ready, Prince Venlen. Spirits are high. When would you have us ride?\"\n\nPrince?\n\nVenlen slowly lowered the small Fae, still reeling from his attack on her mind, to the ground. She barely noticed the branching of that growing green light of life beneath her feet. This was the ultimate dichotomy. She was connected to life, belonged to the light. They were death personified, followed by endless darkness.\n\n\"Be brave, keonai mouv. You have nothing to fear,\" he whispered in her delicately pointed ear. She narrowed her eyes at him. The way he treated her like a child was exasperating, and fury began replacing the fear she felt in front of Prince Venlen's army. This time, she was the one bristling.\n\nShe steadied herself as she turned around and faced out amongst the sea of hard faces and battle-ready men before them, all of them waiting for the command of the man who had just laid siege to her body and mind. She sucked in a deep, shuddering breath and straightened her shoulders as she met the gazes of the men who stared openly at her.\n\nShe felt a trickle of the fluid that still coated the inside of her thighs drip down the back of her leg. The two men at the front stiffened and began sniffing the air. Their curious looks turned into ones of intense scrutiny. She noticed the change in the other men, too. One by one, they sniffed the air and then stiffened, the looks of curiosity in their eyes hardening to malicious glares.\n\nThey were smelling her. Not just her... They were smelling the sex that dripped down from between her thighs, Venlen's scent mixing with her own, claiming her in front of his men.\n\nShe was humiliated. And terrified.\n\nWhat sort of men were these, who sniffed the air around her and moved shrouded in darkness always?\n\nAs if to confirm that this was exactly the effect he had been going for, Venlen hooked an arm around her waist and cupped a breast in his right hand. Heat flushed her cheeks and she tried to wrench herself out of his grip. Don't move, his voice growled in her head, and she felt the urge to twist away and run back inside melting into nothingness. Reisnaig asshole dick sick fuck, GET OUT OF MY HEAD! She screamed in her mind, directing all the rage at what he was doing straight into his consciousness. She felt nothing but his amusement in response.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he drawled, making a show of gently fondling the breast he held beneath his palm. \"As some of you know, Laiyla and I have been...\" he paused here and pinched her nipple between his thumb and finger. She yelped and heard snickering from a few men. \"resting,\" he finished indulgently. \"Raul's actions were unforgivable,\" he continued, his voice hardening at the mention of the man who had tried to kill her. His hands tightened around her breast and she bit her lip to stop herself from crying out again. \"But he brought my attention to a potential problem, and for that I am grateful.\"\n\nHe shifted her easily over to his other side, and the tiniest of movements on his part made it so he had angled his body in front of hers protectively as he spoke again. How very gallant of you, she thought sarcastically, not missing the movement or the implication. He ignored her.\n\n\"Trusted brothers, I offer you a chance to speak now, if you bear any ill will toward the Fae girl. You will be forgiven if you leave immediately.\" His booming voice echoed across the clearing as he gave them a chance to absorb his words. Heads turned to each other in confusion. Laiyla stiffened, sick with the certainty of what was coming. \"Anyone?\" he asked, giving a moment for second thoughts.\n\n\"Very well then,\" he said softly, and she collapsed at his feet with a cry of pain. She could feel her strength being sucked from her in a giant whoosh of air. Her body shook, sweat broke out over her face, her fingers curled into fists in her hair. She knew what was happening. He was using her to search the minds of his men, forcing himself between folds of memory and thought and emotion, violating them in the worst of ways. He was doing it all at once, using his own great strength to make possible a feat she would not have been able to perform on her own.\n\nShe fought against the feeling of being swept away by rushing water. Her fingers gripped the side of her head and she screamed, her body convulsing with effort. Suddenly it was over, and she was being swept up off the ground, lips pressing gentle kisses over her eyelids. \"It's over, keonai mouv. No more.\"\n\nSure enough, she felt his invading grip slipping from her mind, a cool feeling of emptiness remaining in his wake. She took a deep breath and started to open her eyes, but his fingertips landed gently on her eyelids and he spoke softly to her. \"No. You will not want to watch this part. Sleep, Laiyla.\" He pressed his fingers to her forehead, and the familiar feeling of dark, enforced sleep swept over her. She strained against it, her consciousness delicately balanced between two worlds, and from a shroud of weariness, she heard him bark out several names.\n\n...........................................\n\nLaiyla lay sleeping in his arms, nestled safely against him. This was the last terrible thing he would ever do to her, he promised himself. Everything he had done today was to ensure her safety. Still, the sound of yet another scream of pain being drawn from her lips because of him drove a sharp knife of guilt into his gut, twisting terribly when he realized she had begun to bleed from under her bandages again.\n\nThe men whose names he had called out were being roughly thrown before him, swords pointed at their backs, their arms bound behind them. He glared down at them, seething. These were his men! Men he had fought with, had slept next to on the battlefield. Men he had bled over, who had bled over him. He shook with fury. Laiyla stirred and moaned, and he realized he had been gripping her. He forced calming breaths into his lungs and looked out at the gathering lineup of traitors, their eyes wide with fear. He stalked forward.\n\n.......................................................\n\nShe could feel him shaking with anger, gripping her unknowingly tight as he watched them. Barely conscious, she struggled to reach out to him. She couldn't let this happen. These men did not deserve to die. They hadn't deserved to have their minds torn through either, the darkest reaches of their darkest thoughts illuminated by their prince. And then to have those thoughts used against them... She had to stop it.\n\nHe started moving forward, and she tried to move, tried to grab his shirt and shake him to come to his senses. She felt numb, approaching paralyzation, but she managed to grip a fistful of fabric and yank. \"Venlen,\" she whispered, and he paused, his head cocking to bring his ear closer. \"Don't.\" It was all she could manage, and she raged against her uselessness, trying and failing to make her mouth move.\n\nHe pressed his lips to her forehead and sighed. \"Shhh, keonai mouv. I will do everything I think is necessary to keep you safe.\"\n\nSafe. The man was delusional.\n\nShe felt herself being passed into different arms, bigger, but less... Just less. She didn't know how, she just knew they lacked something important. Venlen growled a command, low with warning. The giant holding her nodded once, then began carrying her back into the house. She heard the piercing ring of a sword being drawn. Right before she passed that threshold into blissful unconsciousness, the first head fell.\n\n..............................................\n\nDamien basked in decadence. A rounded belly and thick neck reflected the richness of the meals he preferred. The room surrounding his royal presence was saturated in opulence. Gold glittered from nearly every square inch of the place, jeweled boxes and treasured chalices and precious gems lined the mantles and small inlets built into the brick walls. Even the women, standing silent in the shadows until called upon, were flawless and radiant. He would not have accepted anything less.\n\nPresently, Damien slouched over the table, looking glumly at his yet untouched dinner plate (roasted duck in a rich cream sauce) and listening to Prudence prattle on about his brother's latest escapades. His dark hair fell into his eyes, the rich chocolate brown irises flashing in irritation and impatience. He would have been handsome if it hadn't been for the pudge clinging to his cheeks, chin and neck. A hint of a strong jawline was hidden, as were nearly perfect cheekbones. He was tall, so very tall, and the combination of a tall, imposing man rapidly plumping up was reminiscent of a child's fairy tale about a gluttonous giant villain.\n\n\"She cannot be underestimated, your Majesty. She is just barely past the age of a Fae youngling. Her gifts are still developing, and already some of her abilities surpass that of Lystra. Your brother has long now displayed exceptional power. With her bound to him, he will become nearly unstoppable.\"\n\nDamien's mood further soured, and he snapped his fingers at the closest girl, a delicious looking brunette scantily clad in gold undergarments that just barely covered her ample breasts and fleshy cunt. She came forward and dropped to her feet in front of him, and he raised partly off the seat, so she could peel down his pants. His semi-hard cock was released, and she began licking and stroking with a practiced technique.\n\nAlways feeling better with a whore's lips around his dick, he picked up his silverware and began digging into his meal. Between bites, he shared his thoughts with his oracle.\n\n\"Venlen wouldn't dare rise up against me, and if he ever thought to do so, he could be easily disposed of. I do not acknowledge his claim to her. Unlike him, I have different ways of making her comply with my wishes.\" He paused and reached down to tug roughly at the fabric covering the whore's perky breasts. He fondled and pinched her lovely nipples, ignoring her whimpers of pain around his cock, as he stared Prudence down. Embarrassed, she averted her eyes, and he smirked.\n\n\"Touch yourself, sweetheart,\" he grumbled to the whore, her nipples now dark red and swollen from his rough handling. Obediently, she reached down and slid thin gold fabric aside, stroking her clit and sliding her long fingers in and out of herself, moaning sweetly as she sucked away on his cock.\n\nHe began eating again, staring darkly at the robed woman looking impatient yet timid. Her long blonde hair hung in limp strings around her face, and it looked dirty, the wrong color entirely. Her eyes were a slightly appealing shade of blue, staring out from an oval face with little hinting at the bone structure beneath. The whole effect was decidedly underwhelming. Oracles were supposed to be stunningly beautiful. He kept this one around because she was wholly dedicated to her work, understanding that this was the only thing in the world keeping her head attached to her neck.\n\nDamien spoke with his mouth full, eager to have this meeting over with. \"I did not call you here to listen to all the ways in which my brother would be able to defeat me. If provoked to an extreme. Your ramblings are next to useless. I asked you a question you have yet to answer. It is past time I had an heir. Will she bear me a Seeker child or no?\"\n\nPrudence hesitated, twisting her fingers and darting her eyes back in forth. \"That is... highly improbable, your Majesty. But there are many suitable women who would bear you strong and capable heirs,\" she finished quickly, noting the dark look that came over his eyes. \"I would be able to help you secure one.\"\n\n\"What is improbable, Prudence? My heir being a Seeker, or her giving me a child?\" His voice was low, anger rumbling beneath the surface. Prudence stared at the floor and tugged nervously at her robes.\n\n\"You will look at me, my dear, and you will answer me quickly, and honestly.\" He gripped the girl in between his legs tightly by her hair and she yelped in pain and sprung up from her place. He struck her sharply with the back of his hand and tears welled in her eyes as she held onto her cheek, but she immediately lowered herself back onto him and continued her job.\n\nPrudence spoke slowly, anxiety lacing her words. \"There is a child, your Majesty. A child with Seeker blood. But it is not yours.\" This last was spoken with a resigned tone, and her shoulders slumped.\n\nDamien's fingers curled around his chalice, and with a snarl, he lifted it and heaved it against the wall by Prudence's head. She flinched back as wine splashed over her face and robes.\n\n\"There is little that this world would dare deny me,\" his booming voice declared dangerously. \"I don't care what I have to do, but she will bear my child, or she will know pain beyond reason and then a slow and torturous death! And as for you,\" he growled, \"you are not the only oracle at my command. You will remember that next time you answer a question. Now GET OUT!\"\n\nQuickly, she bowed her head and turned toward the door, eager to be gone.\n\n\"Oh, and Prudence,\" he said softly as she reached for the handle. Nervously, she turned to face him.\n\n\"Do not for one second think me a blind fool. I know perfectly well how you want for Venlen's affection. If I hear even the slightest hint of a rumor that you have spoken of this to him, your head will roll.\"\n\nHer face draining of color, Prudence bowed deeply and shuffled quickly out the door, not daring to breathe until she was out of his presence.\n\nHis mood considerably lightened, Damien dug into his plate with zeal, the whore on her knees sucking dutifully. When he was finished, he sighed with satisfaction and turned his attention completely toward her. She trembled as his hands wrapped around her pretty neck.\n\n................................................\n\nLaiyla. Soft whispers swirled around her head, gently taking her from blissful sleep. Keeping her eyes closed, she listened to the whispers caressing her cheeks, weaving themselves through her hair, dancing lightly around her fingers.\n\nThe moon rises, Laiyla. The time draws near. Do not hesitate when he lets down his guard.\n\nShe shivered. For once, strong arms did not envelope her, a reassuring hum did not resonate against her back. She cast her net and felt him close but distracted.\n\nShe tried to turn her focus back on the whispers, but they were gone. She thought about what they had said. Do not hesitate when he lets down his guard.\n\nShe waited for the sound of his bootsteps coming toward her, ached for the feel of his fingers playing in her hair. She stiffened at her own thoughts, rigid with the realization of where her feelings were taking her. It's the bond, she told herself. It's just the fucking bond.\n\nWith a jolt, she remembered all that had happened before she lost consciousness and was almost sick. Dry heaving, she sat up and remembered the horrible ring of the sword as it was pulled, the terrible thump as the first man's head was cut from his shoulders. The oily feeling of his presence in her mind. Where she was all claws and talons, ripping and tearing when she felt cornered and threatened, he was all soft caresses and warm manipulations. She had felt the lie behind the feel of him in her mind. Despite how he thought he felt, she would never be safe with him.\n\nStill he did not come for her. She drew her knees up to her chin and hugged her arms around her short, toned legs. She didn't know if she was relieved or disappointed, or both, but a layer of frustration settled like dust upon the top of whatever emotion it was.\n\nHeavy footsteps sounded outside her door and she knew instantly that it was not Venlen. She pulled her legs under herself as one of the giants from the night before towered in the doorway, staring down at her and sniffing the air.\n\n\"Prince Venlen has ordered your immediate departure,\" he said gruffly. His dull blonde hair was loose and wild. Bright blue eyes peered down at her with impatience as she tugged on the new dress covering her body, this one the deep blue of an autumn sky. She was growing tired of his dressing her like a doll. He took two massive steps toward the bed and was suddenly towering over her. Good Gods the man was big. \"Get up. We will go now.\" He made no move to reach for her. Fool.\n\nShe smiled up at him, sweetness saturating her honeyed words. \"And what's your name, pup?\" she asked, lazily drawing a circle on the mattress with her finger, mimicking the circle she was making in his mind. \"Did Venlen send you for me to play with? Surely he knows better than to send one of his overgrown dogs to collect me.\"\n\nIrritation flashed in the man's eyes, and he reached down for her. \"Ah-ah,\" she admonished, holding a finger up to him. \"I know for certain he wouldn't want one of his dogs pawing at his play-thing.\"\n\nHis hand froze, and whether it was from her words or her now steady grip on his mind, she didn't know or care.\n\nShe snarled in warning and curled her talons around his intention, the place where all magic, all action, all purpose came from. He stared blankly ahead, waiting for her command. \"Tell Venlen that if he wants me, he will have to come collect me himself,\" she snapped, and when he reached the door, she sent one last mental shove his way and glided out of his head.",
        "..................................................\n\nWhen his largest, meanest looking warrior had barreled through the door, face drained of color, and had told him of what Laiyla had done and said, he had almost roared with laughter. Amlen gaped at him in horror. His hands still shook from the awful feeling of having been under her complete control. He had been ready to die at nothing more than her word. The prince was a madman to have taken such a creature as his mate.\n\nStill chuckling, Venlen dismissed his guard and strode out of the small room to the bedroom door. He found Laiyla crouching under the window, her lithe body ready to spring.\n\nWhen she saw it was him, she straightened and calmed. His eyes grazed over her, and he found himself annoyed that she had discarded the blue gown he had chosen for her and instead wore a pair of supple leather pants and a loose white tunic.\n\n\"I take it you and Amlen didn't get along well?\" he raised an eyebrow at her.\n\nShe crossed her arms angrily, her feminine growl permeating her words. \"Next time you send someone to collect me, reisnaig, know that I will send them back to you with their mind in pieces.\"\n\nHe smirked, unable to suppress the sense of pride he felt at her ferocity and brazenness. Only he was allowed to come near his little one. No one else was acceptable to her. \"Fine. But you will come to me now. We are leaving.\n\nHer vibrant green eyes narrowed. \"What about Sonya?\"\n\n\"Sonya has already left with the main battalion. We will meet up with them once we are close enough to the city.\" He let his eyes roam the small curves of her body, returned now that her appetite was improving, and her health was restored. The healer had done well. He prayed she would continue to improve on the journey, would not slide back into the feverish, sickly Fae he had held next to him for what seemed like months.\n\nShe stepped forward, her glare still suspicious as she considered his outstretched hand. \"Sonya...\" she started.\n\n\"...Will be safe and waiting for you at the other end,\" he finished, and gestured her forward with his palm. \"Come to me, keonai mouv. We need to leave.\"\n\nThere was a moment of hesitation before she walked the rest of the way toward him. When his hand closed over hers, her eyes widened, and her face shot up to look at him. Fear clouded her stunning eyes. \"Laiyla? What's wrong?\"\n\nShe shook her head as if to clear it, a shiver running down her spine. \"Nothing. Lead the way, reisnaig.\"\n\n................................................\n\nLaiyla slept curled next to the fire bench beside him. It would take two more weeks for them to reach the border of the city, the border that separated this world from his... theirs... and that would return her rightfully home.\n\nHe gazed over her body, so much smaller than his, so much ferocity and willpower in such a tiny vessel. His dominance over her was absolute. He had full access to her in every way, even the ability to change her thoughts. Yet still she denied him the affection she should have displayed for him by now. A chill crept over his body at the thought of the horror he had felt from her end of the bond at his recent actions. Despite all his power over her, despite the fact that he owned her in every sense, she could not accept that he had acted as he had only to keep her safe.\n\nHe reached down and swept his fingers over her forehead, tucking loose strands of hair behind her ear. She was so beautiful in sleep, the way her face relaxed and was comforted under his touch, a slight smile curling her lips. Every day she warred with herself against her feelings for him. Every day she slowly lost ground. She would come to love him, would eventually give herself over to him completely, and he would finally own all of her, broken heart and all.\n\n\"Braenn mael laevvi, keonai mouv.\" \n\nCome back to me, little one. \n\nHer eyes fluttered open and she looked over at him, stretching her arms over her head and arching her back like a graceful cat. Her dark hair once again fell over her eyes.\n\n\"It is time we talked.\"\n\n..........................................................\n\nShe sipped at the tonic the healer had put into her hands when Venlen had ordered the camp to pack up for another day's ride. It had been a week on the road, according to Venlen, since it was impossible to tell with how much she was forced to sleep. Time had closed her wounds and given back some of her strength. After a lunch of roasted rabbit, hunted by Venlen himself, and dried nuts and berries, they had continued moving. Only this time, Venlen had allowed her to walk beside the horses with him. They moved slow, and although her sore muscles still gave her resistance, it was the happiest she had ever been since being taken from her forest.\n\nThe ground bloomed under her with magnificent glowing green branches. She spoke to the trees as they passed, grateful to learn that no dark creatures yet haunted this part of the wood.\n\nVenlen walked silently beside her, stealing quick, concerned glances at her often, as if worried she may fall over at any moment. He was giving her time before they spoke, before he told her what lay ahead of her, and the truth of who he was. She had a nagging feeling that it might be better if she had never asked. Finally, he spoke, the deep rumble of his voice infuriating her with the way it made her body sing back to him with pleasure. Every day it was becoming harder for her to hate him. Every day she clung tighter to her memories of the true Venlen.\n\n\"We are approaching the city in which you will reside with me for some time. The bond makes it... difficult for me to part from you for long. I travel often, and there will be times when your presence at my side will be required. However, you will have every comfort when we arrive at the city. You will know a life of luxury; you will want for nothing.\"\n\nShe was silent, bringing the tonic to her lips as she gazed out at the forest they passed. If not for the sense of unease he felt in her, he would have thought she did not hear him.\n\n\"I am returning you to the place where you were born,\" he said softly. She stiffened and stopped walking. Slowly, he turned back to face her. \"Eila told you of what became of your true family,\" he continued. It was impossible that he should know that. She understood what he was about to say and interrupted him when he began to speak again.\n\n\"Prince Venlen. It was your family who overthrew mine. You helped butcher my mother, my siblings. How small was the youngest you hung from the castle gates?\" she said angrily, her body rigid with slow building rage as she let the implications of his confession wash over her. \"Did you string up a toy animal by her side, to keep her company and comfort her in her last moments?\"\n\nHe sighed, his shoulders dropping just barely. The fact that she had left out concern for her father and grandmother did not escape him. \"I was not present when your family was killed,\" he said, as if testing the words out on his tongue, wanting to see if they tasted right. \"But I would not have hesitated to do the job myself. It was necessary. Your father's evil plagued the land for a generation. It took my brother years to undo the damage, and even now, the people still suffer from some of the terrible things he did.\"\n\n\"And what part of those evils was my mother responsible for?\" she asked, her voice rising, her hands curling into fists. \"What evils did my siblings spread across the land?\"\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" he demanded, his voice not quite a shout but loud enough to silence her. \"What's done is done. The family could not have been allowed to survive. We could not risk the chance of someone rising up, trying to reclaim the throne.\"\n\n\"And what about me?\" she asked, her voice too quiet, her tone challenging. \"Now that you have found me, will my body hang from the gates as well?\"\n\n\"I would never let that happen,\" he growled, the anger in his voice giving her pause. \"You are mine now, you are under my care and protection. No one will ever so much raise a finger to harm you. Besides,\" he continued, his voice gradually losing some of its low threat. \"Seeker blood runs through your veins. Your grandmother gave herself over to darkness, but there is only good in you.\" Here, his voice was filled with something she could have sworn was pride. \"You are the Last Seeker. Killing you would be a terrible deed, a mistake we would not dare to make.\"\n\nShe was quiet for some time as she digested this information. She listened to the clomping of the walking horses, the clink of metal of the weapons that hung on the belts of the many soldiers who surrounded them. \"Why does the darkness follow you?\" she asked finally.\n\nHe looked up at the night sky, making her wait before he answered. \"Lystra, the Seeker before you, your grandmother, was... difficult to catch up with. She escaped the city during the invasion and fought against us from the shadows from some time. When we caught up with her...\" his voice trailed off, and she waited for him to continue. \"A cornered animal will strike out without regard to their own safety. As she faced death, Lystra struck out at me, condemning me in her anger and desperation. She tied me and my army to the moon,\" he said, resignation and lingering rage tainting his words. \"I am called the Dark Prince, my army the Army of Night. I have not seen daylight since,\" he finished softly, sadly almost.\n\nNo recognition flared within her. Word of the happenings in her birthplace were limited to what Eila told her, and she had never spoken of this man or his army. Still, understanding flooded her as she listened to him describe the curse that was placed on him. A prince, tied to the moon. The Moon is rising, Eila had told her, the voices had whispered to her.\n\nWhat a ridiculous title, she thought.\n\nHer thoughts racing, she continued talking. \"You take me to your brother now,\" she said, a statement instead of a question. \"You would have me act as Lystra did, securing his place on the throne, drawing out and destroying his enemies and those who would act against him.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said sharply. \"You are not your grandmother. I do not think you are even capable of doing the things she did at your father's side. Your place will be by my side. Soon we will marry, and you will give me children. I will not expose you to the evils that seduced Lystra.\"\n\nShe balked. Marry? Children? The man truly was delusional if he thought she would allow that to happen. To her horror, she found herself considering his words, imagining what their children would look like, wondering if they would carry the Seeker blood as she did.\n\n\"What, no snide remarks? No hateful words to me?\" He sneered at her, but it was more playful than cruel. She did not smile. You asked for it, she thought, bracing herself for his inevitably violent reaction to what she was about to say.\n\n\"Despite your twistedly sweet words, Venlen, I consider you my enemy. Being bound to you, against my will,\" she said, her teeth gritted, \"will never change that. You are also insane to think I will submit to domestication, but I knew this about you already. Luxuries and pretty things don't interest me. If you keep me from my forest, I will eventually give you more trouble than I am worth to you.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath and continued, noting the way his eyes narrowed into an intimidating gaze. But she would not be intimidated, not this time.\n\n\"I knew only my mother, and not well. But I loved her, and despite whatever tangled way you rationalize what you and your family did, she did not deserve to die. Neither did her children, or the rest of the innocent people you must have killed in your conquest for power. Eila told me it was not just an overthrow, it was a war. How many died for the pretty things you have now? Thousands? Tens of thousands?\n\n\"You say such sweet nothings, Venlen. They mean nothing to me. Your fucked-up actions mean far more, and they tell the true story of your depravity. Before I ever laid eyes on you I knew that you would be the end of me. You're a dangerous man, reisnaig, and you want me curled at your feet, purring like a kitten, but you forget yourself, and you forget me. I've made this offer once before, and I make it again. Kill me now, or I swear to you, I will kill you and --\"\n\nWith a vicious growl, Venlen's patience with her lecture was run out and her back was slammed into the ground below her. He pinned her down with his weight, his dark eyes swirling with pure violence and aggression. His massive hand curled around her exposed throat, his thumb pressing into the hollow of her neck as he blanched her honeyed skin.\n\n\"You truly wish for death, Laiyla? You threaten me, after all I have done? After everything I have given you?\" His voice was that deadly calm, churning with threat. His grip on her throat tightened, and she gaped, her lungs trying to suck in air that wasn't there. She thrashed under his grip, relishing the feel of physical contact that wasn't wrapped up in thick layers of sexual conquest. He could have her life if he wanted it. Right now, she was free of her own impulses, and she reveled in the clarity of the moment.\n\n\"You think I am cruel, keonai mouv, that I torment you. Know this: You have no fucking idea what torment under my hand feels like. But I will gladly enlighten you.\" His thick fingers continued to push into the softness of her neck. She bared her teeth at him in a silent, breathless snarl.\n\n\"Your highness,\" a deep voice rumbled above them. Neither of them broke the stare that held them locked together to look up at the figure standing over them. Her vision swam as his hand continued crushing her, but still she refused to look away from those lavender flecked eyes.\n\n\"Prince Venlen.\" The title was spoken softer, but with more urgency. Venlen glared down at her for a moment longer, his dark eyes searching her face for the deception he hoped was behind her look of hatred. Finding nothing but pure malice and resentment, he drew back his hand as if what he had been touching had disgusted him. She clutched her throat, gasping and gagging. The world swam and spun in front of her eyes. \"What is it?\" he barked at the man who had interrupted them.\n\n\"Your attention is needed at the front, sir. There has been a... development,\" he said, casting a wary glance at Laiyla.\n\nVenlen cast one last dark glance back at Laiyla before turning his back on her. Without another word, he was gone, the blossoming bruises on her neck the only sign that anything had happened between them. Her clothes remained untorn and intact; her dignity, spared. The men around her walked on without so much as a glance down at her.\n\nWith a speed that could not have been a coincidence, the healer was upon her, worrying his hands over wounds both young and new as he pressed her refilled glass back into her hands, another tonic with a slightly different smell. They were off the side of the road, sitting against the thick trunk of a maple tree. She pressed her hand to it, asking for comfort and healing. Sensing her need and her worthiness, tendrils of green light funneled from the surrounding trees into the one she touched, then wound its way through her outstretched palm and into her aching body.\n\nEila's pendant responded to the new energy swirling through her, pulsating with a pearlescent glow. With a synergism of reciprocal lifeforce, the bright green glow from the tree and the pearlescent white glow from the necklace twisted in breathtaking intimacy like a lovers' dance, finally settling over her body and into her veins with a magnetic calm. She felt that part of herself, the part of herself she had protected and kept safe from the reisnaig respond in kind. Invigorated, renewed, she opened her eyes to see the healer gaping down at her, a look of wonderment and fear on a face slack with shock. Her aches and pains were gone. When she looked down, she saw her bruises had disappeared, the cuts fully healed. She smiled warmly.\n\nA sound came from the forest behind them. Rustling brush, a scampering of a large animal, a low growl. They both turned toward it, Laiyla's already heightened senses narrowing on the source of the sound. They were alone, the rest of the caravan having moved along the road, slowly but with growing distance. Moonlight cast an ethereal glow on the forest around them. She stilled and focused, ready to strike. With a sigh of relief, she relaxed and grinned widely, jumping to her feet. \"Syrus!\"\n\n..............................................\n\n\"How many men lost?\" His temper flaring, outrage sweating from every pore, the man in front of him cowering as he delivered the news.\n\n\"S-sir, the initial count is eighty-four,\" the man said, shoving his fist into his side to hide his shaking.\n\nVenlen's eyes narrowed dangerously. \"Initial count?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. That is... uh... There are...\" His eyes darted back and forth, and he swallowed hard. \"Extra body parts, your highness.\"\n\nVenlen shut his eyes against the dancing torchlight. His men gathered around him in a loose circle, murmurs and whispers spreading through the crowd of battle-tested warriors. Fear of mortal men this was not; The dark creatures had returned, and this time, they had struck.\n\nHis eyes snapped open, a rapid series of decisions flashing through his mind. \"Gather my four fastest riders. Send them ahead; warn the city. Patrols will be doubled. I want the bodies of the slain beasts brought to me for my inspection. Rafe!\" he barked, and another man appeared by his side in an instant. \"Bring me the healer. He may be able to uncover any weak areas or things of note.\" Rafe nodded once and ran off into the crowd. \"Yessin!\" A taller man, half of his face mutilated by burn scars, stood at attention before him. \"Ride to the main body, tell them to fall back and wait for us to catch up.\" Venlen spun without waiting for an answer. \"Amlen!\" The taller of the two giants among his ranks stalked toward him, massive arms crossed in front of him. \"I want ten men posted around Laiyla at all times. Pick out the strongest.\" He paused as Amlen bowed his head in acknowledgement.\n\nVenlen strained his neck as he looked over the crowd of men growing restless and irritable with the news of their slain brothers. \"Amlen.\" The dark ripple of his voice brought quiet to the men around him. \"Where is Laiyla?\"\n\nMen began looking around, eyes darting back and forth as they raised eyebrows at their neighbors in question. No one spoke. She was not among the caravan. Venlen cursed, gave his men an order, and mounted the chestnut giant that had lead him into battles for decades. The horse snorted and stomped in anticipation. Amlen looked up at his prince, his face stricken as he handed him the reins.\n\nVenlen glared down at his personal guard, disappointment and fury distorting his face. \"One way or another, Amlen, she will be brought back to me. You should pray that she is alive and well.\"\n\nHis heart racing, his gut sick with dread and worry, he urged his horse into a gallop, racing into the night."
