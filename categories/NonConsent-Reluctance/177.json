        "I encourage anyone picking up this story now to return to previous chapters. These are not meant to stand alone.\n\nHappy reading!\n\n*\n\nShe was lying on her back in a field. Blades of grass and small wild flower tickled her skin as they swayed in the soft breezes. An impossibly blue sky opened up above her. She closed her eyes, feeling the sun on her face.\n\n\"This is nice.\" The god's voice came from next to her. She turned her head and opened her eyes to find him lying in the grass next to her. She almost laughed.\n\n\"How casual of you to be down in the dirt with me.\" Her voice barely covered the giggle that threatened to break through.\n\nThe god cracked a smile, rolled on his side and stuck a daisy stem between his teeth. \"Ay, ye wee lass, as they do say, from whence we came so shall we return,\" he adopted a northern drawl and quoted the dark god's promise to her, a mockery of the famous northern priests. Anna couldn't take it and broke out into a full laugh at this ludicrous notion that a god was teasing her in the middle of a sunny field. She must have lost her mind.\n\n\"I've gone mad,\" she gasped.\n\n\"Happiness is surely the first sign of it,\" his voice was falsely grave. \"Terrible for one so young.\"\n\nAnna laughed again. Suddenly she stopped and sat up, looking out into the dream's infinite horizon.\n\n\"I've made a terrible mistake,\" she said, remembering.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" the god said, sitting up next to her. \"Perhaps the boy will surprise you.\"\n\nAnna felt a knot tighten in her throat. \"He fears me now, or worse. He will have left me in the dirt.\"\n\n\"You might be better off alone.\"\n\nAnna shook her head again, tears pricking her eyes. \"I don't want to be alone. Alone I am tormented with thoughts of all I've seen, haunted by my own deeds, filled with silence and rage. He also bears my burden, but so lightly. It hasn't blackened his soul as it has mine. I can save him from that. I have to. And in return he can share his light with me.\"\n\nThe god's arm wrapped around her shoulder and pulled her into an embrace. He lifted her face to his. \"You are light. Sadness and anger might shade you now but underneath it you too are all light.\" His lips met hers softly and she let him pull her into the kiss, allowing herself a moment of reprieve.\n\nA familiar pain blossomed in her gut as she struggled back to awareness. She was lying across a saddle, her legs on one side of the horse and her head and arms off the other. The pain radiated out, announcing that she had been in that position for a long time. She groaned loudly as she came to full, head throbbing consciousness. She squeezed her eyes closed.\n\nThe horse stopped and she felt someone pull off the ropes that bound her in place. Her body was swung up to someone's shoulder, the pain tripling from the relatively narrow area now bearing her weight. Her head felt thick with too much blood. A moment later she was on the ground and strong arms were propping her against a tree. She opened her eyes as far as she could without searing pain, only to find a blurry form moving away from her.\n\nShe closed her eyes again, feeling inside to the dark fire at her center. It had restored itself. She grabbed a bit, washing it through her system, ridding herself of the lingering weakness and soreness that tugged at her body. When she opened her eyes again she saw Dev before her, his face unreadable. She opened her mouth to speak but her dry throat wouldn't work.\n\nHe held out a water skin towards her, dropping it as soon as her fingers touched it. She tried not to wince at his action and took a deep drink.\n\n\"How long?\" she croaked.\n\n\"All yesterday and this morning.\" His tone was short.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"For not leaving me.\"\n\nDev eyed her suspiciously for a long moment. \"What did you put in me?\"\n\n\"I had to heal your body with magic. You'd lost a lot of blood. The magic replaced it until your body does its work.\"\n\n\"Can you take it out again?\" he sounded strained.\n\nAnna had trouble meeting his eye. \"I wouldn't recommend it. You will not feel well on your own.\"\n\n\"I feel worse now. Like there are ants crawling on the inside of my skin. I want you to take it out.\" A bit of the scared boy edged into his voice. She knew how he felt.\n\n\"I know it feels strange. Rein it in; make it work for you. It will be gone in a few days.\"\n\n\"No!\" he snapped at her. \"Take it out now!\"\n\nAnna's eyes flashed with fury as she looked up at him. \"Get a hold of yourself. I can't stay here and nurse you till you feel well enough to move around again.\"\n\n\"I just dragged your unconscious body around for nearly two days and you are going to threaten to leave me behind?\"\n\nShe groaned as she got to her feet. Even at her unusual height, she still had to look up to Dev's furious face.\n\n\"You would have died there and then had I not done what I did. I'm grateful you didn't leave me behind out of fear of my magic, but don't you dare order me around and snipe at me after I very well saved your life. Again.\"\n\nDev looked properly abashed but still prickly. \"It feels like fire.\"\n\n\"It is fire,\" she sighed. \"Clamp down on the feeling; rule the fire.\"\n\n\"Is that what you do?\" he asked cautiously, his anger dropped out of his voice.\n\nAnna put her hand to her pounding head. \"I don't want to talk about that.\" She was exhausted. She needed food and sleep.\n\nDev's voice sharpened again. \"How can you expect me not to ask what you are? How you do what you did? People don't just wander around throwing spells around. You froze those men in place. They couldn't move at all. One died of his wounds and still his body hung there. How could you possibly be so powerful, if you are who you say you are?\"\n\nAnna's head snapped up. She reached out and grabbed Dev's arms, her fingers digging into the muscles in his forearm. \"What did you say?\"\n\nHis shocked eyes looked from her hand to her face. \"What?\" he managed to stutter.\n\n\"About the men. You said one of them died?\" Her heart was pounding. She had forgotten! She had taken two lives and barely noticed.\n\n\"One of the men you shot with an arrow started bleeding from the wound. I went back to the camp to check to make sure I hadn't gone mad. I saw him die and still his body stayed in place. Your magic did that.\"\n\n\"Oh dear gods. Two of them. The other man, I shot him in the throat. He was about to bring the sword down. I didn't think. I shot him in the neck. Then I left them trapped and the other one died. It's still my fault.\" She was muttering almost to herself but she kept her grip on Dev. Fear battered her thin defenses. She was exhausted and starving and incapable of dealing with the thought of more pain.\n\n\"Anna, what are you talking about?\" Dev's voice was still fearful but also concerned. Her tear-bright eyes met his soft hazel ones. For a moment she wanted to tell him everything, to tell him how she sold her soul, how the god had come to punish her, how she couldn't kill them, how she didn't want to kill them anymore. But there were other parts of the story she couldn't tell him. And she knew even then that she couldn't seek comfort with him.\n\nShe tore her eyes away from his and released his arm. Stumbling away from him. \"I just shouldn't have done that. I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't have done what? Anna, what is going on? Can't you tell me?\" Dev stepped towards her. All the fear was gone, he was still her companion, still concerned about her. She supposed her shaking, teary self was no longer as terrifying as he had no doubt imagined her to be.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I need to sleep.\" Anna felt cold with exhaustion. She tried to still the tremors that ran through her with no luck. Dev's hand came down softly on the back of her shoulder. She wanted to shake him off but for a moment she let his hand rest there until she began to shiver again and she pulled away. \"Please, can I sleep here? Are we far enough off the road?\" She couldn't turn around and face him.\n\n\"Yeah, Anna. I'll get a fire started.\" She knew there would still be questions when she woke up. Maybe she would have some answers for him. Moments later she was wrapped in the cocoon of her bedroll and Dev was starting a fire. He tried to wake her to feed her but she would not be moved. Dev settled on the far side of the fire, looking at the lump of cloth that contained her form, wondering what in the world was going on.\n\n*\n\nIt was dawn when she woke up, the world was grey and the forest around her was waking up. She shivered, sitting up and looking around for her bedroll. Had she thrown it off somehow? Where was the fire? She realized, as the cobwebs cleared, that she was alone and she didn't recognize the wood around her. Had he left? And taken everything? Would he do that to her?\n\nHer answer appeared at her side. She looked up at the god's face and her stomach dropped. He was furious. She hadn't thought he could express emotions that intense. She slowly got to her feet and faced him, her eyes still downcast. Silence fell like a weight on her back. She tried not to fidget. She wouldn't be the first to speak.\n\n\"I suppose you think I should be lenient because you didn't kill them all?\" his voice seemed more cavernous and otherworldly than ever. It was like a blow across her body.\n\n\"I didn't think that,\" she whispered. The thought hadn't occurred to her. He must have known that.\n\n\"Do you think so now?\"\n\nAnna shook her head. She would take whatever it was that he was going to do to her. Suddenly the thought occurred to her, would he take her now? Was he going to collect on their deal because of what she had done? She hadn't considered that this could be the end of the road for her. A tight feeling of fear gripped her entire body. No, please, not yet. She looked up into his face, parting her lips to speak her mind but he silenced her with a look.\n\n\"I should. It is a fool who allows this type of persistence in folly.\" He stopped there, letting the words hang there between them. Anna could not think of words to plead her case, her mind was suddenly clouded entirely by panic. She wasn't ready to go; she still needed more time. What of Dev? He would think she had abandoned him. Did this mean she dies now? Was this the end? What of the men? So many more of them would escape justice.\n\n\"But so many of them would escape being murdered by your bumbling and regretfully not be able to participate in the blackening of your soul. And need I remind you that it is my soul now?\"\n\nAnna swallowed again; her mouth was dry. She felt hollowed out, like something was eating at her from the inside. She couldn't argue, couldn't beg. All she could do was stand there until he told her what he was going to her.\n\n\"You ignored my order also. This body you sold me, while not entirely well fed to begin with, is wasting away. I did not just tell you to eat on a whim. This magic I gave you draws on your energy as well. If you do not feed your body, the magic will consume it. You may not feel hungry but you must eat. You cannot simply restore your health with magic and assume the rest is also taken care of.\"\n\nAnna hadn't considered this. She looked down at herself. It did seem like these clothes were hanging off of her more than they had been. The trousers Mirabelle had given her were once a bit snug on her feminine hips, having been cut for a narrower male; now she needed a belt to keep them up. The magic was indeed consuming her.\n\nShe placed her hand on her chest, trying to rub out the empty feeling there. Everything had gone terribly wrong. She had wanted to avenge her family and now she realized taking the lives of their killers cost her more than it was worth. She was still haunted by their faces as they died, the feeling of their flesh on the other end of her blades. And if her guilt and self-disgust weren't enough, she was to be punished by the god as well, opening her up to new levels of degradation. Now, to make matters worse, the magic she had sold her soul for was actually eating away at her.\n\nWas there no upside to this deal? Had she been tricked into this deal somehow? No, she had wanted revenge, wanted blood. How na\u00efve. She had never even seen a man killed before that horrible day and she had sold herself to be able to do just that. Like a fool, she had never considered that she ultimately wouldn't want to.\n\nAnna raised her eyes to the god's face. He had tried to warn her off of it too. She was such a fool. She felt herself slipping again, back towards that dark place, back to the edge of that darkness she had teetered on so desperately after her family had been killed. He would take her and it would be over, this whole sad silly experiment. She began to close her eyes, to let the tide of nothingness take her away from all of her horrible choices.\n\nThe god's hands grasped her upper arms, shaking her.\n\n\"Open your eyes.\" It was a command, but she suddenly found it difficult to care. Not caring lay this blanket over all that was bad and snuffed it out, kept her free of it. The weakness in her body called out to her to give in, to stop fighting. Leave it, she thought, letting the darkness close in. The pit was too deep to start climbing out again.\n\n\"Anna, open your eyes,\" this time the voice rang out in her mind, pushing past the fog, jolting her brain back to the present. She complied, looking back up at his face. She had never been this close to him and had the time to actually look at him. Usually she was too wrapped up in what was about to happen or had just happened to actually study the god, Leonid, the one she had sold herself to.\n\nHis face was eerily perfect. His skin was much darker than hers and evenly toned as though the sun had no effect on it. His cobalt blue eyes shone out from under thick black brows which arched across his smooth forehead. His nose was straight; his lips wickedly full. She wondered, absentmindedly, if his lips would feel the same if he kissed her as he did in her dreams. She saw the corners curve up in a small smile.\n\nHe knew her thoughts! A rush of embarrassment washed over her, breaking her daze. She lowered her eyes and resisted trying to hide her face in her hands despite the grip he still had on her arms. What was wrong with her tonight?\n\n\"Stop, Anna,\" the use of her name still affected her, sending shivers down her spine as if his voice was caressing her skin. \"Stop this self-pity and the rest of the nonsense.\"\n\nShe felt stung. Was she letting herself get pulled under? Wasn't she just getting tired of trying to be strong when she wasn't? When it was all just false bravado backed up by magic, magic which she had so little control over that it was actually devouring her?\n\n\"You are not a little girl living under her parents' roof any longer. You wanted to dispense justice. It is more difficult than you thought it would be. Stop feeling bad about your choices and live with them.\"\n\nIt occurred to her that he had never spoken so much to her at one time. \"It's a lot to take in all at once.\" Her voice sounded small. He was right of course. She had told Dev to clamp down, to rule the fire, and here she was letting all of this burn her up. She realized she was leaning into the god's arms, seeking out some sort of comfort from him. She righted herself a little, pulling away. She could not ask and he was not offering.\n\nThe weakness in her body made her want to curl up and disappear into the ground. But her mind felt clearer now.\n\n\"I'm ready to accept the punishment for my crimes,\" she said softly, trying to sound stronger than she felt.\n\n\"A brave thought, but your body is too weak. We can't punish the unconscious, can we?\" He wasn't going to punish her for the lives she took? Or just not yet? Something inside her ached at either thought. She feared the pain but she feared liking it more. She looked back up at him, searching. He was still smiling slightly. \"Tomorrow night perhaps. Feed yourself; refrain from magic. I'll come for you when you are ready.\"\n\nHis right hand moved from her arm to her cheek, his thumb running softly over her bottom lip. A shudder went through her that had nothing to do with her hunger. The god's gaze became almost painful with its intensity. Then it was gone, he released her and dropped his other hand. He reached behind her and pulled her bow and quiver into his hand from thin air and held it out to her.\n\n\"You'll need this,\" he said. \"Your camp is just through those trees.\" He gestured towards her left. She nodded and took the bow, noticing he had strung it for her as well. She wanted to ask why but even that seemed like more energy than it was worth.\n\nThe god stood there as she moved off towards the direction he had indicated. \"Anna,\" he said softly. She turned back to him. \"Your concern for the boy is admirable but don't put yourself in the position of having to kill for him again.\" Then he was gone as if he'd never been there at all.\n\nShe walked numbly back towards the camp, turning over all that he had said, all the things she had felt. Suddenly a great surge of relief burst inside her, rippling out of her throat as a laugh she barely recognized as her own. She had thought she was dead, finished, scooped up by the god and taken from this world to who knows what fate. She had accepted it, given herself up for lost, the same way she had a few weeks before. It felt like years had passed since that day on the tree. And here she was, still here, still with a chance.\n\nThe laugh startled a large doe that had wandered close to their camp. The creature launched itself between the trees almost straight at Anna. Her need for the bow became clear and Anna brought the animal down with a single shot. She smiled as she walked towards it. He had told her to eat after all.\n\n\"I could use your help,\" Anna said to Dev's rumpled head as he jerked awake. She was dragging the heavy carcass behind her. He fumbled with his shoes and came over, helping her string the body up on a tree branch.\n\nShe sat down heavily when it was done, her weakness catching up with her. Dev looked at her pale face and went to get his hunting knife. \"I'll take care of the deer. Eat some of the food I left for you last night.\" He gestured at her pack. She found a crust of bread and cheese as well as some cold stew. She ate all of it so quickly she barely tasted it. A strange warm feeling settled in her body. How long had she been neglecting it? Days, weeks even. She had barely stopped to eat on the road and she had developed a habit of pushing her magic too hard and ending up unconscious. That would have to stop.\n\nThe smell of warm meat cooking brought her focus. Dev was still keeping to the far side of the fire. The sidelong glances let her know he wasn't quite sure yet what to make of all this.\n\n\"Why were you at the soldiers' camp that morning?\" Anna asked, breaking the uncomfortable silence.\n\nDev looked like a child caught in the act. \"I just went to see if they were moving. I heard them in the morning and you were sleeping so heavily. I wanted to make sure we didn't lose them.\"\n\n\"And they spotted you?\"\n\nDev shifted a little. \"I may have made my presence known.\"\n\nAnna gave him a reproachful look. Dev looked away but his jaw tightened. \"You left me behind with that other soldier in the woods. You were going to leave me behind again when you went to these men. You are no older than I and yet you order me back like a child. I had a family before those men came through. I also want to see justice done.\"\n\n\"Did you see justice done?\" Anna asked, genuinely curious about how he felt.\n\n\"I saw magic done.\" He was still afraid of it, of her. \"I suppose it was punishment. The last man you cursed was condemned to die by the judge in Anthrosen not the day after. But why the magic and the cursing? Why not take their lives as they have taken others?\"",
        "She considered her answer carefully. \"I killed one of the men who had raped and killed my sister.\" Dev's eyes grew wide as she spoke. \"I had him on his knees and disarmed and he said something about how she had wanted him and the others. He was a horrible wretch of a human being, but I did not feel vindicated after killing him. I once thought of killing them all. But I know now that it would warp me into something closer to what they are. I was not a killer before that man. I am now. I will try not to be again.\"\n\nDev continued his wide-eyed stare as she finished. She moved to take the meat off the fire, barely taking the time to let it cool before she cut off a hunk of it and began to eat. She was still terribly hungry. She let Dev consider her cautionary tale. She could see he still had questions.\n\n\"Are you a witch?\" His voice was quiet again, maybe a bit afraid.\n\nAnna shook her head, her mouth full. Then she thought about it and shrugged. \"I don't know if I qualify,\" she said when she had swallowed. \"I was not born with magic and I didn't learn to acquire it. If simply possessing magic makes me a witch then I suppose I am.\" She leaned to take another bite.\n\n\"Then how did you get it?\" Did he sound eager? Anna paused. Her face turned dark and she looked away from the boy on the far side of the fire.\n\n\"That is not a story I can tell you. Suffice it to say I would not recommend it.\" She looked up at his hungry eyes; she saw his desire for it. \"I mean it, Dev. It is a curse that lives inside your body; it eats away at you. It causes more harm than good and opens up avenues of action that you are terrifyingly unprepared for.\" His look didn't change. \"I didn't learn to fight,\" she continued, hoping to get through to him. \"The magic moves my body when I am in battle. Had I learned over years, I would have the discipline to go along with the ability. Instead, I struck out at the first man I found and killed him without a thought. Nothing comes free.\"\n\nDev looked away from her but she could see she hadn't gotten through to him. She shook her head and kept eating. She should have just kept her mouth shut. Now he'd think magic was a glorious idea, a shortcut to being a super warrior. At least he seemed less afraid of her now. She watched him as he thought it over. She could seem him wrestling with the idea. Consequences, especially long term ones, had hardly been a deterrent for her. Why would he be any different?\n\n\"Is there anyone left on your farm?\" Anna asked.\n\nDev nodded absentmindedly. \"My cousin and his wife took over the lands, their farm is next to ours and they were spared the attack. They are keeping it for me if I return.\"\n\n\"Were you not intending on returning?\"\n\n\"I don't know if I can go back,\" he said darkly.\n\nAnna nodded. She knew that feeling. \"Do you still want to travel with me?\" she desperately wanted him to say yes.\n\nDev looked at her, a bit shocked really. \"I\u2014\" he stopped, unsure. He didn't want to be left behind and she was still a better bet than striking out alone, Anna reasoned. He was scared of her but smart enough to know that she was his best chance. She hoped he would reason his way to coming. \"I do.\"\n\nShe gave him a real smile then. \"Excellent, you can finally tell me what happened to the sea maiden who loved the sun,\" she said referring to a tale he'd been dragging out for days.\n\nHe hesitated and smiled back, \"I'm afraid it doesn't end well.\"\n\nShe gave a theatrical sigh. \"The sun is a poor choice of a partner.\"\n\nCh. 6\n\nCh. 6\n\nIt was three days before the god came to her. She had done as he bade, eating ravenously for days to restore her strength, never intentionally using the magic. She found that she couldn't quite turn it off completely. She still felt slightly disconnected from her actions when she hunted or read from the healer's book.\n\nShe was coming to understand that the magic was an entity apart from her, a strange passenger that was beneficial as much as it was an imposition. But, at the time, it was fully integrated into her body. At night she would try to feel for the magic inside her, to see where it ended and she began, but she found the space between her and it to be too small to sense properly. Dev continued to ask her sly questions about her magic, trying to catch her off guard. She remained completely opaque in response. She had already told him too much.\n\nFor two nights now she had slept badly, nervous and anticipating the arrival of the god. When she did fall into an uneasy sleep she had fractured, erotic dreams that left her unsatisfied and more anxious upon awaking in the morning without the nightly interruption. When he woke her on that third night, she almost felt relieved, or she would have if her heart hadn't immediately lodged itself in her throat and a familiar tightening hadn't settled in her lower belly.\n\nHe smiled knowingly and held out his hand. She took it and he whisked her off again. This time she found herself amongst ancient twisted trees with soft moss under her bare feet. The trees glowed white in the moonlight but also seemed to hold their own inner light, the way the god did. Anna looked around in wonder. This was the first time it occurred to her that he might be taking her rather far from her camp.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she asked, her voice hushed in reverence of the scene around her. She couldn't tear her eyes away from the twisting branches of the trees. They seemed to reach out and cradle each other in never ending loops.\n\n\"A personal favorite of mine.\"\n\nAnna turned back to look at the god. He looked less out of place here, more human. He released her hand and stepped into the ring of tree. She followed, nervous again at what was coming. He turned to face her and she saw something in his hand.\n\n\"What is that?\" she asked before she could stop herself.\n\n\"This,\" the god said, \"is for your punishment tonight.\" He held up a leather strap, about as thick as three of her fingers. Anna tried to suppress a shiver, of fear? Of anticipation?\n\n\"Why pain?\" she blurted out. Why was she suddenly talking so much? She bit her lip, wishing she would just keep her mouth shut instead of dragging this out.\n\n\"Why pain what?\" he asked her patiently, as a parent might talk to a curious child.\n\nAnna's cheeks burned at his tone. She felt small and stupid, human she supposed. \"Why pain as a punishment? Doesn't that seem a little...fanatical?\"\n\nThe god actually laughed. \"I'm impressed you chose to bring up theology with a deity.\" He gave her a real smile that made her knees wobbly. He was never this animated outside of her dreams. \"I suppose you are referring to the northern priests who whip themselves to purge themselves of their earthly sins?\" She nodded. \"They believe that in service to the Dark God they must punish their mortal forms. It is an idiocy but so is worshiping death. No one claimed northerners were the most rational lot.\"\n\nAnna was fascinated. \"So why are you punishing me with pain? Why choose what you've deemed an idiocy?\"\n\n\"Oh I didn't choose this, sweet girl,\" his tone had lost its playful edge. His face lost its smile. \"You did.\" Anna didn't understand. She looked up at him confused. \"The moment I came to you in that inn and found you with a knife sticking through your hand. You chose to punish yourself with pain for that man's life. I am simply making sure you don't mutilate yourself in the process.\"\n\nAnna rubbed the hand she had stabbed, flooded again with the horrible memories of that night. It felt like looking through someone else's eyes and feeling someone else's emotions. One moment she felt sure of herself, confident in her path and strong enough to handle the burden. Then Leonid would come for her and she would just break into tiny pieces inside. Shameful tears burned her eyes. He had told her to leave the self-pity behind and instead she seemed to be more susceptible than ever when he was around. But it was unfair that in the moments she was most vulnerable with him, she was also meant to be the strongest. Part of her desperately needed relief, some break from the constant shoring up of her defenses. She took a breath to refocus.\n\n\"So if I had chosen something else? Or not at all? What would you have done?\" She reminded herself not to seek what he was not willing to give. She felt better for it, putting her energy into the moment rather than worrying about what came before or might come after.\n\n\"Why so curious tonight?\" the god said. Anna took a breath, mustering some semblance of composure.\n\n\"Maybe it's just nice to hear you say more than just 'disrobe.'\" She gave him a wry smile that was miles more confident than she felt.\n\nHe returned the smile and then leaned in, his cheek passing hers with barely a breath of space between them. He was as close as possible without touching her. Anna's entire body felt like it was alive with the play of energies from his skin to hers. Her skin tingled, her mind suddenly completely blank except for the sound of her heart pounding. She was sure he could hear it from where he stood. His lips hovered right next to her ear so his voice went straight through her. \"Disrobe.\" It was hardly more than a whisper but it echoed through her head. She felt an undeniable shock of excitement. She bit her lip to keep from voicing her arousal. It was bad enough he knew her thoughts already.\n\nHe leaned back so they were facing each other and locked eyes with her as she slowly began to remove her shirt. Instinctually, she knew not to pull her eyes from his gaze. A small smile played on his lips as he watched her bare herself once again. When she was done, he let the silence and stillness fall on them again. This time she didn't fidget. It didn't feel oppressive as it had in the past. The still moment felt like a small caress before they began in earnest.\n\n\"Reach above you,\" the god said softly. His face had softened as he had sensed her calm. She didn't move her gaze and simply reached her hands above her head. Her fingers closed on what could only be the branches of a nearby tree. But they hadn't been there a moment ago. She gasped as she felt the wood move slowly around her fingers, growing down her hand to her wrists. It felt smooth and oddly warm. In her wonder she looked up to see the glowing branches twist around her hands and begin down her arms. In contrast to the ropes he had used before this was a soft touch on her skin, albeit an unmovable one as it held her fast. The branch pulled her up, stretching her arms till she was once again balancing on the balls of her feet against the soft moss floor.\n\nThe god brought his hand to her jaw, running his fingers to her chin. She looked at him, her eyes wide but unafraid. She knew what was coming. \n\n\"This is going to hurt,\" he said simply, no emotion at all behind his words.\n\n\"I know,\" she said, surprised her voice didn't waver. She was apprehensive of the pain but something had changed. She couldn't quite understand what.\n\n\"Next time you will be more careful.\" It wasn't a question or a command. Just simply stating it aloud.\n\nAnna nodded. The god brushed his thumb across the skin of her face once more and then moved behind her. Her breath got faster in anticipation. This was going to feel very different from the smaller whips he had used before.\n\nThe first blow stole her breath away. The strap was heavy and bruising; the pain it inflicted was deeper than anything she had experienced up until now. The strap had fallen across her shoulder blades, and it burned brightly across the bones. She choked on her gasp and tears stung her eyes. The next one came, directly below where the first had fallen, as though he were painting stripes down and across her back. She screamed then; the pain echoing through her body. Tears began to flow freely down her cheeks and her breath came in pants. Again he struck her and again she screamed. It hurt so much. The thickness of the strap meant he could hit her harder without fear of breaking the skin. The fourth came and she sobbed, twisting in her binds. She could just barely feel the branches' loving embrace as they moved further down her arms, cradling her as she grasped them for support.\n\nAgain and again the strap fell across her body, down her back and to her buttocks. She shrieked in agony when it struck her where her legs began. By the time he had finished with her thighs, she was whimpering. The branches had come down her arms and started across the back of her shoulders, cradling her head as it fell backwards. She lost her footing and slumped into their embrace.\n\nNo more blows came. The tree continued to move around her. She felt more branches grow down her sides. They slid between the places he had struck her back, twined themselves around her legs and under feet, offering their own support as her muscles gave out completely. She felt her legs spread, not of her own volition but the branches themselves separated her thighs. She gasped in pain, any movement awakening the strokes across her body to full, flaming misery. She closed her eyes, giving in, letting this strange scene take control. She had no desire to fight it.\n\nShe felt the cool evening air against her sex and gasped again. She was aroused? From that pain? It seemed impossible and yet there was no denying it. She felt a finger trace across her side, the branches moving out of the god's way to let him touch her. His hand smoothed over the tortured skin of her ass and she moaned in pain and fervent arousal. His fingers found her soaked sex. She gasped as he began to stroke her. Everything felt so impossibly sensitive to his touch. Her body was arched back towards his questing hand, the tree moving her for better access. His finger stroked around her clit bringing more moans from her lips. She was so close. All her energy focused towards whatever he was doing between her legs. His other hand came to her back, touching the raised welt at her shoulders as his mouth came down at the base of her neck, first in a gentle kiss and then a nipping bite. The shooting pain from his other hand, in contrast to the one doing such wonderful things to her sex burst the dam of the pressure growing inside her. Her body shook, and she cried out into the night.\n\nShe collapsed against the branches. Her eyes stayed closed, it seemed too much to try to open them. She felt the touch of his hand across her collarbone and she knew that he was standing before her. She felt the branches move her body again, turning her head to the side and baring her neck to him.\n\n\"Lovely,\" she heard him say. His mouth descended on her overly sensitive skin and she moaned again. The branches pushed her back so that her breasts thrust out, another offering to him. His mouth trailed kisses to her right nipple, his tongue dancing wicked circles around the aching nub. His lips closed on it and his teeth scraped her skin.\n\nAnna was lost in a sea of sensation. Nothing seemed to exist outside of what he was doing to her. A small part of her was scared to open her eyes lest it all be a dream. The pain in her back still radiated through her but the sharp distracting edges had faded and she could focus on his mouth moving down her stomach. The branches were still arranging her, offering up her body to his mouth.\n\nKisses trailed along the inside of her hip bone, right above her sex and again on her inner thigh. She groaned, the tree spreading her legs further. She was arched backwards, almost as though lying back on this strange bed of moving branches that held her tightly in place. How wonderful, she thought, that the very trees comply with his wishes.\n\nShe could almost feel his chuckle. \"No sweet, it's not me they are listening to.\" That wasn't right, was it? Her muddled mind could not grasp what he had said. All thoughts of trying to disappeared as his mouth descended on her wet slit.\n\nAnna's eyes snapped open. She was starting up at the clear night sky framed by the white branches in the grove. The trees had grown in, as if drawn to watch the spectacle. All of this barely registered with her. His tongue was drifting across her most intimate place. The sensations were overwhelming. She whimpered, confused. The gentle caress was almost painful against the overly sensitive skin. His lips closed on her bud and she convulsed. He moved down, laving her slit with the broad part of his tongue before returning to the apex, teasing more delightful sounds from her.\n\nShe was mad with pleasure. She twisted in the branches embrace. It was too much, but it wasn't enough. Something ached deep inside her, something that called out for satisfaction. His hands roughly grasped her ass, pulling her into his mouth with a growl and she was lost. The pain flared from the welts there and again she was spiraling into her orgasm. It seemed to go on forever, rocketing through her prone body, exciting every nerve in her body until she thought she might faint from all the parts of her calling out in ecstasy at once. He didn't stop either, dragging out her pleasure until it hurt, until she begged him to stop, and still he kept at it.\n\nAnna's eyes closed, her body jerked and stilled as he drew away from her. Lights danced in the darkness of her eyelids. She felt the branches lift her again, offering her to the god. She felt very far away as his arms closed around her and the branches receded. The pain in her back seemed to fade as she slipped further away, and the darkness closed in on her.\n\nLeonid stood for a moment, holding her limp form. He looked down at her tear stained cheeks and full red lips. Then he stepped through space back to her camp, pulling her clothing to follow. He laid her on her bedroll, intending to replace her clothes when a soft snore sounded out from the other side of the fire. His eyes narrowed at the boy. He looked back at Anna's naked form. He closed the bedroll over her and sent the clothes to the other side of the camp, folding them neatly over a log. Anna groaned softly in her sleep. She would be in pain tomorrow when she woke up. He crouched down, looking intently at her sleeping face as her frown softened and she drifted deeper. He brushed a lock of silky black hair from her face. And then he was gone.\n\n*\n\nPain worked its way into the peacefulness of sleep and Anna swiftly came to consciousness like a swimmer coming up for air. She gasped and jerked to sitting to relieve the pressure of her body weight on the lines of deep pain across her back. The ones on her ass called out loudly but she couldn't bring herself to move again. She bit her lip but she still whimpered. Despite the pain, and there was plenty of it, she felt this deep and satisfying peace at her center. Last night had been terrible and incredible. Her body seemed to agree. She grasped her bedroll to her naked chest, clenching it in her fingers. She was so distracted she didn't hear Dev until he dropped the firewood he had been collecting as he entered the camp.\n\nFrom where he stood he had a perfect view of the dark welts across her back, drawn in perfectly sloping lines across her body. Shock kept him still but he heard her whimper of pain and the daze broke. He rushed to her side.\n\n\"Gods, Anna, what happened?\" he breathed as he crouched next to her. Her eyes were squeezed tight, her lower lip white against her teeth and her hands were shaking. She opened her eyes, looking shocked, as if she'd forgotten he'd be there. She looked strangely embarrassed at her state. Unthinking, he brought his hand to her back in a comforting gesture. When his fingers hit her bruised flesh she gasped and jerked away.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" he coughed, holding his hands up in front of him. \"Sorry, I'm an idiot. Sorry.\"\n\nAnna shook her head and closed her eyes. She wanted to tell him it was okay, to stop apologizing, but it seemed like too much effort. She was mortified that he had seen her punishment, and worse that he had interrupted her rather lustful recollections from the night before. Suddenly the whole situation struck her as very funny. Here she was, naked as the day she was born, clutching her bedroll and suffering the pains of a morning after a punishment and Dev was apologizing. She started laughing; she couldn't help it. The strangeness of her life was either going to break her or she was going to start taking things in stride.",
        "\"Anna, are you okay?\" he said as she quieted down. She nodded again, giggling.\n\n\"Would you mind terribly grabbing my clothes for me?\" she gestured to the pile. Dev seemed to realize she was naked for the first time and leapt away from her as if she was on fire.\n\n\"Yeah, of course, sorry.\" He stuttered as he retrieved her clothes. He turned his back as she reached for the clothing. Moving was torturous, the feeling of the clothing against her skin was even worse. But the soreness she felt at her core felt better than she was willing to admit, even to herself. When she was finally fully dressed, she touched Dev's shoulder to let him know she was done. When he turned to face her, she couldn't quite make out the expression on his face. Was he pitying her? Was that concern or scorn? Maybe she was losing her touch for reading people\u2014too much time around the inscrutable god.\n\n\"What?\" she said, trying not to sound defensive and failing.\n\n\"Anna, come on,\" Dev gestured at her. \"What in the dark pits of hell happened to you?\"\n\nAnna looked down, ashamed and defensive. She didn't know what to tell him. She found she didn't want to explain herself or reveal the nature of her relationship with Leonid. She especially didn't want Dev's pity. So she lashed out at him.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" Her tone brokered no argument but Dev was not going to be put off so easily this time.\n\n\"I don't care. You can't expect me just to ignore the fact that you were obviously beaten at some point last night. Which can only mean something magical and horrible is happening because you went to sleep one way and woke up looking like my grandfather found you messing with his best horse. Which means that somehow, in the middle of the night, someone or something is doing that to you.\" He was practically shouting by the end of his little rant.\n\nAnna shook with anger, pouring all of her other emotions into fueling that fire. \"I agreed to bring you with me, against my better judgment, to try and give you the same kind of peace I was looking for. If you can't handle traveling with me then leave me be. Find your own way.\"\n\nDev looked at her, shocked to silence for a moment. \"You don't mean that.\"\n\n\"Like hell I don't. I'm sick of the way you look at me like I have three heads. I hate that you can't trust me after everything I've done for you. I'm sick of tiptoeing around you because I'm afraid you'll call me 'witch' and leave. So fine, leave, it'll give me peace of mind.\"\n\nDev's face closed, his emotions barely concealed under a mask of calm. \"I'm terribly sorry for worrying about your wellbeing. I will try not to show any concern for the almighty sorceress in the future.\"\n\nAnna sneered at him. \"Perfect. I'd hate for you to waste any pity on this freak.\"\n\nDev's mask slid a little. \"I can see we won't be able to ride today since your mysterious nighttime activities have made it impossible for you to do so much as don clothing without pain. Perhaps a little time apart would help.\" With that he turned on his heels, took his own bow and quiver and made for the woods without another word.\n\nAnna was left alone in the quiet camp, nothing to distract her from the pain blossoming across her back, ass and legs. Dev was right about one thing, she was not going to be riding today, maybe not even tomorrow. She reached out with her sight, something she had been avoiding for days as she had left her magic alone. The soldiers who had broken off from the main group seemed to have returned home, or of sorts. She was beginning to realize that the ones they had encountered up to this point seemed to be mercenaries, hired swords and criminals. There was still a core of about twenty-five men including commanding officers who were together, moving towards the seat of the government. She would get all the mercenaries first, then make a move on the capital.\n\nShe sighed, her shoulder slumped as she came back to her lonely spot in the camp. She should not have gotten so angry. She rubbed the back of her neck, wishing there was some way to lessen the ache in her body. She considered using her magic to heal the welts but it seemed like a poor choice, especially now that she was trying to keep the magic to a minimum. She sighed and turned to find something to eat. It was going to be a long day of nothing to do but wallow in her sorry state.\n\nAfternoon found her laying on her stomach, the only comfortable position, next to a deep river not far from their camp. She had set up lines for fish and taken the opportunity to relax her aching muscles. She heard Dev's footfall from far off. At first she was worried it might be someone else but his cautious shuffling was familiar to her at this point. His careful approach made her hope he had come to make peace. She wanted to apologize to him for her anger but she couldn't tell him anymore than she already had about who she was and why her back was marked from strappings.\n\nHe cleared his throat a few paces from where she lay. She picked up her head to look at his awkward stance and shifting gaze and gave him a small smile, hoping it would be taken as the apology she couldn't seem to muster. He gave her a small smile in return and moved to sit nearby.\n\n\"Catch anything?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not yet, but they usually don't bite for a bit longer. The sun is still pretty high.\"\n\nDev nodded and glanced at her. She propped herself up on her elbows, ignoring the twinges of pain from her back in this position. \"You?\"\n\nHe nodded, gesturing to three rabbits strung on his pack. Silence fell between them again. Anna chewed her lip, trying to figure out if she should say something else and coming up with nothing. Dev seemed to take a breath as if about to say something but then letting it out in a sort of a sigh.\n\nHe did it a third time and Anna finally had enough. \"What is it?\" she tried to sound patient.\n\n\"I have something for you if you want.\" He said this very quickly. He reached into the sack on his belt and pulled out a dark green herb. The smell hit her hard. She knew it from the tea her mother used to make her drink when she was sick. It was a sharp, cool smell that brought back, most painfully, the memories of being a child, cared for and loved. Her heart lurched and she felt her chest tighten around it.\n\n\"My grandfather was pretty generous with the lash when I was a boy and I was always ending up on the receiving end of one thing or another. My sister used to make a paste to put on the bruises and it helps something wonderful. If you want I can make some for you.\" He was talking rather fast and low. Anna nodded quietly, working on the lump in her throat. Dev gave her a relieved smile and made his way down to the water. He returned with a large flat stone and a slightly smaller, smooth one that would serve as his pestle and he set to works grinding the herbs into an aromatic paste, mixing in the smallest amount of clay from the riverbed to make it all stick. He kept talking, telling her stories of his childhood mischief and the subsequent punishments he'd receive. Anna let his stories run into one another without stopping him. Where she dealt with the pain of loss by speaking as little as possible about her family, Dev seemed to take great comfort in recalling every last detail about his childhood.\n\nWhen he was done with the paste, he gestured to her back. Anna shyly drew her shirt up to her shoulders to reveal the stark marks she knew were there. She had only been able to see the ones on her behind and legs but she knew the dark bruising on her back was probably worse. Dev gave a low whistle when he saw them up close. \"Not a bad set. My grandfather would have been proud,\" he said, a grand attempt at levity.\n\nAnna resumed her prone position, keeping her shirt under her breasts while she lowered her body back to the cool ground. Dev moved next to her, but she turned her head in the other direction to hide her embarrassment from him. She didn't want to bare herself to him again but there was a greater need inside of her, one that had been stirred by the smell of his herbs.\n\nShe wanted, just for a moment, to be taken care of. She wanted someone to care about her wellbeing for no other reason than that she was another human in pain\u2014not because she was owned or because she was a means to an end, but just because she deserved that kindness. She'd wanted it from Leonid, strange though it was to seek comfort from the creature who inflicted the pain, because he was the only one who truly knew her. But he hadn't offered, and Dev had. She didn't want to show Dev this neediness but she wasn't ashamed enough to turn down his offer.\n\n\"This may hurt a bit,\" he warned as his green tipped fingers hovered above her back. She gave him a nod and he tried to spread the salve as gently as possible. Anna still hissed when he made contact. He knew all too well how it felt, the stinging coolness of the herbs against the aching flesh was not altogether pleasant. He worked quietly, trying to be gentle and cautious of her modesty. Despite the marks he was all too aware that he was in direct contact with her naked back, something he tried not to focus on too much as it tended to distract him.\n\nAnna for her part was giving herself over to the gentle touch on her back. The kindness of his gesture and the effectiveness of the salve were working wonders. As she had with Leonid, she was getting better at giving herself over to the moment. The stresses of her journey were wearing out her stony resolve to be tight lipped and stoic about the entire venture. More than once she unconsciously leaned into Dev's hand. He noticed and his tentative application became less guarded as he smoothed the herbs over her skin.\n\nBy the time he finished her back, Anna felt like a cat that had been scratched in all the right places. She stretched out languidly, ignoring the untreated marks on her ass and thighs. She sighed happily.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Anytime,\" he said, removing his touch. Anna felt the loss of his contact.\n\nThey were both silent for a moment, when a splashing sound caught their attention for the first time. All three lines had caught while Dev had been working on her back. She sat up and gave Dev a satisfied smile. \"Seems like today wasn't a total loss.\"\n\nDev laughed. \"Well if you can't ride, you must eat.\"\n\nThe two fell into an easy rhythm of the camp, cleaning and preparing their haul for the day\u2014some of it was going to be packed for the road but much of it was consumed. Anna had realized that she could easily put away as much food as Dev could if not more. Now that she was aware of the hunger the magic created, it seemed like her body clamored for food whenever she thought to eat.\n\nThat night, tucked tightly into her bedroll, Anna smiled a little as she slipped into sleep.\n\nShe was walking along the edge of a vast lake. Her bare feet made their way over the soft round stones at the shore. She was wearing a long white shift that clung to her legs as she walked into the water up to her knees. She was looking across the expanse, trying to make out the other side. It seemed to her that there was something she should be doing. The warmth of late summer wrapped around her. She had always loved this time of year. While some found the humidity oppressive, Anna had always loved how the evenings seemed to caress her with the heavy air. The water at her feet was wonderfully warm as well. It was a perfect night.\n\n\"Another peaceful place,\" a voice from her side sounded out in the darkness. The god's form moved next to her, very close. She turned to look up at his dark face. She gave him a languid smile.\n\n\"I was feeling peaceful,\" she said simply.\n\n\"How strange. I thought you only called me up when you were feeling blue.\" His tone was teasing.\n\n\"I wasn't aware I'd invited you here,\" she teased back. Had she though? She remembered wishing for the hot air, the lake and the water but not him.\n\n\"I suppose it's rude to intrude.\" He made no move to leave. Anna smiled again.\n\n\"So why did I call you up?\" she asked, turning back to the expanse of water. Leonid shrugged. Anna laughed. \"You are supposed to speak my mind! How can you not know?\" She asked.\n\n\"I suppose because you don't know,\" the god said. He moved behind her, wrapping his powerful arms around her and her body relaxed into his. His chin rested against her temple as she settled against him. A strange sort of heat began in her body. She was at once comfortable and all too aware of the touch of their bodies.\n\nHis hands traveled over her arm, up to her jaw line. She let him tilt her face up to his. His lips descended on hers and her body shuddered slightly in his arms. She twisted around so she could face him more fully, equally engaging his lips with hers. She opened her mouth slightly and he followed, slipping his tongue against her lips, drawing hers out. She brought her hands to his face, pulling him towards her. She unabashedly molded her body to his and his hands stroked her back, down her bottom. For a moment they stayed there, knee deep in water, two bodies pressed desperately against each other.\n\nLeonid slid his hands lower, grabbing her and pulling her against him off her feet as he kneaded her flesh. She made hungry sounds in the back of her throat. Instinctively she wrapped her legs around him as he bore them back to shore. She didn't break their kiss the entire way. He lowered her down on a soft patch of grass, hands free to roam her body again. She moaned into his mouth as his palm smoothed over her breast, the hard nipple pressing into his hand. His fingers drew lazy circles around the nub, not really making contact but making her shiver deliciously.\n\nShe tightened her legs around him, pulling him into her. She became aware of a hard ridge between his legs that was lining up directly with her rapidly dampening core. In her waking life she would have been nervous at the promise of penetration but in her dream state this was welcome. She had been aware that though the god had forced her pleasure on her, he had never taken his own with her. She assumed it was because he saw her as little more than a mortal plaything. Now, in her dream, she could live out what she wanted\u2014mutual pleasure, some sort of partnership in the act, instead of the constant anxiety of his domination over her.\n\nTheir clothing seemed to melt away from their bodies and Anna was lost in the feeling of his mouth on her neck and chest. His hands seemed to find the exact places she needed to be touched. But she didn't want his hands or mouth now. She brought her hands to his cheeks and brought his mouth back to hers. She tightened her legs around him and pressed her wet slit against the head of his manhood. She didn't need to beg, or push. Here she got what she wanted.\n\nWhen he slid inside her it felt like a hole she hadn't known was there was finally being filled. It was overwhelming. She kissed him more urgently as he surged inside her. His hand stroked her side, down to her ass and he pulled her against him, filling her further, moving her body with his. Anna brought her hands to his shoulders and she clung to him as he moved. She found his rhythm and soon was moving along with him. The humid air filled with their mutual moans. When she climaxed, she felt as though the warmth of the night was flowing in as she breathed, pulling her back into the darkness of sleep as the pleasured high went on and on, like the echo of a bell ringing through her mind.\n\nAnna woke with a sigh. Her eyes opened to the dawn-grey forest, the cool air promising the autumn's arrival in the coming weeks. She felt strangely contented after the dream. She closed her eyes again. She might have even tasted happiness for a brief moment. It wasn't until she had dressed and begun to prepare to ride out that she realized that she wasn't in any pain. The marks from her punishment had faded to nothing in the night.\n\n***<br> <br> So finals are upon me. Med school is such a drag. I hope this is a good leaving off point. I'll be back in a few weeks.<br> <br> I'd be very interested from you, dear readers, to hear how you feel about this transition. What do you think of Anna and Leonid's development? Did it feel like a natural progression? Also how do you feel about Dev? Annoying? Interesting counterpoint? Just friends? Comment or email me. I've progressed with them but I'm open to suggestions."
