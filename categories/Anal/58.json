        "So what do you want to do for Fathers Day this weekend?\" she asked directly, hoping to get some hint or inkling about a way to make his day special. \"Any plans or presents in mind?\"\n\n\"I don't know, babe, whatever seems good,\" he responds, pre-exasperated by the conversation. He sees her face, at once sad and disappointed, so he tries again. \"Go to dinner at the steak place? Or do something fun with the kids? I really don't care. I just want to make it easy, no stress.\" He's always worried about others, rarely indulging himself.\n\n\"Come on, Miles. That's it? You don't want ANYTHING else? Golf day with the boys? Really expensive bottle of bourbon? Sunday morning blowjob?\" she kids, trying to disrupt the placating mood.\n\n\"Yeah...,\" he says with a roll of his eyes as he turns from the bathroom sink to enter the closet. She loves to say things like that to disrupt his quiet and conservative nature. He's at his least comfortable when she pushes this button.\n\n\"Ok, so no golf, no steak, and no blowjob. Got it.\" she sarcastically hollers through the wall. She waits for a response but hears nothing. She squints with a determined look, devilish plans racing through her mind.\n\nShe drops her bath robe, stands naked in the hallway, and then struts quickly into the closet where Miles is dressing. He catches a glimpse of her curves, her pale breasts and bottom, and the small tuft of hair nestled shyly below. She walks to her clothes, deliberately taking longer just to tease him. His response is to ignore, which is challenging given her beauty and body. Even after two kids in the last six years, she's still gorgeous and sexy from head to toe. He's buttoning his shirt when she turns around to face him, her in a black thong and nothing else.\n\n\"So...you can't think of anything you want for Fathers Day?\" She steps toward him, begging for some response to this blatant proposition. He leans down, kisses her forehead, and smiles.\n\n\"Surprise me?\"\n\nNow it's her turn to roll her eyes and walk away. \"Ok, well don't say I didn't try,\" and she departs for the bathroom again.\n\nMiles scolds himself for not saying something or doing something to show his love and lust for her. But something in him always blocks his most primal impulse. It's a blend of embarrassment and awkwardness, or a lack of confidence. Maybe all of the above. \n\nThough they've enjoyed a satisfying sex life during their time together, it fundamentally depends on Elayna to initiate their interaction. She's a bold, strong, confident woman who knows what she wants, asks for what she likes, and makes no apologies for any of it. This was a fundamental reason he was attracted to her over 10 years ago. He found her voice and posture alluring, so brazen in a sea of meek young women. She cursed like a sailor, loved to play sports, yet could rock an evening gown with the best of the beauty queens. She was everything a guy like Miles could want.\n\nSimilarly, Elayna found Miles cute and a touch mysterious. He was quiet but spoke with a sharp intellect and quick wit. He had no idea how attractive he was, physically, which made him even more desirable. Among the cocky, self-absorbed young professionals in the city, Miles's understated presence actually made him stand out even more. She had no interest in flashy cars, fancy business cards, or elaborate vacation stories; she wanted a real, genuine man.\n\nBack in the bathroom, Elayna dresses for work, a tiny annoyance lingering in her mind. Speaking to herself, she struggles to resolve what took place. \"Standing there naked basically begging him to fuck me, and nothing? I know he likes that thong, but nothing? Ugh, he's something else.\" She decides to let it roll off of her, knowing her being angry won't make anything better. Miles comes back to the bathroom, fully dressed in his classic shirt and tie for work. He's a handsome man, just over six feet, dark wavy hair, enticing blue eyes, and a bicyclist's body\u2014lean in parts, strong in his arms and legs, and just enough cushion in the middle to be real. His love handles might be her favorite body part, a testament to his love for dessert and the perfect cushion to snuggle. Taking in the scenery, she almost ignores him talking to her.\n\n\"'Layna? Layn?\" he ponders as she seems spaced out.\n\n\"Oh, sorry. What?\"\n\n\"Want me to get the girls up?\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll get dressed. There should be cereal and stuff in the kitchen. And they\u2014\"\n\n\"\u2014they like Thomas the Train. I know, Layna,\" he smirks at her. After all he was the one who got them into the train show. Miles leaves the room and heads down the hall.\n\nInto Mia's room he goes, slowly opening the door to find her sleeping soundly without blankets or pillows. She's a restless sleeper, like her mom, and makes a mess of her covers each night. Although she's almost seven years old, Miles still enjoys picking her up, hugging and holding her as she wakes. She stretches and yawns, then rubs her eyes.\n\n\"Hi, Daddy,\" Mia mumbles.\n\n\"Hey, Sweetie. Good morning. Let's get your sister, then head downstairs.\" Mia stretches as she wakes and Miles lowers her to the floor. She stands wobbly as he opens the door to the jack-and-Jill bathroom that connects the girls' rooms. Mia shuffles along, holding her small blanket close to her.\n\nUpon entering Grace's room, Miles sees her buried among the dozens of stuffed animals on her bed. He reaches down to pluck her from the pile, and he cradles her on his chest, not a care in the world about a wrinkled shirt or tie. He leans up, turns to verify that Mia is still with him, and he steps to the door and then down the stairs. Grace doesn't wake at the jostling, and Mia holds his hand down the stairs. It's at this moment that Elayna comes from the bedroom in her pantsuit, her high heels flopping in one hand. She stops for a moment and relishes the view of Miles and the girls.\n\nHe's an amazing dad. Everything he does for the girls seems perfect. He feeds them, bathes them, plays with them, reads with them, and prays with them. Rarely has she ever seen a man so ensnared with his children. Elayna has felt the twinge of jealousy a few times when Miles invests so much of himself in the girls. It's almost like she is the least important part of his life, and that feeling stings. Consciously she knows he loves her, they love each other, and their marriage is strong. But she can't help but wonder how much space he keeps for her after work and these girls. Even this morning, he seemed unaffected by her gesture of intimacy, almost in a hurry to wake up the girls instead. She shakes loose these negative impulses and again takes in the sight of her husband loving on their kids.\n\nHer heart swells as he settles on the couch with them. Miles is silly and funny and sweet, giggling with them before turning on the tv. \"Thomas!\" the girls yell as he changes the channel to their favorite show. Transfixed by the television, the girls all but ignore Miles, so he stands and heads to the kitchen. Elayna watches the girls from the stairs above, her smile bright and loving. She hears Miles fumbling things in the kitchen and decides to go help.\n\nDown the stairs and across the den to the kitchen, she asks, \"Need any help with breakfast?\"\n\n\"Uh...maybe cups and milk,\" Miles replies. He's pouring Cheerios into little bowls, slicing a banana, and grabbing napkins. The food assembled, Miles carries it back to the den. Elayna fills two straw cups with milk and follows him. The girls settle at the coffee table with their snacks and drinks, taking little notice of their parents now that Thomas and Friends are chugging along. Miles wipes Grace's face and puts napkins next to each bowl. He steps back to let the girls enjoy their show, and turns to go back in the kitchen. Elayna does the same, and she quickens her pace to catch him at the pantry.\n\n\"Hey,\" she says, grabbing his hand and pulling him around toward her. He's puzzled and curious why she's doing this. Elayna moves in closer and wraps her arms around his waist. \"I...love you, honey,\" she speaks softly to him. \"You're such an amazing dad, and we are so blessed to have you. That's why I really want to celebrate you this weekend.\" Her eyes plead with him.\n\n\"I love you too, babe, and the girls. You three are my whole life. And that's why I don't really need things or events because I have everything I want right here.\" He speaks plainly and earnestly, his words precise and meaningful. \"I promise, I don't need a big deal. Anything you do is going to be great, so just surprise me.\"\n\n\"Anything? You mean that?\"\n\n\"Of course! Unless it involves snakes or sitting in a sauna with your dad,\" he grins.\n\n\"Hahaha,\" she laughs at him. \"Well, I HAD planned a snake sauna with my dad, but I guess that's cancelled!\" He pulls her in tightly and hugs her with a truth to his love.\n\n\"Daddy!\" Mia yells. \"More O's!\" Miles pulls back from Elayna, kisses her briefly, and grabs the box of Cheerios. Elayna watches him again, kneeling at the coffee table, sprinkling cereal in their bowls, checking their hands for sticky messes, and picking up the errant O's on the floor.\n\n\"God I love that man,\" she tells herself. A warmth rises in her, her chest and neck turning pink as she feels a trickle of sweat roll down her side. Elayna's body excites quickly and intensely, and her breathing becomes rapid. The tingle deep in her stomach tells her how much she wants him. Now.\n\nDropping her heels on the rug, she paces quickly to the den, her urge to be close to him unstoppable. Down on her knees next to him, she extends her hand to rub his thigh, a simple but pointed gesture.\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" Grace chirps, looking down at her shirt.\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" Miles says in response before reaching a napkin across to blot the milk that Grace dribbled down her shirt. His attention is solely on Grace, his body unaware of Elayna's gentle strokes of his thigh. Recognizing the girls are fine with their good and the show is rolling the credits, he stands and announces, \"Time to get dressed and brush teeth. On your mark...get set...GO!\" and the girls spring free to the stairs, squealing and laughing as Miles chases and pinches them gently. All three of them tumble upstairs, thundering steps into the bedrooms and bathroom. Elayna doesn't even need to follow because she knows Miles has it covered. He will get them dressed in cute clothes, brush their teeth, and put their hair in ponytails for the day. He's just that good at parenting. She marvels, again, at how lucky her girls are to have a man so invested in them. Most husbands and dads in their neighborhood are minimally interested in their children, especially daughters. Miles is a special breed, for sure. But what can she do to make him FEEL special and loved?\n\nShe packs the lunches, changes the litter box and feeds the cat, then packs her backpack for work. Miles and the girls return, dressed and ready for their day. Elayna inspects the girls, their matching outfits and hair bands neatly in place. Hugs and kisses follow as they all head to the garage. Both girls climb into Miles's Honda SUV as Elayna blows kisses and waves goodbye from her sleek BMW. And so their day begins.\n\nA slow day in the office, Elayna's mind is scattered, unable to focus on a task for more than a few minutes. Her thoughts drift back to Miles, this morning, and the weekend ahead. She is compelled to do something unique and special for him, but she just can't find the right plan. He doesn't love gifts because he truly doesn't want for anything. Finally she decides to text him. Maybe bug him enough for him to disclose something useful.\n\n. . .\n\nHow's work?\n\n. . .\n\nPretty good. All the permits went thru for the festival.\n\n. . .\n\nThat's great! Happy?\n\n. . .\n\nRelieved. I'll be happy when it's over. Everyone blames the city manager when things go wrong so I'm holding on tight until next month.\n\n. . .\n\nIt will be fun and fabulous. You're the best city manager ever!\n\n. . .\n\nThanks :-)\n\n. . .\n\nAnd the hottest one too\n\n. . .\n\nHow work for you?\n\n. . .\n\nBlah. Jim is out all week. He's at some CEO thing in NY. No new accounts so I'm just killing time in my office thinking about YOU!\n\n. . .\n\nAwww\n\n. . .\n\nSpeaking of you, can you please give me some ideas about this weekend? Puleeeeeeze!?!?!\n\n. . .\n\nI told you, I don't need anything. Really\n\n. . .\n\nDammit, Miles! Your killing me hear!\n\n. . .\n\nYou're a bad speller when you're mad \ud83d\ude1c\n\n. . .\n\nUgggggghhhhhhh\n\n. . .\n\nOk ok. How about this: what I really really really want is...\n\n. . .\n\nYessssss?? \n\n. . .\n\nTo do whatever will make you super happy!\n\n. . .\n\nOmg you r the worst\n\n. . .\n\nHear me out: I love doing things with and for you and the girls. It's my favorite thing in the world. So what would make ME happiest is if you let me do something that you will absolutely love. Not a private plane to Paris or anything, but whatever you've always wanted to do that will bring you (and me) lots of joy. Make sense?\n\n. . .\n\nI guess so. I really wish I could buy you a new putter or play with your putter as a present. Now I have to think about myself as a gift for you? That's weird.\n\n. . .\n\nWell it's what I want. Deal?\n\n. . .\n\nDeal. But no exceptions, no backing out, no complaining about it. What I decide is what we are going to do. Ok?\n\n. . .\n\nMy only veto is sauna/snakes/Tom.\n\n. . .\n\nLol. I know\n\n. . .\n\nOk then we are good. Gotta run. Mayors office beckons.\n\n. . .\n\nOk, love you\n\n. . .\n\nLove you too\n\nSo that's it: she has to find something she really wants so he can be happy that she's happy. \"This is so fucked up,\" she thinks to herself. Thoughts pop in her head like popcorn, each one darting in a different direction.\n\nAmusement park?\n\nBowling?\n\nLong bike ride in the forest?\n\nTake the girls to a movie and lunch?\n\nHotel room for the two of us?\n\nDinner date with couples?\n\nThey've done all of these things before, and none of them would make anyone super happy. Now what?\n\n\"What do I want? What do I like? What would I like to do more than anything?\" As she considers the questions, she snickers to herself a bit thinking, \"I like...sex? No, I LOVE having sex more than just about anything else.\"\n\nElayna has always possessed a strong sexual quality. Not slutty or showy, but a deep desire for physical connection and pleasure. Like most young girls, she discovered her body when she was a pre-teen. After puberty hit, she became more adventurous, experimenting with herself to learn what felt good. Early boyfriends with fumbling, aggressive hands were no match for her own, their ability to coax rich feelings from deep within her. By the time she was truly sexually active, Elayna knew exactly how she wanted to be touched, and she would clearly direct and command her partners accordingly. Most willingly agreed to follow her lead, often being rewarded with her vocal and physical enthusiasm. Well into college and after a couple of long-term boyfriends, she learned to love partnered sex almost as much as her solo sessions.\n\nWhen she met Miles, one could say she was very experienced and open about her desires, which was the perfect match for his inexperience and wish to make her happy. She taught him, and he relished learning every way to please her. He never imagined he would marry someone with such passion.\n\n\"So maybe that's it: we will have the wildest romp in our lives. It makes me very happy, which should make him feel the same way.\" Her inner monologue continues. Her office phone rings to snap her out of these thoughts. She buries the issue for now, knowing she more time to craft her plan.\n\nLater that night, after the girls are asleep, Elayna sits in bed with her laptop open on her legs. She's shopping, clicking and scanning at a furious pace before Miles arrives in bed for the night. She seeks new lingerie for the weekend. Her closet has its fair share of slinky, lacy, silky ensembles, but she craves a bold, exciting addition to make an impression on Miles. Victoria's Secret has lots of soft and sexy pieces, but they feel a little...safe? Elayna's urge takes her to Fredericks of Hollywood where she starts to narrow her focus to a corset. It's unlike anything she has in her closet, and she tingles at the thought of how sexy she will feel wearing it. Browsing the styles and prices, she settles on a black corset, see-through in parts, with garter straps at the bottom. \"That's hot,\" she tells herself.\n\nBefore she completes the transaction, Elayna decides to search the full internet for similar styles and maybe lower prices. Entering \"black corset\" into the search engine brings a host of sites, some more adult-oriented. Intrigued by some of the images, she clicks different links, one of which takes her to an adult toy store. The lingerie selection is limited and cheap, but she gets distracted by the ads for all types of sex toys. She's owned a couple of vibrators over the years, and she and Miles have enjoyed using them together. A new toy or two might add another layer of excitement to her plan, so she clicks through pages and pages of toys.\n\nA little overwhelmed by the choices, she starts with a bullet vibrator, simple and strong. She had one years ago but lost it in a move. Wireless and rechargeable sounds useful so she adds it to her cart. She then clicks through the selection of dildos. Most look a bit scary and too large, so she scrolls to find one that seems like a better match. Given that she and Miles used one together in the past, Elayna doesn't think another one will intimidate Miles because he's already got the worlds most perfect penis\u2014the exact shape, size, texture, and look that should be in a textbook of penises. Truly the best in the world, or at least compared to all the dicks she's known. Elayna decides that a Tantus silicone dildo looks about right. With two toys in her online shopping cart, she's about ready to check out when she sees a tab for \"Anal Toys.\" Her heart beats faster and a warm curiosity rises within her. She clicks on the tab and waits for the page to load. She and Miles had a boozy night several years ago where she told him he could have her ass. But without preparation or the lube necessary to make it work, they abandoned the idea. He's touched her soft, tight flesh more than a few times, and she likes the feeling, so an anal toy might be a fun adventure they can share. Elayna surveys all the options and thinks, \"wow, so many shapes, and styles, and colors for things to stick in your butt!\" She laughs to herself and then refocuses on the screen. Reading about the products and scanning reviews, she decides that two options\u2014a petite black silicon plug and a heavier metal plug\u2014would be fun to try. She imagines both inside her and shivers with excitement. With her previous experience fresh in her mind, she knows she should buy a bottle of lube, and there are several recommended on the page of anal toys. She opts for the most popular water-based version and adds it to the cart.\n\nAll set to complete the transaction on the Checkout page, she sees an add at the bottom of the page for, \"Couples Toys.\" Unsure if it would include anything she's not already viewed, she clicks the add. The new window opens to cock rings, strap ons, and some fairly traditional vibes and dongs, until she sees nipple clamps, restraints, handcuffs, and blindfolds. She remembers the \"Fifty Shades\" phenomenon, but when she and Miles watched the movie, he didn't seem that excited. The thought of being tied up appeals to her, given that it's something they've never done. \"Maybe...I think...oh hell, why not\" she mumbles as she adds several more items to her cart\u2014soft cuffs, handcuffs, bed straps, and a blindfold. A host of items in the cart, are peruses the checkout screen to determine the damage. It's not as bad as she thought, and she completes the transaction after adding express shipping. Knowing she hadn't finished buying her corset, she returns to the lingerie site, and buys that as well. Elayna plans the shipments to arrive in plenty of time for her to make sure the plan is in place.",
        "\"Working?\" Miles asks as he walks in the room to find Elayna on her laptop. Startled just a bit, she folds the screen down and looks up at him.\n\n\"Not really. Just shopping for a few things,\" she smiles and turns to put the computer on the night stand next to her.\n\n\"Hopefully you ordered more socks for the girls because we are losing the battle with those in the laundry room,\" he adds as he walks to the master bathroom.\n\n\"Ok,\" she responds, a touch giddy bc he has no idea what she's been shopping for. She leans back on the bed and turns off the table light. It's dark in the room save for electric blue light coming from the bathroom. She inches under the covers, the knowledge of her shopping spree making her giddy. Miles returns from the bathroom, ready for bed. He slides between the sheets and scoots close to snuggle with Elayna. Their warm bodies intertwined, her skin warming to his touch. She's perfectly comfortable and content to drift to sleep with the man of her dreams.\n\nAwake the next morning, Miles and Elayna proceed through their daily routines. Showers, dressed for work, up with the girls, off to work and school. What could seem mundane to many is quite the opposite for Elayna since she knows what awaits them. She still has to get her shipments, arrange for the kids to stay with their aunt and cousins on Saturday night, and get Miles out of the house in the afternoon.\n\nAnother slow day at work with the boss out of town, Elayna spends time calling and texting those who, unknowingly, are going to help her plans.\n\n. . .\n\nHey Dave. Melanie said you were up for golf with Miles on Sat. Still good to go? Any idea where you may go and when?\n\n. . .\n\nHi, yes I'm good for golf on Sat. T time is 12:00 at Twin Oaks. He needs to meet at my house around 10. Ok?\n\n. . .\n\nPerfect, thank you!\n\nRelieved that she has Miles out of the house for Saturday afternoon, she now needs to set the plans for the girls.\n\n\"Liz!\" Elayna speaks into her phone. Her sister is one of her best friends, and her kids are only a year apart from Mia and Grace. It makes for easy \"cousin nights\" when parents have plans. She traded texts with Liz in the early stages of her plan, so she just needs to fix the details.\n\n\"Hey! You never call from work. What's up?\" Liz seems worried, sensing a problem.\n\n\"Work is slow, and I'm trying to be sure Saturday is all set. Can I bring the girls in the morning?\" Elayna almost pleads, hopefully.\n\n\"Sure. We will be home so just bring them over whenever. It's going to be great, so ya'll don't worry and have some fun. What are you guys doing, anyway?\" Liz hasn't heard any details about Elayna's plan, and she curious.\n\nElayna knows she can't tell Liz the total truth so she just adds, \"oh, you know. Hotel room downtown, nice dinner, champagne.\"\n\n\"You buy new underwear?\" Liz teases.\n\n\"Liz, that's just\u2014\"\n\n\"Ah-ha! You did buy new underwear! Well I hope it works out well for you both,\" she she laughs into the phone. Elayna gets a little annoyed but relaxes at the ribbing.\n\n\"Yeah yeah yeah. At least my kids won't catch US in the middle of things!\" She fires back at her sister. She's upped the ante with that one.\n\n\"True. It was a funny story, though,\" she adds with a giggle.\n\n\"I know. Anyways, we will see you in the morning, ok!\"\n\n\"Sounds good, love you\"\n\n\"You too, and thank you, and Elayna hangs up her phone. The pieces are in place!\n\nHome from work early on Friday, Elayna spies a group of boxes by the front door. The girls are chatting and singing in the back seat and take no notice of the packages. Into the garage and then the kitchen, Elayna prepared a bowl of fruit for the girls to share. She's a bit frantic, trying to settle the girls so she can get the boxes upstairs and out of sight before Miles gets home.\n\n\"Grapes and berries,\" she announces as they girls clap and smile. She turns on the tv, funds some cartoons, and then adds, \"Mia, I'm going to get the laundry upstairs. Keep an eye on your sister, please. And no messy messes on the table or floor, ok?\"\n\n\"Ok, Mommy.\" Mia is so wonderful and responsible as the older sister. She's been Grace's best friend and guide since day one. Elayna beams with pride as she steps out of the kitchen and to the front door.\n\nOne, two, three, four small boxes and a soft envelope package. Barely holding them together, she hustles upstairs to the master closet. She tears into the boxes and stashes the receipts in a small suitcase. Taking inventory, she has everything she ordered and prepares to add it all to the suitcase, but she stops for a moment to inspects her new toys. She clicks the bullet, and it vibrates to life, surprising Elayna. She feels the buzzing in her hand, then holds it to her arm. Pausing for a second she ponders...and then slides it lower, between her legs, just to see. Another surprise awaits as the vibrations penetrate her pants and underwear, a mounting swell of pleasure bringing a smile to her face. Sending the excitement rising, her mouth is agape, and she has just enough will power to withdraw and silence the device before exhaling an emphatic \"WOW!\" She picks up the other objects, looking at each closely. She smiles at the pale skinned dildo and feels a bit naughty holding the butt plugs. Satisfied and thrilled with her purchases, she adds them to the suitcase.\n\nThe final soft package has her corset and bondage gear. She takes a closer look at these to be sure nothing is in disrepair. She holds up the corset and her face is flushed red, all of her energy radiating warmth throughout her body. She thinks this will do wonders for their night, and she has stockings and heels that will go perfectly with them. Overwhelmed with anticipation, she knows she has to put all of this aside now, but she can hardly wait to dig into this suitcase again tomorrow.\n\nBack downstairs, the girls are still at the table watching tv. Mia sees her mom enter the kitchen and shouts, \"No messy messes!\" Both girls show their clean bowls and hands. Elayna claps for them, and the girls do the same. Amid the cheers, they hear the garage door open. \"Daddy's home,\" Grace shouts and jumps down from the chair. As Miles rounds the corner, the girls barrel into his legs, hugging him and giggling wildly. Elayna takes her time in her approach, leaning forward to kiss Miles. He starts to pull away from the brief kiss, but Elayna leans in more and deploys a heavier set of lips for the kiss. She finally withdraws and smiles.\n\n\"Well hello there,\" he says, at once surprised and delighted. He then squats down to collect his kids in his arms to carry them to the couch. Elayna catches herself again, admiring his dedication to the girls. He deserves so much, and she can't wait to surprise him tomorrow.\n\nUp early on Saturday morning, Elayna keeps Miles asleep as she hustles downstairs with the girls, careful not to make much noise. She has already packed their stuff for the overnight at Liz's, so she's simply enjoying time with her kids. They help her make a big breakfast that Miles will enjoy\u2014pancakes, bacon, fruit, coffee. The girls are giddy with excitement to showcase their effort this morning, and with the signal, Elayna sends them upstairs to wake him. Listening from the kitchen, she hears their thundering stampede up the steps and down the hall. A pause and then a thud (one of them bumping the door), she can sense the squeals are about to begin. And they do\u2014both of them howling with delight and some subtle howls from Miles too. A minute later Mia and Grace are dragging Miles by the arms, tugging him downstairs for breakfast.\n\nFinally on the kitchen, the yell, \"Happy Fathers Day\" and hop around the table covered with dishes and piles of food.\n\n\"Wow, this is so great!\" Miles says, leaning down to kiss both girls on the head. He smiles and winks at Elayna, knowing she orchestrated most of it.\n\n\"I helped do the pancakes,\" Mia says proudly.\n\n\"I did the fruit salad,\" Grace adds sweetly.\n\n\"You both are super awesome for making me breakfast. And Mommy is the super awesomest, right?\" Miles turns his gaze back to Elayna standing at the kitchen island. She smirks at him. \"Now let's eeeeeeeeeeat,\" he shouts as they all dig in.\n\nWell into the meal, Miles looks happy and full, so Elayna thinks it's time to share the next step.\n\n\"You're playing golf with Dave today. You're supposed to be at his house at 10.\"\n\n\"I...am?\" He responds, a little surprised. \"Ok then, i better get moving,\" he adds as he starts to collect the breakfast dishes.\n\n\"I got it, babe. You go get ready,\" Elayna interrupts his work. Sensing he has no choice but to acquiesce, he hands over the plates and steps away from the table.\n\n\"Thank you for this morning. Thanks to ALL my girls,\" he cheerfully adds as he heads upstairs.\n\nThe kitchen is clean, the girls are dressed, and Miles loads his car for his golf outing. He hugs and kisses everyone before hopping in the drivers seat and zooming out of the driveway. Elayna can tell he's amped to play golf with Dave, life-long friends who don't see enough of each other. She knows this will have him in a great mood for the whole weekend. With Miles out if site, Elayna loads the girls and their gear, and she drives them to Liz's house. Dropping the girls with their cousins is a bit chaotic, so many kids under ten running around, and the adults briefly catch up before Elayna departs again.\n\nExhaling in the car, Elayna turns up the music and relaxes. She's put a ton of energy into orchestrating this day, and now she has the chance to unwind a bit before the main event. She's scheduled a few things at the spa/salon, starting with a fresh mani-pedi. Sitting in the chair, she feels sleepy, the release of all the adrenaline this morning sapping her energy entirely. Daydreaming just a bit, she imagines the scene tonight: candles, wine, her dressed from head to toe in the sexiest outfit ever, him marveling at his \"gift\" and making wild, sweet, fantastic love with her. Her mind flashes to things they've done, intimate moments in their past that make her body temperature rise. A patron drops something in the spa and Elayna comes to life again. Her nails almost done, the woman asks if there is anything else Elayna would like today. Feeling indulgent and enjoying her alone time, she decides a wax would be helpful for tonight as well. After reviewing some options, Elayna settles on a Brazilian, something she's often heard about but never tried. In the spirit of new adventure, she moves forward with it.\n\nWalking gingerly to the car, Elayna struggles to comprehend the experience she had with the wax technician. A soothing gel on her most sensitive skin has dulled the earlier discomfort, but she can still recall the sharp points of pain at each step just a few minutes earlier. She just wants to get home and give her tender bits a rest before the fun with Miles begins.\n\nBack at home, Elayna changes from her clothes into a bathrobe, and her nakedness underneath is liberating. She lounges on the bed, cheerful but still a little tired. \"Short nap?\" She asks herself. \"Or get motivated and clean the bedroom?\" Scanning the room for laundry, stacks of mail, two bags of returns to Target, and a full trash can, she opts for rest. \"Rest is best,\" she tells herself.\n\nFlipping and turning and adjusting, she can't seem to find a way to get comfortable. Landing on her back, frustrated by her inability to snooze, she's now overheating in the robe and under the blanket. She kicks off the blanket and unties the belt of her robe to let the panels flop open. Her skin relishes the cool air. In a moment she realizes she's home alone and naked on her bed. A brief flutter in her belly signals a willingness to indulge. Elayna's hands pull open the robe entirely, and her hands gently caress her body. Softly scratching her stomach, her neck and shoulders, and down the middle of her chest. Her legs rub together, the friction generating more heat within her. Her fingers finally reach her breasts, and no longer casual or flirtatious, she squeezes the sides of each breast before gripping and twirling each nipple. She loves this feeling, the pleasure connecting parts deep within her. After several turns at her breasts, she decides to venture her hands further south.\n\nFor an instant she's unsure, given the pain of the waxing this morning, but she knows her body well, her fingers with their most delicate touch around the exterior lips of her sex. She's delighted at the super soft texture of this area, and her hands start to explore more creases and folds within. Teasing the first drops of moisture from below, she runs her hand all over the expanse, still fascinated by the hairless skin. Eyes closed, she starts to fantasize again, pretending it is Miles's hands and mouth that caress her. She pauses, stuck on the image of Miles in her mind. Retracting her hands and opening her eyes, she turns to her side and grabs her phone. Rolling onto her back again, she crosses her legs at the ankle, unlocks the phone screen, and opens the camera. Centering the frame she snaps a picture of her bare legs and bright red toes. She knows this will make Miles smile because he loves when she sends him subtlety sexy shots, just enough to tantalize and delight him without going too far. She adds a kissing emoji to the message and sends the photo to Miles. She wonders if she should send something else more aggressive, but decides not to, knowing it could tip her hand too far. Instead, she hops off the bed and starts to tidy up the bedroom.\n\nBuzz Buzz. Miles feels the phone in his pocket, and as they are in the golf cart between holes, he takes a look. He sees it's from Elayna and opens the message. He catches a glimpse of bare skin and stuffs the phone back in his pocket before Dave sees it too. He's flustered and embarrassed in these seconds but relaxes quickly. Then his interest is peaked, and he wants to look again. Once the cart stops, and they prep to tee off, Miles hangs back to let Dave set up first. This is his moment to glance again at the message, and he quickly reopens the phone.\n\nTaking off his sunglasses so he can view the picture clearly, he sees Elayna's gorgeous legs, bare on the bed. He can't help but wonder what she's doing in bed, seemingly unclothed, at this time of day. He studies the image, her smooth skin and cute toes making him grin. His passion and love for her swells.\n\n\"Hey, Miles. You're up,\" Dave shouts.\n\n\"One sec,\" he responds. He wants to tell her how this simple gesture made him feel. He wants to tell her how much he wants to be in that bed with her right now. Running out of time, he sends a smile emoji, a heart emoji, and the eggplant emoji. Proud of his quick work, he puts his phone away and proceeds to hit his best drive of the day, easily 250 yards right down the fairway.\n\n***\n\nWalking in the bathroom she hears her phone ding and returns to retrieve it from the bed. Opening it to see Miless message, she laughs out loud. \"Mission accomplished, she tells herself. With even more spring in her step, she resumes her work.\n\nWith the sun behind the house, Elayna knows it late afternoon. The bedroom and bathroom are clean, and the fridge has supplies stocked for the night as well\u2014champagne, meats and cheeses, mixed berries, and a small cheesecake, Miles's favorite. She writes a short note, lights a candle, and places both on the kitchen counter. Elayna pulls the bottle of bubbly from the fridge, takes two glasses from the cabinet, and adds the lighter to her pocket. Lighting more candles in the bedroom, she keeps the champagne cold in an ice bucket on her nightstand. She then decides to work on props and wardrobe. Taking all of her recent purchases to the bed, she lays them all out. She adds a few extra pieces, and then covers the whole stash with a blanket. Now she waits.\n\nIn the fading light, Miles arrives home to a dark house. After parking in the garage and stepping into the house, he hears silence. Troubled a bit, he calls out, \"Layna? Girls?\" He winds his way to the kitchen to see a candle on the island counter. Now he starts to understand. Stepping closer he spies a piece of paper propped on the candle. Opening it carefully, he reads,\n\nYou present is upstairs. It is for you to do whatever you want with. Your present is just there to make you happy. XOX, E\n\nHis mouth is dry, and he can feel the sweat on his brow, the heat rising to his ears. A shot of adrenaline runs through him. So many questions buzz through his brain, so Miles sits for a moment on the barstool at the counter to think. A few deep breaths, he leans his head back and closes his eyes. He imagines Elayna smirking, pointing her finger and calling him to her. He considers what she might be wearing\u2014her favorite lingerie, a lacy white teddy\u2014or perhaps she's wearing nothing at all. His curiosity brings him out of his seat and he walks to and up the stairs. A flickering light is emanating from the master bedroom, though the door is only cracked, and he takes one more deep breath before crossing through the doorway.\n\nOnce inside, his eyes find Elayna on the bed, sitting up with her bathrobe on. It takes him a second but he spots a little red bow, one usually reserved for a gift, on the front of her robe.\n\n\"Happy Fathers Day,\" she whispers.\n\n\"Thanks? I don't really know\u2014\"\n\n\"\u2014yes you do. I will do whatever you want tonight, Miles. I'm your present.\" She leans back a bit and waits. Miles glances around and sees the candles, champagne and glasses. He walks up to the bed and leans down to kiss his beautiful wife. A deep, wide-mouthed kiss that hints at the powerful desire they share. He then turns to the table and pours two glasses. They toast and sip, and Elayna awaits his direction.\n\n\"Up,\" he requests. She obliges and stands up, facing him. He takes her hand and leads her to the bathroom. Once inside, he releases her hand, opens the shower door, and turns the shower on. Elayna waits, still sipping her bubbles. Miles starts to undress himself, shirt, shoes, pants and socks. He stands in his boxer briefs and checks the water temperature. After making a small adjustment he returns to Elayna.\n\n\"Off,\" he says and waves his hand at her. She turns to our down her wine glass and then drops her robe. She stands naked, willing and wanting, the best present he could hope for. Miles drops his briefs and quickly steps to Elayna, embracing her urgently and kissing her madly. She can already feel his arousal, his warm, swollen member pressed against her smooth mound. Their kiss concludes, and he leads them to the shower.\n\nExpecting heavy foreplay and possibly some oral, Elayna is surprised by Miles's very casual, practical approach to the shower. He soaps his body and then hers. He takes extra time to wash her back, chest, stomach, and legs. It becomes a luxurious feeling, him caring for her this way. He slides a soapy hand between her legs, gently washing the area. He stops for a moment and says, \"wow, you're...all bare...down there\" and then pulls the hand sprayer to rinse her body.\n\n\"Thought it might be new. Got the full Brazilian style wax,\" she tells him.\n\n\"You mean, like, front and back?\" He asks nervously.\n\n\"Yep. All bare all around,\" she says with a smile. She feels his hand on her left butt cheek, his fingers inching toward the middle. Her breath quickens in anticipation as his touch slides between her butt cheeks, but not pressing deeper. He finds the area just as smooth.\n\n\"That's wild,\" he says with a smile.\n\n\"Do you like it?\" Elayna inquires, hopeful.\n\n\"Well, yeah!\" he excitedly chirps.\n\n\"Good. It hurt like hell, but for you...anything,\" she concludes. Washed and rinsed, Miles fastens the hand sprayer to the wall and turns off the water. He opens the door and grabs a towel. Rather than dry himself, smile turns to envelop Elayna, who is already getting cold. He wraps the towel around her and dries her body. Rubbing her body quickly in an attempt to warm her, he then dries her arms and legs. He leaves the towel draped around her and ushers her from the bathroom to the master closet.",
        "\"I've actually got something to show you,\" she admits to Miles and turns to leave the closet. He follows her to the bedroom and sees her pull a blanket from the bed. As he seeks closer he can see all sorts of colors and textures, and when he's next to Elayna, he determines what's on the bed\n\n\"Well isn't this great?\" he says with his arms folded. She isn't sure if he's annoyed or happy.\n\n\"Do you...like this stuff? Or do you want something else?\"\n\n\"This will be fine,\" Miles replies and picks up the black corset. He hands it to Elayna, an intensity in his eyes that she's rarely seen. She drops her towel and begins to put on the lingerie as Miles's gaze travels her whole body. Elayna feels sexy, desired, and she knows she can play up her role as vixen tonight. After perusing the bed, Miles asks, \"Don't you have fishnets?\" It's one of his mildly hidden desires, but tonight, nothing is hidden. \"I'd like you to wear them.\"\n\n\"Ok. What about my underwear? Black thong? Something else,\" she asks flirtatiously.\n\n\"No, nothing. Just fishnet stockings. And your strappy black heels,\" he declares with confidence. In his mind Miles has fantasized about this very outfit, and he can hardly comprehend that it's happening now.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" she coyly responds. Elayna returns to the closet to fetch her items while Miles scans the bed again. He sees the straps and cuffs, the blindfold, and the toys. He picks up the bullet vibe and clicks its button, but he quickly turns it off thinking it's too loud. He chuckles at the silicone dildo. He finally picks up the two plugs, not entirely sure what they are. Just then, Elayna returns wearing her stockings and heels. She's incredibly attractive, and Miless heart pounds in his chest. He wants her so badly, and the swelling between his legs is a reminder that more than his eyes are aroused by the sight of his sexy wife. \"Whatcha got?\" She asks as she strides to him.\n\n\"I'm not sure? What do these...or...how do you?\" he asks innocently. She finds him adorable in moments like this, him overcoming a robust shyness to connect on an intimate level.\n\n\"They're butt plugs. I thought you might...or we might...want to try that?\" Elayna is a touch shy but also more than motivated at the idea, and her eyes show it. She can see in his face a curiosity and interest as well. She swivels and picks up the bottle of UberLube on the bed. \"Use this with one of them,\" and as she hands him the bottle, Elayna turns, and bends over on the the bed. A lump in his throat and burning passion in his heart, Miles surveys his willing wife. He flips open the cap and applies a few drops of liquid to the black silicon plug. He now stands behind his wife, inching closer to her beautiful round ass, ripe for attention. He first leans down and plants a kiss at the small of her back, then a bit further down on her right cheek and left. His touch has her panting into the bed covers, and part of her wants him to take her right now. Instead she slides her arms down to her sides, and both hands reach up to grab her buttocks to pull them slightly apart. He gazes are her tight pink hole, its puckered center twitching slightly. Mustering his courage, Miles places the tip of the plug right at the entry point and waits. The cold, wet sensation causes her ass to wince just briefly before she feels the slight pressure at the doorway. She relaxes with a few deep breaths, which allows the plug to slip into her a bit. Miles pauses a moment before pushing further, and in a moment, the plug is firmly nestled in place, held tightly by her muscle and the toy's wide base. Miles uses both hands to massage her cheeks, loving the handfuls of flesh at his disposal.\n\n\"How does it feel,\" he asks boldly.\n\n\"Ahhh,\" she gasps for a second before adding, \"fucking fantastic,\" Elayna says, inching up on her elbows. \"How does it look?\" she retorts.\n\n\"Really fucking hot,\" Miles responds. With that, she rolls over and climbs to her feet to stand in front of him. No more waiting, she kisses him wildly, her tongue attacking his, and her arms desperate to feel his body.\n\n\"I want you so bad right now. I want you inside me,\" she pleads, one hand reaching to grasp his hardened member. But he pulls away, though his body clearly wants what she is offering.\n\n\"Not yet. On the bed. Lay on your back,\" his tone more direct now. She's intrigued by his command and does as he says. Climbing into bed, she scoots to the top and rests her head on the pillows. She watches Miles tinker with the props below, his movements quick and purposeful He finally raises his arms to showcase the velvet cuffs and straps. She knew he would like the kinky stuff; she's always thought he had a depraved streak deep down inside. Miles raises her right leg slightly and wraps the cuff around her ankle. He does the same with the other leg. He then climbs on the bed, gets to his knees and shuffles to the top where Elayna waits.\n\n\"Hands,\" he commands, and she obliges. Cuffs attached to each hand, he lifts them above her head and fastens them together behind the wrought-iron railing of the bed. She still has some movement, but she cannot bring her hands back down to herself or him. Seeing her slightly restrained, Miles throws one leg over her body and straddles her waist. She isn't sure what he's up to next, but she can't wait. He shuffles forward again, bringing his body closer to the top of her. She's been looking at his face, but finally drops her eyes for a moment to see his cock, hard and straight, oozing drops down the tip. At last she thinks she understands.\n\n\"Open,\" he says. She looks right at him and does so, her mouth wide and wanting. Miles grabs himself by the shaft and guides the head of his cock to her lips and tongue. She can already taste his sweet seed and bobs her head forward to get more of him in her mouth. He moans with delight as she sucks heartily on the tip, not quite close enough to get any further down on him. He shifts forward a bit more and his swollen member pushes to the back of her mouth. He has taken control of the movements now, fucking her mouth gently to avoid a snag from her teeth. Miles loves watching this, his adoring wife gobbling his cock so wantonly. As he pushes to the limit of her mouth, he decides to see how wanton she is. \"Take it all,\" he adds and sees Elayna's eyes wide a big. She pulls her mouth off for a moment and breaths. But she does not hesitate or vocalize any pause to this direction. Instead, she opens her mouth once again, ushers him past her lips, takes his head to the back of her mouth, waits for a moment, and then proceeds to drive her face forward, his cock sliding far down her throat. It's only a few seconds before she has to withdraw again for air, and Miles sees his cock dripping wet from her saliva. \"Good girl,\" he says with a smirk, content with her effort so far. Elayna feels dirty and sexy, and she loves it. Because she loves him.\n\nSwinging his leg over her body, He's standing next to the bed again. He scans what remains of the props and lifts the blindfold up. He also grabs the bullet vibrator. \"My turn to play with you,\" he whispers. Elayna smiles and licks her lips, still savoring his taste. Miles places the blindfold over her head to cover her eyes. \"Relax. Enjoy. I love pleasing you,\" he adds as he descends down her body. He turns the vibrator on, it's faint buzz arousing great anticipation in Elayna. She feels it on her shoulder and twitches at the shock and ticklish feeling. She laughs a bit. Then Miles brings it down her chest, circling her right breast, and the pleasure starts to build. She can feel her nipple harden inside the cup of the corset as he circles the area. It feels amazing, and she yearns for...oh yes, he's found the other breast as well, the vibe bringing that nipples to life as well. The vibrations then move south, her ribs and belly feeling the unmistakable sensation. The bed shakes a bit, and Miles's hand is on her right leg, but she can't quite determine what he's doing. \n\nThe vibe returns to her hip, and she wants badly for him to bring it between her legs. But he doesn't oblige, instead sliding down her inner thigh on one side and then the other. She feels like place the bullet on the bed and pick up her right leg. He props it on his chest, the stiletto heel almost piercing where his heart would be. He unhooks the strap on the shoe and carefully slides it off. He then gives a sweet kiss to the tips of her toes, encased in the black fishnet stockings he enjoys so much. He repeats this operation with her other leg, holding on his body to remove the shoe and kissing her radiant red toes. His hands work up the calf this time, on hand massaging and the other trailing the rejuvenated vibrator. Elayna never knew such simple things could make her body respond like this, every touch and moment like a musician bringing the music of her body to life.\n\nHis hands massage her inner thighs, and his lips soon follow. She sense the heat of his breath, the coarseness of his beard, and the softness of his mouth. Closer and closer he inches up her body until he's at the crease of her leg and body. He knows her scent and visibly sees how swollen and wet her lips and clit are. He marvels at her amazing and sexy body, such a wonder to behold and enjoy. He wants to dive in a savor every drop of her, but instead brings the bullet back to the forefront. He grazes the outer lips with it, and she jumps in response, not uses to that feeling and without the ability to predict it by sight. He works the vibe around her puffy pink lips, each time steering far clear of her button. He then adds a perfect peck to her clit, his lips sticky and warm to her touch. \"Ohhhh,\" she exclaims uncontrollably, as the bullet slides to her wetness while his lips continue to kiss her. The vibrations at her sopping hole cause Elayna to buck her hips up, which pushes his mouth into more contact with her body. Now licking, sucking, and vibrating all parts of her sex, Elayna is lost in ecstasy, unsure if she's ever felt anything like this in the past. He arms pull against the cups as she wants to grab the back of his head as his mouth continues to devour her. She also wants to watch him lick and suck her pussy because he is so damn good at it.\n\nWithdrawing the vibrator, instead Miles slides two fingers inside of her, a gaping cavern showing how hot she has become. His mouth still suckling on her most sensitive spot, Miles's ring finger finds the edge of the plug that he'd nearly forgotten was in her ass. Removing his fingers from her ravenous cunt, he starts to play with the plug as his tongue swirls among her lips. He deftly slides it out a bit before it goes back in, much more easily than before. He can tell by Elayna's breathy moans that this is an experience she's enjoying. A bit more curious, he pulls the plug all the way out, and instead inserts one of his fingers. He's played with the outside of her ass many times, stroking and rubbing the pucker, but he's never ventured here. Inside she is warm and slippery, faintly similar to her primary sex hole. Her muscles clench tightly as his second knuckle presses in. Now finger fucking her ass and lapping at her pussy, Miles realizes how turned on he is by this gift of allowing him to do whatever he wants. He relishes every texture and taste of her body and now must decide what's next. He withdraws his hands and mouth and pushes himself to his knees, looking at her gorgeous body-corset, stockings, ripe red lips spread wide for him.\n\n\"What do you want,\" he utters between his own deep breaths. She hears him, but faintly as she brings her conscious self to life.\n\n\"Fuck me. I want your dick in me. I want it,\" she almost whines with urgency. He starts to oblige, bringing his hard cock to the pursed inner lips. Instead of doing as she's asked, he decides to keep it on the outside, his thrusts separating the lips and sliding his head across her clit. He does this five, ten, twenty times, each on eliciting an \"OHH\" or \"AHH\" from Elayna. He's teasing her into completely craving his cock. After minutes or hours, she finally speaks up again, \"Please...Miles...please,\" her breathy demands enticing him to slide himself down so that the tip waits at the edge of her hole.\n\n\"You want this?\" he grumbles to her.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exhales.\n\n\"Say it again. Tell me how much you want it.\"\n\n\"Fuck me, Miles, Fuck me so hard. I want your cock in me, fucking me, making me come. I want to feel your hot come inside me. I want...\" she says before stopping her speech when she feels Miles impale her with his rod. \"OHHHHHHHH\" she moans loudly as he buries himself as deep as possible into her. He withdraws and slams into her again, the force a touch painful but overwhelmed by the warmth of pleasure. He does it again and again and again, thrusting and grinding her as she moans and wails with delight. For a second she thinks of Miles and slides her fishnet-covered legs up and down his back, knowing he will love the feeling of this texture on his body. She senses his breathing increases and he exclaims an \"Ohhh...yea\" between thrusts, her legs wrapped behind him. He pushes himself back up, his hands running up and down her legs until he reaches her ankles. Finding the cuffs again, he grabs both ankles and pushes them toward Elayna until they are in line with her hands that are cuffed at the head of the bed. He fastens the cuffs together, and she is bound, arms and legs to the top of the bed. She's never been compromised like this, her body wrenched and restrained. She is nervous but trusts him always, and as his hand stirs between her legs again, she becomes less concerned with her position than generating orgasms for them both.\n\n\"What do you want to do to me now?' she asks in a sultry voice. He fingers tease her bare lips, her wet pussy, her hard clit that begs for release. His moistened finger then slips lower, rubbing her perineum, the sensitive spot between her holes. It only takes an instant for him to reach her ass again, his finger swirling about the puckered flesh. \"Fuck it, Miles. Fuck my tight little ass,\" she adds in her dirty, demanding voice. His moans indicate his approval. Miles finds the bottle of lube and squirts several dollops all over his cock, stroking it to make it slick all over. She can hear the unmistakable snap of his wet foreskin crossing the swollen head, and she knows he's ready. With her legs pinned back, Miles has easy access to her ass and brings the tip right to the edge. Manipulating himself, he is able to slide the head past the tight muscle, and he pauses a moment. Elayna feels the pressure of his prick entering her, but she breathes and relaxes herself to take more of him. When he feels her relax, he pushes further, gently easing over half of his length into her. Miles withdraws a bit before moving forward again, the tightness of her ass's grip almost pushing him over the edge already. \"Yesss,\" she whispers at his thrust. Seeing her body respond, he pushes himself inside all the way, his cock firmly entrenched in her glorious ass. He can hardly believe sensation of her hugging him so intimately. Her mouth is wide open, and she's almost stopped breathing, just to relish the fullness of this moment. He starts to slide in and out ever so slightly fucking her ass, and it feels like heaven for both of them.\n\nKnowing he can't take this for long without losing control, he pauses, wondering if she is as close to orgasm. He decides to reach forward and unhook her cuffs, releasing her legs and unhooking her arms. He then pulls the blind fold from her eyes. A watery, cloud gaze is upon him, so much exhaustive pleasure behind her look.\n\n\"What's wrong, babe?\" she asks.\n\n\"Nothing. Turn over,\" he says. She rolls to the middle of the bed onto her stomach. He grabs her by the hips and lifts her up on her hands and knees. Now she understands. His hands at her cheeks, she feels the wetness of his cock at her asshole once more, She reaches underneath herself, and guides the tip to the right spot, and Miles pushes himself in again. They both grunt at the joy of this penetration. Miles shifts his body a bit, and she wonders what he's doing. He then reaches down to her side and adds, \"Use this.\" Elayna turns her head slightly to see the small silver vibrator in his hand, and she extends her arm to take it. His hands back on her hips, he starts fucking her again, this time with more speed and force. She can tell his climax is close, so she clicks the vibe to life and slides it under and between her legs. The pulsing vibe is the perfect compliment to the deep stretching her ass is feeling. She has been on a roller coaster of physical sensations and gratification, and she isn't sure she wants it to end. Still the bullet's hum gives her no alternative as she knows the tension is reaching its peak. \n\nMiles thrusts as deeply as he can and holds himself there, and she feels his cock pulse and swell inside her. Indescribable it is to sense his come leaking into her this way, yet its warmth turns her on even more. The moment pushes her over the edge and her body begins to thrash and buck against his, the orgasm spreading through her entire body like never before. As they both gain conscious clarity, their bodies slow down. Miles eases out of her, hoping he hasn't hurt her with his enthusiasm. A few drops follow his cock, and Elayna loves the cool wetness strolling downward. She leans forward to collapse on the bed, her body lined with sweat and her insides both sore and satisfied. On his knees behind her, he can hardly believe what's transpired as he glances over her beautiful body. He caresses her legs sweetly until she turns on her side. He flops down next to her, facing her and kissing her. She can still take herself on his lips, and it makes her kiss him longer. Upon the break of the embrace, he asks, \"Are you ok?\" just to be sure this evening's events haven't done awry in any way.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" she smiles in return. \"Happy Father's Day.\"\n\n\"Probably the best one ever!\" he chuckles to her.\n\n\"I'm glad. Definitely my favorite,\" she adds and kisses him again. \"So what are we going to do for your birthday next month?\" she asks with a wink. Both of their minds start to churn out ideas.\n\n\"I'm sure we can think of something,\" he exclaims and rolls on top of her with one more passionate kiss."
