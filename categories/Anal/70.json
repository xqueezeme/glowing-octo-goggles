        "Saturday 19th October 18.45hrs\n\nAfter a very heavy day, I brought the car to a halt in the drive and climbed out. It would have been the perfect evening for a game of squash; I felt tired, but I could feel the tension in my muscles so I knew that I still had a lot of energy. Squash is the perfect antidote for a stressful day. It\u2019s a short, intense, and demanding game, and always leaves me relaxed and free of the frustrations of the day. \n\nI hadn\u2019t played since the game with Nicky; I\u2019d been reluctant to call Steve to arrange a game. It just seemed so impolite to fuck his wife and then pretend that I was still a good friend. But I guess that I was more worried that Nicky would answer the telephone and I wouldn\u2019t know what to say to her. My guilty mind had run the following conversation each time I\u2019d thought of calling. \n\n\u2018Oh hi Nicky! What? No really, I loved fucking your bum. It was lovely, but sorry I can\u2019t tonight, I\u2019d sooner play squash with your husband. What? Oh yes, I\u2019ll make sure that we use court seven. Should I show Steve where I took your pants, and made you play without them before I fucked you and made you scream? I\u2019ll even show him the vide., What? Oh sorry, didn\u2019t I tell you about the video. Anyway, if I\u2019m not busy, perhaps we could fuck tomorrow?\u2019 \n\nThose thoughts seemed to summarize perfectly, my current self-appointed status as the best friend from hell! Something I wasn\u2019t particularly proud of.  \n\nSo, squash was out and nothing, but nothing, was going to get me off the settee this evening. I went into the house, tossed my briefcase into the \u2018rubbish\u2019 corner of the hall, and went into the lounge. I poured myself a small scotch as a pre-med, and called to find out where Steph was hiding.\n\n\u201cSteph.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up here darling. I need to talk to you, can you come up?\u201d Initially a cold chill ran up my spine, did she know about Nicky and me? No she\u2019d called me darling, so the worry quickly dissipated. Nicky had promised never to talk about us to anyone, and I\u2019d believed her. Wearily, I climbed the stairs, and found Steph freshly showered in our bedroom. \n\n\u201cYou need to get ready quickly, we\u2019re off to the cinema.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t fuss, your gear is over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve had a lousy day, and I\u2019m knackered.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh stop moaning, you can sleep during the film.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always held that against me, I\u2019ve only done it once. I just found Gone With the Wind boring.\u201d Steph smiled, she\u2019d got a rise out of me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I only found out an hour ago myself. Nicky and Steve won four tickets for the arty roundhouse cinema in town. It\u2019s showing the original Lolita, and everyone is dressing up, including you. I\u2019ve spent the last hour on the phone and I\u2019ve got you a really neat outfit. It\u2019s just been delivered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Joe?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s spending the night at his friends house. He\u2019s sorted.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteph, do we have to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I know that you\u2019re tired, but you might actually enjoy it. If you don\u2019t, then have a sleep when the lights go down. Besides, if we don\u2019t go, then Steve and Nicky can\u2019t go either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t make this hard work. Steve is on call, and might be called away, so we\u2019ll need to bring Nicky home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a taxi?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh very gallant. This conversation has encountered a fatal error and is being shut down, misery guts. Go and shower, I\u2019m dying to see you in your outfit.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe shower was the highlight of my day so far. Although still tired, I came out of it refreshed and prepared to consider that a night out might not be the disaster that I\u2019d imagined earlier. Then my mind went back to what Steph had said, \u2018dressing up\u2019, \u2018your costume\u2019. I rushed out of the shower, grabbing a towel as I went.\n\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Steph. I put the towel around my waist to cover up what she was referring to, and then it became clear what the dressing up consisted of. Stood in front of me was a thirty something schoolgirl. Steph was dressed in a short green tartan kilt, white blouse with a matching green tie, white socks, a prefect\u2019s badge completed the outfit. She\u2019d put her hair into pigtails, and looked absolutely ravishing. Understandably, the towel began to twitch.\n\n\u201cWow, are you sure that you want to go out?\u201d I could feel the front of the towel rising, as my little companion expressed his own approval of her costume.\n\n\u201cDown boy,\u201d she laughed and patted the bulge in the towel, which only encouraged him. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m sure. Get your costume on, we need to leave in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nLooking at the tent shape in my towel, I said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose we could,. You know,..before we go?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not, you\u2019ll make a mess! Anyway, we haven\u2019t time!\u201d\n\n\u201cMake a mess!\u201d I replied in mock outrage. \u201cIs that all I do for you, make a mess?\u201d She laughed.\n\n\u201cNo, to be fair, sometimes you do do a little more for me. But you do always make such a mess, and we haven\u2019t time. Now get ready.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell what about a quick,. you know?\u201d I offered him a little closer to her. Steph applied a generous coating of lipstick, and then replied with a smile.\n\n\u201cNo, awfully sorry darling, I\u2019ve just put my lipstick on! Get ready.\u201d Then she closed the conversation, flashing her blue school knickers at me as she tidied up.\n\n\u201cYes miss.\u201d I was already into character. Things were looking up.\n\n\u201cOh Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Miss.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember that we\u2019re with friends when you\u2019re in the cinema. No naughty stuff! Ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cOk Miss,\u201d I replied, without meaning a word. In all the years that we\u2019d been together, we\u2019d never been to the cinema without \u2018naughty stuff\u2019. The surroundings seemed to turn me on. But more importantly, it was the only place that Steph seemed to completely lose her inhibitions. So not only did I not mean what I said, I was fairly sure that she didn\u2019t either. In fact, I think that she\u2019d have been really disappointed if I\u2019d done as she\u2019d asked.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cOver there, you\u2019ve got five minutes, so I hope they fit. I\u2019ll drive so that you can have a drink.\u201d Since I was already holding what remained of my first scotch, that seemed to be too good an offer to refuse. I dressed quickly, as Steph fiddled with her make-up. Once my little associate relaxed a little, the grey flannel shorts fitted ok. But the white shirt and blazer were slightly small. The outfit, looked, as it should, ridiculous. I looked like an overgrown schoolboy.\n\n\u201cCome on, Nicky and Steve will already be there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI feel such a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look great. Just like the boy I met after school who carried my books, and took my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust your heart?\u201d\n\n\u201cBehave yourself! And don\u2019t forget, keep your hands to yourself at the cinema.\u201d She smiled. \n\n\u201cWith you dressed like that, it will be hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if it wasn\u2019t, and if you\u2019re a good boy I might check it out for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeck, I\u2019m not that sort of guy. D\u2019you think I\u2019m easy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha. Do you want me to answer that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo maybe not.\u201d \n\nIn fact, Nicky didn\u2019t need to wait until the theatre for \u2018the naughty stuff\u2019. As she drove the car onto the highway into town, my hand slid along her leg to her cotton knickers. Of course, she protested, but made no move to stop me. I\u2019d confirmed that her instructions were not what she wanted, so a teasing finger moved gently over her vagina, which interestingly was already damp. A brief investigation suggested that she\u2019d spent some time on her bikini line; and I approved. I sat back and left her to concentrate on her driving.\n\nThe very trendy theatre bar was on the first floor, and had ceiling to floor windows. We looked for Steve and Nicky, but they hadn\u2019t yet arrived so we took the only table still available, a table for four near the windows. I wondered about the view of Steph\u2019s kilt from the street below. I was a little sorry that I wouldn\u2019t be able to have a look for myself. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t need too much explanation about tonight\u2019s movie; the bar was packed with people dressed in outrageous schoolboy and schoolgirl costumes. In the first few minutes, I couldn\u2019t keep my head still. I kept finding yet another woman, showing abundant amounts of bare flesh, for me to look at. \n\n\u201cOk tiger, you\u2019ve had a good look,\u201d said Steph disapprovingly.\n\n\u201cDid I tell you how good you look tonight?\u201d I replied groveling. She laughed. Oh good, I was forgiven. Strains of \u2018Tonight\u2019s The Night,\u2019 interrupted the conversation. Steph took her cell phone from her bag. I smiled smugly at my choice of call tone for her phone. Foreplay comes in all forms, was my motto.\n\n\u201cHello! Oh hi Nicky. Where are you? Ok great, yes we will, see you in a minute. Bye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just parking the car, will you get them a drink, a Fanta for Steve and a brandy for Nicky. Oh by the way, when they arrive take care, they\u2019ve had an argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d I did as I was told, and a few minutes later Nicky arrived, followed closely by Steve who had a face like thunder; he was clearly not pleased about something. Looking at Nicky, I think that I could guess what that might be.\n\nIf most of the costumes in the bar fitted into the outrageous category, then Nicky\u2019s outfit deserved a category all of it\u2019s own. She looked absolutely stunning. She was dressed in a white school blouse, which had been carefully arranged to look like she\u2019d just been in a fight. All the buttons were hanging off, and it was open from neck to waist, where it was tucked into her very short grey gym skirt. She obviously wasn\u2019t wearing a bra, and was proudly showing off most of those fabulous breasts. The blouse looked anything but secure, stopping just short of revealing her nipples to the world. It was something of a mystery how it remained in place. A short red tie, white socks, high heels and a black eye completed her outfit.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Steph. \u201cNow that\u2019s an outfit to die for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, you don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve overdone it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you look stunning. Doesn\u2019t she Joe?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr, yes, really nice.\u201d I replied fatuously, anxious not to stare or appear over excited. It seemed to me, that that would be unwise. Anyway, I could leave that to others, since almost everyone in the bar was either staring, or pointing at her. Beside her, I felt like the floor of the Sistine chapel, no one looks at that either.\n\n\u201cHrmmp,\u201d grumbled Steve. Message received, Steve did not approve of the outfit. He was dressed normally.\n\nWe moved around the table so that they could join us. Partners sat on opposite sides of the small table, with Nicky to my left facing the window. These seating arrangements did nothing to support my attempt not to stare at her. I couldn\u2019t help but look. Without any difficulty whatsoever, I could see more or less the whole of Nicky\u2019s beautiful left breast. Taking the full tour, my eyes, skated down its outline until it disappeared into the fabric, and then along the underside as it re-emerged. Eventually I forced myself to look away, and glanced guiltily at Steph. She looked back at me and smiled. She mouthed the word \u2018letch\u2019.\n\n\u201cJoe, pull in your tongue, and close your mouth. You\u2019re dribbling.\u201d Steph said, laughing. I felt myself blushing.\n\n\u201cSorry Joe, am I embarrassing you?\u201d said Nicky, apparently genuinely concerned.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine. You just look stunning, er lovely, that\u2019s all.\u201d Whoops! Enough Joe, I thought. I looked at Steve, who was not amused by my embarrassment at all. In an attempt to occupy myself, I tried to strike up a conversation with him, but he was more or less monosyllabic. I persevered, but it couldn\u2019t be described as a conversation.\n\n\u201cHave you had a good week?\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose so.\u201d Etc. etc..\n\nI was pleased when my persecution was cut short, as the bell sounded to call us into the auditorium. As everyone was distracted, I grabbed a last good look at my favourite breasts. Other than Steph\u2019s, I corrected myself. I was desperate to catch a glimpse of nipple. It was so close, I began to wonder how she was keeping the blouse in place. But in spite of revealing most of each magnificent orb, her nipples remained irritatingly concealed.\n\nAs we queued to take our seats, Steph took my arm and whispered,\n\n\u201cJoe, doesn\u2019t Nicky look fantastic?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I replied. She poked me in the ribs, and laughed.\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d she mocked in a mickey taking voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your eyes down her cleavage for the last ten minutes, you horny sod!\u201d She then felt my crotch. \u201cI hope that some of that is for me!\u201d I laughed an embarrassed laugh.\n\nWe took our seats. Frustratingly, the two girls sat together, with Steve and me on each side like bookends. I had lost my tantalizing view, at least until the intermission. \n\nThe cinema auditorium was extremely modern, and being an art house production, a guy felt the need to outline the movie storyline to a load of adults dressed as schoolchildren. Like we didn\u2019t know already! Eventually, he introduced the program.\n\nThe film got under way. As I\u2019d expected, it was dated and fairly boring. I occupied myself by undoing a couple of buttons on Steph\u2019s blouse and squeezing her breasts. She didn\u2019t object at all, so I had a little play under her skirt. She whispered,\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t! I\u2019m trying to watch the film, and Nicky\u2019s right next to me. She\u2019ll see.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to push my luck, and I\u2019d improved my view by two buttons so I sat back and my eyes wandered around the auditorium. It was approximately eighty five percent full, maybe two hundred people, most watching the movie, but a few guys, like me, seemed bored. Some others were clearly doing naughty things. I envied those, and pointed one or two of them out to Steph. She laughed, and brushed her hand teasingly over my groin.\n\n\u201cOh I can see that he\u2019s needing a cuddle, maybe I\u2019ll help him out later, if he behaves himself.\u201d \n\nThe dull soundtrack was disturbed by a double beep, and Steve and Nicky held a short conversation. Steph had a whispered conversation with Nicky, and then Steve stood up,\n\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got to go, Joe will you look after Nicky? Bye.\u201d \n\n\u201cSure no problem Steve,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhat are mates for?\u201d Thankfully it was dark, because the insincerity of my reply caused a rush of blood, and an evil, more apt reply crossed my mind. \n\n\u2018Should I make her sob in pain as really really good mates often do to their friend\u2019s wives? Hey, why don\u2019t I fuck her bum again until she feels like she\u2019s being split in two, that seems to do the trick? What do you think Steve?\u2019\n\nThe unspoken question caused an uncomfortable look on my face. Even in the poor light, I\u2019m sure that Steve noticed it, but he was in a hurry.\n\n\u201cCheers, you\u2019re a mate Joe,\u201d and he left. Fucking mate! Why the fuck did he have to be so trusting?! If he\u2019d looked after Nicky properly, she wouldn\u2019t have turned to me. But I knew that I was simply trying to turn him into less of a victim, maybe that would make me less of a shit! If only Steve knew just what a complete shit I was. Some fucking mate! I hated the guilt. I fucking hated it! I wanted to hate Steve, for being stupid, but I couldn\u2019t, I just hated myself. \n\nI looked over at Nicky who smiled mischievously at me, reminding why I was in this predicament, God, how I wanted to fuck that woman again at the earliest opportunity. I wanted to hear her scream in ecstasy as I abused her, and Steve\u2019s trust again. Steph broke the moment,\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been called in to work, we can drop Nicky off can\u2019t we? It\u2019s no trouble, it\u2019s on our way home,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo problem, does he need help?\u201d I joked, to hide my discomfort after my unspoken reply. Steph laughed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, besides some people would pay to sit with two women dressed as schoolgirls.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too probably, how much for the full service?\u201d I joked. Steph poked me in the ribs disapprovingly. \n\n\u201cPervert,\u201d she scolded. I think she was joking, but I wasn\u2019t at all sure.\n\nEventually the intermission arrived; The MC came back on stage, and explained that there would be a short, ten-minute intermission. But before that, he had a question, for ladies only.\n\n\u201cHow many of you ladies have been to the cinema with your boyfriend\u2019s, and found yourselves, being, how shall we say, toyed with.\u201d\n\nQuick as a flash, Steph, and almost all the other women, put their hands up. \n\n\u201cGood, good. OK, how many of you tonight?\u201d After a few nervous chuckles, most hands went down, only one or two remained. \u201cLook around boys. Ok ladies, don\u2019t despair, well not yet anyway. It\u2019s just that the guys you\u2019re with tonight are a little slow. Maybe they\u2019ll improve, I\u2019ll ask you ladies again later.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately the girls didn\u2019t want to go for a drink. So being the gentleman I am, I went on my own. After a couple of refreshing large whiskeys to settle my nerves, the intermission bell sounded and I re-took my seat. Steph was alone.\n\n\u201cOhh, you\u2019ve buttoned up. Where\u2019s Nicky?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to, Nicky asked me if you\u2019d been playing with me. She\u2019s just gone to the loo. Actually we\u2019ve had a really good chat while you were away.\u201d A chill went up my spine. She continued, \u201cYou know when the chap asked how many of us had been groped in the cinema.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, er yes, I think he said toyed with though.\u201d I replied, the feeling of panic abating slightly.\n\n\u201cNicky hadn\u2019t put her hand up, and I joked with her and accused her of being shy. She snapped at me, and then apologized. It turns out she\u2019s never ever had \u2018naughties\u2019 with Steve, anywhere other than in their bedroom. And, she hinted that even there it doesn\u2019t happen to her satisfaction. She said that she\u2019s very envious of our relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said, sliding my hand up her leg again. \u201cWell you know what I mean. Does that mean that I can \u2018toy with you\u2019 when the movie starts again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet! Stop it! But if you\u2019re a good boy, maybe, just maybe, I might just \u2018toy\u2019 with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell maybe, just maybe, I won\u2019t let you,\u201d I said recovering my hand.\n\n\u201cHa! Fat chance, you\u2019ll loll there like a playful puppy,\u201d she replied scornfully. \u201cSometimes, I think that it wouldn\u2019t matter who it was, you\u2019d just lie there and let them play with you. Seriously though Joe, I think that Nicky\u2019s quite unhappy, and I felt quite sorry for her. If that guy asks again at the end, be prepared for some odd looks. I think that she might lie, and I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nAfter a short while, Nicky returned to her seat, and after a whispered conversation with Steph, she stood up and squeezed past us and sat in the next seat to me. My fists balled up tight, burying themselves into the velour seat as her barely protected bottom passed achingly close. Steph broke my concentration.\n\n\u201cIs that better? she whispered. \u201cYou can be a thorn between two roses. Now I\u2019ve no-one next to me to watch you misbehaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d I replied as I slid my right hand along her inner thigh. \n\n\u201cNo, no! Be patient! Wait until the movie restarts,\u201d she scolded. I looked to my left, and saw that Nicky was watching us.\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d \n\nAs the house lights dimmed, and the movie restarted, as well as confused, I was getting warm, so I took off my school blazer and laid it over my bare knees. Fairly soon, my right hand re-found Steph\u2019s bare thigh, and very slowly made it\u2019s way upwards. She made no move to stop me; instead she slid back in her seat and opened her knees slightly. Good, good, we\u2019re on our way, and life seemed simpler. The hem of the short skirt slipped easily over her smooth thighs, until my hand nestled on the outside of her very damp knickers. I paused for a few seconds; Steph\u2019s only reaction was to settle back a little more into her seat. \n\nAs with all endeavors, I\u2019ve always believed that seduction can be broken up into phases. Phase one had been safely negotiated. My hand nestled at base camp, in-between Steph\u2019s legs with only a strip of her school knickers obstructing further intimacy. Although we\u2019d been in this position many, many times since we\u2019d first met, I still felt the excitement associated with the successful execution of phase one, and the anticipation of successfully getting into her knickers, and beyond, in phase two, especially in a public place. ",
        "My hand lay against the damp material, and then slowly and gently my fingers began to explore the outline of her vaginal lips. I glanced at her to see if she was ready for the next phase of \u2018naughties\u2019 to commence, the overcoming of the final barrier. The flickering light from the screen danced across her face, and gave me my answer. Her eyes were closed, and she had settled back in her seat to enjoy my attentions.\n\nEncouraged, my fingers slid beyond the soft fabric, and onto her outer lips. A little sigh, and movement, was enough to confirm that my timing seemed to be perfect. I eased the fabric aside, and began to trace the outline of her vagina. \n\nBy now, neither of us had any further interest on what was going on on the big screen. Steph had her eyes firmly closed, and I was looking at the lovely, but under the circumstances, dangerous view revealed by her raised skirt. I, and anyone else who cared to look, would see almost all of her gorgeously bare legs and what was going on between them. In the occasional bright flicker from the screen, I caught glimpses of her vagina, contrasted by the blue of her school knickers. The thought of someone else, a stranger, catching the same delicious view of my wife gave me a real buzz. \n\nAfter tracing along her outer lips, my finger gently negotiated the tiny area of sensitive flesh to her anus. The movement elicited a quiet little moan of approval, and a shuffle of her anus against the tip of my finger. She leant her head towards me and nibbled my ear. As she did, I undid her blouse and used my party trick to unfasten her front fastening bra. She nipped my earlobe, and whispered, \u201cpervert\u201d. In response, I pulled at her nipple, and cupped her newly vulnerable breast.\n\nNow it was time to go for glory. My finger retraced its path back along her open vaginal lips to her clitoris. Taking the tiny hood between my finger and thumb, I eased back the delicate protective cover to expose her most sensitive plaything. She trembled, I paused hoping that I\u2019d not gone for her tiny button too soon. \n\nFrustratingly, I could only imagine the view, and I did. By now, in spite of the earlier confusion, I had a shorts splitting erection, and I needed to shift in my seat to get more comfortable. Reluctantly, I withdrew my hand from her blouse. As I moved, I caught a glimpse of Nicky. Stupidly, in my excitement I\u2019d forgotten that she was there. She wasn\u2019t watching the movie, and wasn\u2019t even pretending to. Nicky was leaning forward, watching what was going on between Steph and me. A second careful glance confirmed it. Nicky was transfixed. She also seemed to have her left hand under her skirt. \n\nShocked, my activities with Steph stopped. Pretty quickly, I felt her wriggle and push against my fingers to encourage me. Although my mind was no longer entirely on what I was doing, I continued to gently knead her clitoris. Steph was extremely aroused, and I could tell that she needed to come. Her vagina was wide open, and her delicious juices flowed freely down towards her anus. But for Nicky, this would have been perfection. Steph was moaning gently, and beginning to come onto my teasing fingers. I was concentrating on helping her through to orgasm, as silently as her accumulating juices allowed. Suddenly, my concentration was shattered as a soft voice whispered into my ear.\n\n\u201cFinger me too. Please, finger me too!\u201d Geez, my hair stood on end as Nicky took my left hand and placed it on her upper thigh. Fortunately, by now, Steph was in a world of her own and looking after herself. All she really needed were my fingers, so I moved my other hand up Nicky\u2019s thigh to her knickers. Still a little cautious, I paused. In response, Nicky pushed on my hand, as she hurriedly pulled the saturated crotch aside. \n\n\n\n\u201cFinger me, please! Oh fuck! I\u2019m so excited! Please Joe, finger my cunt!,\u201d her hot breath pleaded into my ear. It was clear as soon as I touched her vagina just how close she was to orgasm; she was almost there. Nicky grabbed my hand as I slid two fingers into her unguarded antechamber. She began to come almost immediately, her cunt soaking us both with her juices. Fortunately, the film was quite noisy at this point; otherwise the wet appreciative sounds from her would have attracted attention as she squeezed her come over my fingers. \n\n\u201cOh god, I\u2019m coming, finger my bum too. Hard, hurry. Please!\u201d Nicky whispered. My finger slipped easily into her well lubricated but tight little bottom.\n\n\u201cOhh that hurts.\u201d She slid away from me down into the seat, and further onto my fingers. As she came, I felt Steph stirring.\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve done it again, you horny bastard,\u201d she scolded. \u201cNow I\u2019ll need to go to the little girls room and change my knickers. Luckily, knowing you I brought a spare pair. Ask Nicky if she wants to come as well.\u201d The humour, almost gave me away. I very nearly laughed out loud, Nicky was coming, and not quietly! As Steph asked me the question, Nicky was coming, onto my left hand. I hope that the irony of the situation hadn\u2019t triggered too much of a reaction, other than a daft smile on my face. I turned and whispered to a slightly disorientated Nicky,\n\n\u201cSteph\u2019s off to the loo, do you want to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m ok thanks,\u201d she replied. I shook my head to Steph, then curled my fingers inside Nicky, dragging them across her G spot and testing the wall of her anus. Steph headed off alone for the ladies room. Taking advantage of the opportunity, my fingers began to hit on Nicky\u2019s eager cunt and accommodating anus hard. She laid back, with her legs splayed, and was taking as much as I could give her. Almost immediately she came again, marking her territory on her seat and the rear of the seat in front. This time the film didn\u2019t, and probably couldn\u2019t have disguised the noises from her. \n\nHer gentle moans, audible over the soundtrack, and the wet sounds from her cunt as she came over my invading fingers were unmistakable. Thankfully, no one turned around, but a few couples in the rows in front exchanged knowing glances at each other. My mission accomplished, I sat back and clasped my hands in my lap, my chest puffed out. There was something special about having fresh come from two different ladies on my hands. \n\n\u201cOhh Joe, thank you, thank you, that was fantastic. Would you like me to suck you? Please let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds wonderful Nicky, but not now. Steph will be back soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhh, are you sure? You\u2019ve been so kind to me!\u201d There it was again, she\u2019d just given herself to me to play with, and she was grateful to me. My conscience had little or nothing to work with, so I asked,\n\n\u201c I\u2019ll call round on Monday. Is that ok? You can repay me then.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise? I\u2019ll do anything you ask me to, you do know that don\u2019t you? Just tell me what you like. You will do that won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely anything, you are a wonderfully kind man, and deserve anything you like. Promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise.\u201d Thank god for my control, I think that Nicky would actually have done it. She would just have been getting down into my lap as Steph re-took her seat. Smiling at Steph, I slid my hand under her as she sat down. She smiled back and then removed my hand from cupping her bottom. \n\n\u201cEnough big boy let me relax now. I\u2019m nice and dry.\u201d I did as I was told, and sat back between them as the film flickered through its final minutes, to wonder what would happen on Monday. \n\nEventually, thankfully, the movie ended and the final credits rolled. The houselights came on again, and the MC\u2019s voice came over the sound system. OK ladies remember my question from earlier? For all of you lucky ladies, who have been pleasured tonight, please smile at each other as you leave the auditorium. But it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t smile too much as you leave the theatre. It upsets the neighbours, they get jealous. The place was filled with howls of embarrassed laughter from the girls, and smug grins from the guys. I got a dig in the ribs from Steph, and a shy smile from Nicky, who seemed to have tears in her eyes. I mouthed, \u2018are you ok?\u2019 She nodded. \n\nWe got a very inquisitive look from two couples, who I\u2019m sure had been sitting just in front of us. I smiled at them, and gently guided Steph and Nicky through the crowd, away to anonymity.\n\nSteph drove home. I tried to make polite conversation with them both, but it was really difficult to tread a neutral line. I was still horny, and I\u2019d been unable to wash, so I still had a reminder of the evening on my hands. It was sustaining an erection that I just couldn\u2019t get rid of. As we\u2019d left the theatre, Steph was looking for me to hold her hand, but she was to my left, so I\u2019d made some excuse and moved to her left before taking her hand. \n\nWe dropped Nicky off at home and said goodnight. Steph and I then went home. Steph went upstairs, and I locked the house and checked the windows.\n\n\u201cJoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way honey.\u201d For the second time this evening, I wearily climbed the stairs. In the bedroom, Steph was sat at her vanity unit. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She turned around to reveal a fresh application of shocking red lipstick.\n\n\u201cCome here, I believe that I owe you something.\u201d She undid my belt, and fly zip. \u201cWow, you did enjoy the movie, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Holding me in both hands, she slowly drew me towards her.\n\n\u201cBut supposing I make a mess?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you will, I\u2019m relying on it!\u201d I thought it wise not to say anything else, and after admiring my excited erection for a few seconds, Steph didn\u2019t speak again, she had her mouth very full.\n\nWe made love, and it was good, probably the best we\u2019d had for months, but my mind was elsewhere, trying to analyze Nicky\u2019s needs, and my role in helping her to fulfill them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday 20th October\n\n\n\nI picked up Joe junior on Sunday morning, and we spent a fantastic day playing football in the local park. He loved me spending time with him, and teaching him how to improve his football skills. I applauded every time he managed to master a new skill, and he demanded that I teach him something else. In truth, he was already much more skilful than I\u2019d ever been. He had a natural ability. I was running out of things that I could demonstrate to him. Eventually he would be challenging me to teach him things that currently I couldn\u2019t do myself, and probably would never be able to do. I made a mental note to brush up my own abilities or he\u2019d become frustrated and lose interest in his game. Being realistic though, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to improve my own skills by much. I\u2019d need to analyse the game, and look for techniques that we could learn together.\n\nWe played a little squash in the afternoon. Again, Joe was an eager pupil. Eventually after a lovely boy\u2019s day, we went home and Joe enthusiastically described everything he\u2019d learned to Steph.\n\nJoe went to bed very reluctantly at 9.00 pm, and Steph declared that she was in the mood, so we adjourned soon after. I\u2019m afraid that I didn\u2019t perform well. I wasn\u2019t really tired; it was more a mental problem. I was distracted. Although I did my best, I knew that I was falling short. It was more than going through the motions, but not by very much. To her credit, Steph didn\u2019t complain, and she seemed to enjoy herself. But it wasn\u2019t one of our best lovemaking sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday 21st October 09:30hrs\n\nI opened the shop, and greeted the staff, but my mind was definitely not on my work. I still had pangs of guilt about my relationship with Nicky, but they were very much outweighed by the passion and desire that I felt every time I thought of her. One word kept playing through my mind, like a repeating movie. The word? Anything. Did she mean it? And even if she did, what on earth could she do. From a sexual perspective, we\u2019d already done everything that I have ever imagined or fantasized about.\n\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say \u2018penny for them\u2019\u201d said Stella, my Office Manager who had just come into my office. \n\n\u201cWhat? Oh I see,\u201d I smiled a sickly smile. I could see from her face that she had a good idea why I was again preoccupied. Normally on a Monday I would be chasing around the various travel company account managers, agreeing this weeks priorities, and financial targets.\n\n\u201cDid you have a good weekend Joe?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, pretty good Stella, and you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of, I\u2019ve had my legs waxed. Can you tell?\u201d With that, she hitched her short skirt up. Her long tanned legs looked even more beautiful than usual. \n\n\u201cYes Stella, your legs look lovely. Why do you have them waxed?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Joe, behave. You know very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo honest I don\u2019t,\u201d I protested dimly.\n\n\u201cHair, hair, dummy. Waxing gets rid of the tiny hairs. See!\u201d she said, putting her foot into my lap. \u201cGo on find a hair. Just one, and I\u2019ll demand my money back and sue them for inflicting all that pain for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope they look perfect Stella. But I\u2019m sure that I could find one, it depends on where I look,\u201d I replied with a mock leer.\n\n\u201cNope, you won\u2019t find any there either. I\u2019ve had my bikini line done too. Perhaps you should check it out during the stock check. It\u2019s no longer in stock, it\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d I could feel my complexion turning a bright shade of red. \n\n\u201cSorry I\u2019ve embarrassed you again. I\u2019m only joking, but they do look good don\u2019t they? I\u2019m really pleased with them.\u201d They did, and so did the crotch of her white knickers. I was disappointed when she put her leg down again. Laughing, she marched out of my office on her newly waxed pins, leaving me with a cryptic comment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such an old shy-baby boss. Us girls like to look good for you boys, you should notice and demand more of us. Just compliment us on our efforts, who knows what might happen?\u201d \n\nNow I confess that I have always been a little dopey when it comes to the opposite sex, I never could read the signs. But even I was coming to the conclusion that Stella was still coming on to me. I remembered her words, \u2018I\u2019ll always be here for you\u2019, hanging in the air as she left my office the last time that we\u2019d come close. Not for the first time, my \u2018little friend\u2019 signaled his disappointment at my failure to take advantage of Stella\u2019s implied offer.\n\nI busied myself, and did a little tidying up to occupy my mind, and get rid of the eager associate pushing at my waistband. I checked my watch every five minutes or so, but at 10:30 I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Very apprehensively, I picked up the phone and pushed the buttons. It rang three times,\n\n\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi Nicky, it\u2019s Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, hi Joe, I\u2019m almost ready for you. You are coming, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say in reply, so I said rather limply.\n\n\u201cIs it ok? Are we still ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cOk? Oh I hope so Joe. Surely you know how I feel about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sorry Nicky. I guess I do, and I feel the same about you. I\u2019ll set things up here and I\u2019ll be over in fifteen minutes, is that ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds good Joe, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready now Nicky!\u201d\n\n\u201cHurry Joe, I can\u2019t wait, see you in fifteen.. Oh Joe, please remember, anything, anything.\u201d The phone clicked as the connection was broken.\n\nThud! \n\nMy little associate sprang further into life as his unromantic, selfish, and giant alter ego. Just one word, one word had put him in command. \n\nI made the excuse to Stella, that I was visiting a potential new client. Thankfully she didn\u2019t ask me any details. I\u2019m sure that she didn\u2019t believe a word, but she agreed that if Steph rang, she would take a message and I would ring her back. As I left her, Stella said,\n\n\u201cGood luck!\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck with the new client!\u201d\n\n\u201cOhh thanks, it\u2019s a bit speculative at this stage, but if it comes off, it could be big.\u201d Inside, I cringed at the words, and my guess is that Stella was having difficulty keeping a straight face. But I was very grateful that she did.\n\nAs I unlocked the car I wondered what \u2018I\u2019ll be ready for you\u2019 meant. I couldn\u2019t wait to find out. As I sat in the car, I noticed just what a lovely day it was, especially for October. In the short time that the car had been standing, the interior had warmed up nicely. I threw my overcoat onto the rear seat and opened the windows, then drove the short distance to Nicky\u2019s. Under the circumstances, I was very relaxed. The sun was shining, it was a gorgeous morning, and I was on my way to commit adultery again with my best friend\u2019s wife. What could be better? \n\n\u201cYou selfish shit,\u201d I said to myself.\n\nJust a few short weeks ago, in similar circumstances, I would\u2019ve had a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. But all that appreciation from Nicky was having its effect. Now I\u2019d begun to feel quite good about it. No one was getting hurt, were they? And Nicky was only doing what she wanted to do, wasn\u2019t she? But what exactly was it that she wanted to do? Well it seemed that that, was anything that I wanted it to be. \n\nEvery time that thought passed through my mind it had two effects, one on my little eager friend, and the other on me. Over the last couple of days, I\u2019d reflected on this mutually exclusive feeling enough times to realize that the crux of the problem was responsibility. My little associate felt none whatsoever, other than for his own carnal needs. He became excited and more than ready for anything that might come his way, and would manipulate any situation, or thought process, until he got his way. \n\nAnd me? Well I just became confused. We\u2019d done everything, and more that I\u2019d ever imagined sex might consist of. So what else could we do? What would anything be? Nicky seemed sure that I would know, and would be asking her to do things she\u2019d never done before. Things she\u2019d already agreed unconditionally to do, whatever they were. That responsibility weighed heavily on me.\n\nAs I approached Nicky\u2019s, an idea hit me.\n\nIf I\u2019d had an erection before the idea, then it went into a different class afterwards. Smiling to myself, I muttered, \u2018ok over to you smarty\u2019.\n\nI parked the car and strolled up to Nicky\u2019s door. I knocked and heard her call,\n\n\u201cJoe is that you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, who were you expecting?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nI pushed the door open, and walked into the hall. Nicky was stood at the other end and she looked stunning. Suddenly my idea seemed a little less practicable. She was wearing her schoolgirl outfit, exactly as she had worn it on Saturday. The blouse was completely open from neck to waist, and, in daylight, the skirt that I played under, looked even more daring than I\u2019d remembered, It seemed much much shorter. \n\n\u201cNicky you look absolutely gorgeous.\u201d She looked a little embarrassed, and averted her eyes.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s not too much is it? I thought that you\u2019d liked it, so I put it on again for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicky, you look absolutely perfect.\u201d I walked up to her and kissed her. Initially we kissed gently, but then moved into a full blown passionate exchange. My hands roamed all over her, and pulled her against me so she could appreciate just how sexy she looked.\n\n\u201cOk, lets go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLets go, I\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo where?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t go out dressed like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh but you can, and we are. Trust me Nicky. Trust me. It\u2019s a lovely sunny day, and we are going into the country to a fantastic little place I know, and then we are going to make love just like teenagers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut!\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d I interrupted. You can wear my coat.\u201d I released her, and left her slightly bewildered as I returned to the car and collected my overcoat. I held it, and she helped me to put it on her. As I wrapped the coat around her, I slipped my right hand under the warm lining and into her blouse. I cupped her left breast, and turned her head, we kissed over her right shoulder. Her breast felt absolutely wonderful, and her nipple suggested that she was as eager as I was to get on with things.\n\n\u201cTrust me lover, trust me,\u201d I whispered. She nodded, and kissed me again. I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to explore her right breast as well. Eventually, we broke off, and reluctantly I restored her modesty under the large coat.",
        "\u201cCome on gorgeous, we\u2019re skipping lessons today for a little playtime.\u201d Nicky smiled nervously. I took her hand to the door, and then she walked very confidently and demurely to my car. I opened the door for her, and drank in the view as coat fell open when she took her seat.\n\n\u201cBeautiful. Just beautiful!\u201d She smiled an embarrassed smile. I climbed in, and the engine kicked into life. At a respectable distance from her home, I said,\n\n\u201cShow me your gorgeous legs Nicky?\u201d She moved the coat until it revealed a generous amount of bare flesh. \u201cAnd that cleavage?\u201d again an immediate relaxation so that the coat was completely open at the front. It was difficult to concentrate with the view on show. \n\n\u201cAre you happy Nicky?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course Joe, I\u2019m just a little nervous, that\u2019s all. I just don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d For the first time in minutes, she looked at me and replied,\n\n\u201cYes of course, you are a fantastic man, and you\u2019ve done so much for me. I\u2019m more happy than I\u2019ve ever, ever, been.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, I would never ask you to do anything that you don\u2019t want to do, I just want to explore a little. Is that ok?\u201d She looked away from me again and said, \n\n\u201cJoe, I\u2019ll do anything for you. Anything.\u201d Thud! There it was again, the \u2018A word\u2019, an unconditional commitment to anything I wanted. The sensation in my pants was unbelievable; I had an erection like never before. We didn\u2019t talk much for the next few miles, I just tried to concentrate on my driving, having the occasional look at the gorgeous sight to my side. After a while, the traffic and people disappeared and the roads turned into country lanes. I pulled down a narrow lane and then off the road onto an overgrown uneven track for a couple of hundred very enjoyable yards, as Nicky\u2019s soft breasts followed every bump in the track. Eventually I pulled the car to a stop close to a waist high dry-stone wall and humpback bridge.\n\n\u201cOk we\u2019re here!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Joe it\u2019s beautiful, where are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s just a little place with a river just over that wall, and my favourite piece of woodland across the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds lovely.\u201d I leaned over and we kissed again. I found it impossible to ignore her breasts and searched them out again rolling and pulling at her nipples. Nicky purred softly.\n\n\u201cOk, let me show you my magic copse!\u201d I very reluctantly let her go, and climbed out of the car. She remained in the car, and looked very nervously around. I opened her door and offered her my hand. She took it and got out as demurely as she could. But, given her outfit, I still got the most wonderful view of her soft breasts as they bounced around in all their unconstrained glory. Anxiously, in the bright sunlight, she started to fasten the coat.\n\n\u201cNo, no, please don\u2019t button up your coat, I want to look at you as we walk.\u201d Nicky didn\u2019t look at me, but she did stop and undid the buttons that she\u2019d fastened. I took her hand and we began to walk alongside the dry-stone wall towards the bridge. It was a magical sensual feeling, the most gorgeous autumn day; the woodland was displaying its full range of colours, greens, browns, auburns and reds through to an abundant display of yellows. I don\u2019t think that my senses had ever absorbed this amount of beauty before. I had Nicky on my arm, the woodland birds were singing and chattering a welcome from within the carpet of colours. It was almost poetic. I pointed at the blanket of colours and said,\n\n\u201cListen to the birds, I wonder if they\u2019re taking about us. I\u2019ll bet they are. They probably saying, wow, look at Joe; we\u2019ve not seen him for ages. And look at his girlfriend, she\u2019s gorgeous, isn\u2019t he a lucky guy?\u201d I stopped, and took her into my arms again and we kissed for what seemed like hours. My hand wandered over her bottom, exploring its outline. I wouldn\u2019t be robbed of my opportunity to examine exactly how beautiful it was. Neither of us seemed to want to break off the kiss. Eventually we did, and carried on walking. I felt her hand tense up and grip me tightly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic, I\u2019ve seen him too.\u201d Approaching us was an old woodsman with his day\u2019s supply of windfall dry firewood. He was dressed for warmth, and looked like he was used to sleeping rough. Alarm bells rang, and I put my arm around Nicky to reassure her. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s harmless darling, he probably lives in one of the ruined cottages a little way down the river. You\u2019ll make his morning though.\u201d I squeezed her hand, and winked at her. I was pleased to see that she hadn\u2019t been spooked too much; her coat was still open revealing a view that the woodsman would probably remember forever.\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d I said as we passed him.\n\n\u201cAnd good morning to you, Sir.\u201d He replied. Sir may one address your beautiful companion?\u201d I nodded. \u201cGood morning to you Madam! May an unworthy old man address you Madam?\u201d After a pause, Nicky replied quietly;\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He bowed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most grateful. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date. \n\nI smiled, as Nicky blushed with embarrassment.\n\n\u201cWhy thank you. You are very kind.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMen\u2019s evil manners live in brass; their virtues we write in water. Madam, you are very beautiful. You have made this old man\u2019s day. And you sir, are a very lucky man!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Sir, and you know your Shakespeare. Yes indeed, I am a very lucky man.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe must needs go that the devil drives.\u201d With that, he walked on. Nicky was still blushing as we left him. I smiled at her and she returned it with a coy smile of her own. The birds began to chirrup seemingly in agreement. They seemed to have been listening to the exchange, and now were keen to voice their opinions.\n\n\u201cWhat a nice guy. Over here darling.\u201d I took Nicky\u2019s waist and helped her over the two step stile in the wall. As I dropped down in the meadow, it seemed even more beautiful than I\u2019d remembered. There was the calming sound of rushing water from the river, now just a handful of yards away, the ripples on the surface scattering the twinkling sunlight into every direction. Stepping-stones across the narrowest point to the other bank were barely covered, and the woods on the opposite bank looked positively serene. Although this was autumn, there was still the unmistakable smell of late blossom.\n\n\u201cOh Joe, it\u2019s wonderful. It really is. How did you find such a lovely spot?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is perfect, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve never brought anyone here since I was a kid. I used to come here on my bike, and play on the stepping-stones.\u201d I felt a lump in my throat as I remembered running across the stones chasing after an early girlfriend. We stood there for a few minutes, before turning to each other and embracing. Nicky rested her head on my shoulder, while I held her tightly. We moved back until Nicky could lean against the wall.\n\n\n\n\u201cKiss me lover!\u201d She responded, returning my exploring tongue with a nibble. My hands began to respond to the demands of my rising erection; \u2018he\u2019 clearly had plans for Nicky. Soon, both hands were fully occupied inside her coat, one making its way under her blouse searching out my favourite breasts, as the other slid around her waist eventually settling on her bottom. There was something magical about making love alfresco, something I\u2019d rarely done. Normally unused senses became intrinsic to the experience. Nicky gasped as my hand cupped her, suddenly I realized that my hand were probably cold.\n\n\u201cSorry darling, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok! It\u2019s nice, just a shock that\u2019s all.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let my hands warm up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No! I need you now. Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d Permission and encouragement given I continued to explore her, gently tweaking her nipples. My right hand began to lift up the back of her skirt until I could feel the outline of her cotton clad bottom.\n\n\u201cMmm, beautiful beautiful bottom,\u201d I whispered, \u201care you going to show it to me later darling?\u201d Her answer was a very hungry kiss, and a gentle nip of my lip. My hand slid inside her knickers, and followed the contour to her cleavage where an impatient finger followed it south until it reached her anus. \n\n\u201cWhat an inviting little opening. Now what can I do with that?\u201d Nicky pushed back onto my finger, teasing it against her impossibly tightly closed little hole. My left hand slid down her bare flesh, beyond her skirt onto her thigh. We kissed again and my tongue explored her as I climbed to her knickers. The cotton gusset of her only remaining protection, was already showing encouragingly moist signs. Finding the waistband, my hand slipped over her tensed tummy and smooth mons pubis until it found her unlocked antechamber. She gasped, as an over eager finger touched her clitoris on its way into her.\n\n\u201cThis is fantastic lover, you look, and feel gorgeous in the open air. It\u2019s very, very, sexy to have my finger in your cunt, just like a teenager.\u201d No answer from her, other than a soft moan and a gentle push against the invading finger. After kissing her again, I nibbled her neck on my way to her breasts. My tongue drew a helix on each wonderful breast, until it reached her sensitive nipples. In each case, a playful nip drew a sexy purring sound from her. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, I saw a movement out of the corner of my eye. I lay my head in-between her breasts, and looked to investigate it. The sight of our Shakespearian woodsman some thirty yards away greeted me, unashamedly watching us.\n\n\u201cShh darling, don\u2019t move, our Shakespearian friend is watching us.\u201d Nicky stiffened.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry lover, it\u2019s very sexy.\u201d I whispered, \u201cHe clearly has excellent taste; I love to look at you too, so I can only admire his taste. Maybe we should help stimulate his literary juices?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you warm enough lover? Should we take off your coat?\u201d After a short pause, her reply was to slip the coat off her shoulders allowing it to fall onto the grass below.\n\n\u201cIs that ok?\u201d She asked disarmingly, briefly looking deep into my soul before lowering her gaze.\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s perfect, you look gorgeous. But perhaps we should allow our literary friend to see a little more of you?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow much more?\u201d she replied. She seemed a little shocked.\n\n\u201cOhh we\u2019ll see. But not more than he deserves, or more than you want him to.\u201d She kissed me hungrily, and whispered:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you Joe, you know that, as long as I\u2019m pleasing you. Just ..just\u2026 \u201d I paused, but her words faded away. Fearing a refusal, I kissed away any further words, and moved behind her. \n\n\u201cNow lean your head back on my shoulder.\u201d Nicky leant her head backwards, and we kissed again. My hands were still down her pants, and I had no intention of moving them. My little friend was desperate to be liberated to join in the action, and was pushing up against Nicky\u2019s bottom.\n\n\u201cCan you feel me lover.\u201d She pushed back in reply. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our friend\u2019s attention, should we take this a little further?\u201d She kissed me, and explored me with her tongue, before grabbing my hand and whispering:\n\n\u201cJust finger me hard!\u201d I did as I was told, slipping three fingers into her as I considered how far I ought to push this situation.\n\n\n\n\u201cOpen your blouse lover, let\u2019s show him your wonderful breasts.\u201d I sensed a real resistance as she paused, so I encouraged her. I eased my fingers a little deeper into her and said, \u201cI\u2019d love to show him your gorgeous breasts. Is that ok?\u201d She looked down, and after what seemed like an age slowly opened the delicate garment until it was hanging from her shoulders, her magnificent breasts on display for our very fortunate Shakespearian aficionado. \n\n\u201cFantastic, fantastic, oh boy is he enjoying the view. Cup your breasts and tug at your nipples to show him how they like a little gentle abuse. No pause this time, Nicky did exactly that, and more playing with them as she showed off. Her state of arousal was obvious, she was very close to orgasm her juices running over my hand as my fingers played inside her. \n\n\u201cA little more lover, let\u2019s show him a little more.\u201d After a long pause, she kissed me again and whispered;\n\n\u201cWhat? What shall I do?\u201d \n\n\u201cTake off your blouse.\u201d Almost immediately, the redundant garment slid down her arms onto the grass.\n\n\u201cTell me what to do!\u201d she said, encouraging me to give her further instructions.\n\n\u201cI think that you should show him your lovely cunt, don\u2019t you?\u201d She gasped. I kissed her again worried that I\u2019d gone too far. To my relief, she reached under her skirt and pulled away her soft cotton knickers down to her knees. \n\n\u201cMmm gorgeous. And now?\u201d\n\n\u201cShould I lift my skirt for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no baby, we\u2019ll do much more than that.\u201d Nicky gasped again, then said.\n\n\u201cDo I have to take it off?, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m ready for that!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no baby, you don\u2019t need to, let me do that! I recovered my left hand from investigating her wonderfully bare bottom, and fumbled with the waistband until I found the clip securing the wrap around skirt.\n\n\u201cMmm William, I hope you are ready for this. Is it ok Nicky? There\u2019s still time to stop me.\u201d For a few seconds, she was silent, both of us so tense we were barely breathing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to take your fingers away to let him see my cunt. You do want me to show him my cunt, don\u2019t you?\u201d The final barrier overcome, I could breathe again.\n\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Very reluctantly, I withdrew my fingers from her, and then undid the clasp. The tiny skirt slowly, and very seductively, fell open before slipping away onto the grassy meadow below, leaving Nicky naked but for her knickers uselessly positioned around her knees. Without any comment, she moved her legs apart stretching her pants: then leant back and kissed me, her tongue competing with mine for access.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh god, I\u2019m coming. No, not yet. Oh please god, not yet. Not like this! Finger me Joe, please! Hard! I\u2019m coming. Do you think he\u2019s watching me come?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer, I was fully occupied servicing her oncoming orgasm I pushed my fingers back into her and grabbed her breast with my left hand, squeezing the lovely fleshy orb. Nicky came almost the instant that my fingers re-entered her. \u201cHarder, please harder, I\u2019m coming again. Please, hurt me! Please.\u201d I gripped and pulled hard at her nipple, and my right hand slapped against her clitoris, as it forced my fingers into her. \n\nNicky\u2019s cunt was wide open, my fingers leaving her completely before resuming the inward stroke. Her head began to roll from side to side on my shoulder. By now she had accommodated most of my fingers inside her, and I was almost lifting her off the ground as my hand tried desperately to comply with her screamed demands to finger her harder. \n\nFor one surreal moment, a mental picture of the situation visited me. In it, I was finger fucking my best friend\u2019s naked wife in front of a total stranger, and, at her request trying, to hurt her. This strange picture was silent, but for the sound of Nicky\u2019s appreciative juices and moans. The resulting brief feeling of guilt was overwhelmed by the desire emanating from my trousers to fuck her into some sort of orgasm-induced coma. The surreal out of body experience evaporated as Nicky screamed,\n\n\u201cOh god, hard! Hurt me! Finger my bum! Hard! Hard! Please. Oh please, hurt me! Please god, I can\u2019t take much more! Fuck! Oh thank god, I\u2019m coming!\u201d I moved my left hand and searched out her anus. A finger teased the rim of her little hole, but Nicky was in no mood for teasing.\n\n\u201cIn, in! Fuck! Put it in. Finger my bum.\u201d I slid the finger beyond her gatekeeper, Nicky\u2019s own juices easing entry.\n\n\u201cOuww, another. Another finger, no two! Now, please.\u201d Even with her helpful juices, it wasn\u2019t quite so easy to get another two inside her. The second finger slid in ok, but the third had to be forced in. Nicky was trapped between two invading hands, and as the third finger entered her she went onto tiptoe.\n\n\u201cOuww! Oh god, that hurt\u2019s so good. Don\u2019t stop, another. I\u2019m coming!\u201d I slipped another finger into her impossibly stretched little hole. This was clearly hurting her; she was still on tiptoe, her only way of offsetting some of the pain my fingers were inflicting on her. As well as I could, I began to work both hands in and out of her. As my fingers receded from her, Nicky dropped from her toes following them. This unreal picture continued for another few seconds, until she moaned and fell into an orgasm that seemed to continue for minutes. Initially, she went limp in my hands like a little rag doll. My fingers taking full advantage of her quiescence until her weight returned as she milked the final spasms of her orgasm.\n\n\u201cOh lover, I feel so alive with you. Just hold me! Please, hold me, I\u2019m a little dizzy.\u201d I was happy to cooperate; Nicky was shaking as I put both arms around her and held her while she slowly recovered. Suddenly we were both returned to reality by an unexpected interjection. \n\n\n\n\u201cBeauty itself doth of itself persuade the eyes of men without an orator.\u201d \n\nShit! I\u2019d completely forgotten about our Shakespearian friend. Startled, we both looked and saw he was no more than a few yards away. He waved, then turned and walked away reciting one last Shakespearian quote as he did:\n\n\u201cShe is a woman, therefore may be wooed; She is a woman, therefore may be won, She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved. What, man! more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of; and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.\u201d\n\nAs he disappeared from view, Nicky turned to me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Joe, I just got carried away. I\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, are you kidding? You\u2019ve just made two men deliriously happy.\u201d \n\n\u201cHave I, honestly? I just lost it, and I completely forgot about Mr. Shakespeare.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably given him the sight of his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think so? I just wanted to please you, but I got too excited and lost control. You\u2019ve just given me the most wonderful orgasm of my life; I thought that I was going to pass out. Do you want me to put my clothes on?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve not finished yet, so why not just put your coat on? I want to play some more in my enchanted glade.\u201d Nicky picked up her coat, and covered up.\n\n\u201cAnd my knickers?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I think that I\u2019d like to remove those myself later.\u201d Nicky smiled as she pulled them back into place. I collected her blouse, and shirt.\n\n\u201cCome on sexy.\u201d I took her hand and led her to the stepping-stones.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t get wet, will I? Is it safe to cross?\u201d\n\n\u201cLover, it\u2019s quite safe until we get to the other side\u2019 which is where I\u2019m going to I tell you what I\u2019m going to do with you.\u201d Typically, Nicky avoided eye contact and set off on her own across the stones. She made it the short distance to the other side easily, and greeted me as arrived. We kissed as if we\u2019d been apart for a year. Nicky hadn\u2019t bothered to fasten her coat, so I had her soft fleshy breasts against me. We needed to get to my destination quickly, or those distractions would lead me away from my goal, whatever that was.\n\nI led Nicky over the multi-coloured carpet of autumn leaves into the woodland for a few yards or so; eventually we arrived at the magical place that I\u2019d remembered. It seemed much further into the woodland than I\u2019d recalled, but the gentle sounds of the birds singing their welcome seemed familiar to me.\n\n\u201cOh Joe it\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Nicky looked around, and then went to sit on the fallen tree at the centre of the circular clearing, where I joined her. The glade was slightly different; an aborted logging exercise had stretched the clearing towards the south, which allowed the glade to be bathed in warm sunshine. \u201cThank you for bringing me here Joe, it\u2019s perfect. I really am sorry about before, but you drove me crazy. I\u2019ll make it up to you. I promise I will. Just tell me what I can do to make amends to you.\u201d In truth, Nicky\u2019s performance had probably been one of the sexual highlights of my life, and I didn\u2019t really understand her guilty feelings, but she seemed to need to serve. I could only imagine what the view looked like to our Shakespearian voyeur, and I did.",
        "\u201cPerhaps I should punish you?\u201d As I floated the suggestion it seemed like my \u2018little friend\u2019 doubled in size. He clearly liked the idea. \n\n\u201cPerhaps you should, do you think that I deserve it?\u201d Nicky replied eagerly, before averting her eyes. A million sparks shot through me as the significance of her reply registered.\n\n\u201cYes I think will punish you! You do deserve it don\u2019t you? Take off your coat.\u201d Nicky stood up, leaving her coat behind. She stood before me, naked but for her cotton knickers. I still had no idea what was I going to do, but Nicky threw me a lifeline.\n\n\u201cAre you going to slap me?\u201d My head spun, this naked vision in front of me suggested that I slap her. I tried desperately to conceal the shock, but it must have been obvious since Nicky averted her eyes again. Recovering, I said, \n\n\u201cYes, Nicky, I\u2019m afraid that I am going to slap you. But you have been such a bad girl so I want you to undo my fly and see what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d Nicky didn\u2019t answer, she knelt in front of me and undid my waist button and fly zipper, and then looked up at me.\n\n\u201cTake out my cock Nicky, see how hard it is for you.\u201d Nicky did what she\u2019d been told and held me with both hands. \u201cNow you know what to do with that, don\u2019t you Nicky?\u201d She tightened her grip, and slid her hands towards the base of my erection, looking at me as she licked the pre-come off the straining tip of my cock. Slipped her mouth over, her lips slowly moved down the length of my overexcited member. The sensation was unbelievable. Where the hell all that eager flesh had gone, I had no idea, but wherever it was it was wonderfully tight. I could feel Nicky nibbling the base with her teeth. I laid back and closed my eyes to shut out all other distractions. I imagined standing behind Nicky watching her as she slowly, and expertly, slipped my cock out of her mouth, nipping the tip with her teeth, before making it disappear again.\n\nThis image was almost too much to bear; I was close to bringing this to a premature end.\n\n\u201cLover, I need to be careful, you are too good at that. I\u2019m getting far too close to coming. Soon you\u2019ll feel a gallon of my excitement hitting the back of your throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm.\u201d She slipped down to the base again, and ran back up the length with her teeth.\n\n\u201cFuck, I pulled out quickly. Fuck that was close.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, have I done it wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong! Nicky, that was fucking wonderful. But I don\u2019t want to come yet.\u201d I looked at her, \u201ccan you see what you do to me? I\u2019m as hard as a rock. All I wants to do is cover you in warm sticky come. That\u2019s how excited you\u2019ve got me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmmm, are you going to punish me for being such a bad girl?\u201d There it was again, a definite request for a little punishment.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid that I am. How do you think that I should punish you?\u201d Nicky looked at the ground. \u201cPerhaps I should slap your lovely bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you make it very red?,\u201d she replied without looking up.\n\n\u201cOf course lover, very very red. Would you like that?\u201d I motioned for her to lie across my knees. Silently, she positioned herself across me, to perfection. Her cotton-clad bottom was under my hand ready for attention. I couldn\u2019t help but admire its beauty; it seemed such a shame to abuse it in any way. Strangely, the sight of her prostrate across me caused two conflicting emotions in me. The first was to protect her, she was giving herself to me unconditionally, and willingly, I couldn\u2019t abuse that trust. However the second emotion was not quite so honourable. \n\nThe view of her, and her willingness to participate had driven me to a state that I\u2019d rarely, if ever felt before, a fact that must have been all too obvious to Nicky, since my oversized cock was poking into her tummy.\n\n\u201cOh Nicky, you look so beautiful. Are you sure that I should still punish you?\u201d In reply, she began to peel her knickers away from her. I completed the job until they were around her ankles.\n\n\u201cOpen your legs!\u201d Nicky dropped the knickers onto the floor, and complied. My view was unbelievable; I spread her bottom cheeks and could see the results of our earlier endeavors, her bum-hole was still slightly open and red. I was still very nervous about this. \u201cYou must tell me immediately that you want me to stop, you will won\u2019t you?\u201d Nicky didn\u2019t reply. \n\nI tapped her naked bottom with the flat of my hand, making a delicious slapping sound. I tapped her a second time, this time a little harder, and watched as her white fleshy cheeks wobbled mouth-wateringly.\n\n\u201cPlease, harder, much harder, I\u2019ve been a really bad girl!\u201d\n\n\u201cOK! Tell me what you\u2019ve done to deserve this punishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been selfish, you are very special, I\u2019ll do anything to please you.\u201d I slapped her again, this time my hand landed much harder. Nicky gasped at the shock. \u201cOuww, oh yes that\u2019s it. I promise I\u2019ll be good for you.\u201d My \u2018little friend\u2019 was now in charge. He liked this task, and Nicky\u2019s reaction to it. Slap! Slap!\n\n\u201c Now lover, have you learned your lesson?\u201d Slap!\n\n\u201cOh god, again. Please, please.\u201d I slapped her again two or three times, each one harder than the previous one. Nicky gasped after each, but no cry for mercy came.\n\n\u201cTell me you\u2019ve learned your lesson lover.\u201d I slapped her again. Now her bottom was showing signs of distress with both cheeks displaying a red glow. \n\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll be a good girl, I promise I will. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I slapped her again, the hardest so far.\n\n\u201cOuww..Oh, anything, anything, anything you want me to. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d I slapped her three or four times, fairly hard.\n\n\u201cPlease Joe, harder. Please.\u201d By this stage, I was lost, I had no control whatsoever and still Nicky was encouraging me for more. I slapped her bottom hard, maybe a dozen times or more in succession, waiting after each one for her gorgeous bottom to settle after its sexy quivering. Initially Nicky screamed, but then became quiet and flaccid. Finally, tired, I stopped slapping her and looked at what I\u2019d done. Her bottom was very red, but something was wrong she was sobbing uncontrollably. I stood up, pulling her with me and hugged her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got carried away. Oh hell, I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry Joe,\u201d she sobbed.\n\n\u201cHave I hurt you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, you were perfect. Please don\u2019t apologize. I\u2019m sorry for crying, I\u2019m just so happy. You make me feel so alive.\u201d \n\n\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019d never forgive myself if I hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for crying Joe, I\u2019m really really sorry. Please don\u2019t worry when I cry, you\u2019re just so special to me, and no-one else has the ability to move me so much; I wanted and deserved to have my bottom smacked. And you did it so wonderfully, yes it did hurt, and my bottom is delightfully sore. But that\u2019s what I wanted; I needed you to punish me for being inconsiderate to you. I\u2019ll have a lovely tingling sensation for the next few days to help me to remember it.\u201d I wasn\u2019t absolutely sure that I understood, but Nicky seemed convinced by her answer, so I went along with the theme.\n\n\u201cOk then lover, but I want you to punish yourself now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I lay back on the fallen tree.\n\n\u201cSit on me, and put my cock into you. You\u2019ve made him very hard, and he wants to punish you himself for exposing yourself to him.\u201d Still sobbing, Nicky did as I\u2019d asked her, spread-eagle; she gasped as she slid me into her wet cunt.\n\n\u201cNow fuck yourself. And make sure that those gorgeous breasts really bounce for me.\u201d Nicky moaned softly, and then really went for it, lifting herself up before slamming down onto me, forcing my cock deep into her. Very aroused, I was much too big for her, and she winced each time we reached her limit, but she didn\u2019t stop her tits bouncing fabulously as she approached yet another orgasm.\n\n\u201cStop! Stop lover,\u201d Nicky stopped, shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n\n\u201cNothing, just stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, please I\u2019m coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I know you are Nicky, and this one will be different. You are not allowed any more movement. I want you to come, but you mustn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhh, please. Don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d She was squirming, rubbing her clitoris against me.\n\n\u201cStop. Don\u2019t move!\u201d I said sharply.\n\n\u201cOhh, I need to come please. Please!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not yet. Tell me what you are going to do to please me, if I allow you to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything, anything. Just fuck me, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god, I need to come. I\u2019ll suck you, and I\u2019ll push it right down my throat for you.\u201d Again, she rubbed her clitoris against me.\n\n\u201cStop! Have I given you permission to move yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whimpered.\n\n\u201cSo don\u2019t move! What else are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease let me come. Please,\u201d she begged.\n\n\u201cNo! Tell me what else?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you, hard,\u201d she replied desperately.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not yet!\u201d\n\n\u201cOhh please. I need to come, so badly.\u201d She began to sob again.\n\n\u201cAnswer me! Where?\u201d She remained absolutely still as she wept,\n\n\u201cIn my mouth, my cunt, my bum, anywhere you want. Oh god, I\u2019ll fuck you hard, anywhere you like, until it hurts. You can make it hurt me. I\u2019ll do anything for you, I promise I will, let me come. Please, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d I didn\u2019t like her crying, but I wondered why my cock grew harder each time she did? Nicky had clearly been teased enough.\n\n\u201cOk lover, but don\u2019t move yet! I\u2019ll allow you to come soon, but on one condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything, anything. Oh thank you. Please, just fuck me,\u201d she replied tears streaming down her cheeks and falling onto my chest.\n\n\u201cYou must do it hard. I want to see those lovely breasts bouncing as you come on me.\u201d I pulled and stretched her nipples upwards, and then let them go. Her breasts dropped perfectly, settling beautifully back into their normal lovely state. \u201cLike that!\u201d \n\n\u201cNow? Please.. now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes now, but remember my instructions.\u201d Nicky lifted herself up, and then impaled herself onto me. She gasped as my cock painfully found her limit, and beyond. For the next few moments I had real difficulty concentrating, as she repeatedly threw herself upon me. Withdrawing, then slamming herself down onto my cock again. In an attempt to keep control, I tried to plot a route from Southampton to Lhasa without flying through Chinese airspace. I was successful in avoiding orgasm, but the sight of her breasts demonstrating their abilities to move independently, coupled with the sound of Nicky as she approached orgasm severely tested me. Suddenly she began to scream.\n\n\u201cYes, yes. Oh fuck.\u201d She stopped and threw her head back. I watched as her cunt repeatedly gripped me, the violent involuntary orgasmic waves passing through her. After a few seconds we were both wet through. Nicky fell forward, her head on my shoulder. \u201cOhh Fuck! I\u2019m coming again.\u201d I lay there and felt her shudder through yet another climax. \u201cOh god, I\u2019m sorry Joe I just can\u2019t control myself with you. I\u2019m ready to come again! I\u2019ve got to stop and to do something for you. Tell me what to do. Anything. Make me be your bad girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, lover, you\u2019ve made a mess around my cock with your come. Maybe you\u2019d like to clean me up? But first, I want to drink every drop of your come.\u201d Nicky thought for a minute, and then stood up, leaving my disappointed and sticky erection to fall flat onto my stomach. She turned around, straddling me again, exchanging my view of her gorgeous breasts for one of her wonderful bottom. I positively purred in appreciation as she bent down to reveal herself for me. She seemed a little reluctant, or nervous, so I pulled her towards me until my tongue made contact with her vaginal lips. \n\n\u201cOh god!\u201d I ignored her and slowly, and repeatedly, traced the delicious journey along the inside of each swollen rim to her anus, and then back to her clitoris, lapping up her delicious juices. Slowly, Nicky seemed to relax, and take over some control. She pushed a little more, allowing my tongue to probe deeper into her. As the tip touched her tiny little hole, she moaned and reached around pulling her bottom cheeks apart. \u201cAm I doing it right? Am I? Tell me what to do. Make me be a really naughty girl for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm. why don\u2019t you imagine what a bad girl would do, and do it for me? In reply, she pushed back against my invading tongue.\n\n\u201cLick my bum. Put a finger in me! Please.\u201d I withdrew a little, and eased my thumb up against her \n\nCan you imagine my view of you, as I lick your cunt and bottom? Look at my cock, how hard it is for you. Would you like me to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cOhh fuck, yes!\u201d She pushed back against my probing tongue. \u201cOhh no, no, please I\u2019m coming again!\u201d I tried desperately to suck in air, as Nicky smothered me squirting her delicious ambrosia over me. \u201cOh God, Joe, please stop. I can\u2019t control myself with you; I could come another hundred times. All I want now is to make you come, I\u2019m desperate to repay you. Fuck me until you lose control, and shoot your lovely juice into me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk lover, I\u2019ll just lie here while you repay me.\u201d Nicky stood up in all her naked glory, looking gorgeous in the midday sunshine. She straddled me again, sliding her cunt along my straining erection.\n\n\u201cNow what would a dirty girl do in these circumstances?\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cAhh I know,\u201d she said taking me in hand and guiding the tip of my eager associate against her anus. \u201cOhh he\u2019ll enjoy me being dirty with him, won\u2019t he?\u201d I closed my eyes to savour what was to come. Nicky slowly, and steadily increased the pressure on the gatekeeper of her tightest little hole, but to no avail, in spite of all the attention earlier, she remained firmly shut. Each time the pressure reached a maximum, to our immense frustration, my associate slipped away from his goal.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry lover, I can wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d She reached around, with her other hand, her fingers still around the tip of my cock. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this! I\u2019ll open it up for you.\u201d The pressure increased again, and suddenly the head of my cock slipped effortlessly beyond her resolute defences into her wonderful tight little chamber. \u201cOhh, that feels so good. Push. Now fuck me as hard as I can take it.\u201d Not one to turn down an invitation like that, I pushed hard, completing the rest of the job in almost one go. The feeling was incredible. It hurt like hell, but I couldn\u2019t wait before withdrawing and slamming it home again. Nicky\u2019s expression told me that I was hurting her, but she stood her ground encouraging me as stroke after stroke abused her, disappearing up to her limit. This couldn\u2019t last long. The sight of her tits bouncing, and the sensations induced by her tightest hole on my desperate cock made an early conclusion inevitable.\n\n\u201cSorry Nicky, but I can\u2019t hold it any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold my tits. Fuck me. Fuck me hard. I want to felel you shooting your lovely come into my bottom. I want to feel you fucking my tiny bottom until you come.\u201d She took my balls in hand. That pretty much did the trick for me. I stopped moving, my muscles refusing to respond as the spasms slowly built to a maximum. Eventually I pushed again and groaned as my overdue come began its short journey from the tip of my toes into her bottom.\n\n\u201cYes yes. That feels so good. Fuck me, use me like a dirty girl.\u201d That encouragement competed the job, over the next few glorious come filled strokes, I squirted the rest of my enthusiastic jism into her. \n\n\u201cOh god Nicky, that was fucking fantastic.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made my bum sore. Was I dirty enough for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicky, you were absolutely wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cNicky, my dick is still in your bum! As soon as I pull out, a gallon of my come is going to run out onto your legs. Is that dirty enough for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOhh yes,\u201d she giggled. It seemed an appropriate time to withdraw, so very reluctantly I did.\n\n\u201cTold you so.\u201d I laughed as she looked at the little puddle of fresh come on her hand.\n\n\u201cMmm, she licked it clean. It tastes lovely.\u201d Eventually, I recovered enough to stand up. Nicky put on her skirt and blouse as I put on my clothes. I still had her knickers in my pocket, and she didn\u2019t ask for them so I didn\u2019t volunteer to return them. I did give her my coat though, but she decided to carry it. Slowly normal senses were being restored, and the sounds of outraged birds squawked their disapproval, or perhaps envy.\n\n\u201cCome on sexy, time to take you home fucked!\u201d We walked hand in hand, and left the woodland creatures behind, no doubt discussing amongst themselves what they\u2019d seen. We crossed the stepping-stones, and I helped Nicky up onto the stile crossing the wall.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d I lifted up her skirt, and pulled her reddened bottom cheeks apart. \u201cOh Nicky, you won\u2019t believe this view!\u201d Her bottom was still open, with two or three lines of come leaking down onto her legs. Nicky showed no signs of embarrassment; she just stood there as I enjoyed the view. Eventually, I let her go and urged, \u201cSorry Nicky, hurry to the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, please forgive me for this, but you are too tempting!\u201d I took her hand and dragged her the short distance to the car. \u201cPut your hands on the car!\u201d Undoing my zipper, I said, \u201cGod Nicky, I hope that you\u2019ll forgive me for this.\u201d Hurriedly, I lifted her skirt and forced my cock back into her anus. I apologized again, \u201cSorry Nicky!\u201d Somehow that seemed inadequate. Slipping easily into her, I began to fuck her hard. No thoughts of the Hindu Kush or Lhasa this time, no attempt to hold myself back, simply an attempt to come, as soon a possible, and as far into her as I could, Nicky made absolutely no protest, she simply stood there.\n\nI was having difficulty coming, I grabbed her breasts and stood her up. Kissing her, I whispered \u201csorry,\u201d again. Suddenly a familiar sensation confirmed the inevitable, I was coming again. \u201cOh god I\u2019m sorry Nicky, I\u2019m so so sorry. Ohh!\u201d Time after time, my hard cock slammed into her abused bottom, lifting her off the floor, each stroke injecting a fresh donation of come until I had no more left to give to her. Even then, I continued to fuck her, reluctant to concede that it was over. \n\nFinally, I collapsed onto her, both of us falling onto the car. As I recovered my breath, I heard her sobbing. \u201cOh god, I\u2019m sorry Nicky!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no! I\u2019m just being stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh please don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019ve hurt you. It was on the stile, I..\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she was now crying uncontrollably, \u201cIt\u2019s the passion. I\u2019ve never experienced such passion before!\u201d she sobbed. The uncomfortable truth was nor had I.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve not hurt you?\u201d She smiled and kissed me, salty tears on her lips.\n\n\u201cYes you\u2019ve hurt me, you horrid horrid man, you can\u2019t imagine how much. My bottom is really sore, but it was the most wonderful experience I\u2019ve ever had. I knew you had to do it; you really needed to fuck me, whatever. You didn\u2019t consider me at all; for the first time, you just needed to fuck me. You really needed me. Finally, I feel like I\u2019ve given myself to you, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes of course it does lover, and I\u2019m flattered.\u201d A nearby bird helped return my senses to normality chirruping its approval, or perhaps not. However, reality was the pair of us face down on my car, with Nicky half naked and me still inside her bum.. \n\n\u201cI guess I should take it out?\u201d Nicky didn\u2019t reply, she just squeezed my hand. She moaned softly as I reluctantly withdrew from her. As we stood up and parted, I handed her her knickers and said, \u201cyou\u2019ll probably need these.\u201d \n\n\u201cMmm, yes I think so. I don\u2019t think that my bottom will ever be the same again after that!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t get me started again Nicky.\u201d She put on my coat, and then her knickers.\n\n\u201cGod how much have you given me? I\u2019m wet through.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I had. All I had lover, you\u2019ve got it all.\u201d She smiled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. Come on, we need to get you back to work. You can think about me walking about all day with your lovely come running out of my bum.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god Nicky, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done to deserve you.\u201d \n\n\u201cEverything, Joe. Just everything. You\u2019ve shown me what passion really means. Thank you so much for that. Promise me that you\u2019ll use me whenever you want to. I want to feel like that again.\u201d",
        "\u201cOf course Nicky, of course I will. If you really want me to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I do. I\u2019ll do anything just to feel like that again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too, thanks Nicky.\u201d \n\nAs I drove home, Nicky chatted away happily. But I was a little subdued. Why was I more than a little afraid? I\u2019d just felt a passion that I\u2019d never experienced before in my life. Why the hell was I frightened? Why didn\u2019t I feel good?\n\n\n\nDear Reader, \n\nI hope that you've enjoyed this story, and I welcome and value your feedback.
