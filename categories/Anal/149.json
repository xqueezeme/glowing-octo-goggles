        "He entered the room like a wild cat stalking his prey. She was instantly on alert, the hairs on the nape of her neck standing up. He scanned the tables, seeking her out. She slid down a little farther in her chair, hoping to delay the inevitable. His eyes locked on her, and his powerful stride brought him to the table. She sat up straighter, cleared her throat, and huskily said, \"Hi Jon, how are you?\"\n\nHe pulled out a chair and sat opposite her, picked up a menu, and signaled the waiter. He ordered a drink, and sent the waiter away, not bothering to ask Mel if she wanted anything. He scanned the menu, and sipped the drink after it was delivered, all before even acknowledging she was there. When it seemed as though he finally noticed she was there, he replied simply, \"I'm fine.\"\n\nMel picked up her own menu, hiding behind it. She didn't want him to see the tears shimmering in her eyes. The bastard broke her heart, and had the nerve to treat her like this? She felt the slow burn of hate bubble up in her chest, not for the first time since their divorce. He'd asked for this meeting, yet was acting like he was doing her some big favor.\n\nThe waiter came, they ordered, and a long uncomfortable silence ensued. He watched the room, always on the lookout for something or someone that would interest him. And she stared down at her hands, folded tightly in her lap. She took a long, shaky breath, and took a sip of her ice water. She waited for him to get on with this, she needed to get back to her office.\n\n\"So, how do you like the office I paid for?\" he finally broke his silence.\n\nHe paid for? What the hell? She wrote the checks for her office remodel out of her personal account. The gall of this man!\n\n\"I like the office I paid for just fine,\" came her clipped retort.\n\nHe looked at her over his whiskey, raised his eyebrows a fraction, and shook his head. He put his glass down, and said, \"You paid for? That was my money, doll. You may have signed the checks, but it was MY money in that account.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, Jon. I'm not going to argue dollars and cents with you. What do you want?\" Mel asked, exasperation clearly evident in her voice.\n\nHe looked at her. She was tall, nearly 5'10\", and had a voluptuous body. Curves in all the places women should have them, and high, perky breasts. Long black hair, and silver eyes made her a woman any man would lust after. And he was one of those men. He'd wanted her the first moment he'd laid eyes on her. \n\nShe watched him cautiously, peeking at him from under her long lashes. He was the most physically attractive man she'd ever met. Much taller than she at 6'5\", and athletically built, she had been unable to resist him. His big brown eyes and dimples had charmed her into bed faster than she cared to remember.\n\nThey had made quite the couple, striking in looks and successful in their respective careers. He was a powerful attorney, and she an advertising executive. Their divorce had been civil, if not amicable, and each had left with what they came in with. Or so she'd thought until he made that obscure remark about her office renovations.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, looked at her with his brooding eyes and said, \"We missed something in the divorce, a piece of property. We need to decide what to do with it so I can clear my books before year end. I don't want to pay taxes on it if you want to keep it.\"\n\nShe tried to think of anything they may have forgotten about, but her mind was drawing a blank. \"What property? I honestly can't think of anything.\"\n\n\"The cabin at the lake. We were only there once, when we first started dating. I'm not surprised we didn't think of it. It's been years.\" Jon took a healthy sip of his whiskey, the ice tinkling in his glass.\n\nThe waiter brought their food, and talking ceased while they ate. Mel remembered the cabin. It was small, but homey. She thought back to their time there, and had a brief flash of naked lust and total bliss. They'd been so happy and in love then. No wonder they'd forgotten about it, they hadn't been happy together for a long time. \n\nIt was no one's fault, really. They'd just gotten so busy with their careers, they lost touch with each other. And when she'd found out about his lover, she hadn't been all that surprised. It had broken her heart, but it hadn't come as a complete shock. He'd never believed that she hadn't taken a lover. In fact, she hadn't been with a man since Jon. \n\nThe deep timbre of his voice brought her back from her wool gathering. \"So, I was thinking that after lunch, we could run up there. Take a look around. See if either of us wants the place or if we should sell it. What do you think?\"\n\n\"You mean now?\" she asked, looking up at him quizzically.\n\n\"Yes now. I told you, I want to get this cleared up as soon as possible. Today,\" he acidly replied.\n\n\"I'll have to call the office, I may have some appointments lined up for this afternoon,\" she tossed back at him, ice in her voice.\n\n\"Fine, call. Let's get this over with,\" he shot back at her venomously.\n\nShe dug in her purse, pulled out her cell, and called her secretary. Kris explained that she only had one appointment for that afternoon, and she could easily call and reschedule that. Mel thanked her, hung up her phone, and tossed it back in her bag.\n\n\"Are you happy now?\" she bitterly asked her ex, shooting daggers at him with her icy eyes.\n\n\"Babe, I haven't been happy since we met,\" his voice low with repressed anger.\n\nThey finished eating in silence. He went to pay the check, and she went to the restroom before their long drive. She looked at herself as she washed her hands. She looked good, if a little tired. She'd thought 30 would make her look older, more mature. It hadn't. She still looked like a college freshman. She touched up her eye make up, brushed her hair, and went out to face her nemesis.\n\nHe was already outside waiting in his car when she emerged from the restaurant. He looked even more dangerous wrapped in his low slung sports car. He revved the engine in impatience, urging her to hurry up.\n\nShe opened the door and dropped into the passenger seat. He didn't even wait for her door to close before hitting the accelerator and peeling away from the curb. She looked over at him in annoyance while she buckled her seat belt. He seemed impervious to her ire, all his attention on the road.\n\nThey drove along in tense silence, neither wanting to say anything that might cause another spat. The drive was about 3 hours long, and after about the first 30 minutes, Mel was starting to get sleepy. She hadn't slept well the night before, nervous about her intended meeting today. Her head lolling onto her shoulder, her eyes slowly closing, Mel fell asleep.\n\nHe looked over at her, heard her light breathing, and knew she'd drifted to sleep. She'd looked tired, and he'd wondered if things had been rough at work. He knew how hard it had been for him to open his own practice, and thought maybe she was having a tough go of it on her own. She'd always been so damned independent, but as the saying goes, the harder they fall.\n\nThe drive to the lake was uneventful. He was just pulling up to the cabin when he reached over and shook Mel's shoulder. \"Hey, Sleeping Beauty, rise and shine.\"\n\nHer eyes blinked open to see a forest of trees out her window. She sat up straighter, and winced. Her neck was out of whack from being craned to one side for so long. She brought her hand up to rub the kink out. Jon was already half out of the car, breathing in deeply and stretching his arms above his head.\n\nShe watched the play of muscles under his shirt, remembering the way they'd flexed under her hands. He really did have an amazing body, she had to grudgingly admit to herself. No amount of animosity would make her lie to herself about that.\n\nShe opened her door, repeated his stretch, and looked around. It truly was a beautiful place, and she couldn't believe they'd both forgotten about it. Dense trees lined one side of the gravel drive. And the view to the lake on the other side was magnificent. A looping, lazy, path flowed down to the waters edge. The water reflecting the clear sky, making it a deep azure blue.\n\nJon turned to her, holding the keys up, and gestured toward the cabin, \"Shall we?\"\n\nShe nodded her assent, and followed him up to the cabin. He unlocked the door and stepped inside. She walked in after him and was assailed with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Dark green walls, hardwood floors, and the huge fireplace along the far wall greeted her. She thought back to the one time they'd been here, the hours they'd spent making love in front of the fireplace. She remembered they'd tried to make popcorn over the fire, and smoke had filled the room along with their laughter. They'd had more success toasting marshmallows. She smiled at the flashback.\n\nHe watched her, saw every emotion that crossed her face. Pain, sorrow, laughter. He was curious to know what she was thinking, his own thoughts a jumbled mass of random memories. They'd gone skinny dipping in the cool water, drying each other with their tongues. He'd shown off for her, climbing one of the trees out by the driveway. She'd laughed up at him, the sun shining in her eyes. \n\nThey each walked around the front room, running their hands over walls, furniture. They met in front of the door leading to the bedroom, neither of them looking at the other. Jon reached out and turned the knob, pushing the door open. \n\nThe room was tiny, the only piece of furniture occupying the room being a massive four post bed. Two small rugs on either side of the floor, and a large picture on the wall opposite the bed the only other adornments. \n\nHer breath hitched in her chest at the sight of that bed. She remembered the long nights, and days, they'd spent loving each other in it. So much love and laughter had existed between them then.\n\nShe was busy looking at the room, Jon was busy looking at her. Again, the play of emotions on her face drew all his interest. She truly was an open book. Every thought, every emotion showed on her face, nothing was sacred. It was one of the things that had made him fall in love with her in the first place. \n\nShe felt him watching her, and turned to look at him. His face betrayed none of his feelings, something she had had to get used to. His emotions always hidden beneath his cool veneer. He was always in control, never let himself truly go. It was one of the things that had pulled them apart. \n\n\"Seen enough?\" he asked her, cocking one eyebrow.\n\n\"Yes. I think you should keep this place. It was yours before we...married...and it should stay yours now,\" her reply made in a quiet voice.\n\n\"Well, I don't want it. I'll never come up here. I guess we'll call a realtor and get the place listed,\" Jon's words clipped.\n\n\"If you want to sell it, that's fine, but I want no part of it. As I said, it was yours, and I really have no claim on it,\" Mel told him as she turned to walk out of the bedroom.\n\n\"Fine. That's settled. Let's get out of here,\" Tim's tone angry as he pulled the bedroom door shut firmly behind him.\n\nThey walked to the door, Mel giving the fireplace one last look, then headed outside. Making their way to the car, neither of them said anything. Mel opened her door, sat down hard, and buckled her seat belt. It seemed like such a long way to come for nothing. \n\nJon got into his seat behind the wheel. His jaw set in anger, he jammed the key in the ignition, turned it, and nothing happened. He tried again and still nothing happened. He checked that the car was in gear, pumped the clutch a few times, turned the key, and again got no response from the car. Slamming his hand against the steering wheel, he yanked up the handle on the door. He reached down to pull the hood latch and got out.\n\nMel watched him stalk to the front of the car and bend to open the hood. It blocked most of her view. All she was able to see were his forearms moving around, pulling this, pushing that. \n\n\"Get behind the wheel and try it,\" he commanded from under the hood. Mel undid her belt and crawled over the gearshift. She pushed down the clutch and turned the key. Yet again, nothing happened.\n\n\"Are you going to try it or what?\" his voice dripping with disdain.\n\n\"I did, damn it,\" she shouted back.\n\nShe heard his angry grunt as he tried to figure out what was wrong with his car.\n\n\"Again,\" he yelled at her. She turned it, and got a big, fat nothing.\n\n\"Nope, nothing,\" she yelled back at him. She was beginning to enjoy this. She knew how demeaning this would be to his manhood.\n\nHe came back around the car, flung open his door and grabbed his jacket off the back of his seat. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his cell. She watched as he flipped it open and began walking around in circles.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Trying to get a fucking signal, what's it look like?\" he gave her a blistering stare.\n\nShe reached over and grabbed her purse. Pulling out her cell, she too got out of the car. She flipped her phone open, only to see that she had no signal either.\n\n\"You got anything?\" Jon asked her.\n\nMel shook her head in frustration. Jon stalked back over to his car, and again attacked the engine, desperate to find the problem. After a half dozen or so tweaks, he got back in and tried the key again. Still nothing.\n\nIt was starting to get dark now. He was debating whether or not he'd have enough time to jog somewhere to get some help before full darkness was upon them. He didn't think so.\n\n\"I guess we're stuck here for the night,\" he looked over at Mel.\n\nShe looked back at him, \"Are you serious? Can't we just walk somewhere and get someone to come help us?\"\n\n\"It's going to be dark in less than an hour. Any place we could walk to is going to take a lot longer than that. And by the time we got there, they'd probably be closed anyway.\"\n\nJon grabbed the keys and got out, slamming his car door behind him. He walked around to the front of the car and shut the hood. Turning towards the cabin he looked back at Mel, \"You coming or what?\"\n\nLetting out an exasperated sigh, Mel followed him. Back in the cabin, Mel sank down onto the couch while Jon went into the kitchen. She heard the sound of doors opening and closing and looked over heard shoulder, curious.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she shouted out.\n\n\"Looking to see if there's anything to eat in here. Could be a long night with no food,\" his voice sounding like it was coming from a cave.\n\nShe walked out to the kitchen to see what he was up to. She found him on his hands and knees, reaching back into a cupboard by the floor. She got an eyeful of his rounded butt poking up in the air. He had a nice ass, toned and muscular. Her hands itched to grab it, and she was stunned at the thought.\n\nHe sat up on his haunches, and was surprised to see her standing there. He held up his hands for her perusal. One can of peaches, and a box of crackers that apparently even the mice hadn't wanted. \"And I found a bottle of wine way back in the pantry,\" he said, pointing the can towards the counter. \n\n\"Hmmm, a real feast. Peaches, crackers, and wine. You sure know how to treat a gal,\" sarcasm oozing with every word Mel said, a smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hey, I'm a classy guy, what can I say,\" Jon smiled back as he stood with his prizes.\n\nShe opened some drawers, looking for a can opener. \"Voila!\" she exclaimed, holding it up for him to see. \"And it has a corkscrew.\"\n\nHe chuckled despite himself, seeing a twinkle in her eyes. He handed her the box of crackers, and went about opening the peaches. A few more drawer explorations, and Mel was able to find a fork. However, a quick perusal of the remaining cupboards failed to turn up any dishes. She did find another can of food, this one a dusty, dented can of peas. One look at each other, and she put them back, as they both despised peas.\n\nGrabbing their food, and the wine, they walked back into the sitting room. Each taking a spot on opposite ends of the couch, they sat, and laid their repast on the small coffee table.\n\n\"It's getting a little chilly in here, I wonder if there's still any wood out back,\" Jon mused aloud as he went over towards the door that led out to the back of the cabin. Opening the door and peering around the corner, Mel heard him utter, \"Well whatta ya know.\"\n\nHe disappeared out the door, returning a few seconds later, his arms laden with wood. He crossed to the fireplace and dropped his cargo on the floor. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his gold lighter. She didn't know why he carried it anymore, he'd quit smoking 4 years ago. But seeing it now, she was grateful he did, as a chill started to creep into her bones.\n\nHe got up and came back to the table, reaching down, he grabbed the box of crackers. He ripped the box open and set the inner packages back down. Tossing a few logs into the fireplace, he grabbed his lighter and lit the box. He pushed the flaming cardboard under the logs. Within a few minutes, he had a respectable fire going.\n\n\"You know, it's going to be a whole lot warmer over here,\" he said, looking back at Mel. \"Grab the food and get over here.\" Jon got up and walked across the room, going into the bedroom. He emerged as Mel was sitting down in front of the fire. In his hands was the comforter from the bed.\n\nSitting down cross legged next to Mel, he wrapped the blanket around his shoulders. He held one edge open to her, his arm stretched out, \"Misery loves company.\"\n\nShe thought for about a half a second, then scooted in close to him, feeling him drape the blanket around her. They sat in comfortable silence for a while. The only sounds the crackle of the fire and their cracker crunches.\n\n\"What the hell happened to us, Mel? Where did the people that sat here all those years ago go?\" she heard Jon ask quietly from beside her.\n\n\"I don't know. Too much work, not enough us time. And then there was Jacy. She didn't help,\" she knew bringing his lover up would probably start a fight, but he'd asked.\n\n\"Yeah, she was a huge mistake. She was what tipped the scales for you, huh?\" he looked over at her, the firelight dancing in his liquid brown eyes.\n\n\"It's water under the bridge now. We've moved on. Let's just get through tonight as peacefully as we can, ok?\" \n\nShe reached for the can of peaches, brushing her hand over his leg to get them. The fork was out of her reach. \"Hand me that fork, would you?\" she asked him.\n\n\"This fork here?\" he teased, holding it up over his head.\n\n\"Yes, that fork. Hand it over,\" she tried to grab it, but it was up too high for her.\n\nHe switched hands, holding it out away from her even farther, laughing as she lunged for it. \"Knock it off. Give me the damn fork, you ass,\" Mel laughed. She was starting to stand, trying to grab the fork from him, when her leg caught on the edge of the blanket, tumbling her across his lap.\n\nHe laughed even harder, enjoying the sight of her upturned bottom laying over his legs. He took the fork and playfully poked her in the ass with it.\n\n\"Hey!\" Mel yelped. She gained her balance, and pushed up off his lap. She again made a grab for the fork, and he easily dodged her. She looked down into his face, laughter crinkling the corners of his eyes.\n\n\"You're letting all the cold air in. Sit down and I'll let you have it,\" Jon offered. Mel gave him one long look, then sat back down, fixing the blanket back around them. She held her hand out to him, waiting for him to hand her the fork. He reached for the peaches instead.\n\n\"Hey!\" she yelled at him again, watching as he dipped the fork into the can.\n\nJon poked a peach with the fork, and yanked it out of the tin. He let the juice drip off, then offered the peach to Mel.\n\nShe watched him warily, waiting for the tease, knowing he was going to pull the fork back the second she leaned for it. But he just sat there, waiting for her. She leaned over, her mouth opening, craning her neck. She felt him slide the peach into her waiting mouth. The flavor of the fruit burst in her mouth. She closed her eyes, savoring the flavor.",
        "Jon watched her, saw her swirling the peach in her mouth, on her tongue. Spying a small drop of fruit juice on her full bottom lip, his breath quickened. He leaned over to her, and licked the tiny droplet off her lip. The contact jolted through his body straight to his groin. \n\nMel's eyes flew open at his lick. Who would have thought that such a light touch would cause such a deep reaction. She'd felt it all the way to her toes. Her nipples hardened painfully, and she felt her moist center contract.\n\nJon looked into Mel's eyes, trying to read her. He noted her uneven breathing, and the light flush on her skin. Leaning over again, he brushed his lips across hers. He felt a zing, and his loins tightened. He pressed his lips to hers a second time, more fully and applying more pressure. His heart began to beat erratically. This was how it had been when they'd first been together. Every touch a spark that led to a roaring inferno.\n\nHis first kiss was like a warm breeze, soft and tender. His second was like the beginning of a storm, the air electric. She leaned into him, wanting to deepen the kiss he'd started. She opened her mouth, slipping her tongue out to lick his lips. His lips parted under her tutelage, allowing her access, while slipping his tongue out to tangle with hers. His arms circled her, pulling her tightly to him, feeling her hard nipples pressing into his chest. \n\nThe warmth of the fire was nothing compared to the heat building between them. Mel moved closer to Jon, her hands on his thighs, pushing her up closer to his mouth. His skin was warm under the material of his pants, and she felt his muscles jump at her touch. He grabbed her more fully and pulled her onto his lap. She tilted her head back, wanting to feel his hot mouth on her neck.\n\nJon nuzzled her ear, sliding his tongue down the side of her neck. She arched her back, allowing him more access. He reached up to fondle one of her breasts, the nipple hard against the palm of his hand. He squeezed it roughly, the way he knew she liked it, before pinching the hard nub. \n\nShe moaned and instinctively moved her body closer to his, wanting his touch. Mel slid her hands up under the back of his shirt, clutching at him, digging her nails into his taut flesh. She craved him, wanted to devour him. \n\nJon slid her off his lap, laying her down on the rug in front of the fireplace. Leaning over her, he kissed her passionately, while his hands found the buttons on her blouse. With lightening speed, he had her shirt open and was flicking his tongue on the tops of her tits. Sucking the firm flesh into his mouth, leaving love bites in his path. He bent and nipped one of her tightened nipples with his teeth, enjoying the low groan that escaped from her.\n\nHer hands roamed his chest, stopping now and then to tug open a button. Pulling his shirt the rest of the way out of his trousers, she opened it, loving the feel of the hardness of his chest. She tweaked each of his small nipples, twisting them in her fingers. \n\nHis hands found the buttons of her slacks, while his mouth left a moist trail down her stomach, pausing to flitter his tongue in her belly button. He slid her slacks over her hips, she lifted her ass to help him. With her pants off, Mel lay in nothing but her bra and panties, the fire light making dancing shadows on her skin. Jon ran his tongue under the waistband of her lacy panties, his hand coming up to cup her sex. She parted her legs, her shaky fingers seeking out the button on his pants. \n\nHe finished undoing his pants and quickly took them off, shaking his shirt off as well. He covered his body with hers, and just kissed her. Their bodies fit together so well, a perfect match really. His slid his hips, placing himself between her legs. She began a slow roll of her lower body, rubbing her throbbing clit against the stiffness of his tool. It had been so long since she had felt actual man flesh, and she was begging for release.\n\nHis body responded to hers, grinding his pulsating cock hard against her in small circles. Mel felt her climax come bubbling up from low in her belly. With a loud moan and a thrust of her hips, she broke, her body trembling as the waves of her orgasm ebbed. \n\nJon lay atop Mel, feeling her come down from her climax. He kissed her neck, nibbled on her shoulder, and waited for her next move. He felt her hands slide down his back to grab his tight cheeks, slipping her hands under the material. He raised himself off of her, and unclipped the clasp of her bra nestled between her breasts. He suckled each nipple in turn, biting them roughly then laving them softly to ease the pain. \n\nSliding one large hand down her torso, he slipped it beneath her panties, one thick finger slipping between her lips to find her drenched. He eased his finger into her wet hole, curving it up slightly to find her G spot. He felt her muscles clench when his finger grazed over it, a guttural moan the only sound she made. With his other hand, he removed the black lace covering her pussy, dragging her panties down with a hard tug, tearing them off of her. \n\nMel had always liked it a little rough, and feeling Jon rip her panties from her body while his finger played over her G spot had her at the edge of another orgasm. She felt the tip of his tongue flick over her engorged clit like a red hot poker shooting up through her pussy. Reaching out she grabbed his hair in her hands and pulled his face roughly against her cunt, growling out a husky, \"Eat me!!\"\n\nJon thought she was going to rip his hair out, but he dove into her moist center, sucking her love juices out of her. Nipping her tight button, adding a second finger to thrum against her sacred spot, Jon loved her the only way he truly new how to. And when her second orgasm wracked her body, he held on tightly, licking and sucking her dry.\n\nMel came crashing back into her body, chest heaving, heart beating an irregular staccato. She felt Jon's body sliding up hers, his mouth coming down on hers hard. He'd lost his underwear at some point, as she could feel the thick knob of his cock pressing against her opening. Smashing his lips against hers, he pushed up quickly, thrusting his cock up into her roughly. \n\nHis hands grabbed her hips in a death grip, leaving bruises that would take days to fade. Holding her down, he pounded into her hole relentlessly. Harder and harder he thrust into her, driving her hard against the floor. She could feel the fat head of his prick ramming against her cervix, a heady mixture of pleasure and pain. \n\nJon came quickly, the surge of his seed splashing inside her tight cavern. He dropped onto Mel, knocking the wind from her. His sweat covered body slick in the glow from the fire. He lay on top of her, getting his breath back. Pushing up slightly, he looked into her eyes, \"I'll last longer next time, I promise.\"\n\nMel gave him a small smile, and squeezed her pussy muscles tight. \"You'd better . It was over so fast I hardly felt a thing.\"\n\nFeeling her clench him, Jon hissed, his cock getting hard again already. He began a slow rhythm, sliding back and forth in her, feeling the blood flood to his pole. Together, they rocked their hips, building their passions. He lifted her legs, urging her to wrap them around his middle. She obliged, pulling him tight to her. Leaning back slightly, he arched his hips up, poking until he hit her G spot with his turgid member.\n\nShe bit her lip and groaned when his tool found that elusive spot deep inside her walls. Reaching down between her legs, she rubbed two fingers hard against her clit, pinching it between her fingers when the rubbing was no longer enough. Jon looked down at their joined bodies, watching her play with herself. It was always such a turn on for him to see her rub herself so lewdly. They'd spent many a night watching each other masturbate, before finally jumping each other in a frenzy of wanton lust.\n\nHer fingers wet and sticky with her own cum, Mel reached back and slid her fingers between Jon's ass cheeks. She rubbed her juice coated fingers over his anus before slipping one finger into his tight back door. She knew how this got him going, and prepared herself for the ride.\n\nJon began pumping into her harder, his cock matching the same thrusting rhythm as the finger invading his asshole. They fucked each other, each keeping pace, until with a final thrust, Mel tipped over the edge. As her climax overtook her, her finger rammed into his backdoor, brushing against his sensitive prostate gland. \n\nFeeling the nails of one of her hands drag down his back, and the finger in his tight hole hit his \"G spot,\" Jon exploded. The hot rush of his cum jetting up from his nuts and out into her pussy. He rolled off of her, laying back on the cool wood of the floor. Mel sat up and slid closer to him, looking down at his softening cock, covered in their cum. Straddling his head, her wet, cum filled pussy inches above his mouth, she bent and took his limp prick between her lips.\n\nShe ran her tongue up and down his soft shaft, tasting the mixture of their love liquids. She poked into his slit, and brought her hand up to squeeze his balls. Leaning over farther, she ran her tongue down his hairy sac to the spot just behind his scrotum. Pressing her tongue flat, she licked his taint, dipping her mouth even lower to slip the tip into the tight crease of his ass. With her other hand she gripped his tool, clenching and unclenching her fist, feeling the blood rushing to fill it.\n\nJon opened his eyes when he felt her take his tired dick into her wet mouth. Hovering above his face was her sopping pussy, a combination of both their juices slowly dripping down her lips to the tops of her thighs. He ran his tongue up each thigh, licking off the drips, tasting them both, before slipping it between her lips and into her hole. He poked his stiff tongue far into her dripping cunt, mimicking the movements his cock had made earlier. Reaching up, he put a hand on each cheek of her ass, spreading them wide while pulling it closer to her face. He let his tongue slide out of her pussy with a wet pop, and slid it up to her pink, puckered hole. \n\nHis rapidly stiffening prick gripped tightly in one fist, Mel used her other hand to spread his ass. Jon lifted his legs, planting his feet flat on the floor, and spread his knees wide, allowing her tongue better access to his own hole. Flicking the tip of her tongue over his anus, Mel jacked his cock. She felt his sac tighten, lifting his balls to brush her chin. She felt his grip on her thighs, as he rolled them over.\n\nHe was now straddling her head, his full erection poised just above her waiting mouth. She opened her mouth as wide as she could, feeling the strain in her jaws, and tilted her head back, opening her throat. Jon slid all of his cock into the waiting orifice, not stopping until he felt her throat swallowing convulsively, sucking him in deep. He slipped it back out of her throat, letting her get some air, before grinding his hips back down, pushing way back into her mouth. He began to pump his cock in and out of her mouth, fucking her face the way he'd fucked her pussy.\n\nJon grabbed Mel's legs, pulling them far back and wide open, not stopping until they were pressed flat against her sides. He lay his arms on them, weighting them down and spread as wide as possible, her ass lifted off the floor, her cheeks an open invitation. He bent his head and speared her asshole with his tongue, working it in deep, a while he pumped his cock into her mouth. He tongue fucked her tightest hole, wiggling his tongue deep into her rectum, her sphincter sucking him in deeper. The moans in her throat causing a delicious vibration along his tool. \n\nHe pulled his cock up and almost out of her mouth, and Mel placed a hand on one firm ass cheek, stopping him from driving back into her throat. She placed 3 fingers into her mouth, coating them with her saliva, feeling his hard shaft against them. She took her wet fingers up, and placed them against his asshole, twisting them into his tight cavern. She heard him grunt ass he slid his ass back onto her hand. Once all three fingers were wedged tight in his backdoor, he slid his stiff one back into her throat. He continued his assault on her mouth while she rammed her fingers into his anus.\n\nJon was in heaven, with his cock balls deep in Mel's hot mouth, and his ass filled with her hot fingers. He would pump straight down into her face, and pull back pushing himself hard onto her hand. She would wiggle her fingers around in his anal cavern, tickling his prostate, while she swallowed, her throat muscles convulsing along his shaft.\n\nRemoving his tongue from her ass, he replaced it with 2 of his fingers, pushing them deep into her bowels. His mouth returned to her pussy, where a new puddle of her juices lay pooled waiting for him to slurp them up. He covered her mound with his wide open mouth, sucking both sets of her smooth lips hard. He sucked them roughly, biting and twisting before releasing them and attacking her clit. He pinched it tightly between his lips, her hips bucking up, while adding a third finger to her hot ass.\n\nMel felt his fingers working over her asshole, and his mouth roughly abusing her sensitive pussy. Her orgasm came wrenching from her, her teeth clamping down on the hard cock impaled in her mouth, her hand slamming into Jon's tight ass. Her lower body quaked, bouncing up and down with the force of her tremors, a torrent of her cum squirting up out of her and onto Jon's face.\n\nWhen he felt Mel bite down on his shaft, and her fingers ram deeply into his ass, Jon's own climax began to overtake him. Her tight walls gripped his fingers, and a geyser of her love juice came gushing out of her, dripping down his cheek and lips. He licked his lips, enjoying her flavor. He pumped his hips, once, twice, the third time being the charm, as his sperm erupted from him, coating her throat. She swallowed quickly, not wanting to lose one delicious drop of him. \n\nThey let their fingers slide slowly from each others backsides, and Jon pulled his softening prick from Mel's mouth. He let her legs drop back to the floor, and moved off of her. Turning to face her, he bent close to her, and she licked the rest of her cum from his face, before pulling his mouth to hers for a tired kiss. He grabbed the blanket, and covered them with it, laying his head on her chest. She ran her fingers through his hair, and he stroked the soft skin of her stomach. \n\nWhen they had both recovered from their marathon sex session, they sat up, wrapped themselves back in the blanket, and shared some of the wine. Neither spoke as they watched the flames flicker. Time passed in silence, each alone with their thoughts.\n\nJon broke the tension first, \"I still love you, will always love you. No one has ever touched me the way you do.\"\n\nMel let out a giggle, \"That's only because you don't tell them you like your butt played with.\"\n\nJon pushed her playfully, \"Ha, ha. That's not what I meant and you know it. Besides, how many of your lovers have you told about your little fetishes?\"\n\n\"I haven't had any lovers, Jon. You were the last man I was intimate with. There has been no one since the divorce.\"\n\nJon looked over at her, \"I haven't been with anyone either. Not since Jacy, anyway. When I lost you, she left. It was like the only reason she wanted to be with me was because she couldn't have me. Once I was available, she broke it off. I heard she was with Crawford now, helping wreck his marriage, too.\"\n\n\"I never stopped loving you either. I was willing to work on things until I found out about her. I just figured that you'd moved on from me. I know I wasn't always there for you the way I should have been, and for that I am truly sorry,\" Mel spoke in a low voice.\n\n\"NO! I'm the one who should be sorry. I knew how hard you were trying to get your business up and running. I was selfish. All I could think about were my needs and wants. If anyone is to blame for the way things turned out, it's me,\" Jon replied passionately.\n\n\"So what happens now?\" Mel's voice barely a whisper.\n\nAt that, Jon leaned over to Mel and brushed his lips over hers. \"Is it too late to try again? I mean, have I ruined things so completely that you can never forgive me?\"\n\nMel reached for him, wrapping her arms around his torso, looking up into his eyes. \"I want to try again. I want what we once had. I need you, I always have. Let's try. Can't we just try and love each other again?\"\n\nJon kissed her hard, pulling him tightly to him. \"Yes, I want that. I want it all with you. We can be good again, I believe that.\"\n\nAnd with that decision made, they lay back down in front of the fire. Jon kissing Mel's lips tenderly, sliding his lips down her neck to bite her collarbone. He worked his way down her chest to her hardening nipples. He sucked one hard into his mouth while his hand squeezed her other breast, pinching that nipple between his thumb and forefinger. He slid his knee between her legs, bringing it up against her. He felt her wet pussy rub along his thigh. \n\nMel could feel his stiffening cock brush against her leg. His knee against her cunt sent ripples of pleasure coursing through her. He bit down hard on one nipple, and she shuddered under him. She spread her thighs farther apart, wanting him to fuck her hard again. Reaching down, she grabbed his hard prick, guiding it to her wet hole. She rubbed the head back and forth over her clit, sending shivers up and down her spine. \n\nJon grabbed Mel's ass cheeks in his hands, and brought it up off the floor, before pushing his throbbing dick against her hand. Mel slid his swollen head to her opening for him, and he drove his cock into her. She arched her back and bit her lip at the invasion. He didn't pull out of her, just thrust his hips, pushing his hard on deeper into her cavern. Her hot, wet hole making slight sucking sounds as he pounded her. \n\nMel grabbed his ass hard, digging her nails into the flesh of his butt cheeks, pulling him into the \"V\" of her thighs even tighter. He rammed his hot cock into her, harder and faster. Jon leaned over her, taking one tit deep into his mouth, feeling her hard nub at the back of his tongue, before letting it pop back out. \n\nMel wanted all of him. She wanted to feel everything he had to offer. \"Fuck me in the ass, Jon. I need to feel your cock in my ass,\" she begged him, her voice raw with emotion.\n\nHe let his prick slip out of her wet pussy, her juices dripping out of her. He sat up, and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach. He reached under her, pulling her up to her knees. She lay with her arms and head flat on the floor, her ass up in the air, a deep arch in her back. Jon bent down behind her, and ran his tongue from the top of her ass down to her clit, tasting her. He slipped his tongue deep into her pussy, savoring their mixed flavors, before licking his way up to her tight asshole. \n\nHe wriggled his tongue all over her pink star, delving the tip into her anus. He worked her ass over, getting it loose for his hard cock. Mel moaned deep in her throat, and thrust her ass back. Jon grabbed her ass cheeks and spread them wide, watching her hole open for him. He pushed his tongue in deeper with each pass, before he finally had all of it up her back door, his nose pressed against the top of her cleft. He pulled his face back, and then pushed in. He fucked her ass with his pointed tongue, working it deep into her anus, flicking the tip deep in her bowels. \n\nHe loved her musky taste. She'd always given herself enemas during their marriage, but he'd thought it was a waste. He got so turned on by her flavor and her smell. His face was pressed tightly into her ass cheeks, his tongue as far up her rectum he could get it. He reached under her to rub her swollen clit. Over and over he flicked his fingers on her taut nub, feeling her muscles tighten as her climax neared. When he knew she was close, he slid a finger into her pussy.",
        "Mel's orgasm came bursting from her. She threw her head back and let out a scream. Her whole body shaking with the force. Jon felt her ass clenching his tongue, the muscles working his tongue out of her slippery back hole. And her drenched pussy clutched his finger. As she lay quivering on the floor, he sat up behind her. He put the knob of his dick right up to her asshole, and slid the head in. Even with all his spit, and his loosening of her hole, it was a very tight squeeze.\n\nShe felt him shove the head of his prick into her ass. It burned, the pain causing her to suck in her breath. She lay very still, trying to relax her muscles to allow him further access. She pushed out with her sphincter, letting him slide into her more. She felt his cock pulse as it slid deep into her bowels. She was impossibly full, almost uncomfortable. Just when she didn't think she could take anymore of his prick in her ass, she felt his balls tap against her pussy lips lightly.\n\nHe looked down to where their bodies were joined. Her ass stretched tightly around his cock. He let his finger run over her skin, feeling it taut around his girth. He pulled back, watching her skin pull back with his cock. He worked his tool slowly in and out of her straining hole, getting her accustomed to the feeling. When she began moving her ass in time with his thrusts, he knew she was ready.\n\nShe felt him fucking her anus slowly, working his cock in and out, his tight sac slapping her pussy. She spread her knees farther, feeling his hairy balls brush her clit with each inward stroke. She began rocking her hips back, urging him to go faster. And when he pulled all the way out to the head, and thrust back into her roughly, she let out a low growl, and yelled, \"Oh yeah, fuck my ass hard!\"\n\nJon reared back, and slammed his stiff prick deep into her anal canal. His hands grabbed her ass hard, digging his fingers into her delicate flesh, as he pounded his prick into her tight hole. Her bowels were hot in a way her pussy never was. Tight and dark and dirty, he rammed his pole into her naughtiest of places. He could feel his balls slapping against her sloppy, wet pussy, her moans telling him they were popping her clit. He leaned over her, still pounding her backdoor, and grabbed her tits. He pulled them roughly, twisting her nipples. He pushed himself back up, gripping her hips hard, pulling her ass back onto his cock.\n\nShe was spread as wide as he could get and still stay on her knees. Mel's ass felt like it was being torn apart. Jon's tool was buried deep in her rectum, and his sac was banging into her clit. She was getting close to cumming again. She pushed up onto her hands, and began slamming her ass back to meet Jon's thigh's. \n\nJon was pumping Mel's ass hard, harder than he ever had before, and she was loving it. She'd propped up and began pushing her ass back to meet his thrusts. He lifted one hand and smacked her full on one cheek, leaving a large, red hand print on her creamy skin. Again he slapped her ass hard, this time Mel yelling out, \"Yeah, slap my ass. Spank me hard!\"\n\nHe spanked her again, reaching up with his other hand to grab a handful of her hair. He yanked her head back every time he stroked into her ass, while spanking her ass until it was a bright red. They went on like this, fucking, pulling, spanking, until Mel broke. Her asshole tightened on Jon's prick painfully, her cunt quivering, she let out a howl and her climax tore through her body. She felt tingles from her scalp to her toes, and she couldn't seem to breath. \n\nJon felt Mel's ass grab his cock in a death grip, a grimace of agony crossing his face. He felt her plunge over the edge, and her anus loosened, the spasms rippling over his cock. His whole body shook, electric currents running down all his limbs, centering on his balls. A gusher of spunk came shooting from his prick to splatter her bowels with it's stickiness. A healthy grunt escaped his lips as he collapsed over her.\n\nMel's body dropped under Jon's weight, she hadn't the strength left to hold them up. He lay heavily on top of her, his breath ragged. She could feel his heart pounding against her back, it's irregular beat matching her own. He slid off of her, keeping one hand to lay on one pink ass cheek. \n\nShe rolled her head to look over at him only to see him looking back at her. With a determined look, he said to her, \"I think we should get married again. I think we should definitely keep this place. And I think we should have kids, lots of them.\"\n\nWith a sly grin and a wink, Mel replied, \"I think you just fucked the wrong hole if you were trying to make babies.\" \n\nThe End"
