        "The next week was a busy one. On Sunday, after our morning sex session, I asked Anne if she had ever been to a baseball game. She said she couldn't even remember watching an entire game on TV much less actually going to a stadium to attend one. I told her that her life would not be complete if she didn't see at least one game since it was practically a requirement to do so if you lived in America. \n\n\"In all of your business activities do you ever get involved with any kind of goodwill work or donate to some worthy causes.\" \n\n\"I do that indirectly through the individual corporations I own. I also make donations anonymously to schools and charities. Why do you ask?\" \n\n\"Because if we're going to go to a baseball game we should take some kids that might never have a chance to go on their own. Hey, I know, call your oncologist and ask him if there are any kids fighting cancer that are confined to a hospital that we could take out for the day.\" \n\n\"Carl you are truly wonderful and you make me ashamed of myself for never even thinking of something like that. Here I am doing all these things for me because of my condition and I haven't given a single thought to what kind of life a child with this disease has. I'll call him right away.\" \n\nHer doctor said he really appreciated her wanting to do this and he would call the hospital and ask the administrator if he could put something together. There was a game at Yankee stadium that afternoon and about an hour later the doctor called back and asked if we could manage four young kids that were in the hospital for their chemo treatments but could definitely attend a ball game. \n\nAnne made another call to get tickets. She wanted to get a skybox but I said that was for rich old men and kids wanted to be close to the action so she got seven seats in the third row along the baseline from third base to the plate. She called a rental car agency and had them bring over a big SUV and about one o'clock we headed for the stadium with a stop at the hospital to pick up the kids. \n\nIt was one of the best days we had spent yet. Anne and Melissa had a blast doing things for the kids and, unbeknownst to us, the administrator of the hospital had called someone so when the game was over an attendant was standing at the end of the row we were seated in and asked us to please come with him. He led us over to a gate that led down to the field and we walked down some steps to find the entire team standing there with autographed balls for all of us. You would have thought we had taken the kids to the North Pole and met Santa Claus. \n\nWhen we got back to the house around six thirty Melissa said she would call the rental agency to pick up the car and we asked her to join us for dinner in the dining room. She said she would love to and that she would check out the things Anthony had left in the fridge and start getting them ready. We went upstairs to take a shower. \n\n\"Carl that was one of the best days of my life. If I had any doubt about what kind of father you are they're all gone now. Nothing else you could have done would have made me feel better than being with those kids and helping them to feel good for even a single afternoon. Thank you my love for being the most marvelous person in the world and showing me that you have to live each minute and not cry about how many minutes you have.\" \n\n\"It was a special treat for me too. I've been to a few games in my life but I never got to meet all the players and get an autographed ball. I'll keep that for the rest of my life.\" \n\nWe got in the shower and she adjusted the sprays to a fine mist then put a folded towel on the floor and told me to stand next to the wall. Then she knelt down in front of me and put her hand around my cock and said, \"Special people deserve special treats.\" \n\nShe opened her mouth and engulfed the head of my cock. She took her time stroking me and running her tongue all around me as I gradually stiffened in her hand. Women like to think they are the sole possessors of intuition but even we less evolved men can tell when a woman is giving you a blow job because she thinks you want it and when she's doing it because she enjoys it as much as you do. This subtle distinction occurs primarily because of love, but exactly how this is transmitted from a woman to a man is, and should remain, a mystery. Nevertheless there is a discernable difference and it elevates the act from highly pleasurable to something indescribably wonderful. It changes the gestalt. \n\nWhen I was fully hard she let go with her hand and just slid her mouth up and down my shaft coating it with her saliva. The mist of the shower was covering her in little droplets that shone in the light like jewels. Her hand moved to cradle my balls and caress them as she continued to suck me. A few glorious minutes of this adoring attention was all it took to persuade my nervous system that the only appropriate response was to reward her loving mouth with a big dose of cum. \"Oh Anne, baby, yes. Here comes your special treat.\" She held still with just the head in her mouth until the first ejaculation sprayed into it then very slowly pushed forward to cover more with each spurt until the last one gushed deep in her throat. \n\nWhen she was satisfied that there was no more cum to be had she pulled back and made a big suction noise as the tip exited her mouth. I pulled her up by her arms until she was standing in front of me. She opened her mouth to show me that it was full of cum then closed her lips and swallowed hard. She stuck her tongue out and licked all around her lips then smiled at me and asked, \"Was that OK baby?\" \n\n\"That was a lot more than OK.\" I pulled her to me and kissed her then stuck my tongue in her mouth. I could taste the remnants of my semen. \"God, you taste fabulous. I'll let you do that again later but next time I'll have my head between your legs doing it to you at the same time. I might even put the glass rod up your ass too.\" \n\n\"Oooooheeeee yes Carl yes. Please do that. I love it when you play with my ass. I'll cum real good for you if you will.\" \n\n\"Of course I will because I want you to cum for me. I love it when you cum for me. I love feeling you and tasting you and hearing you. This is what I live for now to keep you in sexual bliss for as long as I can.\" \n\nShe asked me to give her an enema so I could play with her ass later then we got back in the shower and finished washing each other and dried off. Next we headed for the closets to put on some clothes if you could call what Anne wore clothes. She had on a long t-shirt that barely covered her ass. She hadn't bothered with bra or panties and she let me know it in the elevator as she rubbed her body against mine all the way to the second floor. \n\nWhen we got down to the kitchen Melissa had dinner almost ready. Anthony had baked a vegetarian lasagna and Melissa had made a salad for us and brought up another bottle of the super Tuscan wine from the cellar per Anthony's recommendation. We ate at the dining room table and talked about what a wonderful day it had been with the kids at the ball game. I asked Melissa what she was going to do with her autographed baseball. \n\n\"I'm going to keep it my whole life and whenever I need a little pick me up from a long hard day I'm going to look at it and remember that these days here with you two were the best days of my life because I don't want to even think about what I'm going to do after this.\" \n\n\"That's a very sweet thing to say Melissa. I had a feeling when I first saw you that your considerable beauty was a lot more than skin deep. I'm very glad to have met you and I really like having you around through this unusual time of my life and I'm going to count on you to help me keep the person we both love as happy as we can. It seems we will have two different outcomes from this experience. You don't know what you will do and I know exactly what I'm going to do.\" \n\nAnne said, \"Carl I know exactly what you're going to do as soon as we get finished eating this delicious meal so let's not get too wrapped up in what's going to happen in a few months. I believe things will work out for everybody if we just take it one day at a time. I do want to tell you that tomorrow I have a quarterly meeting with my team and I want you to attend.\" \n\n\"What team?\" \n\n\"My business team. You need to meet everybody and understand how my little financial empire works since you have a power of attorney that puts you in charge when I become incapable of making decisions. I've set up a very elaborate structure to attend to all the financial elements I'm involved in and you need to know about it because I have to make some decisions about changing things before I'm not around anymore.\" \n\n\"I guess that would be prudent. I suppose we can't count on you having the full six months and I'm sure there are lots of things that must be planned for should that time be shortened.\" \n\n\"Exactly. I need to set up a plan for what will happen after I die. There are a lot of people who will be impacted by my decisions so this can't wait.\" \n\n\"Anne I know you don't want to wait to get back upstairs with Carl so I'll clear the table and clean up. You go have fun.\" \n\n\"Thanks Melissa and don't spend too much time worrying about what's going to happen to you when I'm gone. I'll make sure you have lots of options.\" \n\nAnne and I headed back upstairs with a stop on the fourth floor where Anne's main office was located. We spent about an hour going over the basic structure of Anne's business empire. She showed me how it was primarily a closely held private corporation composed of ten divisions. Each division handled different aspects of the business. There was a legal team, an insurance team, two investment teams one domestic one foreign, two real estate teams again one domestic one foreign, an energy team for oil and gas, two accounting teams that maintained strict separation so neither of them could do anything illegal or shady and finally a team to handle collectibles like art and rare coins and automobiles. \n\nA team captain who personally chose their team members and could hire and fire at their discretion headed each of the divisions. Anne of course could replace any team captain as she saw fit but had not done so in the seven years that the team had been in existence. She did have to replace two captains due to death but she had worked with them to have a successor being groomed for this eventuality so there would be minimal disruption when it occurred. \n\nAnne and the team captains were the only stockholders of the corporation. Anne held ninety percent of the shares and each team held one percent. They met quarterly to go over the results of their activities and dispersed money as dividends twice a year so the teams could get paid. The money each team received was calculated by a complex formula that rewarded teams that did well and beat their projections but also spread the wealth to teams that did not contribute as much as others. The legal team was a prime example of this since they were not a profit center but handled thousands of legal matters for all of the many sub-corporations both foreign and domestic that were directly and indirectly owned by the main corporation. \n\nThe chart she showed me of how all of the sub-corporations interrelated was mind boggling. It reminded me of the tangled web of companies that Enron had set up but they did it to hide mischief and avoid taxes whereas Anne did it to facilitate doing business in different states and countries and protect the teams from law suits and to have local contacts that could inform the teams regarding investment opportunities. \n\nI was extremely impressed with what she had accomplished. This was a complex but well coordinated money making machine with quasi-independent units that could be created, changed or removed as circumstances dictated. The money really did trickle down from the top, which I always thought was bullshit that politicians spouted just to please their big contributors and get legislation passed to benefit them. Anne had come pretty close to making that fantasy a reality, however before anything trickled down, money poured in from thousands of diverse streams of income and those at the top still got the lion's share and all of the members of these teams knew their business and played hardball. She gave the team captains a lot of leeway but she went over the accounting teams' audits every quarter like a Muslim reads the Koran. \n\nI asked her about the real estate team because I wondered why she needed a team to do that. She told me her father, who really got the concept of this team off the ground, was always traveling around the world and the states and when he would see land or a town that was growing or a building that had been foreclosed because a business had failed, he would buy it. Usually through hiring a local realtor to act on his behalf to avoid speculation. By the time she finished putting the team in place there were hundreds of these properties and each one had to be kept up with so she set up a team for them. She told me she had transferred a few of them into her name so she could use them for her own purposes. \n\n\"What kind of properties do you own?\" \n\n\"Mostly houses scattered around the world which I always planned on visiting but just never got around to it.\" \n\n\"Where are they?\" \n\n\"Oh, the Caribbean, Europe, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Vancouver. Just to name a few.\" \n\n\"And you've never been to them?\" \n\n\"I've been to one of them. It was when I was six years old. Like most of the properties, my father bought it before I was born. It's on the island of Antigua. I don't remember much about it though.\" \n\n\"Anne my poor precious child, you own luxury houses in some of the most beautiful parts of the world and you've never even seen them. That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. After this meeting tomorrow and once we get through the egg harvesting procedure, will you promise me that we'll go visit one of them. I'd love to see the place in Antigua.\" \n\n\"OK. In fact, we can visit several of them if you want. We don't need to come back here until either the quarterly team meeting at the end of September or unless I feel so bad I can't keep traveling.\" \n\n\"That's a great idea. You really do need to see more of the world while you still can and I'd love to do this. I've never had the time or money to do much more than take the kids to Disney World.\" \n\n\"OK then that's what we'll do. We better tell Mitra to plan on a world tour. She's arriving Saturday. Should we take Melissa with us?\" \n\n\"Absolutely. Who else would you trust to drive us around Europe?\" \n\n\"This is sounding better the more I think about it. I'm getting excited.\" \n\n\"Me too. We need to get a good video camera so I can show our daughter all the places we visit and let her know she can go there too someday. Melissa can be our official photographer for the trip.\" \n\n\"You're right Carl. I have to make a will so that eventually Victoria ends up with them. That would be a wonderful gift for her.\" \n\n\"Jesus Anne don't tell me you don't have a will after all you showed me this morning and now all these properties. I'm surprised Walter would let you run a huge holding company like yours without a will.\" \n\n\"I just never thought about it. I don't... I didn't have anybody to leave anything to before now so it didn't seem to matter. I just assumed somebody would work it out if I died suddenly. But now it's different.\" \n\n\"I'd say. We better get you over to Walter's tomorrow and get you one drawn up.\" \n\n\"He'll be at the meeting, he's the legal team captain. I'll ask him to do it before he leaves.\" \n\n\"Do you have a list of these properties so we can make an itinerary?\" \n\n\"I'm sure it's on my computer somewhere. Let me look for it.\" \n\nShe found a folder of personal properties and opened it. Twenty-five subfolders appeared. \"As much as I'd like to see all of these I'm afraid we don't have time to do that. I don't want to go to a place for a day or two then rush off to the next one. What do you say to picking six or seven to spend a week in?\" \n\n\"That sounds good to me. You and Sandy and the kids can take your time in the future visiting the rest of them. Let's pick out ones we can get to so we don't have to spend a lot of time traveling between them. I'll have to contact the property managers in each location and inform them that we're coming. Each of these folders has all that information in them. Oh Carl, this sounds like we're planning our honeymoon.\" \n\n\"Yes it does doesn't it? Sandy and I went to the Florida Keys for our honeymoon. This will be a grand tour compared to that.\" \n\n\"You and Sandy can spend the rest of what I hope will be a long life having a continual honeymoon. These places will all belong to you and her soon.\" \n\n\"I thought you were going to leave them to Victoria.\" \n\n\"There won't be any Victoria when I die. Not legally anyway. You'll have to hold them for her until she's of age to own them.\" \n\n\"I hadn't thought of that. How am I going to take care of all these places? Aren't there taxes and upkeep on them? That could take quite a bit of money.\" \n\n\"Don't worry about it. I have all that in place already so I'll set up a trust fund or something to continue to handle the expenses.\" \n\n\"Sandy will never believe this. Not only will we be able to go all over the world but we'll own houses in these places.\" \n\n\"I told you I was going to find a way to thank that wonderful wife of yours. This will be another little gift for letting me have you to love. I wouldn't trade being with you for a thousand houses. I hope all of you enjoy these places.\" \n\n\"A little gift! If these houses are anything like I think they're going to be, then each one is probably worth at least a million dollars. That's some gift.\" \n\n\"If they're worth ten million dollars each it's still not worth one day loving you. But I guess I do deserve a spanking for never getting around to visiting them.\" \n\n\"My love I have a much better treatment in mind for you than a spanking. Let's continue planning our trip later. Right now I want to reward your generosity with what you so highly prize, one more day of loving me.\" I took her in my arms and kissed her, then we walked to the elevator and returned to our bedroom. \n\nAnne stripped off her t-shirt and threw it on one of the big chairs. My shorts and shirt joined it. Before we got back in bed I stopped at the control pad in the bedroom and programmed in a playlist of music. It was a mix of mostly instrumentals, soft jazz and low key Brazilian music. As soon as we got into the bed we wrapped our arms around each other and let the rest of the world disappear. We kissed softly and tenderly ran our hands over our bodies in a continuing exploration to discover and map every inch into our memories and feel the exquisite sensations that only touching can convey to our hearts and minds. We knew each other now as only lovers can. We were complete. \n\nI slid back and turned to retrieve the glass butt plug and the lube from the nightstand. \"Roll over on your stomach.\" She softly moaned with anticipation as she rolled over, spread her legs and started slowly wiggling her ass. I poured a little of the lube on her asshole and used my finger to rub it. She let out a little gasp when I inserted it in her. I poured a little more lube on her and put the tip of my middle finger next to the one already in her and pressed the tip in beside it. She raised her hips and pushed back to welcome the new intruder and I slid both fingers completely inside her. \n\nMy other hand was massaging her ass cheeks as my fingers turned and slid in and out of her rectum. I could have sworn she was purring like a cat. She was really enjoying what I was doing to her and her enjoyment was enhancing my own. I continued to rub her for several minutes then reluctantly withdrew my fingers, which elicited a moan of disappointment from her. It was soon replaced by a moan of satisfaction when she felt me pour some more lube on her asshole followed by the tip of the butt plug making contact with the center of her puckered aperture. ",
        "I turned it like a corkscrew as I pressed it forward and inserted it into her anus. It slid in without resistance and I stopped when half its length was inside her. \"Now turn over on your side and scoot down a little.\" When she was in position I lay down beside her with my feet towards the headboard and aligned my body so my cock was even with her mouth. I raised her leg up so I could get my head on her thigh and slid my mouth close to her pussy. I felt the head of my cock being enclosed by her lips as mine made contact with her slit. \n\nI slowly licked her from her clit down to her vagina. I gave both of these areas little sideways flicks of my tongue on each pass. I kept this up for several minutes as the fabulous taste and fragrance of her filled my senses. These sensory impressions together with her soft sucking and licking of my cock induced a rock hard erection which increased even more when I felt her hand cradle my balls and her fingers begin to caress them. I sucked her labia inside my lips and very lightly nibbled them as I slid my mouth along her wet slit. \n\nAll the while I was sucking and licking her I was also fucking her ass with the glass plug. I had been sliding it in a little deeper with each stroke and she alternated pressing her hips forward to meet what my tongue was doing to her and pulling them backward to get more of the plug in her ass. She was letting me fuck her mouth with long gentle strokes while she squeezed and massaged my balls. \n\nWe were both building to a climax and when I felt the first signs of mine I pushed the plug all the way inside her stretching her asshole to the max before the fat base slipped completely into her and caused her to moan loudly around my cock. I stopped stroking and held the head in her tight lips and glued my mouth to her vagina and sucked hard. She shuddered and I felt her hot hole squeeze my tongue as her orgasm exploded inside her. My cock swelled then began to spurt the hot cream she loved so much across her slick tongue. Each time I filled her mouth she swallowed it and licked the tip to entice another burst of cum; an entreaty I was more than happy to fulfill. \n\nShe finally pulled her mouth off my spent cock and said, \"My orgasms when that plug is all the way in me are twice as intense as they normally are. You need to try it and see what effect it has on you. I had no idea I would like it so much.\" \n\n\"Well let's go wash it off. Then you can give me an enema and we can come back here and you can put it in me.\" \n\nBeing with her in the bathroom was like being with a little child. Everything she did from the enema to washing me and caressing me was done with total glee and joy. She seemed genuinely excited by playing with our bodies. This was immensely gratifying to me because it meant she was totally in the moment with no thought of her impending doom. Her enthusiasm was contagious and spread to me as I kissed her and rubbed her and licked every part of her. It was as if we were both discovering something for the first time and it was sheer delight. \n\nWe took our time drying each other, pausing for kisses and licks then headed back down the long hallway to the bedroom. There were paintings on the walls that I hadn't taken the time to really examine before. I stopped in front of one of them. \"This is a Renoir isn't it?\" \n\n\"Yes it is. He has always been one of my favorite artists and when this came up for sale a few years ago I bought it.\" \n\n\"Are you telling me this is an original?\" \n\n\"This one is an excellent copy but I bought the original.\" \n\n\"No fucking way! Where is it, locked in a bank vault somewhere?\" \n\n\"Even I'm not selfish enough to deprive the world of a painting like this. The original is in one of the museums here in the city.\" \n\n\"How much is it worth?\" \n\n\"I paid a hundred and fourteen million for it. It would probably go for close to two hundred million today.\" \n\n\"As beautiful as it is it doesn't come close to comparing to you.\" \n\n\"Oh Carl that's such a lovely thing to say. Especially since I know you really mean it.\" \n\n\"I do mean it my love. If it could cure your cancer I'd donate it to somebody. Do you own the originals of all the paintings on these walls?\" \n\n\"Yes but the Renoir is the most famous. I like to support living artists too.\" \n\nI love you Anne. Even more than I thought myself capable of doing.\" \n\n\"Then let's go get in that bed and you can love me some more.\" \n\nWe walked to the bed holding hands. \n\n\"Lie on your back and spread your legs.\" \n\nShe got between them and told me to bend my knees and pulled my legs up. When I had done that she reached over to the nightstand and got the creamy moisturizer I like so much and poured some on my cock and balls. \n\n\"I'll get back to this in a few minutes but first I'm going to stick this beautiful glass rod up your ass.\" \n\nI watched her as she squeezed out some of the lube onto the glass plug then put some lube directly on my puckered hole. She put the tip of the rod against it and eased it inside me. It slid in nicely and actually felt pretty good as it expanded my rectum and pressed against my prostate. My cock began to stiffen. \n\n\"I think you like this. You're going to like what I do next even more.\" \n\nShe began to move the rod in and out of my ass with one hand and used the other one to rub my cock and balls to spread the moisturizer all over them. She was right; I did like this. Her hand was stroking my cock in the same rhythm as she was fucking me with the rod. As my cock got harder she slid the rod further inside me. \n\n\"Oh Carl, I love making you feel good. I don't know which one of us is enjoying this more. Sliding my hand up and down your wonderful hard cock and knowing it's going to be in my tight little ass soon is making me wet. I've never done anything that excites me and gives me as much pleasure as playing with you. Now, get ready because I'm going to slide this all the way into you. Then I'm going to use both hands to stroke your cock and caress your balls until you're as excited as I am.\" \n\nWhen the rod was all the way in me I knew how it must feel to her when my cock was in her ass. I could understand why she liked it so much. My cock was rock hard from the fat base pressing against my prostate. If she continued this hand job much longer, she'd make me cum. As if she could read my mind she stopped her stroking. She moved over my leg and got on all fours beside me. \n\n\"OK Carl, get behind me and put that stiff slippery cock in my ass and fuck me. Make me cum. It won't take much because I'm already halfway there just from what I've done to you. God Carl you make me so hot.\" \n\nI rose up and knelt behind her and lined up my cock with her ass. She reached back and pulled her cheeks apart to give me full access. I placed the tip against her asshole and rubbed it against her with my hand. \n\n\"Don't tease me Carl just put it in me. Please Carl let me have your wonderful cock in my ass. Oooooohhh I want it so bad baby. Please fuck me. I'm almost shaking I want you so much.\" \n\nI pressed forward and the head slid inside her. I didn't stop but kept on pushing into her until I was buried completely in her hot rectum. She began to pant and pressed back against me to take every inch of me. \n\n\"Ohhhhh yesssss baby, yesssss. That's what I want. I think the plug in you has made your cock bigger because you seem to be stretching me more and you're deeper into me than before. It feels sooooo gooood. Oh yes, just hold still for a minute and let me feel you throbbing inside me. Push hard against me. I want to feel your balls mash against my pussy. Oooohhhh Yesssss, Yessssss just like that.\" \n\nShe moved one of her hands from her cheek to between her legs and reached back to squeeze my balls and press them against her hot wet pussy. \n\n\"Oh Carl my precious love, inside these balls is the sperm that is going to make our baby. I want you to fuck me now and spray as much of your cum in my ass as you can. I want to feel it deep inside me so I can imagine what it would feel like to be pregnant with our child. Oh Carl I love you so much. Fuck me my love, fuck my tight ass and fill me with your sperm.\" \n\nI did as she asked, fucking her with long strong strokes so she could feel my cock sliding its entire length in and out of her. When I pulled back I let it slide out completely to see her asshole gape open for a few seconds and when it began to close up I stuck it back in her and buried it in her completely. She panted as it left her and moaned when it returned. She wiggled and pressed back against me each time I pushed it deep inside her. She was right about the plug; it did seem to make my cock bigger and harder. I increased the tempo of my strokes and heard my thighs slapping against her ass as I fucked her with more force. \n\nThe sounds she was making let me know she was getting close to cumming. Soon I felt the unmistakable signs of my own climax building up. I didn't think my cock could get any harder but it did just before my orgasm began. I held still deep inside of her and felt my rectum begin to spasm and squeeze the glass rod in pulses. This feeling spread all through my insides until I felt my cum rushing out of me in a steady stream as if I was pissing instead of the usual spurts. It seemed to go on for a long time. Anne was groaning loudly as she shook with her own orgasm and felt my hot cream flowing into her. The hand she had used to squeeze my balls was rubbing her clit now in an effort to prolong her intense climax. The contractions this induced in her own rectum were prolonging mine as well. \n\nI was going to pull out of her and roll off when I remembered the glass rod was still in me so I reached around with my hand and managed to pull it out. I don't think I would have stopped cumming if I hadn't extricated it from my throbbing rectum. As soon as I succeeded, Anne fell forward and I went with her. We lay together with my oozing cock still buried in her and tried to return to some semblance of normalcy. \n\n\"Oh my God Carl. I thought I was going to pass out. Nothing has ever made me feel like that before. It was fantastic. I can't wait to do it again.\" \n\n\"Well you're going to have to because I won't have any cum in me until tomorrow, if then. Damn that was intense. I'm surprised I didn't shoot one of my testicles inside you. Now I know why you're so fond of anal sex.\" \n\n\"I'm a lot more than fond of it. I didn't know it was possible to cum that hard.\" \n\n\"You really like to cum don't you?\" \n\n\"I really do my love. Loving you makes it easy to do because in addition to the way the orgasm makes me feel I get a thrill knowing how much you like me to cum for you and it intensifies the sensations to know I'm pleasing you too. Oh Carl I don't ever want to stop cumming with you.\" \n\nI slowly withdrew my cock from her and rolled off of her. \"Turn over on your back.\" She complied and I got between her legs. I lowered my head to her pussy and began to lick her slit. \n\n\"Ohhhh yessss baby, keep licking my pussy and sucking my clit and I'll cum all night for you.\" \n\nI pressed my mouth to her lips and stuck my tongue in her vagina and began to lick and suck her while rubbing her clit with my thumb. Her juices flowed into my mouth as I continued to eat her delicious pussy. We were so in tune with each other it was as if we could read each other's mind. I knew exactly what she was feeling and what she wanted me to do to her. Her hands were on my head rubbing her fingers through my hair and gently directing my actions. I could sense her rising passion and her moans were signaling that she was getting ready to cum again. \n\n\"Ohhhhh yesssss Carl yessssss baby you're doing it to me againnnn.\" She pulled my head hard against her pussy and I felt her legs tense as she started trembling then arched her back and came on my face. My mouth filled with her delicious juices and I felt my cum flowing out of her ass on my chin as her climax swept though her. \n\nWhen she finally calmed down again I asked her, \"Had enough?\" \n\n\"I'll never get enough of you my love. But we should try to get some sleep. We have a meeting tomorrow remember.\" \n\nI crawled up beside her and took her in my arms and kissed her. \n\n\"So that's what my pussy tastes like. I do taste good don't I?\" \n\n\"Absolutely delicious my love.\" \n\n\"I still prefer the taste of your sweet cum in my mouth but I do like my pussy.\" \n\n\"And I love your pussy. I love to lick it and suck it and fuck it and feel it and wash it and rub it. I also love that you like being naked because you excite me every time I look at your beautiful body.\" \n\n\"It excites me to have you look at me. I feel loved and wanted. I can't possibly imagine how I lived without those feelings. Loving you just keeps getting better and better. Good night my love.\" \n\nMonday morning came early; we needed to be at the main conference room in the offices of one of the big Wall Street investment banks at nine-thirty. We bathed and dressed and had a delicious breakfast prepared by Anthony. I got an uneasy feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I looked at Anne dressed in the familiar business attire that I had always seen her in when I worked for her. Her hair was up and her makeup very understated. There was no observable evidence of the smoldering sexy body that was now concealed beneath her business suit. \n\nMelissa drove us to our destination and dropped us off at an elevator in the parking garage where she would be waiting for us. We rode up to the floor where the meeting was scheduled and went through the glass doors to the office where the conference room was located. When we entered the room, about half the people were already there with their tablets and computers in front of them. Anne took her seat at the head of the table and I sat in a chair to her immediate left. There were glasses and pitchers of water on the table but no other food or drink in the room. \n\nThe meeting began at precisely nine-thirty with Anne welcoming the team captains and commending them for their efforts, which according to the preliminary reports indicated that the corporation was ahead of projections for the current year. She then let each captain present the results for the team. As the presentation progressed, information was displayed for each division on large screens on the walls of the rooms so everyone could see the numbers. Each captain was allotted ten minutes to do this and each was very well prepared. Only occasionally was a captained asked a question about the report. \n\nBy the time all reports had been presented, numbers and headings elaborating the profits for the second quarter and year to date filled the screens. When I saw the totals for the year and the net worth of the corporation I almost peed in my pants. Anne's corporation was worth over twelve billion dollars and was on track to make over ten percent more this year. In case you're one of those people who don't really understand the difference between those numbers that end with 'illion', think about this: one million seconds is about eleven and a half days. One billion seconds is almost thirty-two years! \n\nThis incredible, wonderful, brilliant, sexy woman had taken the fortune her father left her when he died and increased it over tenfold in eight years. Since she owned ninety percent of the company she was personally worth over ten billion dollars. I turned my head from the screen and looked at her. She looked back at me and saw the astonishment on my face and gave me the sweetest smile I had ever seen. It was the closest thing to an emotion I had seen on her face during the entire meeting. \n\nShe stood up and started speaking. \"I want to congratulate all of you on your performances this quarter and I'm authorizing bonuses to go along with the semi-annual disbursements. I am proud of all of you. Before we conclude the meeting I have an announcement to make. In the past I have had to replace two of the captains due to death and I am now faced with the prospect of having to do this again. This task is all the more painful because the person I must replace is me.\" \n\nThere were audible gasps and one of the captains, a woman, cried out, \"Oh no Anne no.\" Everyone stopped cold and some of these hardened stoic professionals actually looked like they were about to cry. Walter of course already knew but still looked sad. \n\n\"I have recently been diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer and given six months to live. I will try very hard to attend the next meeting but I didn't want to chance not being able to so I would like to introduce you to the person I have selected to take my place. Carl would you please stand. I would like to introduce you all to Carl Evans. Carl and I worked together for almost two years in the largest acquisition our corporation was ever involved in. \n\nDuring that time he exceeded my expectations in every assignment he was given and is very familiar with my management style so I'm sure you will feel comfortable with him as my successor. My role has evolved to the point where I'm not that involved with the day-to-day activities of the many businesses and investments we manage. I see myself as more of a coordinator and councilor for you and in that capacity I'm sure Carl will perform as competently as I have. Carl would you like to say something to the team?\" \n\nI rose and tried to keep the look of complete surprise off my face. Years of being in meetings like this with Anne had prepared me for surprises and I was used to having to think fast when presented with unusual situations. \"I look forward to meeting with each of you over the coming months and assuming the responsibility for succeeding Anne in directing the efforts of the team. My impression is that you are all consummate professionals and need very little guidance in order to produce results. Be assured I will not try to micro-manage your teams as long as you continue your success. I only wish I could have met all of you under happier circumstances.\" \n\n\"Unless somebody has something else to contribute I believe this meeting is at an end.\" \n\nEveryone lined up to tell Anne how sorry they were to hear this news and to shake my hand and welcome me to the team. When Walter came up Anne asked him if he could stay for a minute. When everyone else had left, Anne asked Walter if he was in a hurry. He said not if she needed him for anything so she suggested that we have lunch at the private club at the top of the building we were in and discuss what she needed to tell him. \n\nThe club was probably one of the finest restaurants in the city but was the exclusive domain of the billionaires who run the financial activities of the entire planet. When we had finished ordering Anne told Walter that she wanted him to make her will. He looked a little surprised that she didn't have one and said he assumed somebody else had drawn one up for her a long time ago. \n\n\"I never got around to it but now that I'm going to have a child I see the necessity of tying up loose ends. I've given a lot of thought to this and I've come to the conclusion that trying to itemize everything I own and wind down my business and liquidate all the assets is going to be very difficult and will consume all of the time I have left so I need your help in keeping everything as it is and I want it all to go to Carl and Sandy, \n\nthey are to be my sole heirs and beneficiaries.\" \n\nFor the second time this morning I was stunned. \n\nWalter asked the question that he and I were both thinking, \"Are you sure about this Anne?\" \n\n\"I am more sure of this than anything I've ever done. I spent too long building my business to put a wrecking ball to it now and what would I do with all the money if I did wind everything down. As far as them being my heirs, who better to choose than the father of my child and the woman who will be her mother.\" ",
        "\"Well that will make things simpler. You're right about the time it would take to dismantle your corporation and liquidate your holdings. And then you'd have this huge pile of cash to deal with. Whoever you left that to would have to pay a large portion of it to the IRS. Since you've already named Carl to be your successor in the business he's just another stockholder of the corporation like you and me and the other captains. You personally don't have a lot of assets. The properties and your personal effects are the only tangible items. You lease your car and most everything else you need. I'll get started on it immediately and have it ready for you to sign as soon as I can.\" \n\n\"We have plans to travel sometime in the first part of July so I'd like to have this done by the time we leave. That's why I want Sandy named explicitly in case anything were to happen to both me and Carl while we're traveling. You will of course act as the executor.\" \n\n\"I would be honored to. I'll have it completed before you go.\" \n\n\"You can tear up the agreement that Carl and I signed. You don't have any objections to that do you Carl?\" \n\n\"The only thing I object to is that we need to have any arrangement at all my love. Walter as soon as Anne's will is probated Sandy and I need to come see you about a lot of things and first among them will be drawing up new wills of our own.\" \n\n\"I will be at your disposal when the time comes Carl. I also want to welcome you to the team. I was a good friend of Anne's father so I've known this remarkable woman for a long time. If she thinks enough of you to be the father of her child then that's the highest recommendation you could ever receive. I very much look forward to meeting your wife because I've never known anybody with the kind of compassion she must possess to agree to let you do what you're doing for Anne.\" \n\n\"There is one more thing Walter, can you please look into the legal aspects of our child? We need to know if Carl and Sandy have to adopt her or if he has legal custody by being the father. Since we're not married I don't want there to be any loose ends regarding whom she belongs to. Whatever it takes, she needs to be Carl and Sandy's child. Please make sure the agreement with the surrogate is iron clad and she can't lay claim to the baby.\" \n\n\"Don't worry about that Anne. I'll see to it.\" \n\nWe finished lunch and sent a text to Melissa to have the car ready. She was waiting for us when we arrived in the garage. Once we were in the car I turned to Anne and pulled her close and kissed her. \"That was a very interesting meeting my love.\"  \n\n\"How does it feel to be a rich man Carl?\" \n\n\"I've been a rich man since I walked back into your house eight days ago. I just have more money now. By the way, what kind of salary do I get being the CEO of your corporation?\" \n\n\"I don't take a fixed salary. I've arranged most of what I spend to be an expense for the corporation but I can transfer funds to my private account up to the limit of the amount of cash the corporation has. It's actually not pure cash but T-Bills.\" \n\n\"And how much is that?\" \n\n\"You saw the balance sheet this morning. We currently hold one billion dollars.\" \n\n\"You could take all of that out?\" \n\n\"I've never had a reason to. It's primarily there to be able to act quickly if an opportunity presents itself and we need money fast. The most I've ever taken out in compensation is sixty million in one year. The last two years I've only taken twelve million. You will have the same arrangement but you'll soon find that buying stuff isn't all that much fun once you have everything you really need, and you will as soon as I'm gone.\" \n\n\"Oh my precious darling that is so not true. I have everything I really need right here in my arms and no amount of money could ever change that.\" \n\n\"You never stop finding ways to tell me you love me do you? And I know they come straight from your heart because they make me feel like I'm going to explode from all the love you've given me.\" \n\n\"But speaking of money, I got you credit cards in your name that are for my accounts. There's a platinum American Express and a Black Visa card. They both have no limit.\" She reached in her purse and took them out and handed them to me. \"We need to stop at the bank so you can get a debit card on my checking account for cash if you need it.\" She pressed herself tightly against me and held my hand as we headed back uptown to the doctor's office to do the daily check up on the egg harvesting process.  \n\nWhen we arrived at Dr. Martin's we were shown right in and were told that a problem had come up. Delores had been in an accident and broken her hip and couldn't do the insemination for at least eight weeks. \n\nThis meant it might take some time to find another surrogate. Dr. Martin said we could still harvest Anne's eggs on Thursday but they would have to be fertilized then frozen until a new surrogate was found. She said we could wait until after we had found somebody to harvest her eggs but it could take as long as a couple of weeks. We told her we would think about it and call her later today. \n\nI asked her if she had a way to video the actual insemination of the egg and the implantation procedure. She said there was a camera that could be attached to the microscope and one that could be inserted during the implantation process but that they did not have them on the premises. I asked her if she could arrange to have them brought in quickly enough to record both procedures. She said she could make a phone call to the research institute that had this equipment and find out if she could borrow them but there might be a charge for doing so. I told her to make the call because I wanted to show them to our child one day. \n\nWhen we walked out of the building Melissa was waiting for us. We got in the car and told her about what had happened and to head back to the house. \n\n\"Melissa do you have any romantic music you could play for us on the way home?\" \n\n\"You two don't need romantic music. It only encourages you to take your clothes off.\" \n\n\"We're going to do that anyway so I thought it might help to cover up the sounds.\" \n\nMelissa pushed a button and Andrea Bocelli began to sing 'Besame Mucho'. \n\n\"That's perfect Melissa, thank you.\" \n\n\"You know what besame mucho means don't you Anne.\" \n\n\"It means kiss me a lot. And you need to get started but first help me get out of this suit. I find it very confining and uncomfortable all of a sudden. I don't like wearing business attire anymore. In fact I don't like wearing clothes at all anymore.\" \n\n\"Well you don't have to wear them on my account. Sit up and let me help you take off that jacket.\" \n\nI quickly removed her jacket then took her skirt off to reveal that she had on a red lace thong and no hose. \"The Anne Cordet I used to know would never wear such sexy undies to a business meeting.\" \n\n\"That Anne Cordet has disappeared. You've awakened the real Anne Cordet and she'll wear sexy undies for you anytime you want.\" \n\nI slowly unbuttoned the beautiful white silk blouse she was wearing and when I finished I saw she had on a sexy bra to match the thong. I helped her out of the blouse then undid the clasp of the bra and removed it and put it on the pile with her coat and skirt. She didn't wait for me to take her panties off opting instead to raise her hips up and slip them down and off in one quick motion. \n\n\"Now lets get your suit off so you can get back to the kissing.\" \n\nTogether we had my clothes lying on the pile with hers in less than a minute. \n\nShe leaned over and slid back on her side so she could get her head in my lap and her mouth on my cock, which she began sucking and licking while her hand cradled my balls. I sat back to enjoy this and felt my cock harden in her hot wet mouth. I turned my head and saw the driver of the car next to us. I was thankful that the windows were tinted sufficiently to prevent anyone seeing in. As soon as Anne had me at full erection she removed her mouth and sat up. \n\n\"Slide over a little so you're sitting in the middle of the seat.\" \n\nI did as she told me and when I was in position she put her leg over my legs to straddle me and lowered her hips until my upright cock made contact with her slit. Her hand guided the tip to her wet vagina and she pressed down to engulf me in her warm pink folds. She made a few up and down gyrations to be sure I was exactly where she wanted me then said, \"Now, about that kissing. It's time you got started.\" \n\nNo sooner had she said that than the song ended. The next song that began playing was Michael Bolton's 'Sexual Healing', another appropriate selection. I pulled her head to me and kissed her lips. We exchanged tongues and kissed for a few minutes while she wiggled her pelvis around to massage my cock with her vagina. I put my hands on her shoulders and pushed her back and up so I could get my mouth on her breasts. She arched her back and pressed the one I was sucking against my face then started sliding her hips up and down about half way on my cock. \"Ohhh Yesss Carl, suck my tit. Suck it while I fuck you.\" \n\nHer eyes were closed and her movements on my lap were rhythmic and deliberate. She would pull almost completely off me then push determinedly back down until I was inside her to my full length. I was sure no one had ever fucked me with such total concentration before. She was oblivious to everything but what she was doing and what we were feeling. I joined with her in this single-minded absorption and felt my heart fill with love. \n\nShe never made a sound, even when we both knew my climax was approaching and when I began to spew hot cum into her she pressed herself to me and joined me in orgasm. Her contractions milked the pearly liquid out of me without my having to do anything to assist. \n\nShe lowered her head down beside mine and rested it on my shoulder. I moved my hands from her ass and put my arms around her and held her close to me. Her arms encircled my neck as she returned her mouth to mine for some more gentle kissing. \n\nMelissa said, \"Wow you two. Even without your usual passionate vocalizations I really felt that. You're radiating love like somebody turned on the heater back there. You have no idea what a joy it is to be so close to two people who are that much in love. While you two bask in the afterglow of your lovemaking I've got just the song for you to listen to.\" \n\nShe pushed a few buttons and 'Said I Loved You But I Lied' began to play. She was right it was perfect for the way we both felt. Anne stopped kissing me and looked into my eyes while she listened to the song. When she heard the words 'this is more than love I feel inside' tears started rolling down her cheeks. She didn't have to say anything; I knew it was true. \n\nWhen the song ended she laid her head back on my shoulder still refusing to relinquish my cock from her wet vagina. \"Melissa can you play something a little more upbeat for us now?\" \n\nA few seconds later Robert Palmer's 'Addicted to Love' began. Melissa was musically chronicling our feelings perfectly. She was just as in tune with our feelings for each other as we were ourselves. I really admired her intuition. Somehow it didn't seem strange to have her around when we were being intimate. It sure didn't bother Anne and Melissa actually seemed to get a voyeuristic thrill out of vicariously experiencing our orgasms. \n\nWhen we returned to the house neither of us even bothered to put on a single item of clothing before getting out of the car and walking slowly to the elevator. \"Melissa would you please put our clothes in with the other things that need to go to the laundry?\" \n\n\"No problem Anne. What time do you two want to have dinner?\" \n\n\"Seven thirty should be fine. Tell Anthony to surprise us. You could bring us up a bottle of Champagne if you don't mind.\" \n\nWhen we got back to the room I asked Anne how she felt about the news we got at the doctor's. She was disappointed but she still wanted to do this and she had confidence that Dr. Martin could find us somebody to carry the baby. \n\n\"Anne I'm going to call Sandy and ask her if she would consider doing it.\" \n\n\"Carl, are you sure? That's really asking a lot of her considering what she's already done for me.\" \n\n\"This would solve the possible problem of a surrogate trying to lay claim to the baby. I know it's a remote chance but with you not here we can't rule out what kind of legal shenanigans a woman we don't even know could try to pull despite all the forms and contracts that we have her sign beforehand. You more than anyone should know how desperate people can be when it comes to money and if they find out how much money you have they're liable to do anything to get some of it. I won't push Sandy to do it but I think we should at least find out how she feels about it.\" \n\nI picked up my phone and hit the button to call Sandy. \n\n\"Sandy, it's Carl. I've got a problem I need your help with.\" \n\n\"What's the matter honey? Is something wrong with Anne?\" \n\n\"No Anne is fine but we just returned from the doctor and found out that the woman who was going to be her surrogate and carry the baby can't do it. It may take some time to find a replacement and that means if Anne's eggs are harvested on Thursday they will need to be frozen until somebody is found. This lowers the chance of a successful pregnancy a little and it draws this process out more than we originally thought. And there is always the chance that a surrogate will try to retain custody of the child and without Anne here to fight something like that it could turn into a nasty situation later. So I suggested that we let you be the surrogate. How would you feel about that?\" \n\n\"Jesus Carl what a question. How much are we expected to do for her?\" \n\n\"Sweetie this was all my idea from the beginning. I'm not trying to push you into anything. I just thought since we're going to raise her that you would be the perfect person to carry her. It would make both of us feel more like she really was our child. You've done this before and you had very good pregnancies so I'm sure you could do it again. But it's completely up to you. Do you want to think about it and call me back?\" \n\n\"Oh fuck, in for a penny in for a pound. I heard how excited she was when I spoke to her the other day. If I do this I know it will help reassure her that we're all thinking about the baby and it would break her heart if anything were to interfere with what's already been started. What do I have to do?\" \n\n\"We have another appointment with the doctor in the morning. Can you be at her office at nine AM?\" \n\n\"I'll have to get my mother to come stay with the kids. Where is the doctor located?\" \n\n\"Don't worry about that, there will be a car at the house at eight-fifteen to pick you up.\" \n\nAnne grabbed the phone from me and started talking. \n\n\"Sandy I can't tell you how much this means to me. You've no idea how you and Carl have already changed my life in such a short time and now you're doing something unbelievable for me. You can rest assured that I will provide anything you need during your pregnancy. 24/7 care for you and your children and whatever else you want, maids, cooks, medical expenses, daily massages, you name it. I'll spoil you the way I'm sure you will spoil our child when I'm no longer here to do it. Thank you Sandy, thank you so much.\" \n\n\"Anne I'm beginning to feel the same way about you that Carl does. For whatever reason you reached out for help and the universe sent him to you. I can hear what it's done to you and now I feel like I've been given a chance to do something for you and I know I shouldn't refuse to do this. It will mean as much to Carl and me as it does to you. It's changing my understanding about what love really is. I know that I must do this and I have to do it with as much love as I can because that love will come back to me later so I can share it with Carl and our new child. It is I who should be thanking you Anne. You've given me an opportunity to expand my whole being and see life in an entirely new way.\" \n\n\"Sandy you really are a saint. I feel like I've only been alive since Carl came here and everyday I'm presented with new experiences that hit me with the impact of an atomic bomb. Please don't ever feel that I've taken anything away from you. I know how much Carl loves you and loving me has not diminished it in any way. He's growing too and you will be the beneficiary of that growth. He is the most wonderful man I've ever met and I'm sure I don't need to tell you that. I can't wait until tomorrow. I want to hug you and let you see and feel what a difference you two are making in my life. Goodbye and bless you.\" \n\nAnne handed the phone back to me, \"Sandy she's right, you really are a saint and I love you more than I ever have. This is already making me feel closer to you and looking forward to the birth of our new child and the years of watching her grow up. Oh, and one more thing. You remember that agreement we have with Anne about the gift she promised to give us for doing this? Well we've agreed to cancel it. She's making us the sole heirs and beneficiaries in her will. When she dies we're going to inherit a little over ten billion dollars. I didn't want to tell you about that until you made your decision about carrying the baby. Think about that tonight and I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight my love.\" \n\nBefore I had finished speaking with Sandy, Anne was on her phone talking to Dr. Martin and arranging for Sandy to come with us in the morning when we were scheduled so she could be checked out for being the surrogate. \n\nShe had just finished talking to Dr. Martin when Melissa came into the room with the Champagne. \n\n\"Ooops, I didn't realize you were both still naked.\" \n\n\"Don't worry about that Melissa. Just bring that Champagne over here. It's not like you haven't seen us naked before and I need a drink. You're not going to believe what's happened now.\" \n\n\"Yet another surprise?\" \n\n\"I'll let you decide. Carl's wife Sandy has agreed to be my surrogate. She's meeting us at the doctor's tomorrow to get checked out.\" \n\n\"Wow, this is really turning into a first class soap opera. You two should have your own reality TV show. That wife of yours is quite a woman Carl.\" \n\n\"Don't I know it.\" \n\nMelissa left and we finished our glass of wine and decided to head for the spa and have a nice long soak in the pool. Anne was so wrought with emotion about what was happening that she was actually shaking when we got in the bath. \"Quit thinking about this so much and for God's sake quit worrying about it. None of this will make the least bit of difference in a hundred years. Relax and enjoy what happens no matter what it is. I gently washed her and caressed her and kissed her. She finally calmed down and lay beside me so she could slide herself all over me. Her hand lovingly wrapped around my cock and began slowly sliding up and down. \n\n\"Ooooohhhh yessss baby this is all that matters isn't it? I have to remember to take one step at a time and live each moment. Nothing else exists right now but us and how good your cock feels as it grows in my hand. Fuck me my love. Fuck me right here in this bath and let me wallow in our love.\" \n\nShe raised her leg up and I turned toward her. She guided my cock to her vagina and I pushed against her. I slid into her and started caressing her breast with my hand. I kissed her and kept my mouth on hers the whole time I slowly fucked her as we lay half submerged in the warm soapy water. Finally my cock swelled and throbbed, then began spraying cum into her warm wet cunt. She moaned into my mouth with each spurt and held me tight. \n\nAfter dinner we returned to the bedroom and made love until after midnight. We only stopped long enough to go to the bathroom and have a drink of water occasionally. ",
        "We woke up at seven-thirty and got dressed for the visit to the doctor's. Anne had called the limo service to have a car sent to my house to pick up Sandy and we wanted to get to the doctor's early so we would be there when she arrived. Anthony fixed us another delicious breakfast and Melissa was waiting for us in the garage to drive us to the office. \n\nI was a little apprehensive about this meeting but I shouldn't have been. When Sandy walked in the door to the reception room we both got up and went to her. Anne threw her arms around her and hugged her. \"Oh Sandy, thank you so much for being here and doing this. I still can't fully comprehend the magnitude of your generosity.\" \n\n\"I'm having a little trouble adjusting to your generosity. You're leaving us everything you've got, everything you've worked your whole life for and you call me generous.\" \n\n\"None of that matters to me anymore. Carl has given me the only real thing I've ever known and now you are giving me a future, a beautiful miracle that will be my legacy as a result of the love you both are giving to me. The money and the property will just make it easier for you to take care of my precious child.\" \n\nA nurse arrived and asked Sandy to follow her to begin her examination. It would take a little longer for what she needed to do than it would for Anne. In a few minutes Anne was called back for her check up and I waited in the reception room. A half hour later I was told to go to a consulting room where I found Anne and Sandy waiting for me along with Dr. Martin. \n\n\"Well ladies and gentleman, it looks like we're back on track. Sandy is almost as good a candidate for surrogacy as Delores was with one little exception and that is her age. Usually we like to use women who have had a previous pregnancy and are no more than twenty-six years old but Sandy is only four years beyond that and is in excellent health and condition so I see no medical indication that would disqualify her. She is even in the perfect spot in her menstrual cycle for implantation on Thursday so I assume you all want to proceed with this.\" \n\n\"I have the legal adoption papers that your attorney sent over as well as our standard forms regarding the extraction, the sperm donation, the implantation and the storage of your frozen fertilized eggs. Anne, as soon as you sign these, this child or any other resulting from your frozen eggs will legally and officially belong to Mr. and Mrs. Evans or to the surviving spouse in the case of one of them dying. You are all sure this is what you want?\" \n\nWe all said yes and signed the forms. Anne and Sandy were given instruction sheets for how to prepare for their respective procedures and what to expect. She told me that my part was the easiest and I would be given instructions when I got there on Thursday. \n\n\"Dr. Martin, one more thing, what would happen to my frozen eggs in the event that both Mr. and Mrs. Evans were deceased?\" \n\n\"What would you want to happen to them?\" \n\n\"I guess I would want Melissa to have them. She will be my child's godmother so she should decide what to do with the remaining eggs.\" \n\n\"I'll have an amendment made to the storage agreement specifying her as the owner in the event that you and Mr. and Mrs. Evans are all deceased. You and Melissa can sign it Thursday when you come in for the procedures.\" \n\nWhen we all returned to the reception room Anne called Melissa and the driver of Sandy's limo and told them we would be out front in five minutes. Anne took Sandy's hand and held it as we all rode down in the elevator. When we got to the lobby Anne told her, \"Sandy I know Hallmark couldn't possibly have a card for this occasion so just let me tell you again how much I appreciate what you're doing.\" \n\n\"I'm actually starting to get excited Anne. And I want you to know how much I appreciate all the presents that you've been sending me. They're all wonderful and I love them, especially that bracelet from Tiffany's. I've never had anything from there before and it's exquisite.\" \n\n\"It's been fun for me to pick out those things for you since I won't be around to do things like that for my daughter. I'm sure you'll do that for her though.\" \n\n\"Count on it Anne. We'll spoil her as much as you would.\" \n\nSandy's limo pulled up and Anne hugged her again then I hugged her and kissed her and told her how proud I was of her and how much I loved her. I could tell she was OK with this decision and I felt much better than when I arrived. Melissa pulled up shortly after Sandy left and we got in the back seat. \n\n\"Well, how did it go? I can't wait to know what happened.\" \n\n\"The show's back on Melissa. Sandy has consented and been approved to be my surrogate. We all feel that this is the right way to do this. It keeps it all in the family so to speak.\" \n\n\"I was hoping to hear this. I had already made up my mind to do it for you if it didn't work out with Sandy.\" \n\n\"Oh shit Melissa, are you trying to make me cry? I already feel like you're my sister and now you go and say something like that. What have I done to deserve so much love from so many people?\" \n\n\"You've shown us all that you really needed it and you've accepted it and appreciate it and you've even learned how to return it.\" \n\n\"Thank you Melissa. I mean it when I say you're like a sister to me. You should also know that I've designated you to be the owner of my frozen eggs should both Carl and Sandy die.\" \n\nI had the folder with copies of the documents the doctor gave us so I read the instructions to follow for Anne's egg extraction procedure. She was not to eat or drink after midnight Wednesday. She should have an enema Thursday morning and she was to shave her pubic hair. \n\n\"It says here that they want you to shave your pubic hair for the procedure. Would you do me a big favor and have it waxed instead of shaving?\" \n\n\"You have a thing for bald beavers do you?\" \n\n\"Yes I do actually. Waxing keeps the hair off longer and it doesn't itch like crazy when it grows out again.\" \n\n\"And you know this how?\" \n\n\"Sandy's done it for me a couple of times. It has a very positive effect on my libido.\" \n\n\"That's all I need to hear.\" \n\nShe took out her phone and found the card for the spa we went to for the fabulous massages we had a few days ago and called for an appointment for a Brazilian waxing tomorrow after her last check up at the doctor. She insisted I get a massage while she was being waxed so she booked me one with both Cindy and Kathy. \n\nWe had dinner out and went to a play. It was a revival of Cabaret so naturally we decided to go to a jazz club afterward where we could dance. I was surprised at how good a dancer Anne was. She told me her mother insisted she take lessons when she was in school but was glad she had done it. It felt really good to hold her and dance with her. She wore another of her expensive, elegant but sexy gowns with practically no back it was cut so low and I wore my new tux. \n\nThere was an old fashioned ensemble of musicians, a piano player, a drummer, a saxophone, a bass fiddle and a pretty female vocalist from Canada with the sexiest, sultriest voice I had ever heard. They did mostly old standards and a few modern ballads and they did them perfectly. Holding her close and moving slowly to these songs made it feel like we were melting into each other. \n\nWhen they played 'I've Never Been in Love Before' Anne raised her head up from my shoulder to look in my eyes as the words seem to pour out of the singer's mouth like warm syrup and flow all over us. I could tell Anne wanted to cry as she listened to a song that could have been written for her but she was just too much in love to let the tears out. \n\nWe left early for the doctor's on Wednesday because Anne wanted to go to the adult video store. I asked her what she was looking for and she wouldn't tell me until we got there and she asked the clerk to show her the strap-on dildos. \n\n\"I guess I don't have to ask what you intend to do with one of those do I?\" \n\n\"Well I thought since we both enjoy you fucking me in the ass we should try it the other way around.\" \n\nAnne picked out three strap-ons and asked the clerk if she could try the harnesses on. He told her she could use one of the private video booths but since there wasn't anybody else in the store, she just pulled up her skirt and tried them on over her thong. She chose one that fit her very well and was comfortable and asked about the dildo that went with it. The clerk showed her several that fit that harness and she decided to get three of them in different sizes each with its own harness. One seven inches, one eight inches and one nine inches long. They were extremely realistic and they had vibrators in them. She also got three small vibrating dildos that could go into the woman's ass or vagina while she was wearing the harness. Visions of what I was in for began to flicker through my head. \n\nShe paid for them and we started walking to the doctor's office. Dr. Martin was very pleased with the results of the tests and said we should be back in the office at seven thirty the next day and told me I could give my semen while Anne was having her extraction procedure. Sandy would be prepped and waiting in another room and the implantation would occur soon after Anne's eggs had been fertilized. If all went well we should have a baby on the way in about two weeks. She told Anne to refrain from vaginal intercourse from now until forty-eight hours following the extraction procedure. Suddenly it became clearer why Anne wanted to visit the sex shop. \n\nWe left the doctor's office and walked to the spa. Anne was taken to a room to do her waxing and Cindy and Kathy led me to one of the massage rooms. They didn't even bother to ask me what kind of massage I wanted; we just all started taking our clothes off. This time they were much more comfortable with me and a lot more intimate in their touching. \n\nThey rubbed their tits all over me and took turns laying on top of me and sliding up and down my body. Cindy straddled my chest then rubbed her bald pussy all over it. She inched her slit ever closer to my face until her lips made contact with mine. I stuck my tongue out and flicked it across her clit. She pulled back but soon returned so I could do it again. Finally she pressed her lips against mine and kept them there. I sucked her clit into my mouth and licked it gently. She began to slowly gyrate her hips. \n\nWhile I was busy licking Cindy, Kathy was stroking my hard cock with one oily hand and massaging my balls with the other. They made a great team. As Kathy's fabulous hand job took me closer to cumming, Cindy's arousal increased right along with mine. I was truly amazed at their ability to massage my cock to orgasm without making me feel like they were jerking me off. Anne was right, we should just invite them to move in with us. \n\nKathy knew I was about to explode before I did and said, \"Get ready Cindy we're about to have a gusher here.\" Cindy moved forward a little so she could get her vagina over my mouth. I stuck my tongue in it and she used her fingers to rub her clit. In a few seconds I felt her start to cum on my face and Kathy gently squeezed my balls and let go of my cock. It was rock hard and standing straight up as the first spurt of cum jetted from the tip. Kathy squealed as each additional glob erupted from me and splattered on my stomach. \"I just love to make a man do this. It's so much fun to watch; it almost gets me off too.\" \n\nThey had just finished cleaning me up when the door opened and Anne walked in. \"I see you've been left in very capable hands. I don't need to ask if you enjoyed yourself.\" \n\n\"How was your waxing session?\" \n\n\"Not as painful as I thought it would be but the results are worth it. You're going to love it. I feel even sexier than usual so I hope Cindy and Kathy didn't wear you out.\" \n\n\"So show me.\" \n\n\"No. Not until we get home because I know what would happen if I did and I don't think they would approve of us taking up one of their rooms for the next hour while you had fun with my pussy. Can you still call it a pussy if there's no hair on it?\" \n\n\"That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Come on let's get out of here and spend the rest of the day in bed.\" \n\nWe paid for our treatments and Anne gave Cindy and Kathy each a hundred-dollar bill and thanked them for taking good care of me. \n\n\"Any time Ms. Cordet. It was a pleasure I can assure you.\" \n\nAnne knew what that meant. \"I can't leave you alone for thirty minutes can I?\" \n\n\"I don't want you to leave me alone for thirty seconds my love.\" \n\nAnne had already called Melissa to come and get us so when we walked out of the spa the car was waiting for us. Melissa opened the back door for us and when she got in the driver's seat she asked what was in the bag Anne was carrying. Anne proceeded to take the dildos out and show them to her. \n\n\"I can see you two are really kicking it up a notch. Are you going to wait until I get you home or are you going to get started now?\" \n\n\"I think Carl needs a little respite after his special massage so we'll try to keep it down for the ride home.\" \n\n\"Carl you haven't been naughty, have you?\" \n\n\"It didn't feel naughty to me.\" \n\n\"I'll just bet it didn't.\" \n\n\"Anne we've got a busy day tomorrow, why don't we just eat in tonight and after dinner we can go to that impressive theater you have in your house and watch a movie. I haven't even seen a TV screen since I've been with you.\" \n\n\"It's been a while since I've watched a movie too. Which one did you have in mind?\" \n\n\"Have you ever seen 'A Walk in The Clouds'? It's one of Sandy's favorites. It's a love story so you should enjoy it.\" \n\n\"Yes my love if Sandy likes it then I'm sure I will too. At least I should enjoy it because I can only aspire to the kind of love she has shown me in letting you be with me and what she is doing for me and our child.\" \n\nWhen we got back to the house we had Melissa bring us up a bottle of Champagne and we headed for the spa to play in the bath. Anne told me to get in while she made a big production out of revealing her denuded crotch to me by playing peek-a-boo with a large towel. By the time she dropped the towel completely and bent over so I could see her from behind, my cock was fully erect. \n\n\"I guess I don't have to ask you if you like it.\" \n\nI started to say something and she shushed me. \n\n\"The way you look at me is all the answer I need my love. When I see your face like this it makes me feel so special. The way you love me makes me weak and dizzy and pulls me deeper into love with you. My beloved Carl, I am more grateful for your love than I could ever have imagined. Thank you so much for loving me this way.\" \n\nShe got in the bath and we spent almost half an hour playing with each other and washing our bodies pausing only for kissing and sips of Champagne. She liked rubbing her bald soapy slit on my hard shaft as she straddled me. I liked kissing her tits while she did it. \n\nAfter we finished we put on robes and went down for an early dinner. Anthony had prepared a fabulous lobster salad and some freshly baked granary bread. We finished the Champagne while we ate then went up to the theater. Anne went upstairs while I managed to get the movie ready by using the NetFlix connection. She returned with the moisturizing lotion I liked so much. \n\n\"You can rub some of this lotion on my pussy while we're watching. I'll give you a hand job if you promise to be good and don't cum.\" We sat on one of the sofas and leisurely played with each other while we watched the movie. \n\n\"I can see why Sandy likes this movie. It's such a simple honest love story. I'm so grateful we don't have other people interfering in our love story. Everybody we know is supportive of us being together and that means so much to me.\" \n\nWe rode up to the bedroom and got ready for bed where I continued my meticulous exploration of Anne's bare crotch. Vaginal intercourse may have been off the menu but oral sex was still very much an option. One I indulged in for almost an hour. She must have cum half a dozen times as I licked and sucked her beautiful naked pussy. \n\n\"As soon as you feel you've recovered from your procedure I'll pick this up right where I've left off. I don't seem to be able to get enough of your fabulous nude twat.\" \n\n\"I was hoping you'd say that. Since you like it so much I intend to keep it this way for you. As long as you continue to keep your tongue on me.\" \n\n\"Don't worry about that. The only time I won't be licking your pussy will be when my cock is inside it.\""
