        "I was on the bus, stuck in traffic on 47th when my phone chirped. I would have ignored it. Nobody that I actually want to talk to ever calls me, but we'd been sitting at this intersection for three rounds of the stoplight and I was about to go out of my mind with boredom, so I glanced at the screen. Someone named Dr. Thomas Harker was calling me. I had no idea who that was, no recollection of programming that name in, and to be perfectly honest I'm really crappy at the whole yearly physical thing. Since my gynecologist was female, and I really wasn't seeing anyone else, I had my finger poised over the ignore button. Then it occurred to me. My dad was a doctor. We only saw each other like once a year when I'd go to Wisconsin for a visit and a Green Bay game. But maybe this was one of his friends. He was an old coot, but I loved him and couldn't help but worry, so I went for the answer button instead.\n\n\"Hello, hello?\" I shouted into the phone, because the bus was full of irate riders who just wanted to get home and were being very vocal about it. I covered my other ear, trying to make out the words on the other end.\n\n\"Thirty minutes. Leave your door unlocked, be naked, kneeling in the middle of the living room.\"\n\nI pulled the phone away from my ear and stared at it. I didn't put it back quite as close to my ear, because, you know, radiation. And bad vibes. \"Who is this?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Thirty minutes.\" The voice repeated, then there was only that peculiar silence that cell phones give you. No clicks, no dial tones, just dead air. \n\n\"Okay,\" I said to myself. \"A wrong number. No biggie.\" Except that the call was from a number programmed into my phone. I went to the contact list. Sure enough, there was a name and a phone number, listed as business. Nothing else, but the area code was local. I tapped a few more icons and opened up a Google Search. Typed in the name. Went back and added the city. Went back again and added doctor. It might as well have been Tom Jones for as much clarity as the search gave me.\n\nThe bus was moving again, sort of, and I shoved the mystery to the back of my mind. Whatever the case, I sure as hell was not going to strip and kneel in the middle of my floor with the door unlocked. This was the big city, after all. We made it a few more blocks then some cab tried to cut in front of the bus. The driver swerved and a drunk teenager fell into my lap. I shoved him back into the aisle. A couple more blocks and some perv slipped into the seat next to me where a sweet granny had been sitting. When he started leering, I fervently wished for the granny's knitting needles. I finally abandoned mass transit a couple blocks early, asking myself yet again why it was I'd moved to the big city. The phone call was all but forgotten.\n\nI stopped at a sidewalk vendor and bought a chili dog. See, that's what happens when you have to hoof it; impulse buying. And of course they always smell way better than they taste, but at least I didn't have to give more thought to dinner. I paused in front of my apartment building to finish off the dog. The doorman gets really irate if you bring food into his lobby. I've found that if you're lucky enough to have a doorman, you really want to stay on his good side. Otherwise, packages, pizzas and other goodies can go astray way too easy. I dropped the wrapper in a handy waste bin on the corner then climbed the steps, still chewing. When I mumbled a greeting to the doorman, he gave me his usual crap about how bad my diet is. I just smiled and kept chewing as I headed for my mailbox.\n\nInside, there was the regular stack of junk mail. I almost threw it all into the recycling bin, but then I noticed a thin envelope with a handwritten address on it, using my full name. God I hate that. \"My name is Sky,\" I announced to the empty hall. Next I noticed the return address, or rather lack thereof. All it said was Dr. Thomas Harker. The creepy-crawlies went up and down my spine. I started to open it, but then the jerk from 203 came around the corner. He had no business of his own, so he was always getting in everybody else's. I tucked the envelope under my arm and headed for the elevator.\n\nOnce I reached my apartment, I tossed the envelope on the counter and searched the fridge for some wine or beer to wash the chili dog taste out of my mouth. All I found was beer, of course, because if there was wine, I would have drunk it already. It always held priority over beer. I popped the top and took a long swig, then stared at the envelope. Did I really want to know what was in it? I finally convinced myself that not knowing was not an option. I took another swig, then ripped the envelope open. Inside there was a handwritten note. It said, \"6:00 pm, door unlocked, naked, kneeling in the middle of the living room.\" I dropped the note as if I'd been burned. When I could breathe normally again, I glanced at the microwave. It was pronouncing that the time was 6:23. I rushed to the apartment door and threw a couple more locks, then I pulled out my cell phone and checked the call log. The call had come at precisely 5:30. So, okay, I told myself. Whatever was supposed to happen at six had come and gone.\n\nI retrieved the note and studied the hand writing. A cold chill was coming over me. My old stalker friend had left me alone for almost two months. I had dared to hope that I was done with that whole episode. I still hadn't figured out how an encounter could be so intensely wonderful in the moment and so incredibly creepy when viewed from a distance. While I never did manage to get his name (yeah, long story) one of my friends claimed it was Tom. He had written me a note once before, but I hadn't kept it and recognizing handwriting was not my forte even with side by side samples. I drained the beer and pulled another one out. I looked at my cell phone again, trying to see when Thomas Harker had been added to my contacts. If there was a way to tell, though, it eluded me. I decided that it would be a really good night to crawl into pj's and watch some mindless TV; maybe even fall asleep on the couch. If you can't solve a problem, deny it exists.\n\nI might just mention that I'm a real lightweight when it comes to alcohol, so guzzling two beers in a row was never a good idea. I was beginning to feel the buzz as I headed for the bedroom to change. I threw my head back to finish off the bottle, which is why I tripped over something on the floor. I stumbled into the wall and when I finally righted myself, I was searching for what had tripped me. Hence I was staring at the rope that was trailing out from under my bed instead of the man standing on the other side of the bed.\n\n\"You're late,\" he said, in a stern headmaster sort of way. I jumped about six inches.\n\n\"You're not naked. You're not kneeling in the living room. Have you forgotten entirely how to obey?\"\n\n\"How did you get in here?\" I demanded.\n\n\"With a key,\" he replied, and gave me a condescending look as if I was campaigning for village idiot. I glanced at the bathroom door, but he was between me and it, and frankly, hiding in a bathroom hadn't worked out so great last time.\n\nMy brain was screaming \"Run!\" at my feet, but they were busy remembering how he was capable of delivering orgasms that tingled all the way to the tips of my toes. In fact, pretty much everything from my neck down was totally ignoring all those fight or flight signals. At least the adrenalin was starting to clear the beer fog. I remembered the extra key that I kept in the kitchen drawer for when my brother would visit. Or maybe, that I used to keep there.\n\nI raised my hands like I was trying to ward him off, even though he was on the other side of the room. \"Look, I'm not going there anymore. We're through. Find someone else to be your whipping boy. Girl. Whatever. Just leave me alone.\"\n\n\"I'm not through with you,\" he said in his deep, melodious and utterly threatening voice. He started toward the end of the bed, and finally my feet decided to listen. I made a dash for the apartment door and was fumbling with the third lock when he leaned against the door, arms crossed on his chest. \"Where are you going?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"Away from here,\" I exclaimed tugging fruitlessly at the door.\n\n\"This is your home,\" he pointed out needlessly.\n\n\"Not any more. I'm moving.\" I kept tugging at the door. I'd get it open a fraction of an inch and then it would slam shut. Maybe if I annoyed the neighbors enough, but no, it was Friday night. I was the only one home on a Friday night. Me and the jerk in 203.\n\n\"You don't want to move,\" he said, reaching over and unwrapping my hands from the door knob. \"Think of all the memories we've made here.\"\n\nI yanked my hands free and backed away. One of those voices in my head was screaming \"Don't let him touch you!\" I only had a few states of being when he was anywhere near; angry volcano, which I was clinging desperately to at the moment; putty, which was pretty much any time his fingers touched me; soft and gooey when his lips touched me; stormy ocean when his tongue touched me; and molten lava when his cock was buried inside me. I hadn't ever seen those phases described on a National Geographic special, but they should have been. When he wasn't around, I could pass as a normal human being, even hold down a job and pay bills. When he was around, well, I was basically mindless goo.\n\nHe calmly reached over and slid the deadbolt lock shut. \"Last time I was here, you said you would never deny me again,\" he said, still leaning against the door.\n\n\"That's not fair! I was under duress,\" I argued.\n\n\"Duress? Was I hurting you? Was I doing anything that you didn't ask me for? I believe the phrase you repeated more than once was 'Please, Sir.'\"\n\n\"Under the influence, then.\"\n\n\"Of what? I didn't see you take a drink of anything. I didn't taste wine on your lips.\" He licked his own lips as he said that, and his eyes were glued to my lips. He was moving closer, so slowly it was almost imperceptible.\n\n\"You, damn it! I was under the influence of you.\"\n\nThat made him smile. \"Admitting the truth is good for the soul, don't you think?\" he asked, cocking his head.\n\nA tiny little voice was yelling, \"Back away,\" but it was so distant and there was a roaring in my ears. \"What?\" I said with a shake of my head. \"What truth?\"\n\n\"That you need me, that you want me. That you are empty without me. That you need me to fill you, to make you whole.\" He reached out with one long finger and traced the outline of my lips, concentrating as he did so. The little voice in my head was jumping up and down, waving its hands in the air and shouting, \"That's how it always starts!\" I started to shake my head and suddenly, the hand that had been so softly tracing my lips was tangled in my hair, gripping the back of my neck tightly. \"That you want me to punish you, to make you obedient,\" he continued, then crushed his lips against mine. I was gasping for breath and his tongue took that as an invitation to enter and overwhelm my own. My hands found his chest, but they had no strength to push him away. With that one hand and his lips he held me frozen in place. When he had wrestled my tongue into submission, he pulled back and used the hand at my neck to push me down on my knees. His hands twisted into my hair and gripped my head.\n\n\"How liberating would it be to trust someone who has complete control over you?\" he asked, apparently oblivious to the fact that I was trembling. \"Here's your chance to find out.\" I couldn't see much of anything but his crotch, hidden behind dark slacks, but he was obviously hard and ready, waiting for me. When I'd told him before that I couldn't deep throat him, he had accepted that, and then berated me after for not trusting him. I'd been with enough guys who had broken that trust, and he was so totally different from all the rest, how could he expect me to trust him? Perhaps, because he was different from all the rest? I knew, with as much surety as I was capable, that if I refused and convinced him that I really meant it, he would walk away. But part of me - the part from the neck down - wasn't ready to let him walk away. In fact, the two month drought after the incredibly intense experiences he had orchestrated had been torturous in its own right. There wasn't a vibrator in the world that could match the magic of his tongue.\n\nI was taking too long to think about it. That was probably an unspoken rule that I was expected to know. He shook me. \"Decide!\" he snapped. My brain didn't say, \"Okay, let's do this,\" but my hands reached for his belt. A moment later, his cock was springing free, demanding attention. Jeez, it seemed even bigger than I remembered. I licked my lips and engulfed as much as I could, but he yanked me back. \"Not so fast. Take your time,\" he commanded, but I thought I sensed just a hint of approval in his voice. I guess that made sense, since he had told me he fed on his control over me and I certainly seemed to be fulfilling his commands.\n\nI started again, with just the tip of my tongue, teasing from balls to head, top to bottom, then again with the flat of my tongue. When I had covered the entire surface, I spent a few moments on his balls. Then, I sucked the head of his cock into my mouth, working my tongue furiously on the underside and my hands stroking and working what didn't fit in my mouth. His hands tightened on my head and it took all my will power to keep going. My own hands tightened on his cock, preparing to defend my throat against an assault. But then he was coming, pressing no farther than my mouth and throat could easily accommodate, his hands firm on my head but not forcing me. Despite gagging, I used my hands to milk the last of his come and swallowed readily. When he finally pulled back, I fell forward, bracing myself with my extended arms, trying to catch my breath and calm my nerves. I could feel him watching me, but refused to look up.\n\nAfter an interminable silence, I heard him refasten his slacks, then he stepped back and said, \"You're kneeling, but you're not naked. Fix that.\" He turned away and moved into the kitchen segment of the room. It sounded like he was helping himself to a beer. Again, I was sure I was taking too long to decide what to do. Part of my brain was saying, \"You've sucked him off. That's enough.\" Unfortunately, the part that was from the neck down had other ideas. Out of the corner of my eyes, I could see him move in front of the kitchen bar, probably leaning against it, crossing his legs at the ankles.\n\n\"I'm not seeing bare skin,\" he taunted, but with a touch of humor. He was enjoying my dilemma. \n\nI took a deep breath and sat back on my heels, though I still didn't look up. \"What do you want?\"\n\nI knew he shrugged, even though I couldn't see it. \"Your obedience.\"\n\n\"I think you want my disobedience,\" I challenged, with just a hint of a cringe.\n\nIs it possible to hear a smile? He sauntered over and his fingers combed through my tangled hair. \"Is that what you think?\" he asked, disingenuously. \"That it's all about punishment?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" and damn if it didn't come out squeaky. I took a deep breath. \"You knew how unlikely it was for me to be able to get home by 6:00.\" Okay, that was conjecture, but any good stalker should know stuff like that. \"You told me to leave the door unlocked even though you had a key. You showed up here expecting to have an excuse to punish me.\" I straightened my backbone but didn't raise my eyes. Baby steps.\n\nHe squatted down next to me. \"I didn't need an excuse, cherie. I have been explicit about the rules. I promised you punishment if you didn't follow them. You said you understood. You have been very disobedient.\" He leaned close to my ear. \"You crave punishment. Deny it.\"\n\nI shook my head, squeezing my eyes tight shut to prevent tears. I felt helplessly trapped in a paradox where no answer was right. When he had spanked me, it hurt, yes. It also went straight to my core and ignited a conflagration. He was the only one there to quench it.\n\n\"You also crave to obey, crave clear rules to follow,\" he continued. \"Do you know why?\"\n\nI shook my head. I couldn't think of a good argument to prove I didn't crave that kind of weakness, let alone why I might want that.\n\nHe tucked my hair behind my ear, making it harder to hide from his intense gaze. \"Because it's easy. Simple. No decisions to make. You do what you're told to do, you get your reward. You misbehave, you get your punishment and after, when you do obey, you get an even more intense reward.\" His lips brushed the corner of my eye where a tear was threatening to fall. \"Simple,\" he whispered. He pulled away. \"Now undress,\" he snapped.\n\nMy hands went immediately to the top button of my blouse. He went back to the kitchen bar and took up his beer again. I still didn't meet his eyes as I slowly pulled my blouse off, removed my bra and unfastened my slacks. I couldn't figure out how to slide them off while kneeling, so I made do with pushing them down, squirming to a sitting position, to pull them the rest of the way off, then kneeling again. Not exactly what you would call graceful - or even close. I swear I heard him smile. I had used up my store of feistiness and returned to being his obedient pet. And he never doubted I would. He made me wait like that until he finished his beer, then he sauntered over and knelt behind me.\n\nOne arm snaked around my waist from behind. His other hand was at the back of my neck again, pushing my head down toward the floor even as the arm at my waist was lifting my ass up high. When he seemed satisfied with that, he place my arms on either side of my head, stretched forward in such a way that I suspected was meant to be intentionally awkward and difficult to hold. Part of my brain was suggesting I needed to go back to yoga classes. Another part was noticing that I really needed to vacuum. Most of it though was quite simply dying for his touch anywhere in the area he had just so thoroughly exposed.\n\nHe made some minor adjustments, stood and walked slowly around me, knowing the torment he was putting my through. It seemed like forever before he settled back behind me, chuckling when he saw the juices running down the backs of my thighs. There was another long pause, then his thumb was buried in my pussy. It wiggled about briefly, then just as suddenly was gone, only to press insistently at my asshole. Well lubricated with pussy juice it slit right in. I was pleased with myself for remaining silent. He hadn't commanded it yet, but I was sure it was coming, and practice couldn't hurt. I didn't make a sound when two fingers of the same hand slid into my pussy. I didn't even gasp when they all began slowly pumping in and out. I stayed as still as I could, and prayed they would go faster. \n\nThey didn't, but after another moment, his other hand had reached in front of my thighs to press upward, massaging my belly, even as his little finger wiggled down between my lips and softly massaged my clit with the same rhythm as his other hand. Too slow, I wanted to shout. But I stayed silent. I was obedient. I focused on how the sensation of being massaged from inside and out at the same time was causing so much pressure to build inside me. I didn't know if I would survive the explosion when it came.\n\nWhen I was sure I would lose my mind if the pressure wasn't relieved, his hands suddenly disappeared. I think I made a soft choking sound and I could feel my thighs quivering with need. I began reciting the pledge of allegiance in my head. Anything to keep my focus away from my oh, so empty pussy. What was he doing back there? I heard him stand and move away. I balled my hands into fists, hoping he wasn't looking. A few moments later, he was back. I could feel his breath where it hit my sopping pussy and the juices running down my legs. That tiniest of sensations was pure torture. I couldn't stand it anymore and I blurted out the one thing that might not get me in trouble.",
        "\"Please, Sir.\" There was a definite sob in my voice.\n\n\"Hush,\" he commanded, then something hard and flat hit my ass with a loud smack.\n\n\"Ahhh!\" I cried out as I lurched forward.\n\n\"Did you not hear me say hush?\" he asked calmly followed immediately with an even louder smack. \"And are you not out of position?\" Smack.\n\nIt was everything I could do to get my sobbing under control and move back into the position he'd place me in even as the blows continued to fall. I returned to the pledge, though some of the words were now eluding me. I knew my ass cheeks must be bright red and the initial sting was being replaced by a white hot burning. When I was once again in position and quiet save for my strangled breaths, he tossed his weapon of choice to the side. I could see that it was a paddle, like for table tennis. Somehow, through all that, the ache in my pussy had grown ten-fold.\n\nI could feel him moving behind me, then he was adjusting me slightly, spreading my knees, pushing my shoulders down. As he brushed against me to move this or that limb, I realized that he was naked. From time to time, his cock would slide across my back, or poke against one of my thighs. I dared hope he was finally going to give me some relief. What came instead was even more torturous.\n\nHe was on his knees and moved forward until his thighs and hips were pressed against my throbbing ass cheeks. I sucked in a breath and started at the beginning of the pledge again. I knew if I moved away even slightly, there would be hell to pay. I could feel his cock on my back and tried to imagine how good it would feel in my pussy. When he slid it down the crack of my ass, I dared to hope that was where it was headed. But, no. It slid further to nestle between my pussy lips, exerting an unbearable pressure in its own right, but of a very different nature. So close and yet so far. He leaned over me, his weight falling heavily on my back. His hands reached forward and clutched at my breasts. He alternated between groping my entire breasts and pulling and twisting at my nipples with his fingers. I was breathing in short gasps.\n\nI knew if he just moved the tiniest bit, created that minute bit of friction, it would generate the spark that would ignite my very being. Or if he reared back just enough for his cock to find my opening, I would be screaming at the top of my lungs with one plunge. But with his weight on me, there was nothing I could do to set any of those wheels in motion, punishment be damned. He was holding me utterly helpless and he knew it. I was weeping in frustration and desperation, as quietly as I could. I'd long since given up remembering any of the words of the pledge of allegiance.\n\nA small part of my mind whispered, \"Orgasm denial.\" It had to repeat itself a few times before I could make sense of what I was remembering. He had promised to punish me with orgasm denial for coming without permission some months ago. It hadn't happened then, and I had dared hope he had forgotten. I should have known better. How long could he keep this up? How long could I keep my sanity? He moved away suddenly, too swiftly for even a second's friction. It was as though he read my thoughts and knew what I had come to realize. Would he let me come? Ever? I had tried to make him understand I had no control. He was showing me what control looked like. I was suddenly terrified. He must have recognized that, too, and he graced me with a warning.\n\n\"Be still,\" he commanded, moving off somewhere behind me. When he returned, he adjusted my position so that I was now on hands and knees. It became easier to breathe, but my tangled, sweaty hair was hanging on both sides of my face, limiting my field of vision. In fact, he tipped my head down in line with my back so that I could see little more than the space between my hands. It was almost worse than being blindfolded, because the temptation was so powerful to turn my head, to shake my hair out of the way.\n\nSomething I couldn't recognize was moving up my back, sweeping stray strands of hair this way or that way over my shoulders. Clearing the way? For what? Then he squatted in front of me. I didn't dare raise my head, but I didn't need to. I could just see his cock, at full attention, staring back at me. I was staring at it, trying desperately to conceive of how to lure it into my pussy, when something touched my cheek. He was holding something that looked suspiciously like a crop. As he trailed it across my lips and to my other cheek, I was sure. He flicked it and I felt a brief sting. \"At least it's not the paddle,\" I assured myself. Then the fold of leather bit my other cheek. It slid across my forehead and chin, then briefly touched my eyes, forcing me to close them. Almost gently, it nipped at the very tip of my nose. Then it was gone, and he had moved out of my sight.\n\nI caught myself holding my breath. As I forced the breath out, the first stinging blow landed on my back. As on my cheeks, I quickly realized that the sting was short-lived, the area afflicted much smaller than what the paddle had delivered. And he was delivering the blows more slowly and deliberately, picking targets at random. At some strikes I had gasped more in surprise than in pain, like the one that landed on the soul of my foot. When he landed one on my sore ass cheek, though, it had taken a sharp bite to my tongue to keep from swearing. He was walking around me, apparently choosing spots that pleased him for some reason. I found myself drifting, processing the pain as if it were something entirely apart from me, yet still needing to be catalogued; where, how hard, how long had the sting lasted. Sometimes he simply trailed the tip of the crop along my body. He especially enjoyed tormenting my ticklish ribs in this way. He had also discovered how sensitive my tailbone was, and he would alternately slap the leather to it, then swirl the tip through the sting.\n\nThen the slap landed on my clit. I gasped and rocked forward, trying desperately to get back into position as fast as possible. I wasn't drifting any more. Perhaps that had been his intent. The tip of the leather teased my tailbone again, and I felt my pussy respond with a fresh gush of moisture. The leather slid upwards from my clit back again to my tailbone, dragging my juices with it. I wasn't even trying to control my gasping anymore. Whap! On my clit again, and I could feel the moisture spray down my legs. My pussy was begging for more. Could I really come from a stinging assault on my clit? My world was twisting sideways into freefall. I didn't know which way was up or down. It was several minutes before I realized the crop was no longer descending on me with its burning love/hate. I wanted desperately to look around, but my head was hanging and I didn't think I could even lift it back as he had positioned it, let alone high enough to see what he was doing now.\n\nThen I felt something warm splash on my back and heard his soft groan. More splashes. Where ever the splash struck a cropping, the sting returned briefly. I wept. He had come again, saving nothing for me. I thought my pussy should have calmed into dejection, but it only screamed louder with desperation. My head hung even further and I was staring back at the emptiness between my legs.\n\nAfter a moment, I heard him move away, back to the kitchen part of the room. He was helping himself to another beer. Then he returned. I heard him set the beer on the coffee table, and he came to stand in front of me. I could just see his toes. I didn't raise my head to even try to see more.\n\n\"You may speak,\" he graciously offered. \n\nI couldn't think of anything to say.\n\n\"Are you bound?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"Say it!\" he snapped.\n\n\"No.\" Then I added, \"Sir.\"\n\n\"Have you been raped?\"\n\n\"No, Sir,\" and some part of me already saw where he was going with this.\n\n\"Have you been hurt in any grievous sort of way?\"\n\n\"No, Sir,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Then why are you kneeling here?\"\n\nI was shaking uncontrollably now. \"Because I need you, Sir,\" I whispered.\n\n\"What?\" he demanded. \"I can't hear you.\"\n\n\"Because I need you, Sir.\"\n\nHe squatted down and raised my chin. \"You need what, exactly, from me?\"\n\nI opened my mouth to say \"I need you to fuck me,\" but I realized that wasn't the answer he was waiting for. I took a deep breath. \"I need your approval. I need your punishment. I need your control. I need you to make me feel alive.\"\n\nHe released my chin and I thought my answer had disappointed him. Maybe I was supposed to beg him to fuck me. But then all of a sudden I was being rolled up into his arms, snugged against his chest and he was carrying me into the bedroom. I would have reached up and clung to his neck, but I didn't have the strength. He set me on my feet in the bathroom. \"Use the toilet. Don't close the door.\"\n\nNow to my mind, the only thing requiring more privacy than peeing was - you know - that other thing you do on the toilet. But I was too weak to argue, he was already moving back into the bedroom, and I had some beer to get rid of. What else could I do? When I wandered back into the bedroom, he had the bed turned down and he literally scooped me into it. Then he set about tying me with the ropes he'd reattached to the bed's legs.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said, hoping I still had permission to speak.\n\nHe looked at me with a faint smile on his lips. \"It should be obvious.\" Since I only frowned in confusion, he continued. \"I haven't given you permission to come. Since you have such a hard time obeying, I'm just making sure you don't try to help yourself to an orgasm during the night. If I feel like it in the morning, maybe I will allow you to come. Or maybe not,\" he added darkly as he tested his knots. Satisfied, he turned and strode out of the room, turning the light off and closing the door. I listened intently. Was he leaving me here like this? What if he never came back? When I didn't hear the apartment door open and close I was able to push my panic down. Once or twice, I thought I heard his beer bottle clink.\n\nI tested the ropes. He had given me some room for movement, but made sure I couldn't reach his clever knots with my teeth to try to work them free. Nor could I turn on my side. I don't sleep on my back, ever. But that night, eventually, I drifted off, despite my throbbing pussy. I was so emotionally drained, I simply had no choice. My dreams were beset by frustration and I awoke often trying in vain to reach my torrid clit.\n\nBy morning, I was sure I was feverish. The sheets were twisted and knotted about me. I was staring at the ceiling when he finally opened the door. I wanted so bad to spit fire and brimstone at him, but my aching need had grown in intensity during the night, and he was the only answer to my dilemma. Besides, my bladder was close to bursting. He came to stand by the bed and gaze down at me. I'm sure he could see my seething anger; was probably amused by it. After a moment, he reached down and began freeing my limbs. When he had finished, I kicked and struggled free of the tangle of sheets and shoved past him into the bathroom. He caught the door as I tried to shut it, then stood there, leaning against the wall watching me. I discovered where the term shy bladder came from. But eventually full won out over shy. I tried my best to ignore him as I washed and splashed water on my face. When I looked up from the sink, I could see him clearly in the mirror. He had put his pants back on, but he was shirtless. That gorgeous chest taunted me.\n\n\"So what's on the torture menu for today,\" I asked. He walked up behind me, meeting my eyes in the mirror.\n\n\"Are you sure that's the attitude you want to take?\" he asked softly, one of his hands was drifting down my belly, closer and closer to where I so desperately needed relief. I sucked in a breath and threw my head back against his shoulder as his fingers slipped between my legs and his palm pressed against my mound.\n\n\"Please, Sir,\" I whispered, but then he just laughed and pushed me into the shower, turning on the ice cold spray of water. I howled, but then he was right behind me, commanding me to hush. As the water slowly warmed up he positioned me under the spray, my hands on the wall of the shower, my feet spread. When he was satisfied, he pulled his soggy pants off and tossed them out on the bathroom floor. A moment later, he was sponging soapy water from my head to my toes, meticulously cleaning me even as he stoked the fire in my belly. When he was satisfied that he had covered every inch of me, he put the sponge aside and pulled down the shower head, aiming the spray directly at my nipples, then at my clit. I had done a fine job of staying still until then, but the intensity of the spray on my poor beleaguered clit was more than I could stand. My knees buckled and he caught me around the waist, then aimed one final spray between my legs before shutting the water off. He helped me from the shower and draped a towel over my shoulders then found one for himself.\n\nI was shivering, but not from the cold. Had I screwed up again? He seemed almost playful this morning, but there were so many rules and I didn't even know at this point if I was allowed to dry myself off. He finally settled that question by vigorously rubbing me dry then taking me by the shoulders and pushing me back into the bedroom. He took me to the edge of the bed, then leaned down and spoke in my ear.\n\n\"Do you remember that position from last night? On your knees, ass in the air, head down?\" I nodded. He swatted my still sore ass. \"Do it.\" I obeyed, but inside I was cringing. What if he meant to start the torture all over again? I started to crawl to the center of the bed, but he stopped me and had me assume the position right at the edge. Then there was a long period of adjusting this knee or that arm. He even walked around the bed at one point, and I realized he was trying to prolong my agony. \n\nFinally, he came to stand behind me and after a long painful silence, he said, \"What is the rule, cherie?\"\n\nI wanted to scream. Which rule? There were so many! He began tapping his cock on my ultra-sensitive tailbone. Like ripples in a pond, each tap sent waves through my pussy deep into my core. Then I knew. And I also knew that I was doomed to failure yet again. \"Don't...\" I gasped. The head of his cock was suddenly buried in my dripping hole. It was only the sudden stretching that kept me from melting into an orgasmic puddle.\n\n\"Don't what, darling? Speak up, I can't hear you.\"\n\nI tried to suck in enough air to get the sentence out. \"Don't come without... Ahhhh!\" Every inch of him was buried inside me and his balls had smacked against my clit. If he hadn't grabbed my hips as he plunged in, I think I would have shot off the far side of the bed. He wasn't even going to let me get the whole rule out before he'd make me break it.\n\n\"You're really going to have to work on your diction, cherie. Now try it again.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. \"Don't come without permission,\" I said in a rush. That time, he didn't move. I was panting.\n\n\"And are you going to? Come without permission?\"\n\nI tried to shake my head, but it was impossible in that position. \"I can't...\" I started. He pulled back slightly than slammed into the end of me again. It felt like he'd knocked my breath out.\n\n\"A simple yes or no will do, since you seem to have a hard time forming sentences.\"\n\nWhat else could I say? If I told the truth and said yes, he would stop right there and leave me even more bereft than last night. So I lied. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI know for sure I heard him smile that time. He reached forward and wrapped my hair about his hand, pulling until my back was painfully arched. And then he slammed into me. Once, twice, Five times in all. Then all at once he let go of my hair and reached around my waist, lifting. \"Come for me baby. Come all over me,\" he commanded. And this time, when he slammed into me, his cock hit home on my sweet spot, then slid all the way to the end of me, with every inch of his shaft dragging over that nexus of magical nerves. I screamed and convulsed in the throes of the most intense orgasm I had ever experienced. All of the denied pleasure of the last hours was enmeshed in the most violent electrical storm that could possibly be contained in the belly of a mere mortal.\n\nAt some point, I passed out. When I finally came to, he was gone. It wasn't until many hours later that I had scraped together the strength to go downstairs and get my mail. As I was sorting through the junk, I happened to glance up at the rows of boxes. There, two boxes above mine, was a box clearly labeled Dr. Thomas Harker."
