        "Chapter 26* \n\nAlex awoke in the morning, face down in the bed, completely naked with the sheet barely covering her, which was exactly the way she was when she fell asleep. During his pampering, the aftercare the other kittens called it, she fell asleep on him, due to her exhaustion. They had fucked for hours, in just about every position she could imagine. Her on top, him on top, from the side, from behind. It seemed as if they were making up for all the lost time from her illness, and her temper tantrum. \n\nShe had tried to keep track of the number of orgasms, but she lost count because of the way he took her. Sending her into a mind scrambling orgasms that left her barely able to move afterward, leaving her laying there unable to do anything but enjoy herself while he continued on without her participation, for a short time as she recovered. \n\nShe lifted her head and turned it to look at his side of the bed. That is when she noticed the covers in complete disarray. The sheets bound up and tossed about, the mattress showing, as the fitted sheet was pulled off during their rowdy, leg shaking, sex. There were absolutely no pillows on the bed, they were tossed somewhere in the room she was sure, but where exactly she had no idea. \n\nShe tried to push herself up, but failed. Her arms exhausted as were her legs. Her stomach felt like she had been through some sort of intense sit up regimen, like one suited for Navy SEALS or perhaps professional boxers. Her whole body ached, but in such a deliciously pleasing way she didn't care if it ever went away. \n\nShe lay there, her smile coating her face. Yeah, this is what being royally fucked felt like, she smiled to herself. She could still feel him all over her, his hands, around her throat, pulling her hair or pinching her nipples. \n\nHis face, his beard stubble rubbing raw the back of her neck and her back, as he devoured any and all available skin. She could feel his face on her sex, from where he buried his tongue until she coated his face multiple times with her cum. \n\nShe could feel his magnificent cock in her pussy that was pounded gloriously until she could no longer do or say anything but moan in approval. She would definitely feel him all day there. \n\nShe could also feel him in her throat, which swallowed him as best she could, as he gruffly fucked her mouth making her gasp when he would pull out at the last second before she passed out. \n\nEvery inch of her body had some sort of memory of him. Glorious memory after glorious memory! God she needed to fight with him on occasion just so they could make up! She giggled, no, no more fighting if she could help it. She would try to be the submissive she had declared herself to be. \n\nShe would try to be the submissive the kittens had described. She knew it would be a long journey, but one she was determined to make. It all started with the first step, the step she finally made last night. Not the verbal commitment to Gavin. That was step two, step one was accepting that this is what she wanted. Perhaps even what she needed. \n\nMotion from the corner of her eye caused her to lift her head. She smiled as Gavin looked at her from the doorway. Leaning there, his secret smile of admiration coating his face, his eyes twinkling in satisfaction. \n\n\"Wow,\" he smiled. \"You look spectacular there like that!\" \n\n\"Like what, Sir? Fucked beyond words?\" She looked over at him and smiled broadly but he didn't return her smile. \n\n\"What?\" she asked him, when he didn't return the smile. \n\n\"What?\" he asked back. A smile ticking at the corners of his mouth, as he realized he had been caught by her. \n\n\"You made this face,\" she told him. \n\n\"I did?\" he grinned coming to her and laying down next to her in his expensive suit, not caring if he wrinkled it. \n\n\"Please Sir,\" she said turning on her side with a great deal of effort. \"Communication.\" \n\nHe nodded with an appreciative grin. \n\n\"Why do you describe our sessions as 'fucking'?\" he asked her, pushing her tangled hair from her face. \"Now granted last night I guess that was the best way to describe it, but it seems you always use that term.\" \n\n\"What else would I call it?\" She asked him. \"What do you call it?\" \n\n\"Well,\" Gavin shrugged. \"I would call it lovemaking, or sex, or a physical/emotional connection,\" he said softly as he looked at her deeply. \n\n\"Do you think I am fucking you?\" he asked her. Alex shrugged as she stroked the side of his face. Touching his skin made her insides dance with pleasure. \n\n\"Fucking sounds so impersonal, so emotionless. Yes, there are times that we fuck, as that is what we need from time to time. But, other than last night,\" he winked at her with his mischievous smile. \"I haven't fucked you for some time.\" She stared into his eyes for a few moments. \n\n\"I'm not fucking you, I'm exploring an emotional, sexual experience with you. It's something I have learned since you have come into my life. I was just fucking before, but now, I'm in the lifestyle with you. You can't have the true trust without the emotional attachment.\" \n\n\"If we are just fucking, then I do need to end this, because I haven't looked at it like I was fucking you for some time. I fucked Elizabeth, I fucked Regina, and others before them, but I'm not fucking you. I'm having an emotional connection with you that I didn't have with either of them. Mostly because I was afraid, partly because of an oath I made to myself. I've given up that fear and let you in. I willing to break that oath, for you. Not because I want a sub, but because I want to share my life with someone who gives me purpose. \" \n\n\"I want you to be that person. To do so, I'm willing to let you be who you are, but you have to give me something in return. And that's to let me be who I am. And what I am, is a man who is willing to risk everything for the woman he loves.\" \n\n\"Does that make sense?\" he asked her. \n\n\"I was afraid to call it anything else, for fear of you throwing up a wall,\" she admitted, the tears of tenderness forming at the edges of her eyes. \n\n\"Well, that time has passed,\" he smiled. \"So for clarification,\" he grinned as he wiggled his eyebrows at her. \"I fucked the shit out of you last night!\" She laughed as he pulled her into his arms. \n\n\"Thank you Sir,\" she smiled into his chest. \n\n\"For what?\" \n\n\"For being the greatest thing that has ever happened to me!\" she said stretching out and kissing his lips. \"For breaking that oath! I know how difficult that must have been for you, I know sometimes people say things like that, for their own purposes, but I know, you mean it!\" \n\nAlex showered slowly, letting the water massage her tight muscles. Hell yeah, he had fucked the shit out of her! Her body telling her so with every stiff joint and tight muscle. She found a couple of small bruises where his hand had gripped her firmly, on her hip bone, and on her thigh. She giggled as she shut the water off. Badges of being a good girl she decided. She dressed and found him cinching up his tie. \n\n\"Got a call,\" he frowned. \n\n\"Ok,\" she nodded. \"Is it alright if I go over to Lena's? Some last minute Christmas shopping?\" \n\nHe frowned. \n\n\"Look,\" he sighed. \"I don't want you to change who you are. You never asked permission before.\" \n\n\"I know,\" she nodded. \"But I want to now.\" \n\nHe walked closer to her. \n\n\"I don't want you broken,\" he said firmly. \"I love you the way you are.\" \n\n\"You like it when I back talk you?\" she asked with a smile. \n\n\"Well,\" he tilted her head up, smiling as he looked down at her in thought. \"You stand your ground when it is important to you, do you understand me?\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she whispered seeing the intenseness in his eyes. \n\n\"Are you leaving now?\" he asked her as she bit her lip, trying to keep the lustful thoughts running through her head from keeping him from his call. \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she smiled. \n\n\"I'll walk you out, I want to show you something that I'm sure will start a fight, but I don't give a shit,\" he said firmly, getting her coat and holding it so she could slip her arms in. \n\n\"I'm not fighting with you anymore Sir,\" she said firmly as she slid her arms into her jacket. \n\n\"We'll see about that,\" he smiled as he nibbled on her ear, wrapping his arms around her body trapping her hands against her as he held her from behind. \n\nThey walked down to the elevator hand in hand. She kept stealing glances at him wondering what he had up his sleeve. \n\n\"Hey Mike,\" Gavin said with a head nod as they exited the elevator on the ground floor. \n\n\"Car Dr. Steward?\" He asked as he picked up the phone. \n\n\"Yes, please,\" Gavin smiled. \n\nStanding outside, the sun shone on her face and forced her eyes closed. The bright light warmed her face despite the sharp chill in the air. The car pulling up in front of them caused her to lower her face from the sun and open her eyes. \n\nThe car that sat there wasn't his black Aston Martin. This was a pearl white Mercedes convertible. The car hop nodded at her with a smile and disappeared. It appeared both Mike and the car hop were privy to the knowledge of the new car. A short time later Gavin's familiar Aston pulled up behind the Mercedes. \n\nAlex stared at it for a moment. She was battling the emotion. Part was stunned at the beautiful car. Part was angry that he bought her a car after telling her she could buy her own, and part was hoping, by some miracle, the car belonged to someone else so they could avoid this fight! \n\n\"Wow,\" he nodded appreciatively with a smile, he was looking at the car with her, watching her from the corner of his eye. \"I expected the riot act.\" \n\n\"No, Sir,\" she said dropping her head. That meant it was definitely her car, and nobody else would be coming out to claim it. \"I told you, I don't want to fight with you.\" \n\n\"Hmm,\" he smiled. \"I appreciate that. I really do.\" \n\n\"You had to pick a Mercedes?\" she asked, the disbelief filling her voice, tinged with the anger she was battling. \n\n\"That's better,\" he smiled. \"More of the Alex I love.\" \n\n\"I'm not arguing, Sir,\" she prefaced her next statement. \"But I thought we agreed I could buy my next car, as Elizabeth had done.\" \n\n\"Right,\" he nodded. \"We agreed on that, but that was before your car broke down and forced you to walk home in sub-zero temps giving you pneumonia. Forcing me to lose my God damned mind and forcing me to examine what I was doing as your Dom.\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she frowned. She couldn't even think of how much this luxurious car cost him. It was more than she deserved, more than she would want. Every fiber of her being told her to throw one of her temper tantrums. She closed her eyes and fought that urge. \n\n\"Now,\" he smiled. \"Take a deep breath.\" She followed his command. \n\n\"This is not your car,\" he told her taking her hand. She looked up at him. \"This is a lease car, you have it for the next two years, which should be ample time to save up enough money to buy whatever car you want.\" He turned her taking her hands in his and holding them behind her back, as he pressed his body into hers and looked down at her with his smile. \n\n\"I am a man of my words,\" he reminded her as she smiled up at him. \"I agreed you could buy your next car as you feel that is important to you, so that makes it important to me. But...,\" he closed his eyes. \"I have to be who I am, just as you have to be who you are. And who I am, is a man who provides for the woman he loves.\" \n\n\"I love you,\" he said firmly opening his eyes to lose himself in her soft blue eyes. \"But you have to let me show you, because it's who I am and what I do. Just like your stubborn streak is who you are, your pride is who you are. Your hard working nature and your love filled heart, are who you are. I won't let you stop being that person, but you can't let me stop being the man I am. A man who loves you and wants to show you more than in words. I'm not a poet. I don't do words. I am a doctor, and I do action.\" \n\n\"Are you saying you don't want a Dom/sub relationship?\" she asked him listening to what he was saying. \n\n\"No, I'm saying I want an Angelo/Maria relationship,\" he smiled. \"I want the Dom/sub to meld into something more. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday. I want to be Angelo and Maria.\" \n\nHe left her standing there, her feet frozen in the snow but not because of the inclement weather but because she was frozen by his words. \n\n\"Not a poet my ass!\" she gasped as she watched him walk to the driver's side of her new car. \"That was the most poetic, powerful thing you could ever say to me!\" \n\nShe ran around the car and jumped into his arms and kissed him deeply not caring who saw, or who might disapprove. She wouldn't have cared if her mother was there with her entire bible study group. This man loved her and she was determined to show him how much she loved him in return! \n\nLetting her down easy he stroked her face. \n\n\"See you tonight,\" he smiled as he opened her door. \"Oh, and by the way, no you cannot change the gift you bought me, now that you don't need to save for a car right away! I forbid it!\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she smiled devilishly. Dismissing the new idea of emptying her savings account to spoil him like he was doing to her. She eased into the soft leather of the Mercedes. \"I will not buy you anything else, but the one gift I have already bought you.\" \n\n\"Perhaps I should use this new found desire of yours, to not fight with me, and tell you to take the gift you have back?\" he asked her, lifting his eyebrows in a small hope she would agree. He knew better, but thought, what was the harm in trying? \n\n\"I wouldn't advise it,\" she smiled. \"You just told me you wanted me to be me.\" \n\n\"I do want you to be you,\" he nodded. \"That is the woman I fell in love with. Be careful, the roads are slick. Any problems, take it to Curt, he is to do all the maintenance during the lease time\" \n\n\"Thank you for this spectacular car, Sir,\" she said pulling on his tie to bring him down so she could kiss his lips. \"We will have to take it out and break it in properly!\" She slowly let his tie go and he winked at her. \n\n*** \n\nPulling up in front of her old apartment she looked at all the other cars parked in the street. Her shiny white Mercedes stood out like a sore thumb amongst all the inexpensive, and reasonable cars. Some were like her old Rabbit, more than twenty years old. This was a neighborhood of blue collar workers and students. To have the luxury car there made her uncomfortable. She just didn't believe she was a Mercedes girl! Evidently her Dom thought otherwise. \n\nPushing open the door to her old apartment she could smell the distinct odor of burnt breakfast. She shook her head, the girl just was never going to learn! \n\n\"Hey!\" Alex called out. Instead of calling out, Lena came to her in a rush. \n\n\"How did everything go?\" Lena asked searching for an indication of the news on Alex's face. \n\n\"I have, without a doubt, the greatest man on the planet!\" Alex smiled. This caused Lena to engulf Alex in her arms and squeeze her happily. \n\n\"I'm so happy for you!\" Lena said from within the embrace. \"Are you still in the Dom/sub thing?\" \n\n\"Very much so,\" she smiled. \"It's really rather liberating, this lifestyle.\" \n\n\"I'm so happy!\" Lena said again bouncing on her toes to prove it. \n\n\"Me too!\" Alex said taking her back into her arms. \n\n\"Did you give Mike this number?\" Lena asked pulling back as the thought popped into her mind. \n\n\"I did,\" Alex grinned. \"Did he call?\" \n\n\"Yes!\" Lena gasped. \"We are going out tomorrow night!\" \n\n\"Awesome!\" Alex exclaimed. \n\n\"I know!\" Lena agreed. \n\n\"I hope he can cook,\" Alex smiled pretending to sniff the air around them, a dig at the acrid smell of smoke still lingering in the air. \n\n\"Knock it off! You deserted me for Dr. Stud!\" Lena reminded with a soft push. \"With your track record I wasn't expecting to have to learn to cook for another ten years before you even found a man!\" She teased ruthlessly, pulling up Alex's dating track record. \"I was thinking you were going to become one of those cat ladies with like twenty random cats!\" \n\n\"Oww!\" Alex laughed. \"Well, now I know how you really feel!\" \n\n\"So did you fuck and make up?\" Lena asked with a wiggle of her eyebrows. \n\n\"For hours!\" Alex laughed with a blush. \n\n\"You bitch,\" Lena growled. \"And you won't share?\" \n\nAlex shook her head. \n\n\"He said the big three last night,\" Alex smiled proudly referring to Gavin's declaration. \"I about melted into a puddle!\" \n\n\"Oh my God!\" Lena gasped. \"You got through!\" \n\n\"It was the most fantastic thing I have ever heard, like angels themselves whispering!\" Alex admitted. \"C'mon, I have something to show you, we'll do some shopping to find you a dress that will knock Mike on his ass, and get a bite of food that hasn't been burnt!\" \n\nLena stood on the stoop to the apartment building staring at the car in utter disbelief. \n\n\"I know, right?\" Alex said with a smile and a shake of her head. \n\n\"Oh my God girl! How well do you fuck?\" Lena gasped. \n\n\"Evidently like a Mercedes!\" Alex laughed with a sheepish grin and a slight blush at her own bravado. \n\n\"You bitch!\" Lena laughed. \n\n*** \n\nPulling up under the awning of the restaurant, the girls hopped out of the car. Tipping the valet and waiting for the ticket she found Elizabeth coming out of the restaurant. \n\n\"Alexandria!\" Elizabeth called out when she saw her. It was sort of happy and sort of alarmed. She tilted her face away but it was too late. Alex had seen the bruise. Alex took hold of Elizabeth's chin and turned it back so she could see it. \n\n\"Just a little rough play,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"You know how it is, its ok!\" \n\n\"Yeah,\" Alex said firmly not letting go of Elizabeth's chin. \"I know exactly how it is, but you're wrong, it is most definitely not ok!\" She said angrily releasing her chin. \n\n\"Not your concern,\" Elizabeth warned her. Alex nodded but didn't agree. \"Is that your car?\" Elizabeth asked her. Alex turned and looked at it before turning her eyes back. \n\n\"Yes,\" Alex nodded, she was judging Elizabeth's eyes. There was a jealous tint in them. \"Gavin got it for me.\" \n\n\"Wow,\" Elizabeth said softly. \"Lucky you.\" \n\nEvery syllable she said made Alex uncomfortable. \n\n\"It's not technically mine,\" Alex told her. \"It's a lease, I told him I wanted to buy my own car, so this was a compromise, of sorts.\" \n\n\"Gavin? Compromise?\" Elizabeth asked staring at the car in a growing unhealthy jealousy. \n\n\"Of sorts,\" Alex reminded. \"Elizabeth this is my best friend, Lena Osweiler.\" Alex said introducing them. \"Lena, this is Elizabeth, the beautiful lady who brought me into the life.\" \n\nThe ladies shook hands and Elizabeth nodded in appreciation the acknowledgement Alex made. \n\n\"Senator Danita Housley's new personal assistant?\" Elizabeth asked, her eyes moving from jealousy to a rage. \n\n\"Yes,\" Lena confirmed slowly seeing the change. \"Dr. Steward put in a good word for me.\" \n\n\"Really?\" Elizabeth asked coolly. Alex watched her carefully, Elizabeth's temper was spiking like yesterday in the apartment. \n\n\"What's wrong,\" Alex asked her taking Elizabeth's angry and vengeful eyes from her best friend. \n\n\"Nothing,\" Elizabeth said with a deep exhale. \"Royce was supposed to be recommending me for that job as well.\" \n\n\"Oh,\" Alex said, her mind scrambling at what Elizabeth was feeling right now. It appeared the Mercedes triggered a jealous spike and now Gavin had used his connections to get her best friend a job Elizabeth was trying for, which wasn't going to help her demeanor. \n\n\"Well,\" Elizabeth smiled, regrouping as the two women in front of her were watching her carefully. \"If I don't see you before then, Merry Christmas!\" Elizabeth said as her car was brought around. She tried to sound pleasant but the pain and disappointment came out with her salutation. \n\n\"Yes,\" Alex said as Elizabeth hugged her, it wasn't a warm embrace, more of a quick hug before she left them. ",
        "\"Awkward,\" Lena gasped after Elizabeth pulled away. \n\n\"Definitely,\" Alex frowned watching the car fade away into traffic. \n\n\"The bruise on her face?\" Lena asked. \"Part of your lifestyle?\" She asked hard. \n\n\"It can be,\" Alex admitted with a soft shrug. \"Not usually though, but I would imagine accidents happen just like in any relationship.\" \n\n\"That didn't look like an accident,\" Lena said protectively. \n\n\"It didn't, did it?\" Alex agreed. \n\n\"Tell me that won't happen to you!\" Lena growled. \n\n\"Highly unlikely,\" Alex smiled as they went into the building and was sat at a nearby table. \n\n\"But it can happen?\" Lena asked after the hostess left them. \n\n\"Anything is possible,\" Alex said softly. She leaned into Lena. \"You have met Gavin, the man is a control freak, there is no way he allows that to happen to me unless it is completely accidental and then he would be mortified and never forgive himself.\" \n\n\"Ok,\" Lena frowned, she was not comforted nor was she placated by Alex's assurances. \n\n\"Look,\" Alex began slowly. \"There is a dark side to our world, but it's rare.\" \n\n\"You knew this before agreeing?\" Lena growled unhappy that her friend could be harmed. \n\n\"The first party Gavin took me to, I saw the darkest of dark,\" Alex admitted. \"But Gavin is much too controlled for any of that nonsense, but I would imagine even with all the precautions, with all the attention, it could still happen.\" \n\n\"That's bullshit!\" Lena told her. \n\n\"It's no different than a regular relationship!\" Alex defended. \"Accidents happen there too!\" \n\n\"I know,\" Lena agreed. She knew Alex was right, but the idea that the possibility it could happen to Alex wasn't sitting right with her. This was her best friend! \"How pissed is that chick that your man got me that job?\" \n\n\"He didn't get you that job,\" Alex said with a shake of her head. \"You got yourself that job, he just made the introductions.\" \n\n\"That's total bullshit,\" Lena laughed. \"I know for a fact there are more qualified, better suited people Senator Housley could have chosen. She gave me that job as a favor to your Dr. Stud! Oh, and I'm totally ok with that!\" \n\nAlex said nothing as she looked at the menu. The thoughts were running through her head at the bruise on the side of Elizabeth's face, her reaction to the car, and then losing out on a job to Lena. \n\nThe job could be explained, she was desperate to find a new job and money was tight. So the disappointment was understandable. \n\n\"So how do you know her?\" Lena asked. \n\n\"She was Gavin's sub before me, she brought me on to replace herself so she could move on to a Senator's son, one she believes is bound for the White House,\" Alex told her. \n\n\"She brought you in?\" Lean gasped. \n\n\"Yes,\" Alex nodded with a smile. \"We met at my coffee shop, I had drawn her because she was absolutely stunning. She gave me her number after buying the drawing, explained the lifestyle and introduced me to Gavin.\" \n\n\"I didn't know she was looking for an out until after Gavin told me,\" Alex explained. \n\n\"Gavin knew?\" Lena gasped. \"And he did nothing?\" \n\n\"He knew,\" Alex nodded. \"Gavin is complicated.\" \n\n\"No, what he is, is a super-hot Doctor that can fuck a girl into submission!\" Lena laughed quietly. \n\n\"That he has,\" Alex smiled. \n\nA text brought Alex off the subject, she hoped it was Gavin but her smile faded when it was Kelly's number. \n\nHow is your search going? The text read. \n\nIt's over, I had never really submitted totally, she texted back. \n\nWhat? You hadn't made your declaration? Kelly texted. \n\nNo, I did that, but like you guys said, I hadn't truly accepted my role, Alex clarified. \n\nI'm happy for you, came Kelly's response with a smiley face. \n\nI'm very happy, Alex said with a tongue hanging out emoticon \n\nWelcome officially to our world! \n\n*** \n\nAlex walked into the condo, dropping her bag on the couch she called out to Gavin. She followed his voice to his office. \n\n\"Hey,\" he said as she looked in on him from the office door. \n\n\"Hey,\" she smiled back. \n\n\"Get your shopping done?\" he asked her leaning back in his chair. \n\n\"I did,\" she said. \n\n\"Why won't you come into my office?\" he asked her, laughing that she was still hanging on the door jamb, leaning in but her feet were firmly on the outside. \n\n\"This is your private space,\" she shrugged. \"I don't want to crowd you too much.\" \n\n\"Maybe I want to be crowded,\" he said placing the tips of his fingers to one another in front of his mouth. \n\n\"I just think that if you have your own private space that I won't intrude on, you will have a place that is just yours,\" Alex told him. \"Lena and I each had our own personal space, someplace we could go that the other wouldn't bother them in.\" \n\nGavin nodded appreciatively. \n\n\"Where is your space?\" Gavin asked her. \"Here? Not your old apartment.\" \n\n\"See, that is just it, I do have the old apartment,\" Alex told him. \"I don't need a space here as if I need time away, I can go there. So, for me anyway, this is your 'man cave'.\" \n\n\"Wow,\" Gavin smiled. \"I haven't had a single sub that had that thought process.\" \n\n\"Does it bother you?\" Alex asked him. \n\n\"I don't know how to feel about it at the moment,\" Gavin admitted. \"Let's play it by ear for now.\" \n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" Alex said matching his smile. \n\nShe loved separating herself from the other subs he had owned. Even after all they had discovered with one another she was still trying to distance herself in his mind. \n\n\"I have a question for you,\" Alex began slowly. \n\n\"I know,\" Gavin grinned. \"I can see it in your eyes.\" \n\n\"I'm leery of asking though,\" Alex admitted to him. \n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"Because I don't want to anger you,\" Alex said softly. \n\n\"Ask,\" \n\n\"Did you know Elizabeth was trying for the job with Senator Housley? And if you did, was this some sort of punishment for her leaving for Royce?\" Alex couldn't believe she was asking the question. \n\n\"First off,\" Gavin said firmly. \"I was unaware Elizabeth was no longer employed by her lobbyist company, so no, I didn't know she was looking for a new job. Two, I'm not vindictive in that fashion.\" He got up and made his way to her as it was evident she was not entering his 'man cave'. \n\n\"Like you said,\" Gavin said cupping her chin. \"Elizabeth made her choice, and it was hers to make.\" \n\n\"Thank you Sir,\" she said softly. \"I know it hurt you, but I'm happy she left!\" \n\n\"I am happy as well,\" Gavin whispered brushing his lips over hers. \"You are a great salve to put on a wounded heart.\" \n\n\"You can put me on anything you like!\" she gasped as he nibbled on her neck. \n\n\"Is that a fact?\" he asked. \"Come with me.\" She followed him with her secret smile out. \n\nTaking her into the kitchen had her cocking her head at him. He began to take things off a wire rack in the corner of the kitchen. Placing the items from it on the counter. Various pots and pans, some cooking utensils. Once it was cleaned off, he pulled it to the center of the kitchen and faced her. \n\n\"Get undressed,\" he told her firmly. \"I need to get a couple of things from the bedroom.\" He left her there as she quickly pulled at her clothes. \n\nWhen he returned she was naked and in the submissive position on the floor. \n\n\"Stand,\" he told her once he set some leather cuffs on the counter. The instant she saw them her stomach butterflied. \n\nShe stood taking his hand and he guided her to the wire rack. It was approximately six feet in height, with three wire shelves, the kind you see in stores. He popped off the top shelf and moved it to the side of the room. \n\nShe stood at the side of the rack and watched him put 'S' hooks into holes drilled into the top of the rack, something she had never noticed before. He then picked up two of the cuffs and hooked them into the hooks and left them dangling. She smiled once she figured out the purpose of the cuffs. \n\nHe stood on one side of the rack, her on the other. He grinned as he saw the look in her eyes. \n\n\"I always thought this rack looked odd in your kitchen of marble and granite!\" Alex laughed. Running her fingers over the cold steel. \n\n\"Well,\" he shrugged. \"I don't have a 'red room'.\" Gavin teased knocking the bestselling novel by E.L. James. \"So I have to be creative. As you can see, this rack is perfect for what I want, it also allows me to keep my private life private. Hiding in plain sight!\" He held out his hand to her and she placed hers in. \n\nHe lifted it to the cuff before securing her wrist in it, the soft lambskin fur gently cupping her wrist firmly, while he folded the leather into the pin and buckle. He did the same with the other wrist. Now she was stretched out, her arms cuffed into positon above her head as her body leaned over the middle rack. \n\nShe watched him, his eyes glittering in pleasure, his secret smile matching hers. Her heart beat incredibly fast as he began to run his fingers down her arms. They looped around her neck then slowly down to her breasts before cupping them and having his thumb gently encircle her nipples bringing them taut with excitement. \n\nHe went to the counter and brought back a silver chain and two clamps. She recognized them easily. Nipple clamps, she had seen them at the last party which seemed like years ago now! \n\n\"I'm going to put these on you,\" Gavin explained. \"At first, I want you to tell me if they are too tight, see I'm going to increase the pressure as we go through with our sessions so don't let me put them on at your breaking point. I'm looking for about a three on a scale of ten, the desire is to tweak them as we go until we reach that point over time.\" Alex nodded that she understood. \n\n\"How long will they stay on? If I may ask?\" She asked him. \n\n\"Yes, you can always ask in a session, you know that,\" Gavin told her. \"No more than fifteen minutes, any longer than that there is an increase chance of nerve damage, not good.\" \n\n\"The idea is to bring you pain, not a lot, but pain that brings the sensitivity like the wax did,\" Gavin told her opening the clamps and adjusting the tension in them. \"Under no circumstances are you to tough it out tonight! If at any time you are uncomfortable, or in too much pain, I need to know immediately, use your safe words if necessary.\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she smiled at his tenderness. \"Very much green!\" He nodded. \n\n\"Always so very eager,\" he whispered. \n\nHe lowered his head and put his mouth on her nipple, tonguing it gently. She gasped as the warmth of his mouth on her cooling flesh in the kitchen caused her senses to ripple through her leaving behind the goose bumps. \n\n\"Here we go,\" he said to her. He carefully tightened the clamps until she winced slightly. He then backed off a quarter turn. It hung on her nipple and she marveled at it while she looked down. He checked it to make sure it was fully in place and not off center. He then moved to the other nipple and repeated the procedure. \n\nWhen he was done, she smiled down at her nipple clamps as they hung there. Her flesh bluing around them. He gently touched the ends of her nipples causing her to suck in a quick breath after each touch. \n\n\"Holy shit!\" she gasped at the sensory increase. \"Green,\" She smiled as he looked on her. He nodded. He reached up and checked her hands, squeezing her fingertips to make sure she had plenty of circulation going. \n\n\"How are you doing?\" he asked her as he made his way around the rack to stand behind her. \n\n\"I'm very good,\" she smiled looking over her shoulder at him. \n\nHe ran his fingers up her arms and to her hands. \n\n\"As a point of safety,\" he smiled at her as she looked at him. \"If, for some reason I were to die of a heart attack, or something, because of your beauty, to get out of the cuffs all you have to do is push this release.\" He demonstrated the push button and her hand fell, cuff and all. He then replaced it where it was at the top of the rack. \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she smiled. \"But I just found you, don't go dying of a heart attack!\" \n\n\"Well,\" he smiled as he began to nibble on the flesh on her back. \"If I gotta go, I'll take it this way!\" \n\nHe went to the counter and picked up a crop. \n\n\"Have I been naughty, Sir?\" she smiled at him, her sex warming at the attention he was giving her. \n\n\"Not all spankings are punishment!\" he smiled devilishly. She nodded and closed her eyes. \n\nThe first strike had her on her toes with a gasp. He struck her again and she bit her bottom lip as the sharp sting radiated across her backside. He alternated sides, one side then the other. Striking precisely and with the same amount of force each time. Each strike had her up on her toes as her ass warmed, then began to sting. \n\nHe gently ran his fingers over her sensitive flesh, her body lifting on her toes as the pleasurable pain echoed across her skin. His touch barely there but still inflaming her skin. She looked back at him and could see him watching her carefully.  \n\n\"How red am I?\" she asked him. \n\n\"Little darker than pink,\" he smiled. \"Would you like to see?\" She nodded and he picked up her phone from the counter. He stood behind her and snapped a picture, bringing it around her he tilted it so she could see. \n\nHer ass was a rosy pink, borderline scarlet red. She smiled at it. For some reason she got a perverse pleasure in seeing her flesh like that. It was similar to the bruises he would leave on her from time to time. Either with his mouth, a hickie of sorts, or from where his strong hands held her as he pleasured her. \n\nHe set the phone on the counter and moved back behind her. Pulling a steel stand that had originally held a plant, but, like the rack, this stand transformed in front of her very eyes as he pulled out the wand massager that made her heart skip a beat. This was so fucking hot she could almost feel her pussy leaking down her legs. \n\nGrabbing two more cuffs he knelt and hooked them to her ankles, all the while his tongue licked her sex and her anus driving her insane with desire. She wanted to reach back and grab his head and pull him deeper into her but she was secured so she couldn't. \n\n\"This is fucking killing me that I can't touch you!\" she gasped. \"Sir!\" She had to remind herself of the qualities of a good sub, something she was damned sure she was going to accomplish for him. She hoped to be as good a sub as he was a Dom. \n\n\"I know,\" he whispered from within her folds. His deep voice vibrating off her sex. \n\nHe secured her ankles to the bottoms of the rack, one to a side, spreading her legs wide for his amusement and pleasure. She was now open to him, whatever he wanted he could take and she would be unable to stop him. He rose and rested his body over hers. \n\n\"Do you feel that?\" he whispered in her ear. \"That feeling of helplessness?\" She nodded slowly, her eyes fluttering closed as his hot breath washed over her ear. \n\n\"That feeling of excitement of not knowing what lover you have right now, the gentle one that makes love to you. Or do you have the lover desperate to pleasure you both, like last night.\" He began to run his lips down her body, following her spine, over her sensitive ass, the fire still there from her spanking. \n\n\"Not knowing if I plan on teasing you, or edging you,\" he continued as he licked the outer lips of her sex with his tongue. \n\n\"Or,\" he said softly. \"Do you get the wolf?\" \n\nShe let her head fall back as his hand rubbed her clit gently between his fingers. She gasped at the words, and the sensations she was feeling. \n\nHe positioned the stand behind her, and just under her, clipping the wand on the stand and pressing it to her sex made her hold her breath, which made him smile. \n\n\"And I haven't even turned it on yet!\" he pointed out that he caught her pleasured response. \n\nWith that he flipped the device on low causing its low hum to fill her ears as the toy vibrated across her sensitive clit, he made a few adjustments, making sure the stand was in proper place so the wand fit completely against her pussy, the vibrations making her gasp before a small whimper of pleasure escaped her lips. \n\nHe came back around to the front of her, she looked up at him with a hunger in her eyes that was easy to see. He winked at her. \n\n\"Comfortable?\" he asked her. She nodded emphatically. \n\nShe was beyond comfortable, she was in heaven! The vibrations against her sex causing her whole body to warm and gyrate against the toy. Her legs began to shake slightly as her orgasm began its slow climb to freedom from her gut. She felt it begin as a tingling in her sex before moving to her stomach, then causing her stomach muscles to flex as she tried to keep the feeling at bay for a while, enjoying that build up. \n\nHis hands began to gently massage her available skin with his fingertips. Moving around her face, down her chin around her throat gently. The entire time her build up was causing her legs to shake more and more, soon the rack shook with her body and she could see that pleased him. \n\n\"May I cum, Sir,\" she asked, her voice pleading with him not to edge her tonight. He said nothing as he watched his fingers continue their exploration of her flesh. \n\n\"Cum for me, Little one,\" he whispered after a few maddening seconds of silence, forcing her to wonder what his intent was, all the while he nibbled and nuzzled her ear and neck. \n\nSuddenly her breath caught in her chest as she locked eyes on his, her face reddening sharply as her orgasm clutched her body, her head dropped back as she cried out to the ceiling of her immensely pleasurable release. \n\nWhen it subsided, she lifted her head to see his pleasure written all over his face. \n\n\"Thank you, Sir,\" she gasped. \n\n\"Absolutely stunning,\" he smiled as he kissed her lips. She tried to kiss him back but he pulled back. \"No, I kiss you, not the other way around. You just open your mouth to me, let me decide how to use if for my pleasure!\" he said gruffly. \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she gasped, the sound of his forceful voice exciting her. The wolf stalking around the edges of him, she could see him just behind his eyes. Watching her, wanting to be released. How does she elicit the wolf from the edges to the forefront? \n\nGavin gently began to play with her nipples sending lightening bolts of painful pleasure that caused her feet to dance involuntarily. She widened her eyes at him in disbelief. The tapped the ends of the nipples with his finger causing her to wince. She smiled at him to let him now it was only fleeting. \n\nHe went to the freezer and pulled an ice cube from the tray. Her mouth slowly fell agape as she anticipated what that was going to feel like! He slowly lowered his mouth first and blew his hot breath across her nipples making her eyes flutter with pleasure. He sat up and watched her as he slowly brought the ice in, gently brushing her nipple with it causing her to convulse slightly. \n\n\"Oh my!\" she whispered as she watched his talented hands move the cube back and forth between nipples. \n\nGavin slowly began to undo the clamps causing her to hiss as he released them and the blood rushed back causing her nerves to scream in sensations that were cut off for a while. First one, as soon as it was released his mouth was on it, licking gently, then blowing across them with is breath that made her dance on her toes as it racked her body in sensations that left her reeling in incomprehensible feeling. \n\nHe then brought the ice back into play, now it was dripping cold water as it melted in his hands. She laughed inwardly, the ice wasn't the only thing that would melt in his hands! \n\nHe let the water drop, drip by drip, on her nipple. Each one hitting its mark caused her to jump at the sudden sensation of pain to cold to pain. One nipple, tortured, then back to the other. All the while his eyes would shift from watching her body respond to checking her eyes to make sure she was ok. ",
        "Once he had coated the nipples with drops of water, he began to trace the outside of her nipples with the cube, running around the areola like it was a race track on a caution lap, slowly. Once he had circled multiple times, he dropped his head and placed the cold nipple in his mouth causing the sensations to shift immediately that had her gasping. \n\nHe released one nipple only to capture the other nipple, giving it the same treatment. The wand constantly working on her, bringing another orgasm to light as he suckled on her nipples like newborn baby. Gently kneading it with his lips, then softly with his teeth causing her to 'yip'. That soft sound that made him chuckle. \n\nThe cum flushed from her, coating the head of the wand massager as it rested against her, it began to glisten in the light of the kitchen. Something she was still trying to come to grips with. He was playing in a session with her in the kitchen! It seems they were no longer bound to the bedroom. \n\nNow the car was available, like she did the night of the party, sucking him off as they sped down the interstate. The one session on the couch, and then that glorious night in the dining room, where she got the wolf, and said her safe word. That still brought a single wave of guilt for disrupting the wolf that night. Knowing it wasn't as fulfilling for him because she was afraid. \n\nAfter she came down from the high of her orgasm, Gavin moved the wand away from her and she whimpered slightly. \n\n\"Just for a few moments,\" he assured her recognizing her soft pout. \"I want to change your positioning.\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she said in between ragged breaths. \"Whatever you desire!\" \n\n\"Just you,\" he said as he buried his fingers into her wetted sex. The warmth of which caused him to growl subtly as his fingers plunged into her depths. His body covering hers from behind. \n\nShe could feel his hard cock through his pants on her ass. God she wanted him to release his cock so she could feel the heat from it with skin on skin contact. Perhaps she could wiggle her backside and get it to slip into her. That is where she really wanted it, his hard cock deep within her, pulsing with his desire. \n\nHe brought out short bits of chain, releasing her wrists from the top posts made her brow furrow, she hoped he wasn't releasing her! \n\n\"Not yet,\" he smiled when her eyes looked to him. \"I'm still playing.\" She nodded. \n\nAfter hooking the chains into the 'S' hooks he reattached the leather cuffs that were around her wrists. Now they were just under shoulder level. He moved back around her and undid the cuffs on her ankles. \n\nShe was dying to see what he was going to do next. She found, during these sessions, it was the time in between scenes that made her mad with wonder. What was he going to do next? What was he going to use? How long would he use it? When would he fuck her? Where would he spray his magnificent cum? \n\nAll had her on edge as she could never tell where he was going, it was something she was always surprised with. Their sessions always left her wondering. There were a lot of scenes that had some of the same things but they were never the same. Never predictable, and always cum shattering! \n\n\"I want you to lay on the shelf,\" he told her putting a soft towel down for her to keep the wire from digging into her skin too deeply. \n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" she smiled. \n\nShe adjusted on her toes to lift herself on the shelf, then laid to where her stomach laid across the towel. She was a little apprehensive at first, hoping the shelving didn't collapse beneath her weight! \n\nOnce she was comfortably in place he picked up one of her ankles. She looked back over her shoulder and saw a longer chain hanging from the second set of top posts. He hooked her leather cuffed ankle into the chain, suspending the leg from the top post. \n\nHe repeated the process for the other ankle and soon, she was in a backward 'C', laying on the shelf of the wire rack that used to hold pots and pans! If you would have told her this morning she would be in this precarious position she would have laughed. Not that she wouldn't have believed it because it was Gavin, it would be that she just wouldn't have thought of it! \n\nShe thought she was vulnerable before, but now with both her hands and legs up and behind her, she felt ten times more open. He came around the front and made a couple of adjustments to her arms, dropping them slightly now as he dialed in her length. Making sure she was stretched but comfortable. And most important of all, she decided, helpless to stop whatever he wanted. That had her most excited. She was at his mercy! \n\nHe went back around her from behind, standing between her legs he rubbed her ass with his hands. She rippled with pleasure. Oh God would she love to have him fuck her right now! In her pussy or her ass, she would love it! \n\nHe instead spread her ass cheeks slightly with his hands making her think he was finally going to pleasure himself with her ass, and even though she had been wearing her anal plug she was unsure if she was ready! \n\nHe lowered his face there instead and began to tickle her anus with the tip of his tongue, swirling around the outside of her puckered star, before pressing gently into her with his tongue. His strong hands pulling her cheeks apart to allow him to delve deeper into her taboo. \n\nHer head dropped at the sensations of his soft, hot tongue in her ass. His firm grip on her cheeks showing his actual desire. While his tongue probed gently, his hands held her ravenously and she could tell he was holding himself back. She looked under the rack and saw his chest heaving under his shirt, his passion filling his lungs. \n\nGod she wished he would just take her in the ass, she wanted to see his face fill with the pleasure she had seen that night he fucked Elizabeth in the ass. The complete total loss of control he had when he was in her. Pumping furiously, with Elizabeth egging him on to go harder, to go deeper...to go faster! \n\nHe instead pulled away from her and then let out a little growl of disappointment himself for stopping his true wishes. She smiled her secret smile when she heard him. They were thinking the same thoughts! \n\nHe repositioned the wand back on her causing her to shake with excitement as he pushed it tightly against her so it would not move away. The vibrations picking up right where they left off, pushing another orgasm rapidly. Having it build within her. \n\nThe sharp sting of the crop had her jumping as she had lost sight of where he was and was surprised at the strike. It cascaded her over the top, sending her free falling into her orgasm as he struck her again on the other cheek. Returning to his alternating strikes as she came with a gush as he re-reddened her backside. \n\nThe trickle of her cum hitting the tile floor had her looking under the wire rack to see the clear fluid dripping from the bottom of the wand. She snorted out a soft laugh as the odd thought of hoping the wand was waterproof as it was plugged into a nearby wall! She was going to get real messy, she decided, so she hoped it didn't electrocute her! She shook her head at the weird thought. The things that pop into her head she giggled. \n\nWhen she lifted her head Gavin was in front of her, his cock pulled out through the zipper of his pants. It stood up on him, magnificent to behold to her. She tried to stretch her neck to take him into her mouth. \n\n\"Absolutely not!\" he barked causing her to stop immediately. \"You are only here for my pleasure right now!\" She knew that to be lie, but she said nothing. If she wasn't supposed to be enjoying it, why on earth was she making a puddle on the tile?  \n\n\"I'm fucking you!\" he told her, using her terminology against her. She recognized it but was only able to mumble a few words. \n\n\"Yes Sir!\" she gasped as yet another orgasm began to build in her. \n\nHe took her by the head, his fingers wrapping in her hair. He shoved his cock in her mouth, anything but softly. His massive head hitting the back of her throat as she tried to swallow him but his sudden intrusion left her scrambling to focus on her technique. \n\nJust when she began to struggle with his size he pulled out of her mouth leaving her sucking in air as soon as his cock cleared her lips. He gave her a few seconds before putting his cock back in her mouth, his thrusting hips forcing it in and out. Her gurgling letting him know how deep he was. \n\nShe pulled on her restraints to use her hands to pull his cock out of her mouth as he air ran low in her lungs. A sudden panic fluttered through her as she came to the full depth of just how helpless she was. Suddenly he was out of her mouth and she was sucking air in rapidly. \n\nHe pressed his saliva coated cock against her face, rubbing it around on her cheeks, nose and forehead. Leaving her saliva there. She licked his rock hard cock as he brought it around her mouth. She sucked him in and bobbed her head on his cock on her own. He reached over her back while she did this and smacked her ass with his hand, causing the sound of it to fill her ears. \n\nThis sent her into a frenzy on his cock, making her devour it and swallow it whole, blocking her own airway with his cock as he smacked the other cheek. This forced her to spit out his cock in a sudden gasp as she orgasmed from the sensations of the constant vibrations on her clit, to the sensations of his hard cock in her mouth, to the sudden sharpness of his hand on her ass. The sensations of her sensitive nipples on the towel all had her body shaking with pleasure as he used her, and that was the best way to describe this session, he was using her body! \n\nHe walked around her and stood between her legs again, moving the wand to the side. With one push he buried his cock deep within her causing her to call out in pleasure. \n\n\"Fuck yes!\" she gasped. \"Take me!\" \n\nHe obliged her command, ramming his hips forward forcing her to rock on the rack she was on. He took hold of the rack to keep it braced as he plowed into her forcefully. His hips bouncing off her as he bottom out in her. \n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" she called out on the drives. Her body stiffening as her cum rushed out of her, around his cock to join the rest of her cum on the floor. He pulled out suddenly and walked around to the front of her, before she knew what he was doing, his cum coated cock was back in her mouth. Using her hair to force her mouth up and down his shaft before pulling out leaving her gasping before he walked around her and stood between her legs and rammed home there. \n\nShe was gasping at each deep thrust, now he had his hands on her hips rocking the rack as he rammed hard and fast into her. Mercilessly pounding her quivering sex, as he pushed deeper and deeper in her. \n\nBack around the front of her, back in her mouth after she coated his cock with her orgasm. This time when he pulled out he didn't go back around, he fisted his cock, shooting his hot jism over her face, and into her hair and mouth. Shot after shot blasted her, the hot sticky liquid hanging there, coating her face. \n\nHis hand slowed as his orgasm ebbed from him. She let her head drop in exhaustion as her body hung from their cuffs. He stood there in front of her, slightly bent at the waist, his hands on his hips as he gained control of his own breathing. \n\nOnce he had, he slowly undid the cuffs on her wrists releasing them gently. Then the same for her legs, they felt jelly like as he lowered them to the floor. Her feet tingling as the blood flow went back to them. The slight pins and needles feeling that was bitter sweet. \n\nOnce he had released her from her bondage he scooped her up and took her to the master bath, placing her gently in the tub, before turning the water on and letting the steam rise from its temperature. \n\nShe leaned back against the sharp coldness of the tub, her body too exhausted to care. He poured some bath salts in and soon the room filled with the soft scents of flowers and the warm water soothed her aching body as it rose. \n\nGavin disappeared for several minutes as the giant tub filled with water. She laid her head back lazily and stared at the ceiling. Her sex raw from the two nights of body racking sex. She still wasn't used to it! They were nine months into it, and she was still flabbergasted with the way her body felt after a session! \n\nNine months, just three more to the year mark she frowned. That still had a deep seed of worry for her. Everything about what was happening was telling her this was going to last more than a year! Hell he just leased her a car for two years! Doesn't that mean he is thinking long term? \n\nThen the fact he told her that he loved her, something he hadn't uttered to anyone since Carla. The bitch that broke him. The bitch that made this wonderful man stop loving! And this man could love! Not just the physical portion, although that was flat out amazing, his heart was so wonderful. His gentleness, his soft voice, the way he smiled or looked at her. \n\n\"What are you thinking?\" His voice startled her from her thoughts. \n\n\"Just how wonderful you are,\" she whispered as she looked to him. \n\n\"Why do you try to lie to me?\" he asked her. \n\n\"I'm not lying, I think you are absolutely wonderful!\" she grinned leaning on the edge of the tub resting her chin in her folded arms. \n\nHe stared at her, showing his determination. \n\n\"I was thinking, how pissed I am that Carla broke you,\" she whispered. \"That you were hurt so bad that you almost went through your life...alone.\" \n\n\"Yet you repaired me,\" he smiled as he came in with the wine glasses. He handed her one and climbed in behind her. \n\n\"I shouldn't have had to,\" she said as he pulled her back against his strong body. \n\n\"No,\" he admitted. \"I suppose not. But that is the past, now we have the present and the future!\" he said clinking his glass gently against hers in a toast. \n\n\"What's that?\" she asked as he set a white box, wrapped in bright red ribbon, on the edge of the tub. \n\n\"That,\" he smiled kissing her head. \"Is a box!\" \n\n\"I can see that!\" she said, finding no humor in the fact he had bought her something else. Especially since he had warned her this morning she could not buy him any more gifts. \n\nHer anger bubbled. First the car, the clothes, and the pampering. Now gifts in beautifully wrapped boxes. \n\n\"Easy little one,\" he smiled feeling her anger swell. \"I said I didn't want to break you and that I wanted you to be you, but the caveat is, you have to let me be me...remember?\" \n\nShe lowered her chin to her chest in a deep sigh. Be a sub that rocks his world, she begged herself. That was her goal now. To be the one sub he begs to not leave him, not that she would. But her mind was set, she would be the one that made him believe he couldn't live without her, it would take all she had. All her power to fight her natural desire to stand her ground, to accept her new role, to immerse herself in obedience, but he was worth it. \n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" she whispered. \n\n\"Open it,\" he smiled kissing her head feeling her emotions. \n\nShe reached out with a quaking hand, hoping this wasn't super expensive! \n\nPulling on the ribbon it pulled easily apart. She set the ribbon on the side of the tub. Then slowly pulled the lid off the box. She gasped as the smile spread on her face. It was a gold and silver intertwined Pandora bracelet. \n\nShe gently pulled it from the box, it already had several charms on it. \n\n\"This here represents the city of Chicago, the one you so well depicted on the wall,\" he smiled pointing out the charm with the outline of the city skyline. \n\n\"This one,\" he said, moving to the charm of an apple. \"Represents your life as a teacher, a fruit of knowledge that you happily pass on to others.\" \n\nThe tears were a soft warm stream down her face, as he said the things that she meant to him. \n\n\"This one,\" he smiled holding the charm of art brushes and easel. \"Represents you, the artist.\" \n\n\"This one,\" he said holding the heart inscribed with the word love, \"Represents how I feel about you.\" \n\n\"And this one,\" he said holding onto the one with the three waves of the BDSM. \"This one represents us as a unit.\" \n\nHe kissed her head multiple times. \n\n\"This is your collar, the one you wear in the vanilla world,\" he told her in her hair. \"It is inappropriate for us to wear our collars like we would at a party, so this replaces that, an outward sign to those in the know, that you are owned, but hidden in privacy to those who aren't in the know.\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she whispered as he put it on her. \n\n\"You are not allowed to take it off,\" he said firmly. \"Not without permission, this is my sign of ownership. You belong to me.\" \n\n\"Happily!\" she said wiping the tear away as she turned to kiss him. His hands gently holding her face. \n\n*** \n\nAs he bathed her gently in the tub she played with her new \"collar\". The charms were perfect! She thought of all they had been through, all she was willing to go through with him. The things he was doing for her. Not just physically, but emotionally. It was all so overwhelming! \n\n\"I got a call from my sister today,\" she told him. She had toyed with the idea all day in how to approach him with this upcoming subject. \n\n\"Everything ok?\" he asked her. \n\n\"She asked if I was coming home for Christmas,\" Alex told him looking over her shoulder to gage his reaction. \n\n\"Christmas is supposed to be about family,\" Gavin told her watching her watch him, he knew what was next. \n\n\"I know,\" she smiled. \"Which is why I want you to come with me.\" \n\nAlex held her breath in concern, not knowing his possible response. He had met the parents but basically because he was forced to at the last minute, because neither knew they were coming to town. But this was different, this was not an impromptu visit neither knew was going to happen. This would be something he knew full well was going to happen. \n\nIt also was more than just her judgmental mother to battle with. It would be her three sisters as well. The three \"perfect\" sisters and their \"perfect\" families that her mother claimed and the one rebellious single daughter that only her father claimed proudly. \n\nIt would expose Gavin to her home world, maybe he would learn why she is the way she is, and he would understand. Not that he didn't understand her completely now. But being exposed to the house she and her father had to endure would explain her stubbornness. If there were an explanation anyway. \n\nIt would also give her the opportunity to gloat, to show everybody in her family that she was capable of finding not only a man, but a fantastic one! One that would cause the other women in the family to look upon her with jealousy. And they would be jealous, a wealthy, successful doctor? It was something they all strived for, the three sisters, and multiple cousins on her mother's side, but failed to land. The rebellious one did. The one girl everyone said would wind up either a spinster, because her grit and stubbornness forced most men away from her, or in a relationship with a broke man with no future. \n\n\"Go with you to Pennsylvania?\" he asked furrowing his brow. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I want you to meet my family, I want to show you off!\" \n\n\"I'm not a prize to be gloated over,\" he said with a scoff that he was such a thing to show off. \n\n\"The hell you aren't!\" Alex said turning to him. \"You are the greatest prize God has given me!\" \n\n\"I have my practice,\" he said looking at her, nearly crushing her with his intimation of his responsibility. \n\nHe could tell she really wanted him to go. Of all his subs, he never met any of their family. Alex's parents were the first he had ever met, he hadn't even met Carla's while she was alive, back in college, as they lived across the country. \n\nIt wasn't until her funeral that he even laid eyes on them, and then they hated him because he didn't stop her from her end. Guilt he accepted as he felt the same. Guilt that Alex had shown him was unfair. ",
        "\"I know,\" she frowned. She knew he wouldn't go. His patients come first. It was something she knew she would have to adjust to. \n\n\"Ok,\" he shocked her. \"If it means that much to you, then we will go to your family for Christmas.\" \n\n\"Really?\" she gasped, stunned he would agree. He nodded. \n\n\"There may be times, Little One, where it appears my patients come first, and there was a time that was correct,\" he said as he kissed her lips gently. \"But that time has passed. I want to be with you.\""
