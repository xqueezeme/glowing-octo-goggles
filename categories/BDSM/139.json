        " (If you have not read the first part of this story, it is located .) \n\n*\n\nWhere you end up, surprisingly, is the mall. \n\nYou see it coming up and grin. \n\n'Are we going shopping?'\n\n'Yep.' He answers with a grin.\n\n'I love shopping.' You say truthfully.\n\nHe nods, and focuses on finding you a spot to park. He circles around the lot a couple of times, which you think is odd as he drives past several spots. Finally he spots the entrance to the underground parking. He zips in quickly and through the barely opening garage door, making you clutch at the seat belt in a moment of terror. Then he whirls the rusty old beast around the lot and drives into the very basement level and parks the car in a dark corner with nobody else in sight.\n\nYou like this. A lot. It feels like you're a naughty teenager and you're about to start petting. \n\nYou start running through naughty cheerleader lines in your head. Maybe you can tell him to be careful, in case the coach finds out?\n\nAs usual, Scott is not in tune with your plan, as the moment the car is in park, his seat belt is off, the keys are in his hand and he's out the door to let you out of the car. You think he's being chivalrous, but a moment later you realize that the door is jammed and he has to hip check it just right to get it to open for you.\n\n'Sorry.' He says with a sheepish grin as he holds the door open for you.\n\n'At least you're not a car guy.' You smile back. You dated a car guy once. It was terrible. You spent an hour on the phone trying to subtly let him know that you were horny, and he missed every cue and just stayed home and buffed the leather seats in his Charger.\n\nYou sigh. You did miss the charger. The engine revved and vibrated in jusssst the right way. You didn't miss the driver. He was quicker than a ten second mile and way less satisfying.\n\nHe walks with you to the elevators, and you reach out and tentatively feel for his hand. He takes your hand without looking, gives it that same gentle squeeze he always does and keeps going.\n\nHe keeps doing these little things, and they endear you to him. He keeps putting the pillow under your head, he keeps squeezing your hand firmly, keeps not being concerned about his pleasure and is dialled in completely on your own.\n\nHe's not what you expected at all.\n\nIn the back of your head, you expected to be covered with welts and bruises and possibly be bleeding somehow. You're not sure how you talked yourself into even meeting with this man, because the stories that he wrote made you cringe and shudder and even gave you nightmares from time to time. \n\nThat story with the wasps... you shudder. Then you explain it away to him by saying that you're cold.\n\nAnd naturally, he just puts an arm around you and rubs your back to heat you up. He doesn't paw or grope at you, he just wants to make you warm because you're cold and he parked in a chilly garage.\n\nIt makes your tummy flip flop when he does things like that. He cares. About you. \n\nIt feels like a long time since someone has.\n\nYou squeeze his hand back and give him a warm smile. The elevator arrives a moment later and you get in and let the little glass box carry you up to the shops filled with clothes and shoes, toys and books and all sorts of other little distractions. And the whole time, as the lift slowly takes you up, you hold his hand like a happy teenager. \n\nThe doors open a moment later, and you're ushered into the rather quiet shopping center. People mill around, but it isn't crowded. You both wander down the aisles and Scott steers you almost immediately into a shoe store so that you can pick up a nice comfortable black pair of Tom's. You gladly slide your feet out of the punishing heels and into the comfy flats with an almost audible groan of pleasure. \n\nThe salesgirl chuckles, and Scott pipes up.\n\n'Do you need some time alone with the shoes?' He asks slyly.\n\n'Maybe just a cigarette...' You say with a sigh and your eyes closed. \n\nHe laughs at that and so does the salesgirl, although her laugh is a little strained.\n\nYou slide your high heels into the box the Tom's came in and by the time you get yourself sorted out you see Scott at the counter talking to the Salesgirl. You wonder for a moment if the bitch is flirting with him, then you see him slide his bank card out of his wallet.\n\nYou watch in confusion for a moment, then she hands him a receipt. \n\n'Hey!' You suddenly bark.\n\n'What?' He responds, somewhat startled.\n\n'Did you just buy my shoes for me?' You ask, somewhat vexed.\n\n'Yes?' He says, a legitimate look of confusion on his face.\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Well, I tore you dress to shreds the other night, so I figured the least I could do is buy you a new pair of shoes.' \n\nThe salesgirl cocks an eyebrow but refrains from speaking.\n\n'Ok, I asked you to tear my dress off and it was fantastic! You don't have to buy me shoes every time..'\n\n'WOW!' Says the salesgirl forcefully. 'My stockroom is a DISASTER. I'm... I'm just gonna go clean it. Now. Goodbye.'\n\nAnd she abruptly turns and marches into the back and behind a curtain.\n\nScott watches her go with a perfectly neutral expression. \n\n'Well, at least she got an amusing story out of it.' He says dryly.\n\n'Oh shut up.'\n\nYou leave the store a moment later. One hand wrapped around his, and the other holding the bag and the instruments of torture that you strapped to your feet on Friday night.\n\nYou both wander up and down the mall for a while, not really doing much but relaxing and strolling. Scott asks if you mind going into a book store for a moment, and you don't, so you both look at books for a while. \n\nA candy shop tantalizes you both with fresh caramel and praline fudge, and he gets you both a small slab. You recline on a bench together and break the sweet gooey treat open. You slide a piece into your mouth, moments later your taste buds inform your brain that a piece of solid bliss is in your mouth. And it is creamy, and chewy and delightful.\n\n'Oh god.' You murmur.\n\n'It can't be that good!' Scott says skeptically as he pops a slice into his own mouth.\n\nHis eyes widen then slam shut as he inhales deeply. \n\n'Sweet Jesus, that is unbelievable.' He says, then puts his head down and presses his pinky and thumb to his temple, his eyes shut tightly. You watch him enjoy the fudge like you have seen him enjoy little else (Including you...) and you can't help but rib him a little.\n\n'Wow. Now I know how to make you orgasm. Fudge.' \n\nHe laughs, his tongue still wrapped in a coating of caramel and sugary bliss.\n\nYou just watch him. He really enjoyed it. He really, really enjoyed that. You like watching him when he has that much pleasure. He seems almost vulnerable and afraid when he's happy. \n\nIt's like he doesn't even know how to process that.\n\nInteresting.\n\nTime passes, and you meander down the shops in the mall. You wander by the theatre and Scott stops to look at the posters. The new Batman film is out, and he's gazing longingly at it.\n\nSometimes he's like a little boy. \n\n'Did you want to go see that?' You ask him.\n\n'Yeah, I've been meaning to go for a while now. Stuff just keeps coming up.' \n\n'Am I stuff?'\n\n'You are not stuff. Despite the amount of times I have... stuffed you.' He makes the goofy smile he only breaks out when he's really having fun.\n\nYou blush at him. He's gently mocking you, but he's literally given you more pleasure in the last 48 hours than you had in the last five years. It bothers you.\n\nThen an idea forms in your head. \n\n'Why don't you go watch it now?' You ask him.\n\nHe looks at you with confusion. \n\n'I was just playing with you Addie. I'm sorry.' He says, genuinely apologetic for something he did that made you very happy.\n\nAnd suddenly, it clicks into your head. You think you know what he wants. What he actually needs and needs badly. \n\nYou think you can give it to him. \n\nYou stand on your tiptoes and give him a little smooch on the cheek. He watches you warily, unsure what's going on. \n\n'Please go watch the movie. I'll do a little shopping and we can meet up her in ninety minutes.'\n\n'It's a two hour and twenty minute movie.'\n\n'Please go watch the movie. I'll do a little shopping and we'll meet back here in two hours and twenty minutes.' You say sweetly, all the while thinking happily that this gives you more time to pull off your plan. \n\n'Addie... I... don't you want to come watch it with me?'\n\n'Nope. I like watching movies by myself.'\n\n'Really?'\n\n'Really.'\n\nHe looks at you hard for a moment, then he smiles brightly.\n\n'You really are kind of fucking awesome, you know that?'\n\nYou blush. He means it. He really thinks you're fucking awesome. Not because you're having all sorts of kinky sex, but because you're willing to let him go and watch a movie he's been trying to watch for a month now.\n\nYou watch him head into the theatre, and it's like a weight got lifted off him. He's happy. \n\nHe wasn't unhappy to be with you, but he felt he needed to take care of you. That's why he kept stimulating you to the point of unconsciousness. That's why he wouldn't take you anally even when you offered, why he bought the shoes for you, why he keeps tucking the pillow under your head, why he stood between you and the drunks at the restaurant. That's why he's always giving your fingers those gentle squeezes. \n\nThat's why he doesn't really want to hurt you.\n\nBecause he feels he has to take care of you. \n\nYou'd bet your house if he didn't realize that he'd let his marriage blow up because he didn't take control he would have just driven you home meekly. He stopped you and yelled at you because he knew that that would blow it up if he let it happen. \n\nYou really want to give him one night. Just one night... where he knows that it's all about what he wants and what he needs and that you're there to take care of him. \n\nYou check your watch. The movie starts in five minutes. You should have just enough time to get the things you need.\n\nYou hit the liquor store first. You get yourself a bottle of Rye and get one of the clerks to find an exotic dark beer that you know he'll like.\n\nThen you run down to a somewhat hip clothing store that caters to a younger crowd. You grab a clerk and ask for her help finding the sluttiest dress they have. She plucks out several that you would be ashamed to wear in public. You try them on rapid fire, but none of them seem to be giving you the effect that you are looking for. You sigh and tell the clerk that it doesn't look right. She nods, not judging you but thinking hard about what you want, then snaps her fingers and disappears for a moment.\n\nShe returns a moment later with some of the same dresses, in smaller sizes. She grins, and urges you to try some of them on.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, you find the one that you know will blow his mind. It's an incredibly tight white spandex tube that keeps sliding up your thighs and exposing your underwear and your breasts threaten to pop out of every five minutes. \n\n'The only way you could look sluttier would be to lose the underwear.' Says the clerk with a giggle.\n\nShe's brilliant. You were going to go and buy some really trampy undergarments, but this is faster and he gets you naked even quicker.\n\nYou grin and head to the front of the store to pay for your dress that you've crammed yourself into. A girl and her boyfriend are shopping in the store and he stops dead at the sight of you and your slut-tastic dress. A moment later, his girlfriend sees him ogling you and plants a solid elbow in his midsection. \n\nThe clerk rolls her eyes and nabs a cheap overcoat on the way to the front of the store. She plunks it down on the counter for you and tells you that it's on sale... and it should keep anyone from giving you a hard time.\n\nYou smile, whip out your bank card and pay for both items, then slide the overcoat on and buckle up the front. You dart out the front of the store a moment later and head towards your next stop... the shoe store that you got the Tom's at.\n\nYou quickly scan the available shoes, and you're disappointed. You wanted some ridiculously high heeled stripper shoes and they don't really have any. \n\nYou do see some very epic gladiator sandals with straps that wrap around the ankle and snake up the calf. Scott told you once that he loved the look of those shoes and this pair looks exotic enough to hold his attention.\n\nA quick swipe of the bank card and you've got the comfy Toms stowed in yet another box and the clerk gives you a hand strapping the laces around your legs so that you can get moving. You snicker into your hand as you watch the clerk desperately try not to look at your frequently exposed vagina in the tiny, tiny dress.\n\nAnd move you do, to your last stop, a beauty salon. \n\nYou explain to the receptionist what you're trying to do, and she grins and pages an older woman from the back. She listens to you intently and smiles.\n\n'Honey, when we're finished with you, your man will think he's dreaming.'\n\nYour hair is scrubbed and styled rapidly, the stylist shaping an exotic hairstyle for you that curls down your shoulder and rests on your chest. Then she gets out her makeup kit and with surprising speed turns you from a pale faced girl with no makeup to a pouty lipped exotic temptress. \n\nYou look in the mirror, turn your head from side to side and practice pouting sexily into the mirror. You look fantastic, but you are concerned this is too much.\n\n'Honey, when it comes to men, there is no such thing as too slutty.' She says with a sly grin.\n\n'How did you learn to do this?' You ask, marvelling at how red and bright your lips are.\n\n'Eh, I do the girls up for a local porn producer around here.'\n\nYou look over at her in surprise.\n\n'It's a living.' She says with a shrug.\n\nYou giggle, thank her and pay for her time and leave a nice tip.\n\nYour bank account just took a hit, but you feel like you're ready now. You scoot down the hallway down to the theatre and then sit on the bench and wait for him to come out of the theatre.\n\nYou wait patiently for a few minutes. Most people ignore you, but one older gentleman nearly breaks his neck trying to get a sneaky look at you when he walks directly into a support pillar.\n\nYou're never dressed like this before. It's terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.\n\nPeople start to stream out of the theatre. You see Scott a moment later as he wanders out of the theatre and looks around. He looks right through you, clearly not recognizing you in a different outfit, hairstyle, shoes and made up.\n\nThis will be fun. A smile crosses your lips.\n\nHe stands by the poster where you told him to go enjoy the film. His head swivels around as he tries to find you.\n\nHe's starting to look concerned. His cell phone appears so he can check the time and then slides it back into his pocket.\n\nHe shuffles his feet. He looks uncomfortable.\n\nOk, you think, that's long enough.\n\nYou pop out your cell phone and text him.\n\nAddie: Where are you?\n\nHe hears the ping, flips open his phone and sees the text. He smiles and fumbles with the keys on his phone.\n\nScott: In front of the theatre.\n\nAddie: Where?\n\nScott: In front of the posters.\n\nAddie: Oh. I C U.\n\nScott: Great! Where are you.\n\nAddie: On the Bench.\n\nScott looks over at the bench, then looks in the other direction. He rapidly texts back with a confused look on his face.\n\nScott: I still don't see you. Are you at the outside exit?\n\nAddie: Look at the bench Scott. Look closer.\n\nScott looks up from his cell phone, then over at you. You give him a sly smile. \n\n'Addie?'\n\nYou look around, make sure that nobody is watching, then slide the buckle on the coat open and lean forward and open your legs so that your cleavage presses forward and he can see clearly between your thighs. You know it's shiny and glistening down there, because you've been thinking about all the things you're going to do to him and for him for the last two hours.\n\nYour nipples peek over the top of the tiny, tight white dress. You let them.\n\nYou stand, and walk over to him, bags in hand. His eyes are wide.\n\n'Hi.'\n\n'Hi.' He responds quietly, eyes still wide. You don't know if you've ever had his complete and utter attention this way.\n\nYou drop the bags in your hand and reach forward and take his hand. You squeeze his fingers gently and he snaps out of the spell you seem to have him in.\n\n'Addie what is this?'\n\n'I know you Scott. You put everyone in front of you. And you try and make sure that everyone likes you. And your needs never really matter. Do they?'\n\n'I... I don't...' He stammers. \n\n'They matter to me. You can fuck me for hours and never finish. You figure out exactly what I need and you make sure I get it. And whenever you guess wrong you blame yourself instead of anyone else.'\n\nHe just opens and closes his mouth, words clearly failing him. That pleases you on some level, because you've never stunned him into silence before.\n\n'I'm asking you, please, take me tonight and use me however you want. If you want me to suffer, I'll suffer for you. If you want to take my body, it's yours. If you want me to serve you any other way, please just ask me.'\n\nYou stand on your tip-toes, whisper into his ear.\n\n'I am your property. Tonight. Tomorrow night. Every night. I chose you. You get to make all the decisions from now on. Let me show you that. Please.'\n\nScott makes a strangled sound and blinks for a second, then he clears his throat. \n\n'Do you want to go back to my place now?' He asks.\n\n'Do you?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Then let's go to your place.'\n\nHe nods, and for once he seems a little shaken. This isn't quite going like you planned it to. He picks up some of the bags for you and a sigh escapes your lips. For a sadistic dominant, he's certainly polite.\n\nYou tuck your nipples back into the ridiculous dress and suddenly feel very cheap. You spent two hours glamming yourself up, and suddenly he's too nervous to touch you.\n\nYour hand slides down and grips his. Your eyes widen as you realize that he's trembling.\n\n'What's wrong?' You ask. You just offered to be his whore, his slut, his slave, whatever he needs. Why is he afraid?\n\nHe stops, exhales loudly. His hand drifts up to his face and he grips his temples, massaging them while his eyes close.\n\n'I don't... I'm not... Addie. This is not what we should be doing.' \n\n'Why?'\n\n'We just started. Literally just started. I know you want to please me but... but we can't do this. Not yet.'\n\n'I think we can.' You grip his hand with both of your own and pull him closer to you. Heat radiates off him like it always does. \n\nHe shakes his head with frustration and concern.\n\n'I trust you Scott. I do. I need you to be satisfied. I need you to get what you need. You've been so attentive to what I need... I want.... I need to do the same for you.'\n\nHe sighs and squeezes your hand and looks around. People are staring at you both. This isn't surprising as you're having a heated discussion and you're dressed like a porn star.\n\n'Let's take this out to the car.' Scott says as he looks around.\n\nYou both walk quickly to the elevator. The glass box carries you both down to the car rapidly and silently. Scott seems tense. You squeeze his hand silently.\n\nIs he afraid? Why is he afraid?\n\nThe elevator reaches the parking garage and you both stride out. His hand grips your own tightly as he strides to the car. He seems almost distressed.\n\n'Scott... please.... I just... please talk to me. Please.'\n\n'Addie. I just... it isn't... it's not time for this yet.'\n\n'But I made myself into... I'm not sure what this is. I think I'm a tramp. Or a slut. Whatever you need me to be and... whatever you need to do.'\n\nScott doesn't stop walking. He just makes an enigmatic motion with his hand.",
        "You're suddenly very sad. Scott is terrified to take the next step and you feel like you crossed a line that you were not supposed to cross. You're suddenly very afraid that you fucked up. And not fucked up in some sort of weird rule that will get your nipples pinched. You're afraid that what you did ruined something on some level. \n\n'Scott... please. I... I don't... I just want you to...'\n\nAbruptly, he moves directly in front of you and grabs you by the carefully braided and coifed hair that was artfully darting down your shoulder. He yanks it savagely and you gasp as he bends you backwards and then pins you to the trunk of the car. You feel his elbow land across your throat and he calmly pins you there with his forearm across your throat. You panic a little and the bags you are carrying drop from your fingers and clatter off the ground.\n\nYou feel an odd nanosecond of relief when none of the bottles break. You don't know why.\n\nYou claw at his arm for a second as fear drives your actions. Then he simply yanks your head up by the hair and bounces your head off the trunk of the car. You see stars for a moment, then your head whips right, then left as he slaps you, then backhands you the other direction.\n\nYou stop clawing at his arm and stop fighting him. You're suddenly very afraid. A moment ago you were certain this had all been one very refined act and your direct appeal to his darker side had failed because he didn't really have one. Now you're certain he has one, because your cheeks still sting from those slaps and you can feel a little droplet of blood trickling down your nose.\n\n'I... I'm sorr...'\n\n'Shut. Your. Mouth.' He growls. \n\nYou shut it.\n\n'Addison, you... you do not know what you are asking me. At all.' He says through gritted teeth.\n\n'Yes. I do.' You whisper back. 'You hold it in. All the time. I can see it in your eyes right now. I want to see it. All of it. Stop holding back. Use me.'\n\n'You do not want to play these games with me. I've been... holding this in for so long. I will hurt you. And not in the good way.' He's still angry with you. His grip on your hair, pinning you to the car is like iron.\n\nYou shift on the car, uncomfortable in this contorted pose. Your naked leg brushes up against his and you can feel heat radiating off his leg and body. \n\nYou feel cold, like you always do when you feel afraid and your adrenaline surges... and when you're pinned against a rusty, dusty automobile by a much larger man that you have managed to make very angry.\n\nYou raise a hand to his face and hold it there. Your cheeks still feel hot from the sudden slaps a moment ago, but you don't care. He's so very angry still, his nostrils are flared wide.\n\nYou think about what you say next later, and you don't know why you said it. Maybe you were trying to spur him on. Maybe you really did what him to hurt you. \n\nMaybe you wanted him to let go. Just for once. \n\n'Scott. Don't be a pussy. Do it.'\n\nHe furrows his brow in disbelief. You grin up at him. \n\nHis free fist smashes into the trunk of the car next to your head, denting the metal. You cringe. Your plan is working, but it's working a little too well. \n\nYou were aiming for anger, and you got rage. \n\nAbruptly, he yanks you up off the trunk and then jams a key into the slot. The trunk opens with a loud creak, and exposes a rusty old spare tire and assorted trunk junk, from papers to old Coke cans and tools. You just start to notice that it smells a little when Scott yanks your hair and abruptly shoves you completely into the trunk. The trunk lid slams down a moment later and you're left in darkness amid various piles of junk and trash, various things poking you as you lay stunned at this latest development.\n\nYou hear him loading the bags into the car, and then you hear the doors slam shut.\n\nHe wouldn't.\n\nThe engine roars to life, incredibly loud in the trunk no less, and then he peels out of the parking space. You shriek and cover your ears with one arm while you hold onto the rusty spare tire with the other. Scott flies up the series of ramps, and the loose paper and tools and garbage shift and cascade around you. \n\nThe drive home takes about fifteen minutes, although it feels like forever in the pitch black, dirty, smelly trunk. Finally, you hear the familiar crunch of the gravel outside his apartment and hear the garage door retracting. \n\nScott gets out of the car, and you hear him retrieving the bags full of your clothes and shoes and the beer and the rye. You wait a moment for him to open the trunk, but nothing happens. A moment later you hear the elevator open and he steps inside. The door closes, and you hear the lift take him away.\n\nThen silence.\n\nUh oh.\n\nTime passes. And then additional time passes.\n\nIs he not coming back? How angry is he?\n\nYou begin to get panicky. It's really dark, the trunk smells funny and you feel really dirty.\n\nYou feel around and find the latch. You fiddle with it and try to pop it open until you crack a nail. Then you stop, sucking on your sore cuticle and feel sad for yourself.\n\nMore time passes. It's starting to get to you. You bang your fist on the roof of the trunk a couple of times in frustration. After a few whacks, you stop. Your hand and your finger hurt now.\n\n'DAMMIT SCOTT!' You scream suddenly. And suddenly the tears are flowing again. You're jammed into this tiny, dirty, pitch black trunk. Things are poking you. You feel filthy and disgusting and you're certain that the ridiculously slutty dress, the porn star makeup and the tantalizing hairstyle have been ruined. \n\nAbruptly, you hear the elevator. The engine whirs and the lift slides slowly down to your floor. Somebody, (Scott you hope.) walks over to the car and you hear a key in the lock. The trunk wheezes open and the sudden light punishes your retinas.\n\n'DAMMIT Scott! How could you...'\n\nSlam! You're in the dark again. \n\n'Noooo!' You wail.\n\nYou hear him walk back to the elevator, and a moment later the door slides shut and he disappears back up into his apartment. \n\nYou weep in frustration, but you're pretty sure you know what this is. \n\nHe's giving you a taste. Just a taste. He wants you to know what he's willing and capable of doing to you. Because he wants you to back off. \n\nYou're not going to. You curl into a little ball and try to ignore the various scraps of paper and debris poking and chafing you.\n\nA short while later, the engines whir to life and the lift slides down to your floor again. The same casual footsteps lead out to your car, the key fits into the lock and suddenly bright white light pours down on you.\n\nYou force yourself to not scream at him again. The penalty is apparently more trunk time and you're already sick of it.\n\n'You're done screaming now?'\n\n'Yes.' You reply meekly.\n\n'Good. Get out of the trunk and come with me.'\n\nYou clamber out of the trunk and stand up in front of him. You're still pissed off at him, but you asked him to play mean and he showed you that he could. \n\nHe looks you up and down, then pulls out his cell phone and takes a picture of you. \n\n'Why did you do that?' You ask quietly, seething just a little.\n\n'I wanted a memory of this moment.' He says without looking at you.\n\nHe turns and heads to the elevator, beckoning you to follow him. You step behind him quietly. Your dress is ruined, covered with dirt and rust stains and something black and greasy. Your hair is messed up, and you feel the makeup the woman spent so much of her time and your money on smeared and stained from your tears.\n\nYou both enter the lift and exit into his apartment a moment later. He points towards a small table in the kitchen and two battered chairs. You obediently head towards the table and spy your bottle of rye and a shot glass. There's also a yellow ball gag with a strap and a pair of handcuffs.\n\n'Sit.' He commands. You do.\n\nHe lowers himself into the seat next to you. Then he reaches over and pours you a shot of the rye.\n\n'Drink it. Now.'\n\nYou take the shot glass and press it to your lips then bang back the shot quickly. \n\nYou shudder. This rye is strong and has a smoky aftertaste.\n\n'Addie, I'm only going to say this one time. And then you get to choose what comes next. I want you to have that choice, not because I'm afraid of what I'll do to you, but because you keep pushing the boundaries and I want this decision to be on you.'\n\nHe pours you another shot and orders you to consume it. You do with a little gasp.\n\n'This isn't a fun little sex game you're asking for. I'm going to violate you and do things that you haven't considered. I'll abuse you verbally, I'll hurt you and I'll degrade you. I'll do things to you just to change your expression and just to fuck with your head.'\n\nHe fills the shot glass again, then motions at you once more. A moment later it burns in your stomach.\n\n'I'm not going to give you any limits except for ones I choose. I'll fuck you in any hole I choose, punish you in any way I see fit and violate you in whatever way I think will fill you with sorrow and anguish.'\n\nHe pauses, looks at you. You're shaking as you listen. \n\nHe pours you yet another shot. You drink it, grateful for the sudden warmth.\n\n'If you want to go back to what we had, I'll do that. We can go snuggle on the couch or take a shower and act like mildly perverted people. Or if you think I've been a complete dick you can walk over to the elevator and walk down to the car and I'll drive you back to the restaurant and you can take your car home and never talk to me again.'\n\nHe pours you another shot. You pick it up and toss it down quick, trying to ignore the fact that you've had five shots of alcohol in five minutes. \n\n'But if you really want to Addie, and I gotta say, I recommend A or B over this option heartily, you can pick up those handcuffs and cuff yourself, and then you can take that ballgag and strap it into your mouth. Just know that when you do that, I'm going to take you into the ladies room and do everything you asked me to do to you and redefine your understanding of the word 'regret' in the process.'\n\nHe pours you a shot and then sits back. \n\nYou look at him. He's not angry anymore. He looks resigned. Whatever happens next is whatever happens next and he's going to deal with it no matter what the outcome.\n\nYou put your hand on the ballgag, and he says one last thing.\n\n'If you put that thing on, I'm going to break you. And you need to know that when you beg me to stop, I won't. And I won't care.'\n\nYou shudder. The son of a bitch is making you choose. He's put your options on the table and let you decide. And he's made no bones about it and what he'll do to you in each scenario. \n\nGoing home is not an option. It never was. You could sooner cut off your own arm than leave him right now. \n\nBut going to the shower and letting him clean you is desirable. He's skilled, knowledgeable and he knows you and what you love. And you know just from your little time in the trunk that he knows what you can barely tolerate too.\n\nAnd you want it. You want to see him at his darkest.\n\nYou pick up the shotglass and down the last shot. The alcohol now surging through your system makes you feel lightheaded and terrified and incredibly aroused. You place your hand on the ballgag and pick it up, looking at it carefully. \n\nOnly Scott would have a ballgag with a bright yellow happy face.\n\nYou slide it into your mouth and then slip the straps around the back of your head to tighten and lock the straps in place. The handcuffs follow, sliding easily onto your wrists and then locking down tight. \n\nIt's done. \n\nHe just watches you for a moment, then shakes his head.\n\n'You know what pisses me off Addie? I was content. I liked what we had. I did. It satisfied me. I thought it satisfied you too.'\n\nHe sighs, pours himself a shot from the rye bottle and then bangs it back. Then he turns and looks at you and your blood turns to ice.\n\n'Apparently not, because here we are.'\n\nHe grabs you by the arm and yanks you to your feet. He marches you towards the ladies room, and as you get there you see he's crossed out ladies and written the word 'HELL' in bright red marker on the door.\n\nThe door pushes away and you see the opposite side of the washrooms. You pale a little as you take the place in. \n\nThe front of the area is the same as the boys room, sinks and running water on one side, lockers on the other. More space is allotted to stalls as there are no urinals here. Just past the stalls lies the shower however, and what you see in there makes you pale.\n\nScott has installed two heavy metal bars into the wall and they jut out underneath the shower heads. A pair of chains with manacles hangs from the ceiling, and a medical stand with an enema bag and hose stand in the corner. A table set away from the showers has several whips, canes, paddles and floggers as well as other devices that you don't recognize. \n\nNext to the table are a pair of video cameras, one on a tripod, one loose. A plastic bin holds straps and manacles and additional restraints, some of which you do not recognize. \n\nHoly fuck. This is going to be hard.\n\nScott lets you take it in for a moment, then leans over and whispers in your ear. \n\n'Remember, when you break, and you can't take anymore... I do not care.'\n\nYou look up at him suddenly terrified. Why didn't you just stick with the cuddling?\n\n'Kneel.' He orders you, and you obey. You bend at the waist, and feel your ruined, dirty dress slide up and reveal your ass. One rogue nipple pops out and immediately turns hard. He looks down at you, then picks up something from the table. It's a bottle of lube. He unbuckles his belt and the pants slide down to the floor, followed by his underwear and socks a moment later. He's behind you immediately, and then you feel his lubed up wet fingers sliding roughly inside you seconds later. \n\nYou squeal. He ignores you. His fingers swirl around inside you and then almost as soon as he withdraws you can feel him penetrating you. As scared as you are and with the inclusion of the lube, your sex is sopping and ready for action. He's fully inside you moments later, and he enjoys himself quickly while gripping your hair for leverage. His pelvis smacks off your behind again and again as he uses your roughly and without foreplay. He only stops when he grunts hard, and you feel him spray his seed deep inside you.\n\nYou enjoy that moment, because while he's frozen and still, he's deep inside you and he just used you for pleasure without caring if you had any. It's different, scary and kind of terrifying.\n\nHe withdraws from you after he feels satisfied, then starts trussing you up and securing you.\n\nA heavy leather collar fits snugly around your neck, and a padlock seals it in place. Your arms are raised over your head and your wrists are secured to the collar, insuring that you can't do much more than flap your arms. \n\nHe shoves you against the support bars under the showerhead and secures your now immobilized arms to the hard point with snug plastic zip straps.\n\nHe returns to the table and then pulls out several lengths of chain and a heavy leather belt. The belt locks around your waist, and then d-rings embedded in the leather attach to a chain that locks your pelvis to the wall.\n\nYou think you know what's next. Scott shared a picture with you one time, and he said it was his favourite picture ever. The girl was secured totally, hard tied with chains at the waist, neck ankles and wrists and contorted into an unbelievably exposed position on a dirty mattress. You feel the manacles locking around your own ankles and know that he's attempting to present you in a similar fashion. \n\nThe manacles are attached to chains, and Scott connects them to the top bar through another ring and then forces your ankles up until you have to contort and hang from the bars spread wide and splayed open. Scott checks the tension, then tightens the chains up some more until you squeak from being bent nearly in half with your ankles secured inches from your ears. \n\nScott looks satisfied, then he goes and picks up the loose video camera. He also trains the tripod mount camera on your as well, and then moves in with the shoulder mount camera to get a good look at your face. \n\n'Hey Everyone, this is Addison. Say hi Addison!'\n\n'Mffgerh?' You mumble through the gag.\n\n'Addison is a silly little cunt that wants to see how sadistic I can be. Isn't that true Addison?'\n\nYou flush. He's really crawling into your head now. He knows you think your formal name sounds like a porn star, and he's using that to reinforce the predicament you let him put you in. And he's started to talk dirty to you. Cunt will be just the start of his lexicon of filth that he'll rain down on your head.\n\n'Mgghddswed!' You respond.\n\nScott chuckles, then reaches out and tugs down the neckline of the ruined slutwear you purchased. Your remaining covered nipple pops free and between the adrenaline, the chill in the room and the fear that Scott is building in you it makes it hard as a diamond in seconds.\n\n'You know Addison, I was going to strip you, but I like this look. The dirty slutty clothing just kind of suits you so well.'\n\nYou blush again. He knows being dirty drives you insane. He's not pulling any punches, just like he promised.\n\n'And look here folks, we've got some fresh come dripping out of Addison's snatch.'\n\nYou blush even deeper. He kneels and gets a close up shot of his semen dripping out of you and sliding down your leg.\n\n'Tsk Tsk Addison, you're a mess. But I have good news for you.'\n\n'Mgfgsffe?' You ask, curious and concerned about what he considers good news.\n\n'Oh Addison, soon you'll be a lot cleaner inside than out.'\n\nYou groan, he's going to give you an enema. On camera no less.\n\nYou're wrong about that at first, because he heads back to the table and sets down the portable camera, then starts to browse the table with the punishment implements. You watch in alarm as he picks up a stiff, rigid cane and then wanders back to you.\n\nHorrified, you watch him stand to your side and then slowly trace a finger down your thigh. You shudder, he's going to beat you now, and this is going to hurt.\n\n'What do you think Addison? Six strokes each thigh?'\n\n'NRRGTSSGG!' You plead.\n\n'What? Ten? All right Addison, if that's what you want.' He says with a smile. \n\nHe leans over to you and whispers in your ear.\n\n'You silly whore Addison, wouldn't you rather be cuddling on the couch right now?'\n\nYou frantically shake your head yes.\n\n'Ten it is then! What a painslut you are Addison!'\n\n'NGGGHHHH!' You scream.\n\nHe lines the cane up at the top of your left thigh, places the supple wooden striker against your skin, then rears back and slashes it across your thigh. \n\nYou howl, it feels like he just laid a line of fire across your inner thigh. A moment later he places a finger against your skin a few centimetres below the first strike. \n\nYou beg and plead through the ballgag, but it doesn't help as he meticulously lays ten vicious strikes across your thigh until the last one slashes across your vagina as well. It sears you, and you want to tear yourself off this wall and run away. \n\nIt doesn't happen, you can barely even squirm. And as you wiggle and squeak and cry Scott switches sides and then you feel his same measuring finger against the inside of your other, unpunished thigh.\n\nSwish. CRACK. Shriek!\n\nSwish. CRACK. SCREAM.\n\nHe doesn't dawdle, but he measures each strike and when he finishes, you're sporting deep red and purple welts from the back of your knees and almost halfway up your buttocks. You lay stunned against the wall, the pain so mind boggling that you can barely think. \n\nScott examines the welts. He nods his head, satisfied that he delivered on the suffering that he promised you. You groan into the ballgag and plead with your eyes. ",
        "He grins back at you. You put yourself into this predicament, he's just following through.\n\n'Well folks, we beat her, now we need to clean this her out.' He narrates for the camera and then he reaches over and pulls the enema stand to you.\n\nYou squirm, but there's nothing you can do. He fills the bag with what looks to be hot soapy water then attaches a hose to it and what looks like a black penis shaped latex plug. He slathers lube on it, then turns to you and asks you if you know where this goes.\n\nYou clench your sphincter tight. That thing looks uncomfortable, and the fact that he's filming this is worse. \n\nHe chuckles again at your horrified reaction and then leans over and rubs the tip of the plug against your anus. You can feel the delicate, inviolate muscles clench in your most sensitive of flesh. Scott is insistent though, and you squeal through the gag as the plug slowly violates you on film.\n\nIt only takes a moment to penetrate you deeply with the plug, and then a firm tug affirms that you can't expel it. Scott nods and turns a valve on the hose. You immediately feel a warm, almost stinging sensation as the water seeps out of the plug and begins to fill you. You groan loudly as your tummy distends a bit and it starts to ache. \n\nScott watches for a moment and then wanders away and out the door. \n\nYou boggle at that. He just left you chained to a wall as water fills you up. \n\nSlowly, the pressure increases with the heat, and a thin sheen of sweat pops up on your skin. It's torturous holding this, and you desperately want to expel it but you can't. \n\nYou make animal whines constantly. Your discomfort fogs your brain and makes it hard to think. \n\nScott returns abruptly, can of Coke in hand. He sips on it with enthusiasm, and watches you with an evil smile. You glare back at him and plead silently for him to take it out of you.\n\nFinally, he relents and gives the plug a stiff tug. You squeak again as you feel the water and the plug wedged inside you shift, but another tug immediately after pops the plug out of you and water starts to spray out of your bowels.\n\n'NNNGGGGHHHH!' You scream at the sudden rush of relief.\n\nIt takes only two minutes for the full enema to slide out of you. But finally it does, and you're left with a throbbing sensation in your tummy, an impossibly clean feeling in your behind and a deep and humbling sense of embarrassment as the camera just recorded you spraying water and other matter from your anus.\n\nScott turns on the shower head and washes anything that remains behind down the drain. You're still incredibly relieved to not be full of water though, even though it only means that Scott is prepping to do something else to you as well.\n\nYou're unsure what it will be until you see Scott fitting a condom over his fully erect manhood, and then slathering it with lube. \n\nYou know this trick too. Scott told you all about it. \n\nHe already used you once before he chained you to the wall. And while that was quick by his standards, you had to balance on your toes and try not to fall over while he pulled your hair and casually masturbated himself with your vagina.\n\nNow he was sliding a condom on himself and adding lube, which meant he was just going to fuck the shit out of one of your holes. \n\nHe turns to you and confirms it with a smile.\n\n'Are you ready to try something new Addison?' He asks calmly.\n\nYou feel your rectum clench. \n\nScott walks back to you, his manhood bouncing off his stomach and just about reaching his navel. He's hard and thick and pressing against your tiny rosebud.\n\n'NNMMMGGGHHH!' You protest. Surely he can't be intending to sodomize you for hours.\n\nYou feel the tip of his member against your rear orifice and whimper as he starts to push into you. It only takes him a few minutes to slide deep inside you.\n\nYou're horrified. He just took your last virginity from you while you were chained to a wall and bearing marks of the cane. You're equally horrified at what started as a moderately uncomfortable violation of your anus has started to feel good as Scott pumps in and out of you with vigor and purpose. \n\nYou feel an intense clenching sensation travel up your back, slip across your neck and pulse in your groin. Your breathing quickens, you feel yourself becoming ridiculously aroused and about seven minutes after he penetrated you, you have your first anal orgasm. It pulses through your body in waves, and you want to scream in pleasure and hug him to you.\n\nExcept that he's still pumping away, using you aggressively.\n\nIt stays pleasurable for the next couple of orgasms, but after a half an hour of consistent pounding from Scott you start to feel raw.\n\nThen sore.\n\nThen you beg to god to let him finish, because you know full well that if he finally has an orgasm, he's going to consider this a successful session and celebrate for a moment before he moves on to something else. \n\nAfter your anus starts to throb, you take desperate measures, you start to clench your little ring around him tighter, hoping that the increased pressure will help him finish sodomizing you. \n\nTen exhausting, painful minutes later you feel him tense up, and then he grabs your ankle and grunts loudly.\n\n'GRRRRHGGGGHHHH!' he growls in exhaustion and withdraws from you. Sweat dripping from his nose as he does so. And then he casually removes the condom he was using to extend his stamina while he took you anally.\n\nHe holds it up in front of your face, then turns the tube sideways and squeezes all the semen out of the prophylactic and it splatters across your face and starts to drip down your neck.\n\nYou fell mortified. And messy. Mostly messy.\n\nScott looks at you, then picks up the loose camera. He walks back from the table and then crouches down and starts shooting video of your freshly violated anus. \n\n'Take a look at that folks, that is one gaping asshole.' He says with what can only be called a filthy voice. You feel your anus spasm and trying to contract to it's previous size before your hour long encounter with him.\n\nYou lay against the wall, and you realize that Scott kept all his promises to you. He made you suffer, he violated you and he made you embarrassed as he denigrated you with his tongue.\n\nAnd as you watch, he walks back and sets the camera on the table. Then he picks up a towel and wipes the sweat from his face. His chest heaves from pounding away on your behind for an hour.\n\nThen he walks to the door.\n\nHe's leaving?\n\n'HYYYYSCTTT! WHHDDABBDDMIIi?' You yell into the gag\n\nScott turns and looks at you with a smirk. \n\n'Don't worry Addison, I am not done with you yet. I'm gonna watch a little TV and recharge and then we're really going to make you sing.'\n\nScott turns to the door again and puts his finger on the light switch. \n\n'Hang around ok?' He says with a smile, and then he flicks the light switch, plunging the room into darkness.\n\nThe door slams closed and you hand there on the wall, gagged, splayed, welted and violated.\n\nAnd it does look like Scott is just getting started with you.\n\nWhat's next has never felt so terrifying to you.\n\nYou hang there in the darkness for a long time.\n\nYou don't know how long. There's no clock. It's dark and you can barely move.\n\nThe marks from the caning throb and start to burn. Your muscles start to knot up from the ridiculous position he's put you in. And your jaw aches from the ballgag that he had you strap onto your own head.\n\nThis is misery. \n\nWhy did you ask him to do this with you?\n\nYou know why. You had to see him at his darkest. You wanted to know all of him, and he was trying to lock this part away so you couldn't see it. He practically begged you not to do this, but he wouldn't deny it to you. And now that you're here, chained to the wall, dripping with his seed, aching and sweating and afraid, you know that he's only just warming up.\n\nAnd he shot all that video of you. You shudder to yourself. If that ever got online...\n\nDon't even think of that. He wouldn't do that. He just... wouldn't.\n\nAt least, that's what you tell yourself.\n\nSo you wait, and occasionally cry when the misery gets to be too much for you to endure. But mostly you wait.\n\nFinally, you hear him bang on the door and slap the light switch, the lights flicker, then blaze on brightly, and you groan as your retinas scream at you. It takes a moment to adjust to the sudden light, but once you can finally focus your eyes, you see that Scott is turning the cameras back on. He's still naked, but he'd got what looks like a long whip draped over his neck and he's rummaging through a locker and retrieving gear. \n\nHe sets a bottle of lube on the table, followed by a long thick dildo... and then a power drill.\n\nYou blanch at that. What in the hell is he planning?\n\nScott looks over at you with a grim look on his face. \n\n'Welcome to round two. Are you sorry you asked me to do this to yet?'\n\nYou nod sadly, this is not what you hoped for. You somehow imagined that this would be deeper, more intense, more savage. This is not it. This is just pain and misery and degradation and... you feel like you're going to cry again.\n\nYou can't blame him. How can you? He gave you every way out he could imagine.\n\nSo there's only one thing to do. Endure it, and then decide if you want to keep going. He'll have to stop at some point. \n\nWon't he?\n\nAnd more importantly, can you get the slightly aggressive, sort of dominating but incredibly gentle and sensual and just unstoppable sexual animal back? \n\nYou sigh, then there's a loud crack and a line of fire slashes across your thigh and your left breast. You howl into the gag as the pain rules your brain for a moment. When you can open your eyes again, he's standing a few feet away staring at you. The lash hangs loosely from his hand. He flicks it again and another agonizing line of fire traces itself across your stomach and left thigh. \n\nYou gasp and now the tears do come, whether you want them to or not. It's too much. This is not what you wanted and there's no way out. \n\n'WAGG. WAGG!!!' You yowl through the gag.\n\nScott snorts, then steps closer.\n\n'Is there something you want to tell me?' He growls.\n\nYou nod your head frantically. \n\n'Tell me.' He orders.\n\n'Hawavdemoogy?' You ask in all seriousness.\n\nHe furrows his brow. \n\n'Say that again Addie?' He says quietly. \n\nA little voice in the back of your head notes that he just called you Addie. Another voice tells you to ignore that. You need to endure, and hope doesn't help with that.\n\n'Ha wavv demoogy?' You say slowly, the gag impeding your speech.\n\nScott stares at you with a bleak look on his face. Then abruptly he drops the lash and starts fumbling with the straps securing the gag to your face. A moment later he slides the saliva slick ball out of your mouth and he drops it uncaring to the floor.\n\n'Say it again. Please.' He asks with the most intensity you've seen from him.\n\nYou have to flex your jaw to get your mouth to work right, and as you do, he starts to massage your jaw and mandible. You groan at this tiny little mercy, not daring to hope for more.\n\n'How... how was the movie. At the mall. Did you like it?' You ask finally.\n\nScott just stares at you. A look of horror is creeping across his face.\n\n'What?' He sputters finally.\n\n'The movie. Did... did you like it?'\n\n'Yes. It was good. The... the director played a switcheroo and set up a sad ending... but it ended up being a ... happy... one.' He trails off slowly. Then he stops and puts his hands to his face for a moment.\n\n'Well... I'm glad you had a good time. We... we can keep going now.'\n\nScott looks up from his hands with an incredulous look. \n\n'What?' He asks you.\n\n'We can keep going. Thank you for answering my question.' You respond in a resigned tone of voice.\n\nAnd then you close your eyes and open your mouth so that he can slide the ball gag back in. And you wait.\n\nAnd you wait some more.\n\nAnd then you can feel him pulling at the chains that have you locked into this humiliating, ridiculously overexposed position. The lock pops off and clatters to the ground and your ankle suddenly swings forward. You gasp at your seized muscles as they protest this sudden movement and Scott catches your leg and gently, slowly lowers it to the ground. You moan at the pain that the motion brings you; it's intense after what you're certain is at least three hours of immobility after a fairly punishing beating. \n\n'Easy Addie, take it easy. Slowly.' He whispers in your ear. \n\n'What are you doing to me now?' You groan. He sounds like gentle Scott from before, but you know that game is over.\n\n'I'm getting you off this fucking wall Addie, just give me a minute.'\n\nThe chain releases from your other ankle and Scott helps you slowly lower your leg. His hands rub and soothe and try to decrease the throb from your locked up muscles.\n\n'Wait... why are you... why?' Your voice ringing with startled confusion.\n\n'I need you off this wall.' Is all he will say.\n\n'Did I do something wrong?'\n\n'You didn't do anything wrong. At any point.' He says, and you can hear his voice cracking.\n\nThe belt pinning you to the bar is unshackled next and dropped to the floor with a clatter, and then you feel the zip straps pinning your arms to the bar being cut loose and you start to buckle forward. Your legs are so weak from the prolonged chaining that you can't stand by yourself and you start to crumple to the ground. \n\nScott scoops you up and hugs you to him, and then he turns and walks towards the door. On the way to it, he brushes against the video camera and it totters and then slams into the floor with a crunch.\n\n'Your camera!' You murmur, head tucked into his shoulder.\n\n'Fuck the camera.' He says with a surprising amount of intensity. Then he hooks a finger around the door handle and pops it open. He inserts his shoulder between the door and the frame and slides you both outside and into the main apartment again. \n\nHe crosses quickly to the messy bed and lays you gently onto it. He grabs one of the big fluffy blankets that he stows on the bed and wraps you up in it. \n\nYou're terrified this is another mindfuck. He's just cut you down so that he can get you into a calm state and then start brutalizing you again. It's scary how quickly he found your vulnerable spots and exploited them.\n\nScott rubs your back through the blanket and you groan at how sensitive the spots on your legs are from where he beat you. It feels like the skin is savagely welted and incredibly tender.\n\n'Just lay there and rest Addie, I'll be right back.' He whispers into your ear.\n\nYou hear him rummaging around in his cupboards and then he grabs something out of his fridge.\n\nHe sits down on the bed next to you and motions for you to sit up. He holds out his hand and a pair of red tablets lay in his palm. You look at him apprehensively. You've read his stories. Is he drugging you now?\n\n'It's ibuprofen, extra strength Addie. That's all. Please take them.'\n\nHe holds out his hand. You try to pick them up, but your fingers are still numb and clumsy from the prolonged restraint. He sighs and holds the tablets to your mouth.\n\nYou dip your head and let him tip the tablets into your mouth. He cracks a bottle of cold water and holds it to your mouth so that you don't have to dry swallow the pills. Then he continues to hold the bottle of chilled water to your mouth and urges you to swallow.\n\n'Drink please Addie. You need the water right now.'\n\nSo you drink, and try to figure out what just happened. What changed? Why is gentle Scott back and demented sadistic Scott gone now?\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nAbruptly, the tears come. You're just too confused and sore and brutalized to process everything and your body demands release. As soon as you start to shed tears, Scott sets the water aside and then hugs you tight, his hands running up and down your back in a soothing motion as he keeps you wrapped up in the warm blanket.\n\n'What... what just happened? I don't know what happened.' You finally manage to get out between intense sobs.\n\n'That makes two of us.' Scott says morosely.\n\nAnd despite the tears on your face, and the aches and pains streaking through your body, you smile. \n\nThis isn't a game, or a mindfuck or anything else. This is Scott trying to soothe you and process something himself. \n\nTime passes, you let it all go, releasing all of the fear and pain and grief that he poured into you. You legs and behind still hurt, but he holds you and runs his hand up and down your back and through your hair. He soothes you, and the water and the aspirin and his gentle touches bring solace to you slowly. \n\nEventually, you're just spent, and you lean into him fighting sudden exhaustion. He hugs you and lays you down on the bed with surprising delicacy. \n\nAnd he holds up your head so that he can slide the pillow underneath.\n\nYou smile a faint smile, but you don't even have the energy to open your eyes right now. You just let him take care of you.\n\nThe blanket slides away from your legs and you groan at the intrusion of the cool air on your naked skin. Scott runs his hands carefully down your legs, his fingers carefully tracing the punishment that he inflicted on you. You wince and let out little moans as he does so.\n\nHe leaves the bed for a moment and you hear him rummaging in another cupboard. He returns to the bed quickly and then he starts massaging a cream into your welts and bruises. You groan openly as the cold cream stings for a moment and then numbs the pain.\n\nHe's thorough, he massages every bit of your legs carefully, and then his hands are between your legs as well. Not sexually, but just to rub the cream into the areas that he punished.\n\nEven now, as savaged and exhausted as you are, you feel yourself responding to his touch. You stifle a moan, not wanting to start something you're unsure you can finish.\n\nHe carefully applies the cream to any part of your body that he feels he punished. As he rubs it into the welt on your breast you without thinking reach up and clasp his hand over your aching flesh and hold it there. He stops and then slides in beside you. He cuddles you tightly. His hand gently cups you. His warmth seeps out of him and into you.\n\n'Why did you stop?'\n\n'I don't know. I had to.' He says after an awkward pause.\n\n'You didn't have to do anything.'\n\n'I know.'\n\n'I was ready to go as far as you wanted to. I was. You were scaring the ... I was just really scared but I wanted to keep going.'\n\n'I know.'\n\n'So what happened?'\n\n'I... I just... I wanted to stop. I was done.'\n\nYou squeeze your hand over his, forcing him to grip you tighter. He obliges and begins to softly palpate your nipple and aureole. You sigh contentedly, this is what feels good.\n\nWell, almost. \n\n'No you weren't. You had the whip and the lube and the ... dildo and that... ' You remember and suddenly you feel a chill. He had a power drill on the table.\n\nYou shudder.\n\n'What's wrong?'\n\n'What were you going to do... with ... what was that tool doing on the table?' You ask, afraid to hear the answer.\n\n'Oh. I was going to connect it to the dildo and lube you up real good and then work you with the dildo until you felt like your brain was going to melt.'\n\nYou slowly turn your head and stare at him with wide eyes.\n\n'You cannot be serious.'\n\n'I am serious.'\n\n'Where did you... how did you even come up with that?' You ask in disbelief.\n\n'Addie, it's all over the net. You just have to look for it.'\n\nYou shudder. You just about got to experience that when...\n\nWhen what exactly?\n\n'Why did you stop? I... you were just... so angry with me. I didn't understand what I did wrong.'\n\n'I wasn't angry with you Addie. You wanted me to show you how far I could go. I showed you.'\n\n'But you stopped.'",
        "'Yeah.'\n\n'Why? What changed?'\n\nHe takes a deep breath, struggling to find words for what he needs to say. Frustration spills into his face and he just agonizes over what to say.\n\n'You did. You just... shut me down.'\n\n'No I didn't. I was ready to keep going. I knew it was really going to hurt and I wanted you to keep going until you were satisfied.'\n\n'You did Addie. You really did.'\n\n'How? What did I do?'\n\n'You asked me about the movie. You wanted to know how it was and if I enjoyed it.'\n\n'So because I asked you about the movie you stopped?'\n\n'No... because you wanted to know if I had a good time. And then you wanted to keep going.'\n\n'That makes no sense whatsoever.'\n\n'Addie... you asked me about that, and then you just opened your mouth and waited for me to gag you and start up on you again. And then it all just evaporated.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'I just didn't want to hurt you anymore. I wanted you off that wall... right then and there.'\n\n'You know you broke your camera, right?'\n\n'You know the camera doesn't work right?'\n\nYou sigh, relieved. Then you turn and whack him on the shoulder. \n\n'God you were freaking me out with that. I was terrified I was going to end up on the internet!'\n\n'Addie... I'm a sadistic, twisted, perverted son of a bitch. But I will never, ever do something like that to you.' He says with all sincerity.\n\n'Hey now,' You turn and purr into his ear. 'I wouldn't call you a son of a bitch.'\n\nHe smiles. Then he reaches up and puts his hands to your face and pulls you in for a kiss. You turn over completely and pull yourself on top of him. \n\nIt's not your best idea. The ibuprofen has numbed the pain but you're still pretty tenderized from playing with Scott earlier. What was supposed to be a kiss turns into Scott trying to support you delicately while you groan.\n\n'Hold still.' He whispers in your ear, and he gently lifts you up and stands and then heads towards the bathroom. You cringe at the site of the room where you suffered at his hands but he doesn't head into that door, he just nudges open the door to the men's room and carries you to the bench. You groan under your breath as he sets you on the bench, your behind and thighs complain loudly to you.\n\nScott nabs a couple more fluffy towels and then he grabs a blue bottle and what looks like a shower poof. You raise your eyebrow as he sets them on the bench next to you. He moves to the shower and starts up the water. He measures the temperature with his skin, and when he's satisfied he turns to you and offers his hand.\n\nYour muscles are still very unhappy with you, and they complain loudly as you stand. You groan as Scott helps you up and brings you into the shower and lets the hot water and steam massage and provide succour to your throbbing body.\n\nYou whimper and then you feel his hands on you. His grip is firm and he starts with your head and works down. First he runs his hands through your hair, gently pulling the strands away from your scalp and seeming to release a chunk of tension with each strand of hair he tugs on. His hands drift down to your jaw and he massages your mandibles with fingertips, applying just enough pressure to feel good and stretch out your muscles.\n\nYou feel like you're melting. You lean back into him and let him carry your weight. \n\nHe continues to massage your body under the water, his grip drifts down your neck and across your shoulders, and then he moves your forward and gets you to brace yourself against the wall so that he can massage your back. His fingers meticulously work down your spine and seek and destroy knots and tension. You gasp and arch your back as he works on you and you feel your buttocks brush against him.\n\nHe's engorged and hard. Rubbing you down and pressing against you in the shower has had an obvious reaction.\n\nWithout thinking, you bend at the waist and shift your legs open for him.\n\n'Really?' He asks you.\n\n'Really.' You reply with just a hint of lust.\n\n'All right.' He says. His hand slides around your hip and he pulls you to him. A moment later you feel the tip of his erection pressing against you. You shift your hips, open yourself to him and then he slowly begins sliding inside you. \n\nYou press your forehead to the wall of the shower and brace yourself as you savour the sensation of him filling you completely.\n\nFinally, he's inside you as deep as he can manage, and you concentrate on just... being. You feel him inside you, pressing firmly against you and your sex, his scrotum draped across your little bud. You feel the persistent stinging from the welts on your thighs, and the water dripping down your skin, sliding down your chest and dripping off your nipples and down between your legs.\n\nYou feel his hand holding you firmly in place, and then he reaches forward and slowly grips your hair, pulling your head back.\n\nYou ease up off the wall and lean back into him again, throwing your weight back against him fully. He shifts his footing, but doesn't move an inch otherwise. Your body increases the angle of penetration and forces him firmly inside you and against your clitoris. \n\nYou draw air between your teeth with a hiss. His hands start exploring your body aggressively. One hand cups your breast firmly and the other dips down between your legs and starts to manipulate you from a different direction.\n\nThis is beyond lust. There's pain from the earlier play and the aftermath of the earlier stimulation and the sheer sensation of him over stimulating you from both inside and out. It builds up in you like pressure and you tilt your head back onto his shoulder and pant.\n\nThe water blasts down into your face, he pumps into you, gropes you, works you with his fingers and grips you with his hand. \n\nThe first orgasm comes so suddenly that you can't even brace for it. It just explodes out you with a shriek as you fling back your arms and grip his hair.\n\nHe does what he always does, and he picks up the tempo. Thrusts become faster, harder, more aggressive, his hands grip you firmly and he slides his other hand up from your vagina and grips your other breast. \n\nWithout thinking, you slide your hand back and encourage him to grip you harder, he responds and you gasp as he sinks his fingers deep into the tender flesh.\n\nHe keeps thrusting, faster, ever faster and you feel his hands shift from mauling your bosom to a firm grip on your nipples. You know what's coming and you want it. The fingers grip tightly and twist hard, and the pain is the perfect counterpoint to the relentless pounding of his flesh into you. \n\nYou come hard yet again, whining and holding onto him, but as you spasm your foot slips and knocks his leg on the slippery floor of the shower and you both fall back wards into the shallow pool of water with a thud.\n\n'Dammit. I need to put some bloody no stick pads in this thing.' He mutters.\n\nYou lay limply on top of him, his manhood still half inside you and your breast still gripped firmly by him.\n\nAbruptly, you sit up, then carefully lift your leg and spin with him still deep inside you. That sensation alone nearly paralyzes you for a moment as you feel him twisting inside you. You wheeze out an animal whine quietly and then you finally shift into position on top of him. \n\nYou place your hands on his sternum as he stares up at you then you slowly lower yourself down until you're resting your head on his chest just under his chin.\n\nHe leans his head back and wraps his arms around you.\n\nYou lay there for a while, joined at the hip, words not required. The water keeps pounding down and keeps you both warm.\n\nExhaustion claims you for a little while. The day has taken its toll. Scott let's you lay there until the water starts to turn chilly before he finally rouses you from your fatigued slumber.\n\nHe helps you back to your feet and turns off the water. Then he gets a fluffy towel for you to wrap yourself in. You dry your hair and rub down your skin with the soft towel and generally just malinger quietly in the shower. \n\nAs you move towards the door, you catch your image in the mirror. The welts are turning into ugly little uniform bruises running down your legs. Where his hands were gripping and crushing your breasts dark purple bruises linger.\n\nYou stand and stare. You should feel traumatized, horrified. \n\nYou don't. You feel something else.\n\nScott walks up behind you and admires your flesh in the mirror as well. He snakes a hand around your belly and drags his lips around your neck. You feel him still erect against you and realize that you once again did not feel him finish inside you. You also know that it's not that important to him.\n\nBut as he wraps his arms around you and you gaze at the mirror, you know what the feeling is.\n\nYou feel owned. Wanted. Adored.\n\nAnd you like that feeling.\n\nYou stand like that in front of the mirror for a while, and just stare at the two of you. His arms snug around you, his lips nuzzling your neck. His beard is getting rough and it abrades your skin. \n\nYou don't mind that at all either.\n\nYou run your hands up across your chest and rub your own shoulder. Your fingertips brush across the sensitive little bruises that his fingers left on you. You like those bruises, despite the discomfort. It's like you can still feel his hands there, squeezing and taking and pinching.\n\nYou like the fact that he left his mark on you. You want him to leave more. \n\nIt would be nice if they hurt a little less when he left them. Maybe. Maybe not. Would they mean less if he just left a hickey?\n\nHe brushes up against your leg, still mostly erect. You shake your head. How does one man, one forty year old man no less consistently do this? You've had twenty years olds that could barely last ten minutes. He shrugs off an hour or two like it was nothing. He's never quick. It drives you crazy that sometimes he never gets off.\n\nYou like it when he gets off. On you. In you. It feels so satisfying.\n\n'Do you still want to... hurt me?' You ask, a little afraid of the answer.\n\n'A little bit. Not like before.' He whispers into your ear. \n\n'Define a little bit.' You ask.\n\nHe smiles, cups your breast roughly, starts to squeeze. You hiss as you suck air through your teeth, then you say something that surprises you both.\n\n'More.' You say with a groan.\n\nScott raises an eyebrow, then whispers in your ear.\n\n'Are you sure?'\n\n'Yes. Harder. Please.' \n\nHis grip intensifies, pulls at the sensitive flesh. You gasp and start to involuntarily rise up on your toes. Your hand flutters, reaches behind you and finds him, now hard and full and rigid. Your fingers wrap around him and gently stroke him as you whine at the pressure he increases on your girls. \n\nYou stand locked like that for a moment in time, you struggling to give him pleasure while he carefully gauges just the right amount of pain for you. You arm aches at the awkward angle, and your teats start to throb at the pressure. \n\nThere will definitely be more bruising now. At least you hope so.\n\nYou tilt your head back on his shoulder, surrendering to it, wanting it. You gasp at the pain and something else that's building in you that you can't even define. Your hand pulls him closer to you, between your cheeks, to the spot that he cleaned and used so harshly. \n\nHe doesn't hesitate, and lets you guide him inside you. You gasp as he slides into the still slick entrance, and as he fully penetrates you a wave of intense pleasure roars out of your pelvis and rocks your body. You shriek as it consumes you fully for a moment and leaves you shuddering, tears leaking out of your eyes.\n\n'Uh... wow.' He whispers in your ear.\n\n'Blrgh... gahh...' You mutter, momentarily robbed of speech.\n\nHe just nuzzles your neck, kisses away a tear forged from pleasure.\n\n'Don't... stop. Don't you... stop. Finish. I need you to... finish. Please.' You manage to beg him while panting.\n\nHe doesn't say anything, and just nuzzles your neck but you feel him start to slide in and out of you again. You tilt your head forward and see yourself in the mirror.\n\nYou barely recognize yourself, your delicate, pale skin is welted and bruised. Your long hair is tangled, wild, unruly and messy. Tears of pleasure stream down your face and his hands squeeze and twist your breasts and nipples. Your sex glistens with your own lust, and your own hand drifts between your legs to manipulate your own flesh and jack your pleasure up to another level. \n\nHe continues thrusting into you, but with caution. He knows you still feel delicate back there and while you wish he would pound away with abandon, you're certain you would regret that later. \n\nBesides, this still feels forbidden, or at least it feels forbidden when you're not paralyzed by climaxes so intense it feels almost like a seizure. \n\nYou just let everything go and ride it for a while. Your fingers and his hands and his member build orgasm after orgasm in you and your body convulses with each one. \n\nFinally, after what feels like forever, you feel him start to stiffen. You squeeze tighter around him and abruptly he grabs your hair and shoves into you fully and hard. \n\nYou gasp, feel him impale you fully and seconds later feel him release inside your bowel. \n\nHe's hot, and wet, and you feel dirty and violated and thankful at the same time. Sweat literally drips from you both at the end of this frantic, intense coupling. \n\nYou slump forward, exhausted. You arms rest on the counter. Your forehead drops onto your forearms with a limp splat. \n\nYou can't stop gasping for air. You make a superhuman effort to lift your head and see him behind you, eyes still closed, still inside you. Sweat trickles down his own pale skin, and his chest heaves like he just finished running.\n\nHow long were you two like this?\n\nYou feel Scott start to withdraw from you, and you can't help but whimper as he slides out of you. You feel raw back there, slippery and impossibly open. Your anus spasms. This level of penetration and raw powerful sex is a new thing that your body has not quite adapted to. \n\nScott gasps in air and then finally speaks.\n\n'We... we really do... have the best showers... ever.'\n\nThere's a moment of silence and suddenly you cannot stop laughing. It's true, you've had more sex in this room than you have in his bed. Your throat is raw from all the screaming, but you can't help yourself, you need to let this out.\n\nFinally, Scott runs his hands up your back and grasps your hair. He gently tugs on it and you reluctantly stand back up and lean against him. \n\nThe mirror displays you both, slick with sweat, panting and spent. Scott slides his arm around your ribcage and cups your teat firmly. \n\nYou can feel his seed sliding out of you, slipping through your still violated rosebud. Tiny little drops of his pleasure start to leak down your leg. Your nipples and breasts throb from the abuse you practically begged him for and it's starting to be difficult to see pale skin among the many bruises on your sensitive globes.\n\nYou look trashy, used, like a well fucked porn actress.\n\nYou'd feel terrible if you hadn't secretly longed for this for so long. \n\n'What are you?' You murmur.\n\n'What do you mean?' He responds quietly, his own chest still heaving.\n\n'How do you get me to do these things? Nobody ever even... touched me there before and I can't wait for you to take it. You bruise me and welt me and I can't stop staring at your marks. You're hard as a rock and you never seem to finish... I have to beg YOU to finish and you know how to get more pleasure from my body than I do.'\n\nHe just looks at you over your shoulder and gently massages the breast in his hand.\n\n'What the fuck are you?'\n\n'I'm just... just a guy Addie. There's nothing special about me. Really.'\n\nYou shake your head with frustration. You don't know if this is mock humility or if he believes it. \n\n'Liar.' You whisper. \n\nHe shrugs and gives you an odd little smile. \n\n'Come on, we should clean off.' He pauses for a moment. 'Again.' He says with a wry smirk.\n\nYou nod and let him lead you back to the shower, stealing one last look at the very defiled, bruised, battered and supremely sated woman in the mirror. She smiles back at you.\n\nHe washes you again, and this time it's just gentle cleansing with no sex. You don't think even he could manage to start another round of coupling at this point. He takes the poof and lathers it up and gently clears all the sweat and grime from your skin. You groan as he washes your chest, the bruising seemingly getting tenderer by the second.\n\nHe's thorough, and the poof slides down your back and between your legs and you're surprised at how completely raw and battered you feel. Sex with this man is like wrestling with an alligator it seems. He finds ways to tenderize areas you didn't even know you had.\n\nStill, his hands are gentle, and he cares about what happens to you. It's enough. More than enough really.\n\nAfter he finishes washing you, you rest on the bench and watch him shower. \n\nHe doesn't look like a rampaging sex machine. His hair is thinning, his midsection is thick and his skin has a pallor that is only worn by people that deliberately avoid the sun. Even his hairstyle is short and unaffected. He barely uses any products at all except when his hair is so unruly he concedes defeat by plastering it flat.\n\nHe's the antithesis of everything you dreamed of.\n\nHe's also everything you want.\n\nYou could watch him shower like this for hours. He's so unconcerned with appearances that it's almost comical.\n\nFinally, for the second time this evening, he turns off the water and gets you both a pair of towels to dry off with. This time you carefully brush out your hair and then tie it into a tight braid, the towel tucked around your torso and keeping you covered while you do so.\n\nScott disappears out of the washroom for a moment, then returns with a fluffy, overly large pair of men's pyjamas for you.\n\nHe hands you the warm sleepwear and you grin at him. \n\n'I can't. I should really get home. We both have to work tomorrow.'\n\n'You should take a sick day Addie.'\n\n'Why?' You ask seriously.\n\n'You... are going to be sore tomorrow. Seriously sore.' Scott responds honestly.\n\n'Oh.' You hadn't thought of that.\n\n'Stay the night, call in during the morning and get some sleep. I'm going to focus on not touching you for a bit.'\n\n'But I like it when you touch me!'\n\n'I don't mean like that, I mean like touching you touching you.' And he sets a hand on your thigh and slides it up between your legs. You gasp as his finger slides inside your still slick opening with next to no resistance.\n\n'I... am not sure how I feel about that.' You murmur as you waffle between wanting him to continue and agonizing over how drained you feel.\n\n'I know.' He says and he slides his finger out of you, accompanied by the little squeal you emit. He raises his finger to your lips and you take his finger in without thought, your tongue cleansing the salty sweetness of your own sex from his skin. \n\n'Will you stay with me if I call in sick?' You ask dreamily, already imagining yet another day of frantic, intense, punishing coupling.\n\n'Of course I will. You think I'm going to miss a chance to play hooky with you?' He says with a smile.\n\n'I'd like that.' \n\nYou stand and slip the towel off your torso, revealing yourself to him fully and then you slowly slip into the warm flannel pyjama top he brought you. You take a look at the pants, but the waist is built for him and won't even attempt to stay on your waist.\n\nYou sigh, and hand him back the pants. \n\n'Looks like I'll have to be half naked.'\n\n'Not something I'm likely to complain about.' He says with a smile as he slides into the pants himself.\n\nScott tosses the multitude of damp towels into the hamper and then takes your hand and leads you out to the comfy couch. He browses channels until he finds a mindless comedy for you both to watch and then he orders vegetarian Chinese food for you both again. ",
        "The food arrives, and you snuggle up on the couch with him and eat saut\u00e9ed vegetables and fried rice with a sweet and sour sauce. Scott keeps getting you to drink water, which would be annoying if you weren't finding yourself ravenously thirsty. \n\nYou watch the movie wrapped in one of his warm blankets and snuggled up against him.\n\nIt's not a particularly well written film, and sleep claims you quickly, which is probably what he had in mind. You feel him lift you off the couch and carry you to the bed then set you down and tuck you under the covers. It's blissful, but doesn't feel quite right. \n\nMoments later you feel him shake your shoulder and he gets you to sit up so you can take another pair of extra strength ibuprofen and some more water.\n\nYou toss back the pills and take a long pull of the water and hand it back to him. He turns and takes the glass back to the sink, and as you watch him you make a quick decision and pull the pyjama top up and over your head and toss it to the floor. \n\nHe turns back from the kitchen and spies you reclining on the bed, then shakes his head. \n\n'Addie... we really need to give your body a rest now.'\n\n'Then get over here and cuddle up. I want to feel your skin against me.' And in me, you think to yourself.\n\nHe nods and then slides off the pyjama bottoms he had been wearing and settles into the bed next to you. You turn and face him, then slowly slide a leg over him and then slide on top of him.\n\n'Addie, come on!' He protests.\n\n'Shush Scott. You want me to sleep, yes?'\n\n'Yes. You need rest.'\n\n'Well, I'll relax better with you inside me.'\n\nHe sighs. You slip a hand down and massage him, your fingernails tracing over his skin and tickling the head of his manhood. He responds like he always does, and his little monster stirs to life. It takes only minutes of gentle manipulation to bring him fully erect and hard and then you calmly hold yourself open and then guide him inside you. Your hips slide down his pelvis until you're both pressed directly against his groin and he's buried deep inside you.\n\nYou freeze like that for a moment and revel in it. This man, this strange, twisted chubby little man, he satisfies you. He more than satisfies you.\n\nYou'd tell him how you feel, but you're afraid this is just passion and lust and if you say that word too soon you're afraid he might run. \n\nSo you stay silent, and bite your lip, and try not to buck and start something that will just lead to more sweat and exhaustion. Because at this moment, you just want him inside you and nothing more.\n\nAnd as impossible as it is, he doesn't push for it either. He's just content to stay inside you and not use you for pleasure. He knows you're looking for something else a little more delicate right now, and he's trying not to ruin it.\n\nYou gently lean forward, your breathing deep and controlled and slowly rest your head on his chest. He wraps an arm around you and slowly pulls the blanket over you both with his free hand, removing the chill from your skin and making this intimate moment even moreso.\n\nIf you could freeze any one moment and keep it forever, this would probably be it. His body is warm, almost hot, and his flabby body surprisingly makes for an excellent pillow.\n\nYou drift, sort of conscious and kind of dreaming at the same time. \n\nFinally, to fight off the urge to say that word, you shake yourself out of your haze for a moment and twist your head up and place your mouth on his own. \n\nIt's a tender kiss, and you both say things to each other that words are not required for. \n\nAnd after you finish this quiet discussion that uses no words, you lay your head on his chest and let sleep take you.\n\nWhen the dreams come, they are odd, strange things. But you still feel safe, because you can feel him holding you, inside you, underneath you even while you sleep.\n\nAnd that feels right.\n\nLike a relentless force, the sun slowly attacks your slumber. First it starts to creep into the windows, and sneaks across the floor. Slowly, deviously it stalks you as you lie in bed wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets. \n\nIt waits and shifts in place for you to show a moment of weakness and vulnerability. And just when you think you're going to sleep forever, it attacks and sunlight splashes across your eyelids.\n\nYou groan and snuggle into the pillows, waging a mighty war with consciousness. Your struggle is valiant, but it's a relentless opponent and finally, your eyelids crack open and you look around.\n\nFirst of all, you're no longer on top of Scott and he's not inside you. \n\nThat's not surprising. It couldn't have been that comfortable trying to sleep with you draped overtop of him. Nor was it feasible to maintain an erection for eight hours while sleeping... even for him. \n\nBut the fact that he slid you off of him gently without waking you and disengaged himself from the bed is interesting. Where is he?\n\nYou slowly sit up, then gasp. Everything aches or throbs when you move. Your stomach feels like you spent a day at the gym doing crunches. The welts on your thighs have turned to bruises and they complain loudly about every move you make. And your chest looks like... bruised fruit. Deep purple and green spots cover your ivory skin and all the twisting and pinching has left your nipples incredibly sensitive.\n\nYou groan and gently lay back down, afraid to rub against the sheets. Or move. Or breathe.\n\nAs you do that, you hear tapping. \n\nIs he on the computer again?\n\nCautiously, wary of starting another argument with your body that you know you won't win, you look over at his bench. He sits in a pair of cotton sleep pants and studies a screen intently. Numbers scroll by in a little window and he taps a couple of commands rapidly into a second command line prompt.\n\nYou watch him for a moment. You like computers, but you probably know more about your car than how computers and the internet really work. Scott treats computers almost like some sort of arcane art form. He runs music through his stereo from his phone via voice command. He digs up arcane information in minutes and runs servers in other cities through black screens of text.\n\nThe chubby little nerd has some skills, you have to admit that. \n\nYou watch him for a moment, then remember that you needed to call into work and let them know that you weren't feeling well. You lurch up out of bed and then freeze as your body yells at you for moving at all.\n\nGood Christ, you certainly like getting and wearing his marks, but this is going to take some time to get used to. You remember him firmly insisting you to take the ibuprofen yesterday and keeping you hydrated and you shudder to think how you would feel if he hadn't bothered with that.\n\nYou limp over to your pile of clothing on the floor and retrieve your purse from the bag it had been stuffed into when you both returned from the mall. Your cell phone is out and in your hand as soon as you dig it out and you call into HR to let them know you need a personal day. \n\nAs you leave the message, you imagine that between your shredded vocal chords and intermittent groans that at least you'll sound authentically ill.\n\nThe message left, you stand there for a moment. Sore and cold, you place a hand on the counter and lean against it for a moment, focusing on your breathing.\n\nYou just feel sore. You've done yoga and pilates and felt a little tender the next day, but this is far worse. Your flesh just feels savaged, and you still feel exhausted after a deep and almost dreamless sleep.\n\nIf it hadn't felt fantastic you'd be really pissed at him. \n\nYou hear him slide the chair back and walk towards you. You'd like to look up and smile at him, but you can't find the energy.\n\n'Holy shit Addie! Are you all right?' He asks as he eyes your battered body. His hands slip over your shoulders and start to knead the flesh.\n\n'M'better now...' You murmur.\n\n'Hang on, let's get some more ibuprofen into you and some more liquids.'\n\n'Sounds fantastic.' You say with less enthusiasm. The hands on your shoulders felt great.\n\nScott pulls open the fridge and pulls out a small bag of oranges. He grabs a manual juicer out a cupboard door, then grabs a large French knife out of a drawer and proceeds to cut the oranges in half. You watch with interest as he quickly crushes the flesh of the oranges on the metal rims of the juicer and then extracts the juice into a glass for you.\n\nTwo things spring to mind. \n\nFirst, you've never had anyone go to the effort to get you fresh squeezed orange juice, let alone do it themselves. (And judging by the amount of effort Scott is putting into this, it's a pain in the ass to do this manually.)\n\nTwo, you can identify with those oranges. You rub your chest and groan and wonder if he might have been more delicate with the fruit on the table as opposed to the globes on your chest.\n\nHe finishes up the last of the oranges and pours the liquid into a tall glass, then sets it on the counter for a minute so he can rummage in his fridge freezer. A moment later he tops up the glass with ice cubes, grabs the anti-inflammatory in his other hand and brings it to you.\n\nThe pills are small and coated, and they vanish down your throat with a gulp of the fresh orange juice. It's impossibly sweet and just delicious. And Scott pulls up a chair for you to rest on while you savor it and he cleans up the mess. \n\nIt doesn't take him long and you watch him putter around his little kitchenette cleaning it up. The board and juicer go into the dishwasher but he manually cleans the knife under hot water and then dries it and puts it away.\n\nHe sees you eyeing him and smiles.\n\n'Gotta take care of my knives.'\n\n'Are they expensive knives?' You ask, genuinely curious.\n\n'Not really, they just work better when you take care of them, clean them and sharpen them.'\n\nYou rest your face in your palms and watch him. He's kind of adorable. \n\nDammit, you're getting aroused again.\n\nYou shift on the chair, clasping your legs together. A little groan escapes your lips. Scott smiles and walks around behind you. His hands are hot on your shoulders a second later and he's rubbing and kneading them gently.\n\nDammit! You don't think you can take another Olympic level sexual marathon. And yet here you are, groaning and squirming under his fingers.\n\nYou sit there quietly and try to meditate. His touch makes it difficult. His fingers are gentle and deft and he slowly draws the ache out of your shoulders and back. His hands slide down to your lower back and your resolve slowly crumbles to dust. \n\nYou grasp the ice cold orange juice, and pour the last of the absurdly sweet juice down your throat. It's cold, delicious and the sensation of the near freezing, sweet liquid sliding down into your stomach is ridiculously glorious.\n\nIt isn't enough however.\n\nSlowly, you turn around on the stool and face him. He raises and eyebrow, and in return you slowly part your legs wide, revealing your glistening sex waiting for him. You pull his hands to your breasts and you feel your nostrils flare and breathing pick up as he touches you.\n\n'Addie. We shouldn't.'\n\n'Why not?' You whisper back huskily. Fuck restraint. You want him now.\n\nHe leans in, nuzzles your ear gently. His hands carefully massage your breasts. The bruises ache as he touches them. You don't care. Every ache comes with a little memory and each memory is a little delight to recall. \n\nYou can't stop gasping for air. You make a superhuman effort to lift your head and see him behind you, eyes still closed, still inside you. Sweat trickles down his own pale skin, and his chest heaves like he just finished running.\n\n'You need rest girl.'\n\nYou shiver when he calls you girl. It makes you want to do things for him and to him. He knows it too. Sometimes he whispers it in your ear right in the middle of taking your body again and again and again in the most delightful form of conditioning you have ever experienced.\n\n'We could rest together. After. If we were gentle...' You ask in a little girl's voice, almost like you are asking for a cookie. A very naughty cookie.\n\n'Addie, we're a lot of things, but we are not gentle with each other.' He whispers back.\n\n'No, we aren't.' You acknowledge, you lack of argument surprising you.\n\n'And even if we could be gentle, would you want me to be?'\n\n'No.', You whisper, again with a certainty that surprises you.\n\n'Go back to bed girl. I have to do some work, then we'll go out and find something to distract you. Ok?'\n\n'Scott... I ... Scott...' You're whining. Why are you whining?\n\n'Girl. Listen to me. Get of the chair. Go lay down in the comfy bed. Nap for a little while.' He leans over and whispers into your ear. His hand slips down between your legs and he slides a finger inside you. You inhale and press into him, hopeful that this is just the start.\n\n'If you're a good girl, daddy will give you a treat.' Another finger slides inside you. You shudder at the sensation and try to spread your legs wider for him.\n\n'What if I'm not a good girl?' You whisper back.\n\n'Then, Addison, we can go back into the ladies room until I am convinced that you will be a good girl.' He says firmly.\n\nYou freeze, uncertain for a moment. You don't want to go back into that room with him. Yet you do want to go back in there with him. He let's out his darkness in that room. And you want him to let it go. \n\nHe was terrifying in that room. He hurt you and scared you and did things to you that you are almost terrified to remember. But you also remember your heart pounding and your blood rushing and the brutally intimate moment you shared after he chained you to that wall.\n\nYou suck on your lower lip. You're afraid you have no limits with this man. Worse, you're afraid that you don't want him to have any limits either.\n\nYou hesitate as long as you can, knowing that the moment you make your decision, he's going to send you back to the warm comfy bed and go back to work. \n\n'How long do you have to work?' You whisper in his ear.\n\n'Just an hour or so. I have to synchronize some sequel servers on the west coast, that's all. One database is a little corrupted so it's taking longer than I thought.' His index finger twitches inside you, you unconsciously squeeze it in return.\n\n'I'll be a good little girl.' You whisper back, despite your fervent desire to be bad. He does have work to do. Everything still hurts. You're certain you'll have more fun with a treat than if you go back in that room.\n\nLiar, you think to yourself.\n\nScott smiles and slowly withdraws his fingers from you, deliberately dragging them across your clitoris. You gasp as he does so, and he takes advantage of your open mouth to insert the same fingers.\n\nYou refuse to break his gaze as you clean your own juices from him. You make promises with your tongue that you will keep as soon as he gives you an opportunity.\n\nHis hands grip your hip and he slides you off the chair and you press into him. All aches and pains are now forgotten. You want him. You want him inside you all the time. It's been so long since any man made you feel like this. And it's never felt this intense.\n\n'Bed Girl. Now.' He says in your ear, firmly but not unkindly. \n\nReluctantly, you pull away from him. He has to work. Then you get a treat. \n\nAs you slide back under the covers and artfully obscure some but not all of your body to him, you think one thing.\n\nYou really like treats.\n\nThe dream sneaks up on you like it always does.\n\nYou've never discussed it with Scott. You chatted about it once with him, and he knows, but he never knew the exact details.\n\nYou sneak home early from work. You're excited. There's planning to do, and the invitations need to get done and you need to set that appointment with the wedding planner... although you are sorely tempted to just do it all yourself. \n\nBrad's jacket is on the hook, his boots are by the door. He's home too! You giggle with glee. Maybe you can slip a little private time in with him before you really get cracking.\n\nQuietly, you sneak up the stairs, hoping that you can surprise him.\n\nYou hear him first. He's gasping for air. \n\nWhy is he doing that? Is he exercising? Is he hurt? \n\nWhy do you hear a woman moaning?\n\nYour stomach twists. He couldn't possibly be doing that. Not here. Not in your own bed.\n\nQuietly, you push the door open and neither of them notices you standing there, stunned silent as he thrusts away into her.\n\nYou can't remember her face. Does it matter? \n\nYour mouth tastes of copper. Your teeth have bitten down on your lip so hard the skin has broken.\n\nHe turns to look at you and smiles?\n\n'What's wrong Addison?' He says calmly.\n\nHow could he? Who is she? Does he even care that you just changed the sheets for fresh sheet Sunday? \n\nDoes he care that he just shattered every mote of you?\n\n'What's wrong Addie?' Someone else says.\n\nAnd you struggle with it. You hate the dream, but you don't want to leave it. You loved him, the bastard. You think at times you still love him, but how can you love anyone that cares so little for you?\n\nSomeone shakes your shoulder. \n\nDisoriented, you open your eyes slowly. \n\nScott leans over you, concern on his face. \n\n'Hey kiddo. Are you ok?' \n\nYou try to talk but you can't work your mouth yet. The blanket is tangled around you and hot and your skin is slick with sweat. \n\nHe reaches out with his hand to stroke your hair and instinctively you bat his hand away. Abruptly you flail about, feeling constrained by the blankets and your own messy hair. \n\nScott recoils slightly, surprised by your response and then he pulls the blankets away from you so you can squirm free. Abruptly you rip yourself out of the snugly cocoon and roll away from him until you smack into the wall. You scuttle yourself back into the corner and just hug your knees to your chest then bury your chin in your chest. You refuse to cry, but your chest heaves and you let one little whimper creep out.\n\nThat fuck. That bastard. That son of a bitch. Why? Why did he have to do that to you?\n\nWhy did you have to see it? Did he want you to see it? Was he just that... stupid?\n\n'Uh... ok. I'm going to assume that was a bad dream.' Scott says quietly.\n\nYou just nod your head.\n\n'I'm sorry.' You say, and hope he'll let it go. It's embarrassing and painful and you hate the fact that this stupid piece of mental scar tissue has intruded on this moment when you actually have felt happy in what feels like a very long time.\n\nYou both sit still for a moment, Scott confused and you embarrassed. Then he slowly sides over the bed. He reaches out to touch your foot. \n\nYou curl it away from him. You're still embarrassed, you still see... Brad obliterating everything you thought you knew. Leaving a hole in you.\n\nIt's never fun watching your whole life become ashes. It leaves a mark.\n\nYou look up at Scott, his face is filled with concern, and for once he doesn't look confident and sure of his next move. \n\nHuh. So all you have to do is freak out and he's putty in your hands. Good to know.\n\n'Listen... I just... I mean... if you want to talk about it...' He starts.\n\n'No. I don't.' You respond flatly. \n\nHe nods, still not breaking your vision.\n\n'Then we don't have to talk about it. Ever. Whatever you need.'\n\nYou nod. Maybe you will talk with him about it one day. Maybe not. You want to trust him, but your track record with people you trust is not great.\n\nHe slides over against the wall, opens his arms to you. \n\n'C'mere.' He says.\n\nYou sit for a moment, then slide up against him silently. He wraps his arm around you and gently starts massaging your head and straightening out your hair with his free hand.\n\nYou sigh. This day had started so well, with such promise and that stupid dream derailed it. \n\n'Hey.' He says, his hand still rubbing you gently.",
        "'Hey.' You say back, no other response coming to mind.\n\nScott just rubs you and holds you and lets his touch do all the talking. He just relentlessly massages your neck and head and skull until the sadness starts to drip away from you.\n\nYou sigh. Maybe you're still just too... fucked up for this. Maybe it's still too soon. Maybe you need to just give up on finding your happiness and your hopes and your trust.\n\nScott leans forward and nuzzles your neck, then he whispers in your ear. It isn't what you're expecting to hear.\n\n'I have more oranges. Would you like another glass of fresh squeezed orange juice?'\n\nYou smile. That orange juice was really tasty.\n\nYou look back at him and smile. He squeezes your shoulder and nudges you towards the counter and you both walk over to his little kitchenette.\n\nA glass is retrieved, ice is inserted, and fruit is viciously murdered for your thirst.\n\nIt's delicious. \n\nHe pours himself a coffee, sits with you at the kitchenette on a tall stool. He runs his hand up and down your back as you drink, which is nearly as pleasant (Although still a distant second...) to the juice he just made for you.\n\nIf he put vodka in this, you think you might have to marry him. Except you think that, and you remember, and it makes you sad again.\n\nHe sees your expression change and the smile leaves your lips. \n\n'Hey, you know you still get a treat right?' He says hopefully, trying to distract you.\n\nYou think about that for the moment.\n\n'Ok.' You whisper.\n\nYou pull the glass to your lips and slug back the rest of the orange juice in a sweet, refreshing deluge that slides down your throat effortlessly. It feels kind of wasteful to slam it back and not savour it, but you suspect that all you have to do is ask and more will be made for you.\n\nYou take Scott by the hand, and pull him away from the kitchenette and back to the bed.\n\n'Uh..' He says, and you shush him.\n\nYou point to the bed.\n\n'Lay down.' You order.\n\n'Hey now, you don't call the shots.' Scott argues.\n\n'You promised me a treat if I was a good girl. I was. Did you lie?' You say, waggling a finger at him.\n\n'No... I did not lie...' He starts, a little confused.\n\n'Bed. Now! Addie wants her treat!' You stomp your foot like a petulant child.\n\nScott gapes at you for a second, then throws up his hands in mock surrender. You point at the bed firmly, and he sits down on the bed and then reclines back with his hands under his head.\n\nYou nod, then lean down and yank down the cotton sleep pants he's been wearing as he worked on servers and networks and IP stuff that kept him away from you and what you wanted earlier this morning. How dare he be responsible and remain employed while your needs were not met? \n\n'Don't you move Scott! You just lay there and relax.' \n\nHe starts to protest and you silence him with one word and a pointed finger. \n\n'Treat!' You bark at him, and he chuckles and the mock surrender appears again.\n\nWow, you really can mold him like putty when he thinks you're sad.\n\nYou wish you'd taken a moment to clean yourself up, fix your hair and run a cloth over your face. But you'd decided to seize this moment if possible and he let you have it, so your mind is spinning with what you want to do.\n\nThere's really only one thing you want to do though, and you decide to do it.\n\nYou climb on top of him, suddenly hungry for him. He reaches out for you and you stop him with that stern finger and that all powerful word. \n\n'Treat! Don't make me tell you again old man!' You say with sternness that you didn't think you could ever invoke.\n\n'I gotta say... I want you pretty bad right now.' He says with passion. His nostrils flare and you can feel him stiffen below you.\n\nYou lean down and whisper in his ear.\n\n'Don't move. This is my treat. If you move or stop me or ruin this I'll consider this a broken promise.'\n\nYou pause, almost afraid to ask the question, but you have to.\n\n'Do you want to break your promise?'\n\n'No.' He says quickly in a strangled voice.\n\nYou smile. He's yours. \n\nHe's a dominant, sadistic, vicious fucking machine and he hates giving up control. But he's giving it to you. Right now. \n\nYou cautiously drag yourself over his groin, your lips parting to allow the sudden slickness within you to slide easily down his shaft. You lean down while doing so to nuzzle his chest and gently kiss and nibble on his nipple.\n\nHis mouth opens and closes and you hear the tiniest gasp from his as he literally claws at the pillow. It's taking everything he has to do what you asked and just hold still for you.\n\nYou decide to reward him for that. You slide forward and wrap your hands around his face and hold him still so that you can press your lips to his and kiss his stubbled face. He kisses you back with a surprising intensity. \n\nYou work your way back down his chin and drag your lips across his neck and just lightly drag your nipples across his chest. His skin prickles with goose bumps and he pulls at the pillow. \n\nYou feel him against your leg, he's rock hard and throbbing.\n\nGood. \n\nYou continue your downward path, kissing and nuzzling his chest, savouring his scent and exploring his body. You tease and torment him, exploring his body and learning the things that drive him into frenzy.\n\nHe nearly breaks the one time, his hands thrusting into the air as you slide your tongue around his navel as your fingers tickle his pulsing manhood. He reaches for you, and you slap his hand away and bark the all consuming word of power that he cannot help but obey.\n\n'TREAT!'\n\n'Chrisssssssst!' He pants, and then he grabs the pillow and pulls it over his face so that he can scream without it shattering the windows.\n\nYou grin. You could get to like this. If this is what it's like for him when he plays your body like a violin then you completely understand it.\n\nAbruptly you slide fully down his body, dragging your diamond hard nipples across his unbelievably erect phallus. You press it to your face and drag your fingernails up and down his sensitive skin. The tip flexes at your ministrations and a drop of clear sticky fluid slides out of him. \n\nYou can't help yourself, your slide your mouth onto him and take as much of him into you as you can. You tongue slides around him and you start to felate him skilfully, forcefully, mercilessly. \n\nSometimes you lack confidence in things. Sometimes you doubt yourself. Sometimes you wonder if you're ever going to be whole again.\n\nBut this, this act, this one thing, you have no doubt in this. You've made men beg before for your tongue and your touch. Scott for all his prowess is proving no different.\n\nDue to the fact that for once he is not controlling the situation, he may be even easier to manipulate this way. \n\nAnd you continue to do so, using your lips and tongue skilfully to extract every last once of pleasure from him. Your fingers cup his genitals gently, squeezing and massaging and you let copious amounts of saliva spill from your mouth as you bob up and down on him.\n\nIt almost feels cruel using him like this. He has no defence against these kind of ministrations and you're just relentless. You drag him again and again to the brink of release and then ease off until he shudders under your touch and fights not to buck and howl. \n\nAfter a measly ten minutes, he's reduced to a gibbering, panting wreck, and you decide to hang him out on that limb for another five minutes. \n\nYou're not angry with him, or even spiteful, but you do want him to feel, just once, what it's like to have no control as someone drags every ounce of pleasure from your flesh.\n\nAlso, it's really fun. \n\nAs he lies on the bed, gripping his hair with his eyes screwed shut and teeth gritted, you finally decide to release him from this. You take him fully into your mouth and press your tongue against the base of his shaft and drag it slowly up until he's nearly out of you entirely, then you abruptly start to rapidly bob up and down upon the head of his manhood while your hand rapidly strokes the shaft.\n\nIt takes less than a minute. He goes rigid and fights not to buck as he emits an animal sound.\n\n'GGGNNNNNRRRRGGGHHHHHHH!' tears out from behind gritted teeth.\n\nAt the same time he erupts in your mouth, and the thick white seed explodes across your tongue and oral cavity. His taste is heavy and musky, and you swirl him in your mouth for a moment before you swallow him. \n\nYou slow down, and flick your tongue over the tip of his penis and continue to stroke up and down with your fist, extracting the last drops of his orgasm from his still ridiculously hard member. You delight in rubbing your face against him, literally painting your own face with his ejaculate.\n\nHe's hot and sticky and trembling on the bed, eyes still slammed shut and his hands pulling at his hair.\n\nYou begin to creep up his body, the same tongue and mouth that you used on him so skilfully now extracting little gasps and moans from his as he lays there and twitches, still trying to be your Treat as you demanded.\n\nFinally, after fully exploring his body with your tongue and mouth, you creep up his chest, tasting the thin film of sweat that he exuded while you worked him without respite. \n\nHis heart pounds in his chest. It satisfies you to feel it so.\n\nFinally, you've crept all the way up his longish, soft frame and gently pull his earlobe between your teeth and nibble.\n\nHe sighs, exhausted.\n\n'Was that a good treat?'\n\n'That... That was... fantastic. Holy... mother of... God... that was .... Intense.' He pants as he tries to speak.\n\n'Was that not what you had in mind?' You purr into his ear.\n\n'Was... just.... Just gonna... take you out to break... fast.'\n\nYou laugh in his ear. Clearly he had not been expecting this.\n\nHe chuckles as well between gasps, and then says the magic words that finally push away any lingering sadness from the stupid dream.\n\n'Your idea.... Was .... Was way better.'\n\nYou laugh again, and he finally snakes an arm around your head and pulls you to him. You kiss him passionately and he returns the favour as he fights for every bit of oxygen he can suck in.\n\nAnd as he gasps and tries to kiss you back, you think one thing.\n\nTreats. You're going to need him to give you more treats.\n\nLots more.\n\nYou lay with Scott for a while, relaxed and comfortable and enjoying the sensation of having turned the tables on him for once. There's no conversation, just you enjoying him sprawled on the bed with you.\n\nYou have a small urge to ride on him, but you repress it and just cuddle with him. He let you encroach on his realm once; you don't want to try it again. \n\nNot just yet anyways. \n\nAfter a time, you both get out of bed and get dressed. You slide into another oversized t-shirt and slide the comfy toms on, as well as a pair of his workout shorts. He slides into some battered jeans and a short sleeved button shirt and futzes with his hair until he gives up in frustration and just plasters it flat with some gel and a sigh. \n\nYou smile and slide behind him as he battles with his hairstyle and loses. You run your fingers through his hair and tease and muss his hair so that it looks relatively styled, or at least better than his previous ode to hair gel.\n\n'Thank you. I'm terrible at that.'\n\n'I would never have guessed that.' You say with a smile. He smirks back at you in the mirror.\n\n'Wanna get some food?' \n\n'I could use some breakfast. I feel like I've completed a couple of intense workouts over the last couple of days.' That thought brings an even bigger smile to your face.\n\nFor the first time in a long time you feel truly sated. You body aches, but it's a pleasant ache. Your head is clear, and your thoughts aren't cluttered with frantic little desires demanding you slake them. \n\nYou feel good. Great actually, and it's because this lumpy, chubby older guy with bad hair has focused everything he has on your needs for a weekend. \n\nWhat a weekend.\n\nYou run a hand down his back, and resist the urge to take his hand and lead him back to bed. You feel almost addicted to him now, his way of taking charge when you need him to, the way he attends to your needs, the way he lets go and lets you do what you need to do when you need to do it. \n\nHe doesn't anticipate your every need. In fact, he's blown a few signals completely, but he tries, really tries to be what you need, when you need it. \n\nAnd he likes you. He really does. \n\nHe sees you watching him in the mirror. You realize that your gaze is pretty intense so you look down, a little embarrassed. \n\n'You ok?' He asks.\n\n'I... don't want this to end.' You answer, surprised at how easily this comes out.\n\nHe nods, turns and slips a hand around your neck and pulls you to him. You wrap your arms around his hips and hug him to you. \n\n'I don't want this to end either... but...'\n\n'But?' You ask, slightly terrified of the answer.\n\n'But you already took a day off from work, and I have my son coming over Wednesday to Friday.'\n\n'Oh.' You hug him tight. Is that it?\n\n'... but I can see you on Sunday. Are you free Sunday?' \n\n'What's happening on Saturday?'\n\n'Uh... well... I have a prior engagement this Saturday.'\n\nHe's nervous suddenly. Why is he nervous?\n\n'Why are you nervous?' You ask him with the least subtle line of questioning you can imagine.\n\nHe sighs.\n\nFuck.\n\nIs there someone else? Is there another woman? His wife? \n\n'I am working at Club S this weekend.... And I committed to topping someone that evening.'\n\n'Oh. Are you... do... are...' You stammer, unsure how to ask the question.\n\n'No, we do not have sex. Ever. She just needs pain, a lot of it, and she trusts me.'\n\nYou process that for a moment.\n\n'Why didn't you tell me this before?'\n\n'Addie, in all seriousness, how would I tell you about this? We've been fucking like rabbits for three straight days, working through emotional stuff together that scares the crap out of me and testing your limits. I think we pushed the boundaries pretty hard over the last 72 hours, wouldn't you say?'\n\nWell, yes, but...\n\n'Do you want to come to the club with me?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Do you want to come to the club with me? I'll show you everything. If you want to see my dark side... this is about as dark as I get.'\n\nThis is intriguing. He's really not trying to hide this, it just hasn't come up. You still have questions about this though.\n\n'So are you like... some kind of ... man ...whore?' You blurt out, attempting to secure the world record for most awkward phrasing ever.\n\nHe bursts out laughing. \n\nYou smile weakly at him. This conversation is confusing.\n\n'No. God no. Nobody is paying me to fuck them. Good god that's funny.'\n\n'So what exactly do you... how... I'm confused.'\n\n'Addie, club S is a... private club for some very wealthy and very connected people with very exotic tastes and a strong desire for privacy. I work for them part time as an administrator and for some of their clientele. It helps me pay for things like child support, legal fees and occasionally lets me repair my car when it breaks down yet again.'\n\n'Oh.' \n\n'You're freaking out.'\n\n'Just a little.'\n\n'Addie, I was involved in this and made my commitments to this evening long before I even met you for Sushi. I didn't know you were going to happen. I didn't even dream you could happen. I'm not hiding anything. Come and see it, see me, meet my friends. They'll like you.'\n\n'How do you know that?'\n\n'Because I like you, and my friends aren't stupid. They'll like you too.'\n\nYou just hug him for a minute. \n\nDammit! Everything was going so well. Just once, you'd like to have a nice relationship with no drama. No unsuspected surprises. \n\nYou'd also like to sprout wings and fly, but that's not going to happen either.\n\n'Ok... I'll go.'\n\n'You don't sound enthused.'\n\n'M'not. Scared.' You hug him tighter. PLEASE don't let this fuck things up you think to yourself.\n\n'Addie, c'mon... there's a fun part to this that I haven't told you about.'\n\n'Fun how exactly?' You ask with a raised, suspicious eyebrow.\n\n'We have to dress up.' Scott says with a smile.\n\nYou look at him blankly. \n\n'Really dress up.' He says, still excited for you.\n\n'What exactly do you mean by 'really dress up' exactly?' You ask, now interested but still concerned.\n\nScott smiles and pulls his cell phone out of his holster on his pants and dials a number. It rings, and a moment later someone picks up.\n\n'Hi Melody, it's Scott.'\n\n'Yes, I'm glad to hear from you too. Do you have a moment to talk?'\n\nThere's a pause.\n\n'Well I can call back, you're negotiating with someone...'\n\nAnother pause, Scott grins. \n\n'Oh, it's one of *those* negotiations. I see.'\n\nYou hear the woman talking to Scott, but he just grins and nods. \n\n'Wow. Remind me to never piss you off Melody.'\n\nShe laughs clearly through the phone. You feel a little intimidated. Scott seems to defer to her a little bit, which you can barely imagine him doing.\n\n'Mels, I'll be quick, so you can get back to obliterating this poor bastard. I have a date for Saturday.'\n\nThe voice sounds concerned.\n\n'We're still on Mel. I wouldn't leave you hanging.'\n\nHe pauses. Then he rolls his eyes.\n\n'You know what I mean Melody. Listen, I was thinking about bringing her to the club, for a meet and greet.'\n\n'Yes, she knows all about me.' Scott says calmly. 'This is about the last thing I have left to show her.'\n\nAnother pause, she asks him some questions that you can't make out.\n\n'Yeah, she's going to need some wardrobe. Can I beg, borrow or steal some of Dominic's time for her?'\n\nWho the heck is Dominic? Why does Scott need his help? Why do you need 'wardrobe'?\n\n'White Melody. Definitely white.'\n\nWhite? He is going to have to answer sooooo many questions when he hangs up that phone.\n\n'Ok, sure... and what's this going to cost me?'\n\nThe voice on the other end says something and Scott rolls his eyes.\n\n'Fine. I'll fix the server cluster in St. Paul for you. You know Melody, you really do need to get some competent technicians working for you.'\n\nShe says something else and then laughs. Scott laughs too.\n\n'Nice try Melody, but I am never going to be your bitch. You on the other hand.... will be seeing me on Saturday.' He says with just a hint of menace.\n\nThat tone of voice makes you nervous. He sounds like before, when you begged him to show you his darker side and stop holding back. He did and you regretted it. You're glad he stopped playing with you like that, but it makes you nervous that he can speak or think like that.\n\nOn the other hand, he does all those other things sooooo very well.\n\nYou realize you're hugging him tightly. You ease up a little as he rubs your back.\n\nScott bids the woman he called goodbye and focuses his attention on you.\n\n'Got you an invite, and got you some new... clothing.' He says with a smile.\n\n'Great. Where the heck are we going again?'\n\n'Club S.'\n\n'And this is some kind of... sex club?'\n\n'Yes... and no. It's a private club for people with... certain tastes. I certainly don't meet the wealth criteria, but I have a skill set that these folks appreciate.'\n\n'And you're not some kind of Man whore.'\n\n'I am not Deuce Bigelow, no. Nobody really wants to see me naked but you.'\n\n'Well, I don't know if I'd go that far... ' You say with a grin.\n\n'You are so mean to me!' Scott says with mock outrage. And then he suddenly starts to tickle you. \n\nYou shriek and squirm out of his grasp and scoot around the table. Scott chases you around the table laughing diabolically. You complete four circuits staying just ahead of him as he wiggles his fingers at you. Finally he vaults on top of the table and lunges at you, but trips over the edge and smacks his forehead off the side of the table.\n\n'Sonofabitch!' He growls and holds his hands to his forehead.",
        "'Oh god! Scott I'm so sorry! Are you ok?' You stammer as you stop running from him and lean over him.\n\n'I am now!' He says gleefully as he lunges and tackles you onto the bed. You shriek as he pins you and starts to tickle you.\n\n'Wait! No! Stop! Please! I hate being tickled!' You wail out loud.\n\n'Really?' He says incredulously, his eyebrow raised.\n\n'Really.' You say firmly, panting just a little.\n\n'I don't know anyone that hates being tickled. My son loves being tickled.'\n\n'Well, it could be that I'm not five?' You say with just a mild amount of sarcasm.\n\n'I certainly hope so, or I have broken soooooo many laws this weekend.'\n\nYou laugh at him and impulsively kiss him. He kisses you back, still smiling. His lips are hot and soft and his skin has just the right amount of stubble. You wrap your arms around his neck and pull him to you.\n\nHe doesn't fight it, he just rolls on top of you and cradles your face in his hand so that he can kiss you back. You close your eyes and feel his body on you, unconsciously spreading your legs so that you can feel him closer to you, almost in you.\n\nScott pulls away a little and smiles.\n\n'No girl, we're going out to get some lunch and we need to go see Dominic. We can do this later.'\n\n'But I want it nowwwwwwww!' You whine in a little girl voice.\n\n'Nope. Not gonna happen. Get up Addie.'\n\n'Do you promise for later?'\n\nScott grins and slips a hand behind you head so that he can grasp your hair firmly, then he slides his other free hand down your shorts. His fingers part your lips and are inside you in seconds, your insides slippery with passion you didn't even realize was building. You open your mouth and gasp at the sudden but extremely pleasurable violation and Scott places his mouth over your own, you try and kiss him back but you're too busy gasping as he manipulates your body in a way that you love and were totally not prepared for.\n\nScott relentlessly works your sex with his fingers and holds you in place by your hair until he rips a quick, powerful and brutally efficient orgasm from you. After you shriek into his mouth as your little orgasm rocks you, he stops working you with vigour and gently moves his fingers in and out of you. You moan as he does that, your last eruption still making you sensitive and responsive to his now gentle touch.\n\n'Addie, I need that to hold you for now. We need to go out. I promise when we get back I will fuck you right stupid.'\n\nYou chuckle with your eyes half closed. From anyone else that would sound crude, Scott makes it sound like an earnest promise.\n\n'Do you swear? Extra stupid?' You whisper into his ear.\n\n'I swear. You're gonna lose a good 20 IQ points when I'm done with you.' He says with just a hint of a growl.\n\nYou smile back, kiss him gently on the lips and let him help you out of the bed on your surprisingly wobbly legs. You straighten yourself out again, ignore the slick, sensitive feeling between your thighs and the fuzzy feeling that he put into your brain, via his fingers and your crotch.\n\nYou both wander over to the lift, and Scott fires it up. You cuddle into him for the minute or so it takes for the lift to power up and drop you both gently down to the garage level. He runs a hand up and down your back and basically just enjoys being with you.\n\nYou think you really adore him. He's so unusual, smart, sassy and downright kinky. \n\nMaybe he's the one.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nYou definitely want to find out, that's for sure. \n\nScott takes you both to a little place that he dug up that specializes in soup and you share a nice light lunch. Scott gets you red pepper bisque and he treats himself to some jambalaya. You both split a nice serving of fresh hot bread and he even manages to get some roasted garlic from the vendor in place of butter. \n\nIt's lovely, but you're now inclined to not smooch him because you're afraid of garlic breath.\n\nYou excuse yourself to dart off and get some mints and when you get back he's gotten some cookies for you both to nibble on. You decide to have one... which becomes two, which rapidly leads to you both devouring the bag of cookies.\n\nYou both sit happily at the table, content and full, and start to make idle chatter.\n\n'Tell me about this Dominic guy.'\n\n'He's a costumer.'\n\n'So... what kind of costume am I getting?'\n\n'A nice white one. With gloves.'\n\n'That doesn't tell me very much.' You say with a pout.\n\n'Imagine that.' He responds with a smirk. \n\n'Boo. Hiss! Wrong answer!' \n\nScott smiles and sits back. He's done talking.\n\n'Sometimes you are soooo mean. Big meanie.'\n\nSo you sit quietly and finish off the cookies with him and have a coffee. And occasionally kick him. Or at least you kick him once, and then he gives you a hard look and you grin.\n\n'Behave.' He says quietly, in that tone of voice that makes you tingle.\n\nYou do so.\n\nA while later, you both climb back into his rust bucket and head out to a quiet little strip mall. Half the building is unsigned and the windows are decaled solid white. Scott opens/hip checks your door for you and leads you over to the blank white store front. He presses an unlabeled black button and waits a moment.\n\n'Yes?' A bored sounding voice buzzes out of a hidden intercom.\n\n'It's Scott plus one Dominic.'\n\n'Oh hi Scooter. Come on in.'\n\nThe door buzzes, and Scott catches and holds it open for you.\n\n'Scooter?' You ask with amusement.\n\n'Shush.' He admonishes you and leads you into the storefront.\n\nYou step in and stop dead. You're surrounded by racks and racks and racks of colourful, exotic costumes. Huge swaths of fabric are interspersed on shelves in every color, shade and hue you can imagine. You smell leather and dyes and scents you can't even place.\n\n'What... what is this?' You ask as you gape at the scenery.\n\n'Pretty cool hmm?' Scott asks you. You nod assent as you try and take in the riot of color.\n\n'Dominic does costume design for Hollywood. He works with some pretty big names, but he likes a low profile so he works here. He's married to Bob, who knows Melody... and everybody goes to club S.'\n\n'You are *such* a name dropper Scooter!' Dominic says as he rounds a corner with a pad of paper in hand and a tape measure draped around his neck. \n\n'God I hate it when you call me that.' Scott answers him with just a hint of a smirk.\n\n'I know, I know dearie, it makes it so much more fun to say.' Dominic says with the tiniest of snorts. 'Let's take a look at our victim shall we?'\n\nThe unusual man that seems to know Scott very well approaches you and scans you from head to toe with a critical eye. You look back at him and he's memorable. He's short and thin and older, with pale skin and a shock of unruly, white spiky hair. A pair of round, gold spectacles rest on his nose and he's wearing a loose shiny gray dress shirt coupled with distressed jeans and a pair of day glow orange sneakers. His outfit is casual, but his watch looks expensive and you're fairly certain that the ring on his hand is worth more than your house.\n\n'So Scooter...' He asks as he eyes you.\n\n'I hate that name.' \n\n'...yes, yes, we covered that. What do you want hear, a nice red silk, leather and satin special?'\n\n'Stop it Dominic. She's not wearing red on her first visit.'\n\n'You did.'\n\n'I wasn't new to this.'\n\n'She is? Really?' Dominic's eyes widen a little.\n\n'I have a name you know.' You blurt out, feeling oddly intimidated.\n\n'My apologies m'dear.' Dominic says with a overly dramatic bow. 'And what would your name be?'\n\n'Addison... Addie.' You say in a tiny voice. \n\n'Well young miss Addison, it is my pleasure to make your acquaintance.' He says and takes your hand. He lays his lips on the back of your hand and places a gentle kiss on your skin. \n\n'Uh... thank you.' You respond blankly to him.\n\n'You are very welcome. Strip please.'\n\nYou freeze for a moment. \n\n'What?' You squeak out in a tiny voice.\n\n'This one is a little slow on the uptake Scooter.' He says over his shoulder.\n\n'New!' Scott says with an aggravated tone.\n\n'I am not taking my clothes off!' You say firmly.\n\nDominic laughs and throws his hands into the air. He gestures to Scott as he leans against a swath of bright blue fabric and tells him to straighten this out.\n\nScott sighs.\n\n'Addie, strip please.'\n\n'Why?!'\n\n'He's a costumer. He needs your measurements for your outfit.'\n\n'So why do I need to be naked?!'\n\n'Addie, you won't be wearing any underwear in this. It will be form fitting. And I mean skin tight.'\n\n'So!?'\n\nScott sighs again and heaves himself up off the fabric. He walks over to you and slips a hand around your neck and pulls you to him. \n\nYou feel scared, your heart pounds in your chest. It's felt like a game up until now, but he's upping the ante again and you're in another situation that feels completely out of your control.\n\nHe puts his hand on the back of your neck and pulls you to him. It's not cruel or intimidating, but it is forceful and just mildly aggressive. \n\nIt's almost like an electric shock, his skin on your skin. You catch and hold your breath.\n\n'Addie, do you think I would really put you in a situation you couldn't handle?' He asks you gently.\n\n'Maybe?'\n\n'Possibly. Yeah. I'm stupid sometimes. But we're just here to get you an amazing dress. And he needs you naked to make it unbelievable.'\n\n'Unbelievable how?' \n\n'You're going to feel like a goddess wearing it. I promise.'\n\nThat's an odd statement. \n\n'You promise?'\n\n'I can't make a promise based on how you'll feel, but I would be completely astonished if you did not marvel at how beautiful and exotic Dominic is going to make you.'\n\n'I just... I..' Why are you so afraid of this?\n\nIs it because he's going to have you strip in front of another man again? Is it because you still don't trust him? Are you just afraid in general? \n\nIt's none of those things, you realize, you just haven't learned how to fully let go and just be. Scott's offering to take care of these things for you. He bargained with somebody to get you here, in this amazing space filled with surreal clothing and an odd, sarcastic and apparently ridiculously talented clothier.\n\n'Will you hold my clothes for me?' You ask, embarrassed that it took you this long to get to this point.\n\n'Of course I will. Dominic will get you a robe while he sketches once he finishes measuring you.'\n\nWith no more hesitation, you reach down and pull the comfy sweatshirt over your head and hand it to Scott. He calmly folds it for you and then slips it over his arm. A moment later you kick off your shoes and then slide the borrowed pair of shorts down your legs and then slide out of them.\n\nScott kneels and picks up your shorts and shoes and deftly arranges them, then stands and looks at you for a moment.\n\n'What?'\n\n'I just never really get tired of that view, that's all.' He says with a hint of a smile.\n\nYou make grumbly noises at him and wrap your arms around yourself. It's chilly in here.\n\n'Dominic, she's ready for you now.' Scott calls out and steps away. \n\n'Excellent, excellent, about time Scooter. You really do need to finish training your slavegirls before you take them out in public you know...' Dominic mutters as he wanders back around the corner. You can see that he's been sketching on the pad of paper.  \n\nWire frame dolls spin and twist on the page and Dominic has several versions of a dress concealing their frames and you can barely imagine what he's drawing. Some of these things would require a lack of gravity. \n\n'All right, let's get started.' Dominic mutters to himself, and he starts to poke and prod you. \n\nWhat follows is the most thorough measurements you have ever had. The tape measure is everywhere, between your legs, around your breasts and neck, measuring your inseam and ribcage. \n\nHe finishes up and jots down yet another sequence of numbers and nods. Then he hands you a silk robe that you eagerly slide into. \n\n'Ok, I've got some ideas, let me flesh them out and I'll run them by Scott.' He mutters as he looks at the measurements and the sketches.\n\n'Don't you mean that you'll show them to me?' You ask.\n\nDominic turns and looks at Scott with a smirk.\n\n'She's new!' Scott protests.\n\n'How new pray tell?' Dominic sputters with mock indignation. 'Did you pick her up at the bus stop? Should I be checking her ID? Is she a virgin? Wait..'\n\nDominic turns back and looks at you, eyebrow cocked.\n\n'Are you a virgin Addison?'\n\nYou open and close your mouth and suddenly blush a deep pink. Words will not leave your mouth at this ridiculously intimate question.\n\n'Ok, definitely not a virgin.' He says conclusively. You did not think it would be possible to blush any harder, yet you seem to do so.\n\nScott throws up his hands and walks off, seemingly frazzled by the bizarre conversation. Dominic snickers into his sleeve and turns back to you.\n\n'That was fun. He'll be back in a minute when he gets over his urge to strangle me.'\n\n'Uh... ok. I have no idea what happened just now.'\n\n'It's just a game that Scooter and I play where we needle each other. You should see it when we play poker.'\n\n'He plays poker?'\n\n'He does play, and quite well on occasion. He's still a little bitter about some quad threes that I felted him with a couple of months ago.'\n\n'I have no idea what that means. Is that bad?'\n\n'I took all his money.'\n\n'All of it?!'\n\n'Well, all the money that he had at the table. I didn't clean out his bank account or anything. This dress will do that.'\n\n'Oh. I thought he arranged this with... uh... Melody?'\n\nDominic looks up and arches an eyebrow. \n\n'Melody is paying for this? What did Scooter trade her for that?'\n\n'He... he told her something about a server cluster somewhere? St. Paul I think?'\n\n'Ah. He's trading on his technical skills for mine. Nice.'\n\n'I think so. He's does things with computers that I just don't understand.'\n\n'I'll leave that in your capable hands. I need to go show him the sketches.'\n\n'Oh! Me too!' You squeal with excitement. You've never had someone make you a dress from scratch before. It's exciting. \n\nDominic looks at you with a wry smile. It's like he knows a joke that you don't and he's chuckling at it to himself.\n\n'Why are you looking at me like that?'\n\n'Addie, sweet girl, your Scooter's... love slave. Right?'\n\nYou feel yourself blushing ferociously again as you look away in embarrassment.\n\n'I'm going to take that as a yes.' Dominic says calmly as he continues. 'So Scooter here is taking you to a very private, elite, BDSM club to present you to his inner circle of friends. He's just leveraged an intense amount of himself to make you look as spectacular as you can possibly look in this environment.'\n\n'Um... yes?' You respond, not sure where this is going.\n\n'So traditionally, he chooses how you dress and what it will look like kiddo.'\n\n'That... that doesn't seem fair.' You say with a tiny pout. \n\n'It's not. It isn't supposed to be fair. Your whole relationship is based on you surrendering your will to him, for him. Right?'\n\n'I don't... I mean...'\n\nDominic slips arm around your shoulders and gives you a friendly squeeze. \n\n'Addie, I'm not judging you. I'm in no place to judge anyone or anything. I'm just telling you how it is. Be glad Scott wants you in a nice dress. One of the members presented a new slave last year by walking him in on a leash, buck naked on his hands and knees.'\n\nYou wince at that. That would be hard to handle from anyone.\n\n'Addie, Scott gets to pick the dress. If he shares that with you, every time he looks at you that night, he sees compromise. You guys are not about compromise. You're about surrender and trust and control... and all the fun things that come with that.'\n\nYou think about that for a moment. It bothers you that this man is designing a beautiful dress that will cost a fortune that you will have no say in at all. But you also remember the table, and that first night and the whole weekend that you've spent with him. He's lovely and he adores you and he's clearly putting himself out there to try and show you everything you asked him to show you at costs you don't understand.\n\nDominic waits patiently while you process that. His sketchbook is tucked into his side.\n\n'You won't... I won't...'\n\n'Addie, I'm going to make you look beautiful. Sexy and desirable and not slutty or whorish.'\n\nYou nod your head. It will have to do.\n\nDominic squeezes your arm and heads off into the maze of fabric rolls to locate Scott and show him the design. You take a moment to think about it, and then call out.\n\n'Dominic?' You call out, hoping he's still in earshot.\n\n'Yes Addie?' He says, poking his head back around a roll of shiny, metallic fabric. \n\n'Can it be... just a little... a little slutty? For him?' \n\nDominic smiles.\n\n'Sexy always has to be a little slutty Addie, the trick is to use just the right amount.' Dominic replies with a smile as he makes a tiny measurement with his fingers showing what represents to him just the right amount of sluttiness.\n\nYou smile as he disappears into the fabrics. He's funny and talented and he seems to really enjoy teasing Scott, something you are surprisingly jealous of.\n\nYou spot your clothes on the floor and slip out of the robe and then slide back into the sweatshirt and shorts and your comfy Toms. It's warmer like this in the chilly air.\n\nYou hear conversation and Scott and Dominic emerge from the maze of cloth and costuming supplies bickering with each other.\n\n'... please dude.... You draw into four of a kind once and you won't let it go. Your luck will run out and I am going to crush you when it does.'\n\n'Pish Posh Scooter. You've been saying that for months now. Please keep feeding my bankroll you fishy little fish. Now take your girl home and give her some attention. She looks starved for affection, poor little thing!'\n\nScott sighs and strolls over to you. You hand him the robe with a smile and he gives you a quick hug. \n\nHe guides you toward the door, but Dominic calls out your name. 'Addie!'\n\n'Yes Dominic?'\n\n'I need you to come back on Wednesday to see me for final fitting. Wear something easy to slip in and out of sweetie.'\n\n'I have to work on Wednesday. Can I come in the evening?'\n\n'Of course sweetie. I don't work nine to five like Scooter does. Just buzz the door and let me know that you're here.'\n\n'All right, thank you Dominic. I can't wait to see it!'\n\nDominic smiles and ushers you out the door.\n\nScott hip checks the passenger door open for you in the parking lot and you slide into the well worn seat. You both buckle up and Scott fires up the engine and you roar out of the parking lot in his rusty little deathtrap.\n\nThe drive to his place is quick, but you can't help but grabbing his hand and squeezing it. He looks at you and smiles and squeezes back. It's comforting.\n\nThe car rolls into the driveway of the weird little complex he calls a home and he taps the remote on his visor to open the garage door. He zips in beside your own car coolly and then exits the car to once again let you out of the malfunctioning door. \n\n'You really should get a new car some day.'\n\n'Some day...' He agrees with you. '...some day when I don't have alimony and lawyers fees and child support and a big old mountain of debt to contend with.'\n\n'Hmmmf. I thought you kinky types were always closet millionaires.'\n\n'Ah, you've got the nomenclature wrong. Millionaires get to be kinky. We common folk are just perverts.' He says with a chuckle as he guides you into the lift and hits the button to take you both up to his place.\n\n'I wouldn't call you perverted.' You whisper as you lean into him. \n\n'What would you call me then?' He says quietly as he wraps his arms around you.\n\nYou lean up and kiss him, hungry for him suddenly. He's a little surprised, but he kisses you back with his normal explosive passion. His hand slides up your back and fingers grip your hair tight and pull your head back. His lips drift down your throat and he nuzzles and kisses your neck.",
        "The lift stops and the door opens to reveal his living space and you disengage from him and stride toward the bed. You shed your clothes gracefully as you walk to it, your need for him to be inside you sudden and immediate. The sheets are cool as you turn and sit on the messy bed; the marks he left on your skin barely even itch now. You look at him as he follows you to the bed, amused by his attempt to pick up your discarded clothing.\n\n'Leave them please. You promised me something.'\n\nScott looks up at you amused, and then tosses the clothing over his shoulder. \n\n'And what did I promise you Addie?' He says with a little smirk.\n\n'Extra Stupid!' You declare firmly to him and make a come hither gesture with your finger.\n\n'Maybe. I need you to do something for me first.'\n\n'Like what?' You say with a pout. \n\n'Show me.' He says with what can only be described as a wicked smile.\n\n'Show you what?' You respond with confusion.\n\n'Show me how badly you want it.' Scott replies as he casually drops the clothing he was picking up and saunters over to the bed.\n\n'I'm naked in your bed and I whipped off my clothes the moment I got out of the elevator. I think it's pretty clear how badly I want it.' You reply with just an ounce of irritation.\n\n'Oh, I saw that. But it's not really clear if you were tired, or just wanted a nap...'\n\n'Are you kidding me?'\n\nScott laughs and then he kneels and gently grips your chin between his thumb and forefinger, locking eye contact with you. You feel a shiver travel up your spine and a tingle in the hairs on the back of your neck. He does these things all the time to you and he doesn't even realize it. He just... takes control and you melt.\n\n'Show me girl.' He commands you. And this time you know exactly what he means.\n\nYour hand trembles slightly as you reach between your legs and dart between your lips. You were already aroused just coming up the elevator, now with him taking charge of the moment and holding your chin you've dropped into a state of lust. You're so wet you're afraid you're literally dripping and your fingers slide inside yourself with no resistance at all. You bite on your lip as you hold his gaze, and he slides his free hand across your stomach and cups your breast. \n\nYou moan at both your touches. His fingers are soft and he squeezes you gently but firmly. His fingers creep up the soft globe of flesh and tweak your nipple in just the right way. You can feel the pressure building in your stomach and you clench your muscles tight, bracing yourself for release.\n\nHe bends down and brushes his lips against your own. You pant between passionate yet delicate kisses. He drifts across your face, his lips kissing your cheeks and your eyelids. \n\n'Ngghh... ' You gibber and buck your hips as you approach release. As you start to pant, Scott whispers in your ear.\n\n'Not. Yet.' He orders you.\n\n'What?!' You gasp, so close to orgasm that request seems ridiculous.\n\n'Hold it! Wait. Do not come until I tell you girl!'\n\n'Oh god... I can't... you... what...' You panic as you try and do what he tells you to do, desperately holding back what feels like a wave of pressure inside you. You lock your thighs around your hand and press hard to try and physically hold back.\n\nScott watches you and he slides the hand that was holding your chin around the back of your neck and seizes your hair tightly. You gasp at the sudden reinforcement of his control, and it makes it easier and seemingly harder to hold back at the same time.\n\n'I can't... can't... God Scott PLEASE!'\n\n'Not yet.' He growls in your ear, then sucks your earlobe between his lips and drags his teeth gently across your delicate skin.\n\n'OH CHRIST! PLEASE!' You shriek loudly, taken aback at how desperate you are for this.\n\n'Come.' He orders in your ear and like a wave you let it go and it smashes through you. You arch up off the bed and pull him to you, burying your head in his neck as you howl with release. \n\nIt's an intense, powerful, orgasm and he still has his pants on.\n\nHe still has his pants on.\n\nOh. Shit.\n\nJust as you suddenly figure out what he's been planning, you feel his hand between your legs and on your hyper stimulated clitoris. You wail in horror as he starts to skilfully and rapidly stimulate you even further. You buck frantically, trying to get him away from his diabolical fingers but there is absolutely no escape. He overpowers you and rips climax after climax after climax out of you until tears roll down your cheeks and you lay limply on the bed.\n\nYou want to call him a bastard, but you've literally shrieked yourself hoarse.\n\nAlso, you know that would just make him smile.\n\nAs you lay there on the bed like a limp rag, you hear him sliding out of his clothes and you make a superhuman effort to force your eyes open you see him slide off his shirt and pants and his manhood springs out erect and hard. It makes little slapping sounds as it bounces off his stomach.\n\n'Oh... my... god...' You pant.\n\n'Just Scott Addie. God seems a little formal.'\n\n'You can't... I... you'll kill me.'\n\n'I doubt that. But if I did, wouldn't this be an incredible way to go?' He says with a smirk as he crawls on top of you. \n\nYou're exhausted, gasping for breath, and you've just had multiple orgasms for about five straight minutes. Your thighs and hands tremble as he lowers himself on to you and his lips find your rock hard nipples with ease. You groan as his tongue does skilful dance with your skin and your legs part to let him inside you. \n\nAs sensitive as you are, you gasp as he slides inside you. Every other guy you'd been with made sex a quick little joy to be experienced occasionally. Scott is like a satyr from myth. He's always hard for you. He knows how to touch you, arouse you, control you and pleasure you.\n\nAnd use you.\n\nGod you want him to use you. \n\nImpulsively, you reach up with both hands and pull his face to yours and you kiss him hard. He kisses you back and your tongues slide into each others mouths. \n\nHe's so passionate with you now. He's not thinking about anything but you. His eyes are locked onto your eyes like lasers and as he starts to thrust in and out of you with increasing force and speed he keeps your gaze. \n\nOf course, as over stimulated as you are and as aroused as you are, he has you climaxing in mere moments and he varies his speed and angle of penetration to keep you in a maddening land of bliss and pleasure and passion and border line insanity. Without thinking you spread your legs wide for him and pull his mouth to your breasts so that he can bite or suck or do what he will with you. \n\nYou don't care anymore. You have no regrets with him. Whatever this is, you hope it lasts a long time because he'll be the yardstick with which you measure every other man from now on.\n\nAnd as your overloaded brain finishes that thought, your body begins riding yet another wave of climaxes. And more tears and gasps flow from you as he kisses those tears away and presses his mouth to yours as if to share his own breath with you.\n\nAnd even then, you realize that he's barely even breathing hard yet. He's just measuring his pace to ensure that the sex you have now is as mind blowing as he can make it for you. \n\nHe goes, and goes and goes, and you come and come and come until you swear you can't take any more.\n\n'Scott... please.... please finish...' You lift your hands to his face and plead with him. \n\n'I can't... I can't take any more... my heart is going.... To stop...' You beg him, desperately wanting him to stop yet secretly hoping he'll say now. \n\nSweat drips down his cheek and his gray and straw coloured hair is damp with perspiration. His chest is heaving now too, yet you know he hasn't finished yet. If he had, he would have frozen and gone silent and he has done neither.\n\nHe looks at you and nods, then shifts his hands to grip your shoulder and your hair with a sudden ferocity. His tempo picks up and his member starts rapidly sawing in and out of you. You squeeze him indelicately, trying to help him finish.\n\nIt takes you both a minute, but he finally buries his face into your shoulder and releases, and for once he comes instead of you. You feel his body shudder against you, feel the sudden heat inside you and you know that he's finally taken a little pleasure from you.\n\nThank god. This is fantastic and all, but sometimes being with him is like running a marathon.\n\nYou half giggle, half pant as he lays on top of you, dripping sweat on you as you feel him start to soften inside you. \n\nYou both stay like that for a long time. Both of you spent and exhausted and sated on nearly every level.\n\nIt's good. It's nearly perfect. \n\nAfter a time, he slides off of you and beside you and wraps his arms around you. Like you always do, you slid his hand over to your breasts so that he can play with your nipples while he cuddles. You like it when he absentmindedly plays with your flesh while he snuggles or talks with you.\n\nHe's not talking now though. He just lies next to you, and breathes into your neck. Eventually, his hand grows limp and you realize that he's sleeping.\n\nThis isn't surprising though. He just spent a full three days... doing what exactly? Making love to you? Violently using your body? (With your complete consent.) Showing you what a real lover could be like? What exactly was this?\n\nYou carefully lift his hand from your chest and slip out of the bed. You accomplish this pretty easily but nearly fall over when you realize that your thigh muscles have turned to jello after that last incredibly passionate coupling.\n\nYou need to think on this. It's too fast and too much and as much as you want it you're glad you need to be at work tomorrow. There's still too much to process for... everything really.\n\nQuietly, you slip into the bathroom and take a quick shower, the first one in his place that hasn't involved intense and frantic sex. You grab one of his fluffy towels and dry yourself off and then carefully brush out and braid your hair, then pad back out to the living area where he still dozes.\n\nYou slip on most of your clothing quietly but as you are slipping on your shoes his eyes open and he sees you getting dressed.\n\n'Addie?' He says sleepily.\n\n'Hey Scott. I need to go home now. I have to work tomorrow.' You say to him quietly. \n\nWhy does this feel like you're slinking away? \n\n'Ok. Lem'me walk you out.' He says groggily, and he swings his feet over the side of the bed. \n\n'It's ok, I got it.' You say, hoping that he'll crawl back into bed and go back to sleep. You're afraid that any conversation you might have right now will be awkward, but you don't know why.\n\n'No... got something to take with you. Gim'me a sec...' He grumbles and then he staggers over to the kitchen and pulls open the fridge. He fumbles around for a second and then pulls out a clear glass bottle full of orange liquid and a bottle of water. He stumbles back to you and as he passes the counter he grabs something else.\n\nHe hands you the bottle, and it's cold. It looks like orange juice. You give him an odd look.\n\n'I squeezed it f'r you last night when you were sleeping. Forgot to give it to you when you woke up. Should still be good now... I hope.' He says blearily. \n\n'Oh. Thank you.' You say sincerely. You love the fresh squeezed orange juice. He may have ruined regular orange juice for you now with that.\n\n'What's the water for?' You ask. \n\n'The water is for me.' He says with a chuckle. 'I'm dry as a bone.' \n\nAnd he cracks open the water and takes a long slug from the container. Then he offers it to you and you gratefully share it with him, the cold water soothing your still ragged throat. \n\n'Well... I guess...' You start as you finish the water and Scott interrupts you.\n\n'Oh... and I wanted you to have this.' He says calmly and he hands you a key.\n\n'What is this?'\n\n'It's a key to my place. You can come over whenever you want to.'\n\nYou look at it and look at him. He's still groggy, pale and naked and he just gave you a key to his house. \n\nThis is too soon. You shouldn't take it. You should give it back to him. \n\nYou put it into your pocket then reach up on your tip toes and kiss him. \n\n'Night you. Get some sleep.' You whisper in his ear.\n\n'You too Addie.' He says with a sleepy smile and gives you a big hug.\n\nMoments later you're sliding into your car, pulling the seat belt into place and watching the garage door slide up for you. The drive home is surprisingly automatic, and you're in your lobby before you know it.\n\nYou've already showered, so you simply head to your bedroom, pull a nightie from you're your dresser and slide into your bed. You think to set the alarm clock for the morning, and it's a good thing that you did because nearly the moment your head hits the pillow the long weekend full of sex and exploration and pain and pleasure catches up with you and you drop into a deep slumber.\n\nAnd you dream that night, not of that bitter day of betrayal, but an odd but strikingly clear dream.\n\nYou're in a garden, filled with plants and flowers and trees and fruit all teeming around you. The sun is bright and beaming down and you're walking barefoot through the grass.\n\nAs you walk through the garden, you see something dark in the shadows. \n\nIt's a wolf, and a huge one. It moves soundlessly through the brush and keeps pace with you until it emerges under a tree and lays down in the shade watching you. Its coat is rough, mostly black with gray and the occasional white strand of hair jutting through. \n\nIt sniffs at you, its ears swivel in your direction as it watches you.\n\nWithout hesitation, you walk forward and sit down next to it, then lay down in the grass beside it. It sniffs at you and your hair and then gently licks your ear and shifts over beside you. \n\nAnd in your dreams you lay in this lovely garden next to this huge black wolf and rest. \n\nIt should be scary, this dream, but it isn't. It's comforting. The wolf isn't a threat. It's a companion. And as you lay there and watch the garden, beautiful flowers and fruits and vegetables sprout and grow and fill the paths until all you can see is a bounty of growth.\n\nThe wolf leans over you and licks your ear again and then he whispers in your ear.\n\n'Are you my girl?'\n\n'I am your girl.' You respond without thought.\n\nAnd suddenly, you're back in his bed, Scott on top of you and deep inside you. There's no motion, just his calm, weathered face looking down at you. \n\n'Are you my girl?' He says.\n\n'I am your girl.' The response is just as instant.\n\n'Good girl.' He whispers and his lips find yours.\n\n'Good man.' You whisper back and pull him to you.\n\nMorning comes too quickly, like it always does.\n\nYou roll over in your bed and snuggle into the cool sheets, still crisp and fresh as you've barely slept in them at all since Friday.\n\nOh God, did that weekend really happen? You think to yourself.\n\nSlowly, you sit up and ponder everything. You've had more sex... more pleasure than you've ever had over the last couple of days. \n\nYour nightie rides up a little and reveals a fading welt. Yes it really happened, and it wasn't just pleasure. There were other parts too. Some not so fun. Some things that were terrifying to you and some things... that you just had never even conceived of. \n\nAnd there was him, that sarcastic, chubby older guy with a voice like steel and a sex drive like a fifteen year old. And he just snaked past all your defences and did things to you that you never dreamed you would do. \n\nGood lord it was crazy.\n\nCrazy good.\n\nYou sigh, you're now a day behind on your work week and you need to play catchup. And this is after a long weekend where you did everything and anything and... good lord, you're no longer a virgin anywhere you realize with a shock.\n\nThat stops you cold. Not only did you enjoy it, you initiated it twice!\n\nYou wander into the kitchen in a daze. The battered little coffeemaker sits on the counter, and you absentmindedly fill it with water and some grounds and start brewing a fresh pot. It isn't until you glance in the fridge that you see the bottle filled with Orange juice that he squeezed for you by hand.\n\nIt's in your hand before you can think about it, and then you're pouring that golden liquid down your throat. It's ice cold and still refreshing, although not as fantastic as it would have been a day ago when he made it for you.\n\nYou look at the empty bottle, then rinse it out thoroughly and set it on the counter. \n\nHe's going to need to make you more of that.\n\nYou're going to need a lot more of a lot of things from him. \n\nYou stand there in the kitchen, gently running your fingers over the empty bottle, missing his smell and the feel of his fingers on your skin and tugging on your hair and that animal growl that he makes in your ear sometimes.\n\nIdly, you wonder if this is how a junkie feels. You're so far removed from that incredible sensation that you feel lost and hollow. It's almost like you've been enveloped by a snow storm in January, and you feel as brittle now as you do in the bleakest of seasons.\n\nCoffee brings some small solace, and you take a far too hot shower to chase away this lingering sensation. But even the shower reminds you of him and his brutally passionate and relentless lovemaking. \n\nYou can't stand it anymore and your fingers slide between your thighs and gently coax a tiny measure of pleasure from your flesh.\n\nYou release after a few minutes, and as you lean against the shower wall, water beading on your skin you wish he was here to rub the sponge across your shoulders and back, luxuriously wash your hair and then slide his hand between your legs...\n\nThat thought makes the next measure of pleasure not so tiny.\n\nAnd it also makes you late.\n\nCursing, you towel dry your hair rapidly, and pick out some acceptable work clothes. A sunny dress and a jacket sweater slip on over comfy cotton undergarments and you start to slip into sandals... until you notice the new toms that he bought you by the doorway. \n\nIt suddenly feels like a tiny betrayal to wear something else, so you slip out of the sandals and into the Toms. They're comfy and light and they feel good as you rush out to the car.\n\nThe trip to the office is easy, traffic is light and you realize that you're actually making good time.\n\nYou stop in quickly to get a muffin and a coffee and as you do so, your phone pings, letting you know that someone texted you.\n\nYou look at it and smile and feel lighter. It's him.\n\n'Hey Girl, thinking of you and missing you. See you soon.'\n\nIt's nothing, it's a little throwaway message. More a casual virtual wave than anything else. \n\nBut it makes that brittle ache disappear. \n\nHe's thinking of you. \n\nYou grab the phone and hammer out a text back to him.\n\n'Can't wait to see you again.' You text and then you add a smiley face with an extra big grin.\n\nYou wait what feels like an eternity, then he texts you back a smiley of his own.\n\nThe smiley is making a big hugging motion.\n\nThen he pings you one last time.\n\n'Off to work now. Catch you later Addie.'\n\nAnd with that little exchange, you feel right again. You know he's out there thinking of you, and you like it. \n\nIt's been a while since you were intimate with someone. It seems even longer since someone cared about you.\n\nAnd nobody was ever as intense or passionate or... or... as completely *dirty* with you as he is.\n\nGod this will be a long week, you think with a sigh as you pull into your office.
