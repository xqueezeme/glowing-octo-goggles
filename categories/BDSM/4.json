        "Authors note: Hello everyone.\n\nWell, my friends, the journey is almost over. It's been nearly nine years and over 100 chapters about these tables and the women they love. Again, I am so grateful to MsSensualiT for her continued help to be my second set of eyes in my friend David's absence with whom I started this journey. You will forever be in my mind, my friend, and I hope you are smiling down on me now. I hope those of you who enjoy this series continue to do so.\n\n~ellie.\n\n12 Zenati Pt. 39\n\n\"Together, Marcie. Whatever we decide to do, we do it together,\" he said, holding her tightly against his chest as the plane began to make its descent into Darwin's airport.\n\n\"Okay,\" she nodded without expression, and Noah wished she would fight with him just to see something, anything from her. \"I am barely holding onto sanity right now, Noah, and if you keep looking at me like that, you are not going to like what happens,\" she threatened in a dull steady voice.\n\nNoah wrapped his arms around her tighter, holding back his smile of relief. He had worried that the news of her mother and sister's death had been too much and finally broken her. The threat she made was music to his ears, and he wouldn't dismiss it by laughing out loud in his relief.\n\n\"Whatever you need, Kitten,\" he murmured, infusing it with as much determination as he could. \"We will find Olivia and Genesis, and then we will check on Gideon before deciding anything else. Agreed?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, but, the boys. You told Paulo?\" she asked as if she wasn't there for the conversation they had about bringing the boys to live with them rather than leaving them with the Farnese leaders or the family of the man who, while being their father, had never shown much interest in them and had mistreated their mother.\n\nPaulo Farnese had returned home to ensure his family's safety. Of the other biker's only Benji Papillo accompanied them from Alice Springs to Darwin and flew as the co-pilot to Valdemar. The others who had ridden with them had each decided to stay in Alice Springs a few extra days in case the groups travelling there held Konrad among them. So, they all checked in with their families, content that all was right in their worlds, then hunkered down in the casino to wait to be called into action.\n\n\"I told Paulo, and once this mess is sorted out, he said he would deliver the boys to us himself if we wanted,\" Noah soothed. \"His family thinks Konrad was just after your sister. Your mother was collateral damage in the end. Konrad might have been lashing out at you as a threat to return to him before he did something else. So, I doubt he has gone after Olivia as well. They are probably just enjoying the romance of sailing in the gulf and keeping their communications to a minimum.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" she whispered. The closer she came to Darwin, the more anxious she became, she turned to Noah with the one question that had plagued her thoughts since earlier that day when they returned to camp. \"Noah, if I lose her as well, then what was all of this fighting for?\"\n\n\"Fuck!\" he swore, not hiding the discomfort her words gave him. \"We will not lose her. Gen is with her, and he will fight tooth and nail to protect her and keep her safe,\" he said with certainty. \"They are both fine and will be waiting for us in Darwin.\"\n\n*****\n\n\"Vivienne, from what you have told me, those girls can outwit, outlast and outplay to be the ultimate survivor in anyone's reality or television show.\" Lydia grinned. \"So, let's concentrate on Gideon. He called you, so he's awake and aware if a little banged up. He has his family and the best medical care available. What do you think you will do there that someone isn't already doing? You will only be putting yourself in the middle of the danger and making him worry more, and force his way out of that hospital before he is ready. Don't blame Leighton for making you stay. It isn't his decision any more than it is mine. Gideon wants you here where he knows you are safe.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" Vivienne hissed in exasperation. \"It's the curse or the link between us, I don't know, but he is slipping away from me, and I need to at least say goodbye to the man I love,\" tears ran freely down her face. She could feel it deep within her that he was slipping slowly from her grasp and conscious mind. \"It's different for them. I can't even explain it. It's like there is an invisible tether linking us, and it's stretching to the breaking point and fraying at the edges. If he dies, will you or Leighton ever forgive yourselves for keeping me here?\"\n\n\"I won't,\" Rick said with a sigh as he came into the room. \"We have to let her go. It's important for them both. He won't survive without her energy and that of the baby beside him.\" He smiled gently at his sister. While not as close as Vivienne and Leighton had always been, Rick shared his own special bond with his sister, and he had stepped in on her behalf this time when his brother had seemed unmoveable. \"Teddy and I will take you back to Darwin to see your husband as soon as you are packed and pick-up Benji while we are there. His is co-piloting Marcella and Noah home to Darwin as well,\" Rick explained.\n\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you,\" Vivienne leapt into his arms, her tears falling to the shoulder of his shirt.\n\n\"Finish packing. We need to go,\" he murmured. \"It seems I made my nephew happy too. Rick looked down at the belly between them. \"He will be fine, Viv. You will have the family you deserve,\" he promised as only an oracle could.\n\n\"Okay, change of plans. What can I do to help?\" Lydia started pulling a few of Vivienne's belongings she had hidden out of small places with a look of chagrin.\n\n*****\n\nThe water police had picked up Genesis and Olivia's limping, damaged ship not too far from the Tiwi Islands. After getting treatment for the superficial graze on Olivia's shoulder, they were deposited back on the mainland, where Tullo and Quinto met them with separate cars to ensure enough room for everyone who travelled with them.\n\n\"Noah's still in the air, but they will be happy to hear from the two of you after... oh shit, sorry. You don't know, do you?\" Tullo looked at Olivia's calm, peaceful face.\n\n\"Know what?\" Olivia asked, her voice rising. \"Did something happen to Marcie?\"\n\n\"No! She and Noah are flying in right now but, your older sister, Jessa, and your mother didn't make it. I'm sorry. I should have handled that so differently,\" he apologised as she froze.\n\n\"Can we fight the Farnese for the boys?\" she asked Genesis. Of course, she was sad, but she wasn't devastated by the news. They didn't exactly have a loving or heart-felt relationship which is why she had glommed onto the attention her father showed her when she was young, she realised now.\n\n\"I am sure Marcella is already doing that, but we will back her demands with those of our own,\" he agreed. \"Let's head to the airport then, so you and Marcella can see for yourselves that each other is alive.\"\n\n\"But Gideon, he's hurt.\" Olivia gasped, having thought that was the best place to be right now.\n\n\"And he will still be there in an hour. That big pain in my butt wouldn't leave without forcing some big brother advice and a bad joke on me before he left,\" Genesis chuckled. He had been doing more of that lately as his little one started to show her true personality as last. He no longer had to be the serious hard ass with her all the time as she knew the rules now and the consequences of moving outside them. She was eating and exercising and even had a passion project with her princess stories. She was an accomplished young woman in her own right, and he was just the lucky man to stand beside her as she came into her own.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said and gave a girlish giggle of appreciation of his understanding that she needed Marcella now.\n\n\"How's the shoulder?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's only a small ache. It's manageable,\" she shrugged. \"I will probably feel it more tonight when I try to sleep,\" she admitted.\n\n\"We can check in with Helena or Hector and get you some meds to help with that,\" he suggested, \"We will be at the hospital anyway to see Gideon.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Olivia agreed. She didn't want to cause him any more worry than he already had on his plate regarding his brothers.\n\nGenesis smiled down at her bending his head to kiss her. The pain must be worse than she was letting on for her to have given in so easily, but he was glad not to have to make it a command. She was exactly the woman he had been waiting for his whole life, and he was going to spend the rest of his life making sure she was happy and content in her world.\n\n*****\n\nIt was darker than lighter now, and Armando could see very little from his perch high up in the tower, where he sat with his brother, Gianni and the white woman, Imelda, who had caused his son so much grief with her divided loyalties. Now however, they were choosing to believe her predictions as Gianni's internal radar agreed with hers. With Gideon confined to the hospital and all reports listing him as stable, Armando had his other two sons and the sisters to watch for now. His daughter-in-law should be arriving within minutes of his middle child's plane and the information he had, said the Gen and Olivia had already landed in Darwin. So at least they were all back in one place where he knew they would be monitored and looked after.\n\nHopefully, Konrad was sure to make his last stand well before then. He looked around the airport. No matter what runway or hangar they were directed to, Armando and his brothers had eyes on them from somewhere and a sharpshooter at the ready. He breathed and turned to look at Imelda.\n\n\"Why have you continued to meddle in my son's life. What is he to you?\" Armando demanded, feeling his anger over the whole situation rise to the boil again as she sat beside him, relaxed and at peace with herself.\n\n\"He will be a great leader one day. Not of the Zenati as such, although that may still come to pass. It is he who would build bridges and form alliances where there were none, and it is her who will become the hope and inspiration for the lost and abandoned, the mistreated and maligned. They are needed by this world and must be guided and protected until they reach their potential,\" Imelda said cryptically.\n\n\"In every generation, there are those that will rattle the establishment and those that will see it fall. However, we live in a momentous time, brother,\" Gianni added to her reasoning. \"We always have if you consider who our peers are,\" he smiled wistfully.\" May he rest in peace, Christo Donati predicted this mad man and paid for it with his life, but he left the strongest men to lead his tables. Who else but Joshua could have rebuilt as fast from the ashes their family was left drowning in?\"\n\n\"Peri and our own princess Catriona have done their parts to reshape traditions and outdated thinking, but it is Marcella they have been waiting for, not Emma, which is why we are here and not there,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Gianni!\" Armando barked as the man pulled out his phone and turned it on.\n\n\"We are precisely where we need to be, caring for who we need to be. If you push that alert, the younger generation will only run toward the danger rather than from it. It is meant to be this way, my friend. So let the pieces fall where they may.\n\n*****\n\n\"Speed bird 116 you are cleared to land on Bravo, repeating Speed bird 116 you are cleared to land on Bravo,\" the disembodies voice spoke to Val and Benji.\n\n\"Roger that tower, Speed bird 116 coming in from one o'clock,\" Valdemar answered quickly but pursed his lips. It was rare for them to land on one of the bigger runways, generally held open for the larger airlines.\n\n\"Noah, can you come up to the cockpit for a minute?\" Val said over the intercom. Noah appeared less than a moment later. \"I don't recognise the tower voice, and they are asking us to come in on Bravo. Idea's?\"\n\n\"That we need to land this bird but being cautious is always the best especially given the circumstances. Talk to the tower again?\" Noah asked.\n\n\"Speed bird 116, final check, in line for landing, Bravo?\" Valdemar asked.\n\n\"Speed Bird 116, you are cleared to land,\" was the abrupt reply as if unwilling to speak to the pilots or that they were interrupting them rather than asking them to do their job.\n\n\"Something isn't right, but I can't say what either,\" Noah admitted.\n\n\"Alright, be ready for anything,\" Benji said with a sigh. \"No one can be stupid enough to stage another scene at an airport after what happened to the Vitali's, can they?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't think so,\" Val agreed. Noah grimaced and went back to the cabin to take his seat beside Marcella and looked at the men accompanying them on this flight.\n\n\"Something is a bit off with the tower instructions, so be ready for anything when we land, even for everything to go right for a change,\" Noah chuckled. He clasped Marcella's hand and looked across at Whipper, AJ and Dougy, who accompanied them to ensure their safety until the danger was under control.\n\n\"Since when does everything go alright for us when you're around, Trouble,\" AJ teased. \"Don't worry, me and Douggy will get this shit show sorted out now that you have tagged us in.\"\n\n\"Ya gotta be gamin,\" Whipper grumbled. \"You two asshats, just stay out of the way and let the big boys handles it.\" There was a murmur of assent from the other two elders who had joined them on the trip to Darwin.\n\nThe landing was smooth, and they were directed by ground crew to a hanger at the edge of the private airfield.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Noah said in a low voice reappearing in the doorway of the cockpit.\n\n\"Speed bird 116; ground crew, this is not our designated hanger allow us to proceed or be run over,\" Valdemar said tersely. He could see the dark cars awaiting their arrival further up the row of hangers.\n\n\"Speedbird 116, the safety and protection of everyone using this airfield is my responsibility, and you will use the hangar we have directed you to or be in breach of the air traffic safety laws of this air space.\n\nValdemar said nothing choosing to power down the plane where it stood and allowed it to roll to its eventual stop. If they wanted the plane to move now, they would have to move it themselves, which would buy them time to decide on a plan of action. It was true this strange arrival procedure could all be innocuous, but he had a bad feeling, and the longer he could keep them out in the open, the better as far as he could see.\n\n\"Speedbird 116, prepare to disembark. We will hanger your plane as you exit the airfield.\" the ground crew said after acknowledging the plane was no longer moving at more than a snail's pace. Several small airport tugs raced toward them to assist, and behind them, Benji silently pointed out several of the vehicles from further up the row of hangers beginning to move towards them as well.\n\n\"I suggest we sit tight until someone we know shows up and sorts out this shit. Can you get a hold of anyone?\" Valdemar asked, indicating the phone in Noah's hand.\n\n\"No response from anyone yet. It's like some weird twilight zone,\" Noah eyed the dark cars travelling towards them. \"Are they ours?\"\n\n\"I can't be sure from up here, but,\" he shrugged his shoulders, \"It's a fifty-fifty bet.\"\n\nMarcella came up and stood close by Noah as he straddled the space between the cockpit and the cabin so they could all hear what was happening. He'd been speaking loudly enough that she didn't have to ask for him to repeat himself.\n\n\"I say we get off,\" AJ said into the silence. There are seven of us, all well-armed and capable. What can they do here in public? We aren't at home where no one would see, and the plane is in the open, not hidden in a hanger. If we stay like this, it's a guarantee they will tow us into that hanger and then we will be well and truly fucked.\"\n\n\"Never thought I'd agree with him, but he's got a point,\" Dougy mumbled. \"Better out there than in here.\"\n\n\"I think he's right,\" Marcella finally said after murmurs of assent from the men around her. \"Better to face what's going on out there than just sitting here doing nothing and not being able to get hold of anyone who could help us.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you have to trust there is a bigger plan,\" Benji agreed. Then he held up his phone. \"It's my brother Rick bogarting your hangar up there with Vivienne, who wants to see her husband. They arrived just before us.\"\n\n\"Vivienne's here?\" Marcella asked incredulously. There had been some comfort in knowing she was safe with her family rather than being dragged into all this drama with her. She knew rationally the drama was not her fault, but she certainly felt it was despite Noah's reassurances. Nevertheless, she would be happy to see her friend regardless of the circumstances. She drew a deep breath as the men around her formulated a plan to be safe from the ground crew they were still wary because of everything about them screamed wrong to the pilots and Noah. Marcella listened and agreed to the plan, but in the end, she would do what she thought was right plan or no plan.\n\nThe stairs from the small jet were narrow and could only be travelled single file, but Marcella found herself wedged so tightly between Valdemar as the tallest of the men who walked ahead of her and Noah behind her. She had never felt so diminutive in her life. Of course, being short was nothing new, but these giants of men dwarfed her. Sauntering, the men let Valdemar and Benji lead the conversations.\n\n\"Where are the cars we ordered?\" Valdemar asked.\n\n\"On the other side of the hanger where there is a road rather than the tarmac. If you will follow me?\" the woman who seemed to be in charge asked.\n\n\"I think we will wait for my brother,\" he indicated the black cars moving toward them. \"He didn't seem to have any problem with his cars getting onto the tarmac.\"\n\n\"Move now,\" the woman commanded, resting her hand on her belt as if she might have a gun despite them being highly illegal at airports except when carried by the AFP.\n\n\"Yeah, I don't think so,\" Benji shrugged as if unconcerned by her threat.\n\n\"Look, Sistah girl, just get out the way and let us do our thing,\" AJ moved forward, stepping up to her and putting his hand over hers before she could react enough to draw whatever she had in her pocket.\n\n\"Fuck,\" Dougy said and pulled the rifle he had slung over his shoulder forward and stepped in front of the men who had been talking to stop any further show of force by the small crew on the ground.\n\n\"Ah, Sistah girl, you all that and a bag of chips with your Bruddah's here, but you ain't nothin' to us, so how about you get out da way 'fore they run ya flat,\" AJ warned and lifted his hand from her hip taking the Taser she had threatened to use with him. He leaned forward, dropping his broad Kriol accent, \"You know most people think I'm just a clown, but trust me, if you or buddies lay one hand on my friends, I will show you what a Bruddah can do with one of these. While my beautiful assistant cleans up the mess,\" he indicated Dougy, who stood stock-still with his rifle in hand. Whipper and Henry primed their weapons at the same time, making sure these people knew they were outmatched.\n\nAs the cars holding Vivienne and the Papillo approached from further up the tarmac, the sound of a rolling door slowly opening came from the hangar they stood before. A moment later, two cars began to race away from the hanger, leaving from the rear where the road led to the highway beyond the airport. A crack sounded in the air, and the lead car careened out of control catching the one behind it as it spun, and the vehicles skidded to a halt in a tangle of bent metal and broken glass.\n\nAs if from thin air, men in black appeared. Not necessarily suits but pants and shirts and, in some cases, hats. Ambrose made a bee-line for Marcella, not wanting to use his medical skills to save her when he could help Noah do it with brute strength. It was vital that she not be hurt in the ensuing battle, no matter how small. He didn't know the why or how, but the woman was going to be critical to the future of the tables. Gian hadn't needed the Tartar to assure his brothers of that. They all felt it. However, there would be one hero today, and it wouldn't be anyone here at the airport though they would all do their part.",
        "*****\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Genesis asked. He held Olivia's hand tightly and looked deep into her eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, determination showing in her voice and demeanour. The news of the death of her sister and mother had affected her, but perhaps not in the way most people in her position would be affected. She could see her younger life so clearly now through writing down the Imperfect Princess stories. She could remember the reasons for each one of those stories being brought into being. She could remember the times her mother and oldest sister sacrificed Marcella and even herself to the monster that was her father and the evil of his twisted brother.\n\nAll of the sufferings for each woman in their family was caused by one man, who gave the monsters in her life the means to ruin their lives so completely. It made her determined to end the nightmare before he took any more from her. She may not have been close enough to her mother and oldest sister to mourn them as she probably should, but she knew without a doubt that if she lost Marcella now, or Genesis and anyone of his brothers, she might not survive the rush of emotions that would assail her. So, she was determined to see this through to the end--the end of Konrad.\n\n\"Ready?\" Dominic asked as he approached where Genesis stood with Olivia.\n\n\"Ready,\" Genesis nodded once and pulled Olivia even closer.\n\nDominic fell in beside them, keeping Olivia in the middle of them as if he alone had come to retrieve her from where Quinto had been stopped not far from the marina where he had picked them up. Most of the men had raced to the airport as if falling for the distraction there, but it was only a distraction he knew. So he slid into the driver's seat as they entered the back, and putting his faith in his brothers, he drove slowly through the city and out toward the airport.\n\nThey hadn't been on the freeway long when Dominic's predictions began to occur. First, the tyre unexpectedly blew out, but he had been driving at a slow enough pace to pull over safely. Then, tapping the side of his chest where a sheath held a black blade, he looked meaningfully at Genesis before he got out of the car.\n\nAs if in the middle of some bizarre action movie Olivia watched as the car was surrounded. It was jostled from left to right until the locks on the doors were released, and all four doors were reefed open. As they were pulled from the car, Genesis and Olivia could see Dominic lying on the asphalt, unmoving. She tore herself from the man dragging her to fall onto the body of Dominic, screaming hysterically.\n\n\"Stop, or we will kill your boyfriend,\" an accented voice threatened as she was picked up and forced to look at where Genesis was being held between two men breathing heavily.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said shakily, pulling her hands from Dominic and righting the sling that kept her shoulder in place. \"Just don't hurt him.\"\n\nGenesis wasn't sure what had gone wrong. His cousins should have been here to prevent this. Were they assaulted too early? Too Late? Were they waiting further down the road to ambush them as they drove past? He felt a rock at the pit of his stomach as he realised there was no rescue coming to save them. What had they done? What had he done allowing Olivia to be used as bait like this? He could kill Dominic and would once he got out of this, and they had both recovered. They were loaded into separate cars. As he realised he was being separated from Olivia, Genesis began to fight again until he was knocked unconscious and loaded into the boot of one of the cars.\n\nOlivia didn't make a sound as she watched everything and held the arm wrapped in a sling close to her body. She felt hollow and unemotional as she was placed inside a car between two of the men. She knew they wouldn't hurt her. She was necessary to lure Marcella to the man who wanted to use her just as every other man in her life did. Every man except Noah, maybe. She was surprisingly calm about her situation, but she reasoned that she had been in worse and survived it all.\n\nShe froze as she left the car and found herself in front of a suburban house just like Hermione's, and memories flooded her, making her steps falter as she looked around for Genesis and couldn't find him. She hoped nothing bad happened to him and realised this could be her one chance to make sure he was safe.\n\n\"Where is Genesis?\" she asked quietly, stopping in her forced walk to the front door. \"I need to know he's safe,\" she stated unemotionally. The man beside her jerked his head at a colleague who went over and pulled the still unconscious Genesis from the boot of the car.\n\n\"That doesn't look okay,\" she said flatly.\n\n\"You can see to him yourself once we are inside,\" he grumbled threateningly and gripped her upper arm, propelling her forward.\n\n\"Like you let me see to Dominic who you left unconscious on the side of the road?\" she asked cuttingly.\n\n\"Your men would have been there soon enough. They were only a few kilometres up the road,\" he said, dragging her into the house and out of sight of the neighbours without having to subdue her as well.\n\n\"So, who lives here then?\" Olivia asked, looking around as Genesis was dragged in between two men as if he had drunk too much or something.\n\n\"Airbnb,\" he shrugged. \"Why would I care or even know who lives here?\"\n\n.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" she said calmly and began inspecting the room, making her way closer to the couch where Genesis lay sprawled out.\n\n\"Well, that's unfortunate,\" a cheery new voice said as it entered the room, making Olivia turn back in the direction they used to enter the large family room. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"He had a hero moment and was reminded that real heroes don't exist,\" the large man who had forced her into the house spoke.\n\n\"Heroine's do, but you must know that if you met my sister,\" Olivia gave a short, brittle laugh as she perched on the edge of the couch beside Genesis and stroked his hair. She caught a twitch of his lips and an almost indiscernible flutter of his eyelashes, and she squeezed his hand to let him know she understood. \"So, what now? You send up a bat signal and hope Marcella will come and rescue me again? They'll be expecting that don't you think? Although it was a good idea to bring Genesis, even if the Zenati were prepared to sacrifice me, they are fond of him and will probably attempt a rescue on his behalf. So, ransom or a plain swap? Me and Gen for Marcie?\"\n\n\"There won't be any need for that. My men are at the airport collecting your sister now,\" he said as if there was no doubt of that fact.\n\n\"Oh, that was a real attempt? Gosh, and we thought it was just a diversion because there were so few of your men there,\" Olivia frowned. \"Geez, you're serious! I hate to break it to you, but I don't like your chances, so I guess we are back to ransom or straight swap if you want her.\"\n\n\"No wonder Remington made you into a brainless bimbo. You are truly annoying,\" Konrad groaned. \"I felt sorry for you back then, but I am beginning to understand his methods.\"\n\n\"You were friends with Remington and still engineered his death?\" Olivia blinked in shock at the revelation.\n\n\"It wasn't personal, just business,\" Konrad shrugged as if that was the natural thing in the world. But then, cars roared into the street, and a single gunshot rang through the air. He swore and made several silent gestures to the men in the room.\n\n\"What the...\" Olivia's voice cut off as Genesis sat up, suddenly pushing her to the ground and trying to stand in front of her, but Konrad and his men were faster. She was reefed from the ground and hurtled through the house to a garage and into another car. She could hear Genesis fighting behind her as the car door shut, and she was alone with Konrad in the back seat as two of his men took the front, and the garage door began to tilt open.\n\n\"No need to worry, my dear,\" Konrad said in his urban drawl. The car is bulletproof, and the Zenati are not smart enough to work out how to stop us now.\n\n\"It's not me who should be worried,\" she said without any inflexion in her voice.\n\n\"Oh?\" he asked, sparing her a glance and a disparaging chuckle.\n\n\"Men like you always underestimate girls like me,\" she shook her head and curled her knees under her as if to kneel up and watch the tilting garage door that would give Konrad a chance at freedom. Once she was up and in a stable position, she withdrew the black blade that she had taken from Dominic back on the side of the road from her sling and, using the momentum of her whole body, she leapt forward, plunging it as hard and as deep as she could into his chest.\n\nThe men in the front turned around as she flung herself back from his grasping arms, drawing the blade with her allowing blood to fountain out of the wound for a moment. Then the garage door seemed to slam shut as a car slammed into it, and they were trapped. Stuck in indecision, the men moved to get to Konrad from the car and put pressure on his chest. They looked at her blood-covered and in shock and left her as they tried in vain to save their leaders life.\n\nThe whole time Olivia sat wide-eyed, watching the man die, the black bladed dagger shaking in her hands as she prepared to use it again if these men came near her. She wasn't sure where to go or what to do, so she remained frozen in place, waiting for Genesis to come for her as he promised he always would.\n\n\"Hey there, little one,\" Genesis said through clenched teeth. He was hurt, but there was no way he was leaving without Olivia. \"The docs want to look us both over again, so I am going to need your help to get there,\" Genesis admitted making her turn her vacant stare to him. \"They won't let you take that in the ambulance, baby. Can I have it, please? I am just going to give it to X to look after for you, okay? I promise you can have it back,\" he crooned as he tried to pry her fingers from the blade she gripped like a life-preserver. \"Little one, do what I ask now,\" he let his voice become a little more authoritative as he had at the beginning of her recovery, and he saw her blink slowly as understanding began to enter her eyes.\n\n\"Gen!\" she exclaimed and dropped the blade turning toward him, her blood-stained hands and forearms wrapping around him. \"You're not dead!\" She held him fiercely as if she wouldn't let him go.\n\n\"I promised I would never leave you, and I plan to keep that promise,\" he said as he was awkwardly helped to his feet while Olivia clung to him. \"You are mine, Little One, and I will always come for you no matter what,\" he grimaced as he hobbled towards the waiting ambulances.\n\nThe fight had been short, but hard-fought as the last of Konrad's loyal generals were either killed or taken into custody. Those who were not so devoted ran as soon as they realised he was dead, and the Zenati began to count their losses. Dominic among them, the head injury he sustained when he was knocked to the road may not have killed him at another time but so soon after his surgery had caused a fatal bleed into his brain.\n\nRather than celebrating the end of the man who had dealt so many blows to each of the tables and their families, the Zenati's closed ranks around their injured and mourned their losses in the days that followed the final battles.\n\n*****\n\nNoah sat in a chair between the two hospital beds holding his brothers and told them his version of events from when he split up with them at the family property. He had heard both of their versions as they gave statements to the police and their family members.\n\n\"I need to talk to Val,\" Gideon chuckled. \"They actually rode into a hovering helicopter at speed?\" he asked again as if he couldn't quite believe it.\n\n\"Yeah, I realise it takes a certain breed of man to be a mechanical engineer on one of the tables,\" Noah shook his head, \"But they were all nuts out there!\"\n\n\"I'm surprised you didn't get that job after all the stunts you pulled as a kid,\" Genesis acknowledged.\n\n\"I grew out of it. Val didn't, Noah reasoned. \"Speaking of which, Val and I have a date to take two lovely ladies to pick up three very handsome young men,\" he chuckled.\n\n\"Two days only,\" Genesis grumbled. He hated letting Olivia go to pick up her nephews and attend a memorial for her mother and sister with Marcella, but he couldn't stop her from going in good conscience. The girls wanted it over and done with so they could move on with their lives, and the injuries Genesis had sustained would keep him grounded for a while yet.\n\n\"You have my word,\" Noah gripped his hand and smiled. \"Recuperate quickly, brothers, the three of those women together with Sera, and now Mother may just wear down my resolve not to get involved in the baby shower and wedding plans that seem to be starting up with renewed energy.\"\n\nHe grinned as they both complained they wanted to be involved and laughed harder as Quinto arrived and began setting up for a live feed from which they could watch the memorial, which was the best Noah could do for his brother. He stood nodding meaningfully to the two men and left the hospital. Picking up Marcella and Olivia along the way from where they had been talking with a designer about clothes for the big wedding, Noah made his way to the airport. He was surprised to see Xavier and Emma and his father and mother coming with them to Perth where the Farnese family were taking the bodies of Benita and Jessa to their final resting place. The Farnese would also bring the three boys who would come home with him and Marcella.\n\n\"Are we doing the right thing?\" Marcella asked when they arrived at their hotel in Perth, and she had time alone to think about why they had come to Perth for this final time.\n\n\"Why are you asking that now of all times?\" Noah asked.\n\n\"Well, neither Olivia nor I are model mother material. I mean, what if they could have a better life with their Farnese family, and I am just being a bitch because of the way they treated Jessa and the boys when she was in the hospital, and their had been arrested,\" she frowned.\n\n\"Firstly, they not only knew about the years of abuse Jessa and those boys suffered, but they also condoned it by not speaking out. So you are well within your rights to demand custody as a blood relative,\" he said. \"You have done nothing wrong and have no reason to be afraid or feel guilty. Those boys will love you,\" he reassured her.\n\n\"Maybe Olivia would be better equipped...\" she began, all of her self-doubt rising to the service.\n\n\"We have been through all of this with Olivia and Genesis several times. You are the best equipped to help these boys, love them, and give them a good home while still making sure they understand where they come from and where their roots lie. The Farneses' have agreed to a visitation schedule and have agreed that once the adoption goes through, they can claim the name Zaneti as well as Farnese,\" he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her forehead. \"You aren't doing this alone or making any decisions alone. Olivia and Gen will be there as well as me and Viv and Gid. Trust me. You are the furthest thing from alone in the world.\"\n\nMarcella said nothing, but she felt the warmth of those words flow through her. Then, taking a deep breath, she readied herself and let him lead her downstairs to meet everyone for a sombre dinner. She was surprised when she entered the room that everyone seemed to stop what they were doing to watch their entrance.\n\n\"The boys want a playdate with their friends, and I have some friends I would like to introduce you to as well,\" Emma said, coming to steer Marcella to a table of women where Olivia already sat flanked by the older two of their nephews.\n\n\"Hello, Marcella, I'm Ally Gambaro. I just want to say before anything else that we have set Connie and Massimo up in a nearby house with a nanny, and you and Noah are welcome to join them there to make the transition easier for you both if you like,\" Ally said as she helped Marcella find her chair.\n\n\"I think tomorrow will be fine,\" Marcella said. \"But thank you.\"\n\n\"They nanny can go with you when you take them to help out. The boys like her, and you might need some help going from none to three,\" Ally added encouragingly.\n\nMarcella bristled at what she considered a condescending tone but bit her tongue and said nothing. Then, noticing everything and seeing the signs of the trauma she knew so well, Catriona Vitali laughed into the silence.\n\n\"Ally, you are always overcompensating. Maybe she already has her own, they are her boys now, and you have to let her make those decisions herself. Between you and me, though, Marcie, I am more than happy. Matteo made me get a nanny,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Pfft, you aren't the one who needs a nanny. I think the Donati's are determined to keep poor Peri permanently pregnant,\" Connie laughed.\n\n\"I'd deny it, but I am starting to think that might be true,\" Peri laughed and placed her hands on her belly. \"Besides Marcella and I go way back, I knew her at least in passing way before any of you or even her fianc\u00e9 over there, and you don't see me forcing motherly advice down her throat. She'll work it out. She's smart, and I have faith,\" she smiled softly at Marcella then turned to Olivia. \"What I want from this meeting is to corral Olivia into a publishing deal for her delightful books and for Catriona to consider zhuzshing the illustrations just a bit to make them even more perfect.\"\n\nAnd just like that, the spotlight fell on Olivia, and Marcella felt like she could breathe again. She turned to her nephew, who was sitting quietly beside her. She considered him a moment putting a name with the slightly larger frame.\n\n\"Arturo, would you and Hadrian rather be over there sitting with the big boys?\" she asked softly, and the boy's head popped up. \"It's okay if you do, I would too if I was a boy. Do you want me to get Noah to come and get you?\" she smiled. Arturo returned her smile shyly and then nodded uncertainly, glancing at the table. Then, taking her phone from her bag, she sent Noah a text.\n\nNoah felt his phone buzz in his pocket and frowned. He had already reassured Gen that everything was fine and they were having dinner with the circle. Reading the text, he laughed and winked at Marcella and Arturo before raising his voice to catch Massimo Farnese's attention.\n\n\"Massimo! What were you thinking? No man left behind enemy lines, Brother!\" he announced and stood crossing over to the ladies table, grabbing the giggling small boys under each arm and kissing Marcella as he strode back to the men's table, depositing Hadrian in Massimo's lap while hanging onto Arturo.\n\n\"The great escape,\" Oscar held up his hand to Hadrian for a high five. \"That table is full of girl germs,\" he nodded sagely.\n\n\"See, she already knows what she's doing better than us,\" Peri pointed out, looking over her shoulder as Dante engaged Arturo in the complicated handshake he had worked out with Blaze and Cruze. \"God, look at them. Not one of them ever grew up, not really,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Massimo more so than most of them,\" Catriona laughed and leaned toward Marcella, who she was sitting closest to and in a loud whisper said. \"You know he broke into my bedroom on the morning of my wedding and then called Matteo just to tell him that he was in bed with me?\"\n\nMarcella couldn't help but laugh as Connie groaned out a long-suffering sigh, and they began to tell stories about their friends and family that had everyone at the table laughing throughout the dinner. Peri spoke with Olivia at length about her books and Catriona about illustrating, and they organised a few network meetings to catch up after the world as they knew it was the right way up again.\n\nAfter dinner, Connie and Massimo took the boys back to the house where they were staying with promises from their Aunts and Uncle to see them for breakfast. The party slowly broke up after that. The circle had all come together to support the two young women who had exposed the threat to their tables, targeting them for years and blaming it on the different factions and the other tables. They wanted to thank them and see them happy after the lives they had led, especially Marcella, but anyone could see she wasn't there yet if she ever would be.",
        "As Marcella went to stand from the table, she found Peri standing beside her. She had been dreading this confrontation all night, and she braced herself for blame and guilt Peri had a right to place on her.\n\n\"It's not your fault,\" Peri said. \"It took me a while to work that out too, and Catriona longer still, but those of us who did not grow up as table princesses all have our stories to tell, and when you are ready, I would really like to hear yours. Also, if you know nothing else about me, know that the only person I blame for what happened to me is dead now. So please stop avoiding eye contact with me. I'd like us to be friends.\"\n\n\"I'm not very good at the friend's thing,\" Marcella said softly while trying to meet Peri's eyes.\n\n\"That's okay, Olivia is, and we have exchanged numbers now, which means you have a way to contact me if you ever need to talk or need a drinking buddy or just someone to talk to when your kid is up all night screaming at you,\" she laughed. \"One little piece of advice, take the nanny. Everyone needs a break sometimes, and you don't want your mother-in-law moving in to help out,\" Peri pulled a face even though she would give anything to be able to talk with Antonia again.\n\n\"Understood,\" Marcella allowed a small smile. Peri had said the one thing guaranteed to make her take the nanny offer.\n\n\"You will have to excuse Peri for rushing off, we are still in the honeymoon phase, and she just can't get enough of me,\" Dante waggled his eyebrows as he swooped Peri up, making her squeal and began to carry her from the room.\n\nThat's my cue to swoop in and carry you off, too,\" Noah chuckled when she held out her hands to fend him off.\n\n\"I can walk perfectly well on my own two feet, thank you,\" she admonished.\n\n\"Sure, but it's not as much fun as letting me carry you,\" he grinned as he took her hand as he fell into step beside her. \"Olivia went up with X and Emma, who are not doing as well as they are trying to make out since Dom's death. They needed the distraction of being here and looking after her, but it's probably too much too soon.\"\n\n\"Fuck, I've been so focused on my shit, I wasn't even thinking of them,\" Marcella sighed.\n\n\"Well, your shit stinks too,\" he chuckled. \"They understand where your head is at, and my parents should be back soon if X needs to talk to someone. Papa is here for him as much if not more than us.\"\n\nThey travelled the rest of the way to their room in silence, and once Noah opened the door, Marcella crossed to the couch and flopped back into it, kicking off her shoes and lifting her feet to a cushion.\n\nShe needed a few minutes to get over the overload of good-intentioned advice she had been receiving all night. Noah sat next to her, so close that she could feel the warmth radiate from him to light that growing foreign warmth inside her that blossomed when they were alone. He reached one hand out, trailing his fingers through her hair until his fingers caught in the clasp that held it up off her neck, and he tugged at it.\n\nHer hair fell over her shoulders and halfway down her back in a mess of neglected honey blonde curls. Noah dug his fingers into it, his hands cupping the back of her head, and lowered his face until his mouth covered her perfect lips in a kiss that was hot and demanding.\n\nNo matter how long he had her present and willing attention, he would never take it for granted. He would savour each sweet moment and memory she gave him. He held her head and tilted her face up to him. Her lips parted for his tongue. He moved one hand down to her waist and tugged her into his lap.\n\n\"Noah, it's late, and tomorrow is going to be awful on so many levels,\" She gave an excuse that sounded lacklustre even to her own ears as she leaned back but settled her legs around him instead of getting off his lap. \"We should try to sleep,\" she suggested without any real conviction.\n\n\"We will,\" he assured her as he reached for her again, this time his long fingers moved with surprising grace over her dress buttons. Her breathing sped up as he undid them to her waist. His fingertips brushed against her bare skin and took her breath away. His hands slipped over her shoulders, under her dress, and eased the soft material down until from the waist up, all she wore was a lacey skin-toned bra. He bent his head and kissed her neck, sending a rush of heat through her.\n\nHe made her feel more than desired. She felt so cherished and loved in his arms, it was almost impossible to try very hard to stop Noah's attempts to seduce her again. He slipped his thumbs under her bra straps and tugged on them until they hung loosely over her shoulders. His kiss moved from her neck down one shoulder as his fingers flicked open the clasp between her breasts.\n\nHer breasts spilt out of their confinement, and a low, deep growl rumbled through Noah. She had the most perfect breasts. Her whole body was nothing short of perfection, for that matter. Her waist was narrow under his hands as he bent forward and sucked one of her berry-sized nipples into his mouth. Her hips were full and round in his lap, and they tilted forward as she reacted to his pull on her nipple. Every dimple and crease and every scar on her body was his to love now. He couldn't believe that anyone could ever feel anything but love or tenderness for this woman. He would never let another man near her, let alone hurt her, and he would happily spend his life being all she ever needed.\n\n\"Please--\" Marcella wasn't sure whether she was asking for more or for him to stop. His fingers plucked the nipple he wasn't sucking, and she slid her hips forward until she felt his cock through his jeans against her pussy. The bulge, as always, was startlingly large and rigid. \"Please?\" she asked again plaintively, unsure of exactly what she wanted at that moment.\n\nHe pulled harder on her nipple, his teeth biting into the tender flesh, sending a spark of pain like a livewire through her body to her most sensitive parts. She felt her panties dampening as her body responded to him and the small act of erotic pain. She put her hands to the back of his head, letting her fingers tangle in his thick dark hair.\n\nNoah moved his hands behind her waist, lifting the hem of her short dress, and she raised her arms over her head so he could take it off of her. She started to work on his shirt buttons, wanting to see the broad chest she knew and could feel under it. He helped her, shrugging out of his shirt once the buttons were undone. His chest was broad and strong. A patch of dark hair swirled over it and his torso, narrowing to a peak that disappeared into his pants. Although she wanted to see all of him at that moment, her fingers slipped down between them and caressed the shape of his cock through far too much clothing. He stood her up off of his lap and stood himself.\n\nOnce he was naked in front of her, he pulled her into a fierce embrace slanting his lips over hers in a deep possessive kiss. His cock wedged between them, pressing into her belly hot and hard. Kneeling was almost a reflex that she could no more stop than any of the feelings she had for this man now. She enjoyed the push and pull of power between them now, not as a fight but still as a struggle, and despite appearances, she knew she had the upper hand when she went to her knees for him.\n\nHe twisted his hands back into her hair and led her forward until the smooth, fat head of his cock was against her lips. She swirled her tongue around it, tasting the salt of his precum. He pressed against the back of her head, and the tip of his cock pushed into her mouth, stretching her lips and sliding along her tongue until it hit the back of her throat, and she gagged slightly before swallowing hard. He knew her limits now, and instead of moving back, he pushed forward with her swallow. Her green eyes looked up at him, but he wanted to feel those lips around the base of his cock.\n\nHe knew she could take it and didn't want to wait until she got there on her own. He also knew she secretly got off on small shows of dominance from him. He would not treat her like he had the Kept he had trained and worked with, but he was getting to know the signs of her need for more and when to back off. Finally, she gagged a little, and he stopped, waited for her to start breathing through her nose and for her fingers to tighten on his hips, for her to push a little forward on her own before he pressed deeper.\n\nHer tongue danced against the underside of his cock, sending sparks to his already overheated brain. Her eyes never left his as he pushed her down on his cock, taking her mouth. A rush of primal need pounded within his chest when he finally felt her mouth around the very base of his cock, her nose pressed into his groin. She was his. His, and he knew how lucky he was to have her reciprocate those feelings at last.\n\nHe finally dragged her back, his fingers tangled in her hair. When only the head of his cock was in her mouth, he started pushing her down again. Enjoying the wet heat of her mouth and sounds she made for him. She tried to push her mouth faster down, and he felt a thrill at her small show of greed and a need for him that matched his own for her. He pushed his cock several more times into her throat, felt her nose pressed to his flesh, and then finally let his cock head pop from her lips. He pulled her from her knees and held her against him. She was shaking as she buried her face against his chest and wrapped her arms around his waist.\n\n\"You're amazing, Kitten. So, fucking incredible,\" He praised as he petted the back of her head. His other hand slid down the small of her back to her perfect ass. \"You're mine just as surely as I am yours, heart and soul.\"\n\nHis words made her insides feel tight and hot. Like she'd been waiting her whole life for this one man who, despite everything, came for her time after time, often saving her from herself. Sure, he had been an arrogant arsehole about it at times, but she had been a one-woman army of man-hating bitch when it came to anything to do with the tables. She didn't listen to any of his warnings and spurned his help at every turn. But, even if he did deserve it at times, she still ran headlong into danger, and he came for her every single time.\n\n\"What is it?\" Noah asked, seeing her get wrapped up inside her head again. She shook her head slightly but said nothing.\n\nShe was slipping away from him, and he had to do something to snap her out of it. Instinctively, he knew that a physical release of her anxiety would help. That pain would refocus her attention and break the cycle of destructive thoughts. He turned her so that her back was to him and walked her to the wall next to the front door. His hands slid down her arms and took her hands, lifted them and pressed them against the wall, held them there for a minute while he bent to kiss the back of her neck.\n\n\"Come back to me, Kitten. You're a beautiful, sensual woman who deserves to have her needs met. Tell me what is going on in that beautiful mind of yours,\" he asked and watched as she shook her head slowly and dropped her head between her shoulders. \"It wasn't a request, Marcella. Talk to me!\"\n\nHe brought his hand down with a shocking smack against her ass. She yelped but didn't move. She couldn't have if she wanted to, he had her wrists in one hand, and one of his feet hooked around hers, keeping her legs spread wide. His big hand stung her sensitive skin, pushing the breath out of her. \"We belong together. You need to stop second-guessing this each time you allow yourself to submit to me even a little.\" His hand came up and down again quickly, sending a sharp pain through her.\n\nHer pussy reacted so strongly, that for a minute, Marcella felt light-headed. Then, finally, she arched her back, lifting her ass higher. He was right. They both knew it. It was why she had allowed Apollo so much leeway. He knew her limits just as Noah was learning them now. The difference was that Noah would never use them against her as Apollo had in keeping Chella in control when they were together.\n\nNoah watched her react. He saw the strong, sensual woman he loved push past the fear and self-recrimination. Her ass was perfect, round and firm, and now had a sexy pink glow that radiated heat back at him. He brought his hand down on it again and heard her moan. He lifted an eyebrow and did it again, then reached his fingers between her legs, sliding them along her slit and finding her so wet. She pushed her hips back toward him, trying to make him move his finger into her. He obliged her, sliding one finger deep. She pushed her forehead against the wall and whimpered hotly.\n\nNo longer able to deny himself the feel of her tight pussy around his cock, he moved behind her. She opened her legs eagerly when he pushed against them and whimpered when he slid a second finger into her warm wet depths. Then, finally, he pulled them out and put both hands on her hips. His cock found her slick, entrance like a homing missile. A cry fell from her lips as she arched, pushing back against him as he entered her. She stretched around him as he pushed his hips forward, taking her slowly and relentlessly.\n\nMarcella felt herself fragmenting, dissolving into a million pieces as Noah took her. How had she lived so long without this kind of connection with someone? He held her hips and pulled her onto him, manipulating her for her pleasure as well as his. His long, thick shaft reached parts of her that sang with the thrill of him so deep within her. Another smack stung her ass, and she was reaching for her first climax before she was ready. She hadn't nearly had enough. His fingers moved to rub against her clit with every deep, slow thrust, and she couldn't hold back the tidal wave that assaulted her with painfully sweet sensations.\n\nA deep, pleasure-filled groan erupted from Noah as her pussy tightened around him almost painfully, and he held her while she came. Her head rested back against his chest, and he moved one hand up to brush her hair back from her cheeks. He pulled out slowly, even though his cock complained bitterly at the idea of leaving its tight spot. He wanted her in a bed, on her back, her legs over his shoulders. He guided her at first, but her loose limbs made it difficult for her to follow his lead. Finally, he picked her up and carried her to the bed despite her protests. The bed had a white comforter and several feather pillows, which he stripped from it before laying her down.\n\nMarcella lay back on the bed and opened her thighs for him lifting her hips in invitation. He pushed her legs up, over his shoulders, so she was completely open and exposed to him. Noah put his hands under her hips and lifted, needing to taste her. He knew her scent and taste and revelled in it even before his tongue wrapped around her swollen clit. He moved one hand, his finger circling the rim of her asshole as he fucked her with his tongue.\n\nShe tightened her muscles when he pushed the tip of his finger into her ass, a groan that was half pleasure and half alarm filled the room. He lifted his head and shushed her, his finger not stopping its exploration. When she relaxed, he went back to her pussy.\n\nMarcella felt suspended in another world. All she felt was his hands on her, his mouth on her, and his finger doing something that she'd rarely allowed anyone to do to her willingly. His finger dipped more deeply into her asshole, and she moaned loudly. He wrapped his mouth around her clit and sucked lightly until she felt her whole body giving over to him once again as she cried out and shuddered through her second explosive orgasm.\n\nFinally, he pulled away, and his body was between her legs, the movement brought her legs up high, and he moved his hands up to her ankles, spreading her wide. He looked down at her pussy, watching his cock slide into her. He was so big, so hard, she whimpered as he pushed into her, fully sheathing himself.\n\nHe was going to fuck her hard. She knew it like she knew her name. She reached behind her and grasped the edge of the mattress, lifting her hips in an invitation of the inevitable. He had been more and more dominating, testing her limits as their relationship went from strength to strength now. And even though she hadn't admitted it out loud, she knew her body betrayed how turned on she was every time he took control and made her submit just a little more. It wasn't all one-sided, she admitted. He certainly didn't seem to mind when she took the lead occasionally, but he always managed to know when she needed to give up control and just be for a little while.\n\nNoah rested her legs against his shoulders and took her wrists in one hand, forcing her to keep her hold on the top of the mattress behind her head. The other went to her throat, not hurting her, but holding her so that she was forced to look at him, to watch his face while he fucked her bent almost in half by the position.\n\n\"You are mine, Marcella. My Chella, my Marcie and my Kitten. I want you always to remember that I adore and accept every little piece of you and that you own my heart and soul in return.\" He stated, looking deep into her eyes. This wasn't new information, but he would keep saying it until she stopped doubting the entwined fate life had in store for them. She nodded silently, her eyes wide and brilliantly green. He drew back and thrust deep to punctuate his words, bringing a cry of his name from her lips. He pulled out and pushed in deep again, needing to hear that little cry over and over.\n\n\"Noah,\" The word came out like a prayer. \"Noah,\" she repeated for him. For just as much as he was learning her kinks and limits, she was grasping his and hearing her cry his name while he fucked her spurred him on even harder. His cock pumped in and out, his hips pushing against her thighs with her legs wrapped around his shoulders. His every thrust claimed her as his. He tightened his grip around her neck slightly when she tried to turn her head. He wanted her eyes on his, needed them locked to his.\n\nShe lifted her hips slightly. Her knees were near to her shoulders. Her hair spread around her in golden curls. She was like an angel, a beautiful perfect angel. His beautiful perfect angel, just like he had always known she would be. His cock was buried deep in her. His balls were tight against her, and they throbbed, full and heavy. He flicked his fingers over her swollen clit, and rubbed it faster and a little harder. She bucked as tingling tendrils of pleasure spread out from the tiny bundle of nerves, her eyes wide but not turning from his.\n\n\"Noah!\" she cried. His name was torn from her as her orgasm took control and her hips bucked up. Her body was tightening around him, his cock squeezed by her internal muscles.\n\nHe didn't cum. Not yet. But it was a close thing. His balls ached, and he could feel his climax just below the surface, overheating his shaft. Marcella lay on the bed, limp and exhausted as she came down from the high with him gently rocking in and out of her. He still needed her. He needed her to find a reserve of strength, just for him.\n\nHe lowered her legs to rest around his waist and continued to rock slowly into her sweet, wet cunt. She pushed her hips forward, welcoming him, telling him she was ready again. He took her hard, even though he knew she would be tender by now. She whimpered in protest when he did try to use shallower thrusts, so he rubbed his thumb over her clit as he began to fuck her hard and deep again.\n\n\"Not yet. Don't cum yet, Kitten,\" he commanded as he felt her stiffen below him again.\n\nThe sensations driving her towards the brink of insanity, Marcella gritted her teeth and raised her hips to meet his thrusts. He watched her struggle to obey his command and felt the power of the moment rush through him. He had never wanted a woman, had never needed a woman the way he needed her. Her breath came in pants, and he knew she was teetering on edge. He pushed deep, fucking her, driving her higher. Finally, he couldn't wait any longer.",
        "\"Now, Kitten! Come with me. Come now, Marcella!\" he commanded through a grimace.\n\nHer hips bucked, and he arched his back, finally letting himself spill into her. Her pussy tightened and spasmed around him, milking him of his cum and demanding more.\n\n\"Mine.\" He rubbed a hand over her belly as he collapsed next to her. \"Mine.\"\n\nShe curled against him, dislodging his hand from her belly. Her body was a soft, warm weight against his. Sex between them was always intense, no matter who was taking the lead, but also very satisfying. She stayed very still, knowing if she squirmed too much, he would worry and question her, so she forced herself to relax. The worries that assailed her now were for another day. She handed those worries over to the quiet voice in her mind to keep safe until she had more time to think about them.\n\nHer hand went to her belly, and she reminded herself she had been honest from almost the beginning about not being able to have children of her own, and he had accepted that truth. So, beating herself up about it now wasn't going to help anyone. Besides tomorrow, they would be taking her nephews home, and she knew that would be enough.\n\n*****\n\nThree months later.\n\n\"Somethings wrong! Oh God, Marcie, somethings wrong. I need Gideon,\" Vivienne became hysterical quickly as she exited the bathroom to where they were doing more wedding planning now that the baby shower had been a success.\n\n\"Okay, it's going to be okay. Sera will call Gideon, and Olivia will call Helena while we get you to the car. It's probably a false alarm you were warned this might happen,\" Marcella said calmly. \"But let's get you to the hospital just to be safe. Gideon can meet us there.\" She could hear the other two women on their phones talking to the people she needed.\n\nVivienne had been through the wringer with this pregnancy and had developed preeclampsia in the last few weeks and should have been solely on bed rest, preferably in a hospital. Still, as she made it to the thirty-four-week mark, she had relaxed a little and decided a small outing now and then would be good for her and the baby, it had been a mistake, and now she and the baby would pay for it. A tear rolled down Vivienne's cheek. She was the worse mother already, but it could only get better from here, right? Marcella was managing with a baby and two little boys; she could do this. She took deep breaths and made herself relax as the car wove through the traffic to the hospital.\n\n\"I'll park the car,\" Sera offered as they pulled into the emergency drop off bay at the private maternity hospital where she was a patient.\n\nHelena was waiting with the OB/GYN they had chosen, Dr. David Woods and Vivienne was whisked away while Marcella waited for Gideon to burst through the doors.\n\n\"What are you doing standing there?\" Gideon boomed as he saw Marcella hovering near the door waiting for him. He grabbed her hand and rushed past the front counter, ignoring the nurses and calling for his cousin. \"Helena! Where is my wife!\" Dragging Marcella with him, he followed Helena's voice and the hand that flashed through one of the doors.\n\n\"Don't disappear. We need you here,\" Gideon almost shouted at Marcella in his panic and went to Vivienne's side.\n\nMarcella was overwhelmed by the number of machines that pinged and buzzed. There was a clear box-like crib wheeled in, and her heart went into her mouth. She didn't want to be here, and she certainly wasn't the best person to be helping Vivienne and Gideon deal with this situation. She was edging toward the door when Vivienne let out a heart-rending cry, and Marcella squashed all her fears and went to her friend.\n\nFrom that point on, everything happening in the room was a blur to her as she gripped Vivienne's hand through an epidural and emergency caesarean. She was a rock for her friend right up until the moment the tiny red wrinkled baby was placed on her chest for less than a minute before being whisked away and looked after by the doctors and nurses in the room.\n\n\"Gideon, you look after our baby,\" Vivienne pleaded through her tears, \"She's too little to be out here alone. You stay with her. Everywhere! Promise me you won't leave her by herself. Promise she won't be alone.\"\n\n\"I swear,\" Gideon promised, then kissed Vivienne's forehead and stepped to where his child was being tested and cleaned before being placed in the humidicrib.\n\n\"She's perfect, Vivienne. A sweet little angel. You are so very clever, and she is going to be just fine. Babies come early all the time, and she was just impatient to meet her mummy and daddy cause she knows she got the best of the bunch,\" Marcella knew she was rambling, but she couldn't acknowledge what was still happening to her friend as Vivienne was cleaned up.\n\n\"Dr. Stanley, the paediatrician, is with your husband and daughter, but I wanted to reassure you that while she is early, she is close to five pounds in the old measurements. I find people prefer that with baby weights, but that's just over two kilograms, and she is 43 centimetres long. So she is healthy, but she will need to stay in the Neonatal intensive care unit until she builds up her lungs a bit more. As soon as you are up to it, you can visit as much as you like.\n\n\"See, I told you a perfect little angel,\" Marcella squeezed Vivienne's hand.\n\n\"Can you get me a wheelchair? I want to see my daughter,\" Vivienne looked at Marcella through teary eyes.\n\nThat was all Marcella needed to become the bitch in heels she needed to be for her friend right then. She badgered and argued with doctors and nurses alike until she could finally wheel Vivienne down to the Neonatal ward, where a beaming Gideon had not left his daughter's side as he had promised.\n\n\"I'm going to give you two a minute and go out and give your family the good news before they get kicked out for badgering the staff,\" Marcella laughed. \"Five pounds, 43 centimetres. I don't suppose you are ready to tell anyone her name?\"\n\n\"I've changed my mind, and I want to talk to Gideon about it. He will let everyone know later,\" Vivienne said dreamily as she stroked the clear plastic of the box holding her baby and wished it was different. \"She is perfect. That's all they need to know right now,\" Vivienne said in a whisper.\n\n*****"
