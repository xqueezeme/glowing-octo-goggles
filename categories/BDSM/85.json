        "Chapter 22* \n\nGavin ducked under the plastic sheeting put up to protect Alex from the elements. It also kept the mural a secret. It was hot and sticky under it and Gavin shook his head as he looked at her. She was dripping sweat down her body. Her shorts and shirt were soaked through with perspiration. \n\n\"Perhaps we should pull up the sheeting,\" Gavin suggested looking at her. \"Get some air flow through here?\" \n\n\"It's fine,\" Alex assured him as she put her brush down. She saw the food in his hands. This had become the norm. If he didn't bring food down here personally, he made sure some was delivered. Either by Lena or a delivery person. Alex was now very acquainted with most of the bike messengers in the area as just a sandwich wouldn't do for Gavin. He had to send her entire meals. \n\n\"Alex,\" Gavin shook his head as he ducked under the plastic as she pushed him out of the enclosed area. \"It's like an oven in there. You are cramping at night because you are dehydrated! Working in a hot box is only going to exacerbate it.\" \n\n\"I'm trying to drink more water,\" Alex frowned as the lecture began again. \n\nHe had been on her about taking care of herself, staying hydrated. She spent evenings with Gavin massaging her cramping calves. The worse cramps were the toe cramps! It looked like the toes were trying to cross themselves for luck but it sent her into sheet clutching pain mixed with laughter. He had threatened to take her to the hospital for I.V. solutions but she had begged him off. \n\nSitting down she could feel his anger. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Alex said taking his hand. \"I'll have the plastic lifted up, but I don't want to have to scramble every time a pop up storm hits!\" He nodded but didn't change his frown. \n\n\"Now I know how you feel,\" Gavin said with a deep exhale as he handed her a water bottle instead of wine. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked him reaching for his wine that he pulled away from her and put the bottle up. He tossed the wine from the glass to the grass behind him and pulled out water himself. \n\n\"Wine will not hydrate you!\" he grumbled shutting the picnic basket on her as she reached for the wine bottle. \n\n\"But it tastes better!\" she argued. \"Now explain.\" \n\n\"I know how you feel...when my work takes precedence,\" Gavin told her toasting her water bottle. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Alex said as she dropped her head. \n\nAll her waking moments were here, doing the wall. When she got home, he would bathe her, feed her and then put her right to bed. She was almost asleep in her dinner on some nights. She couldn't remember the last time they had sex. He never pushed the issue. Instead only pushing her health and safety, taking care of her at all times, never bothering her with his desires or his needs. \n\nShe watched him. Everything he was doing was taking care of her, but she wasn't taking care of him in return. She felt guilty about it. From the way he bathed her, to the way he made sure she had food interruptions so she would be forced to stop what she was doing to eat. To the fact she was under police surveillance at all times while she was here. She had gotten to know most of Chicago's finest by now. She tried to send them away but they were always there. \n\n\"I'll try to come home early tonight,\" she told him. He smiled at her. \n\n\"Really?\" He chuckled. \"The work-a-holic take off early?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, I've been neglecting you,\" she said embarrassed. \"What kind of sub doesn't service her Dom?\" \n\n\"I'm not worried about that!\" he said sharply. \n\n\"I am,\" she said firmly back. \"Gavin, I like that. I like it when you fuck me.\" Gavin furrowed his brow for just a second and she saw it. It was so fast she barely did. He seemed displeased for an instant at her description of what he wanted. To fuck her, like that is all he wanted from her. It didn't make him happy to have that be her first thought. \n\n\"Look,\" he said forcing a smile. \"We will have plenty of time for that once you are done with this.\" \n\n\"I'm beginning to think this thing is as important to you as it is me,\" she said with a twisted smiled and a shake of her head. \n\n\"You are important to me, therefore anything you deem important is my utmost concern,\" he told her firmly. He left no doubt of his sincerity. \n\n\"You are much too good for me,\" she told him as she felt the air leave her because of his words. \n\n\"I haven't even scratched the surface of earning you,\" he winked. \n\nShe went back to work after they were done with lunch, before she left he kissed her and she pulled him on top of her and held him there. \n\n\"I'm coming home early,\" she whispered to him. \"I have neglected you long enough! I have neglected us, long enough.\" \n\n\"That would please me a great deal,\" he said to her. \"If nothing else I can get you to bed early.\" \n\n\"I'm going to bed alright,\" she smiled. \"But I'm not sleeping.\" \n\nWalking into the condo she found it dark. Her first thought was he was on a call and hadn't made it home. Her heart sank in her chest, disappointed. She turned the corner and found a candle lit dinner table. She stopped stunned. Gavin came out of the kitchen and stopped in his tracks. He tilted his arm and looked to his watch. \n\n\"Wow,\" he smiled. \"You are early!\" \n\n\"Oh my God!\" She gasped. He set the rolls down and went to her. \n\n\"I wasn't expecting you for another hour or so,\" he told her tilting her lips and kissing them. \"I just put the meat in the oven.\" \n\n\"This is...this is...wow!\" she was suddenly without words. \n\nShe looked at the attention to the romance. Candles, wine chilling, flowers with soft music playing in the background. Straight out of the 'how to sweep a woman off her feet' manual. She was beginning to think he had written the damn thing! \n\n\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" he smiled. \"While we have the time to kill...,\" he winked at her. \n\n\"Absolutely!\" she agreed as she bit her lip in anticipation of what his fabulous hands were going to do to her. \n\nHe took her into the bathroom and started the shower. \n\n\"Let's get some of that paint off of you,\" he said. \n\nShe pushed him into the shower, clothes and all. Pushing him against the wall passionately, with kisses that devoured his lips. He turned her and forced her against the wall as his lips returned the favor. \n\nHe lifted her hands and held them above her head against the wall. \n\n\"Don't drop your hands,\" he said into her ear. \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she gasped as he took her ear lobe in his mouth. \n\nHe cupped the sides of her face as he stared into her eyes. She was being set on fire by him. The way he was looking at her. The way he was touching her. Had it been that long? When was the party? Weeks ago she remembered. That was the last time they had gotten each other off. He, with her, in the bathroom and she returned the oral favor in the car on the way home. Since then it had been all about the wall. \n\nThe water cooled her, the shirt she now wore was see through thanks to the water. She watched his eyes follow his drifting hands down her body. Starting with her cheeks, to her ears then downward. Down to her throat. She watched the fire rage in him. She knew what he was feeling as she was feeling it as well. \n\nHe ran his fingers down the buttons of her shirt. It was an old long sleeve work shirt, something to throw over her to keep the paint from coating her. She watched his grin tick at his lips. \n\nSuddenly the buttons on her shirt went flying! She was stunned as she felt his power rip the shirt open. She also loved it! He used one hand to press softly on her throat, holding her against the wall. Not choking her, just letting her know she was not to move. \n\nHis free hand used the tips of his fingers to drift lower on her. Exploring her. Touching her newly available skin. Her heart beat into her throat. God she loved the wolf when he let it come out. First it was in the hotel that first night. Then here in the condo on the table. She could see it in his eyes right now. The wolf was controlling him. She was giddy about it. She bit her lip, not in excitement this time, but in a reminder to keep her mouth shut and let the wolf run. \n\nHe used his fingers to nimbly bring out her breast from her bra. He wasted no time in capturing it between his lips, his teeth gently nipping. She gasped in excitement. While he was working on one breast he pulled the other out. As soon as it was free he was on it like the ravenous wolf he was. Devouring her. \n\nThen he was kissing her, deeply, his tongue in her mouth, hers dueling with it. Her breathing erratic as he pinched her nipples causing her to gasp under his mouth, which in turn caused his secret smile to come out. Yes, she told herself, it had been much too long to not see that smile! \n\nHer body was on fire, and it was a good thing the water was on and running cold. It seemed her fire was a bright and hot as the Chicago fire. It burned an entire city, now it consumed her! \n\nHer eyes snapped open as he marked her breast with his teeth. \n\n\"Wait,\" she whispered as her mind scrambled to make sense of the images flooding her mind. She touched him softly. \"Gavin.\" He stopped sucking on her and looked her in the eye. \n\n\"What's wrong?\" He asked her, afraid he got carried away with his passion. \"Are you ok?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" she smiled. It was half happiness and half regret. \"I can't believe I'm going to say this, but...,\" \n\n\"But what?\" he asked her, pulling back. \n\n\"I've just been hit with an amazing idea,\" she smiled at him. He began to kiss her neck. \n\n\"I love it already,\" he laughed. \"I can see it in your eyes that it makes you happy.\" \n\n\"You are going to hate it when I tell you,\" she warned him. \n\n\"What?\" he pulled back. \n\n\"I need my sketchbook!\" she pushed her way by him and he watched her leave the shower dripping water all over the floor as she ran from the shower stall shedding her newly torn shirt from her body as she went. \n\n\"Ok,\" he laughed in disbelief, his hands on the wall holding himself up. \n\nHe pulled his clothes off and turned the shower all the way to cold. An attempt to quell his passion. When he was sufficiently cooled off, he dried himself, laughing the entire time. Not since high school had he been left in a lurch like that. He most certainly hadn't had that problem since he became a Dom. \n\nHe wrapped a towel around his waist and walked out into the bedroom. Alex was on the floor with her sketchbook drawing furiously. He leaned against the door, his hand across his mouth. He couldn't decide if he should be pissed or laugh at the whole situation. To be passionately on fire in one moment only to have her bolt from the shower and begin drawing with the same sort of passion. \n\n\"Ok,\" he smiled as his anger melted away. \"Do you want to explain what the hell is going on?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said again but never stopping her hand from furiously drawing. \"I just had an amazing idea for a sketch!\" \n\n\"OK,\" Gavin laughed looking to the floor. \"So you leave me in mid lechery to draw a picture?\" She rolled over and looked at him. She smiled sheepishly. \n\n\"I will make it up to you! I promise!\" she begged. \n\n\"There is nothing to make up,\" he smiled. \"It's just been a while since I have had to take a cold shower!\" He kissed her head as he made his way by her. \n\nHe blew out the candles laughing. So much for seduction tonight! He stopped as he picked up the candles. He should be pissed! He should go into the room and dominate her! Instead he laughed inwardly as he started putting everything up. Pulling the meat from the oven, he prepared her a plate and chuckled and shook his head the entire time he was carrying it to her. \n\nShe was still on the floor. Now she had several rough drafts of pictures spread out around her while she worked on another. He set the food down with a shake of his head. \n\n\"When you get the chance,\" he urged. She nodded but never took her eyes off the sketch pad. He put sleep shorts on and pulled his book out that he had been trying to read. He sat in bed with a shake of his head. Tenacity. Alex had it in spades. He liked that. \n\nAlex woke to an empty bed. She came to bed late, he was already asleep. She felt so guilty about stopping his passion in the middle of it. But what flooded her mind needed to be sketched. She wouldn't be able to do anything else until she did. But now she felt immense guilt that she failed in her duty to serve him. \n\nShe looked to her phone and found a message from him. He was on a call. She knew that. He was gone. She showered quickly and went to the wall. \n\nHe watched her at first, she wasn't painting. She was just staring at it. Contemplating. \n\n\"Well,\" he said softly to not scare her. \"That's a look of determination.\" \n\n\"Is it?\" she asked not turning. \"I'm about to do something I know I shouldn't do, but it is something I have to do!\" \n\n\"Uh-oh,\" he smiled. \n\n\"I'm going to start over,\" she told him softly. \n\n\"What?\" he gasped. \"You can't!\" \n\n\"I think I have to!\" She said turning to him with pleading eyes. \"I won't be happy now.\" \n\n\"Is that what pulled you out of the shower last night?\" he looked at her in disbelief. The wall was three quarters complete. \"You want to abandon this?\" \n\nShe nodded as she chewed on her nail again. He walked over to her and pulled the digit from her mouth and held her hands to keep her from going back to it. She looked up at him and her eyes pleaded for understanding. \n\n\"The mayor has approved this design,\" he pointed out softly. \"He was excited about it.\" \n\n\"I know,\" she said as softly. \"But Gabby wasn't.\" \n\n\"The mayor outranks Gabby,\" Gavin pointed out with a shake of his head. \n\n\"Gavin,\" Alex began slowly putting her head on his chest. \"I was never fully happy about this design, you know that.\" \n\n\"I know,\" Gavin shook his head. \"If you start over...the time involved...could you finish it in time?\" \n\n\"I don't know,\" she admitted. \"It would be close.\" \n\nGavin let out a deep exhale. \n\n\"Can you use any of what you have done?\" he asked her tilting her head up to look at her. She shook her head. \"So we have to take it back to base paint?\" She nodded. \n\nGavin exhaled deeply and closed his eyes. He knew this meant she would be here even longer hours now. He was already concerned about her loss of weight. Her lack of sleep. Her cramping. He looked back at her. Shook his head and pulled his tie loose. \n\n\"Where do we start?\" he said pulling his tie all the way off and hanging it on the edge of the scaffolding. He pulled his suit jacket off then started unbuttoning his shirt as he shook his head while looking at the wall. He couldn't believe he was going to help her do this. \n\n\"You can't help me!\" Alex gasped. \"You would get paint all over you! Your suit costs more than I'm going to make on this project!\" \n\n\"Alex,\" he said patiently, turning as he pulled his shirt off. \"Time is of the essence. By yourself it would take you all day to cover with primer what you have already done. With both of us, we could start, then as soon as the primer is dry on the front section you can get back to work and I would finish covering what's left.\" \n\n\"But your clothes,\" she protested. \n\n\"Are inconsequential,\" he assured her as he picked up a roller. He went to the wall as she picked up another. He dumped primer paint from one of the five gallon buckets into a pan. He looked to her as they stood at the edge of her painting. \n\n\"You go first,\" he told her shaking his head. \n\n\"No, you go,\" she said with a cringe. All the hard work now sat before her as she doubted her new plan. \n\n\"I can't,\" he smiled sensing the same emotion. She dipped the roller in and held it close to the wall. He could see the turmoil on her face. He put his hand on hers and then gently pushed the roller forward. \n\nThey put a single solidary stripe together. She groaned the entire time like she was seeing the worst thing possible. \n\n\"There,\" he said softly to her. \"Now we are committed. When Cortez sensed hesitation from his men after getting to the new world, he burned his ships. They became very motivated.\" \n\nThey painted furiously Alex looked over from time to time to see his silk suit pants splattered with paint. \n\n\"Please tell me those are inexpensive pants,\" she begged. \n\n\"About nine,\" he said not stopping. \n\n\"Nine dollars?\" she smiled happily. \n\n\"Nine hundred,\" he told her causing her heart to sputter. \n\n\"Shit,\" she shook her head. \"I have ruined nine hundred dollar pants because of my flighty ideas!\" \n\n\"Go check the front of the wall,\" he said not responding. \"It should be dry enough to get started.\" \n\n\"Gavin, I'm...,\" she tried to start. \n\n\"It's a pair of pants,\" he laughed. \"Trust me, I have a closet full!\" He looked to her and winked. \"Pavy told me once I was worse than a high school prom queen with all the clothes!\" \n\nShe sulked away from him to start working on the new design. She would hear his phone go off every once in a while but he would only check it then continue painting. \n\n\"Do you need to go?\" she asked him, after he texted a response. \n\n\"No,\" he said firmly, his tone said not to question him. Which meant now he was putting his life on hold for her project. \n\n\"You are trashing the whole thing?\" Lena's voice stopped her from painting hours later. She looked back at her. Lena had take-out food in her hands. Her mouth was agape in disbelief. \n\n\"Yes,\" Alex admitted. \"I had to.\" \n\n\"Are you out of your fucking mind?\" Lena gasped shaking her head. \"You have spent an entire month to get this three quarters done, now with five weeks to go, you are starting over?\" \n\n\"I had to,\" Alex said again, trying to make is sound like it was imperative that she did start over, but even her voice betrayed her as she couldn't make it sound like anything but a spoiled brat not getting her way. \n\n\"Where is Gavin,\" Lena asked shoving the food on the scaffolding. \n\n\"Around the corner,\" Alex said softly. \"Painting up the old stuff with primer.\" \n\n\"Holy shit!\" Lena gasped turning to look at her. \"He allowed this?\" \n\n\"What do you mean 'allow'?\" Alex growled. \n\n\"Baby,\" Lena shook her head knowing how that sounded. \"You are reckless at times! You dive in head first into things without even checking the depth of the water!\" Lena started walking in Gavin's direction. \"I would have thought he would have talked you out of this! He has been so worried about you getting sick down here! Or suffering from heat exhaustion! You were almost done! Now you are going to start that bullshit over again!\" \n\n\"He's been worried about me?\" Alex stopped her. \n\n\"How blind have you been?\" Lena gasped. \"Jesus Christ! The man has been making sure someone has been with you to make sure you don't overdo it at all times. If it wasn't me, it was the cops, if it wasn't the cops it was the delivery guys. Well, unless of course, if it wasn't him down here that is! I don't know how many times I came down her and he was sitting on the bench with a damn book keeping an eye on you!\" \n\nLena stormed around the corner and Alex could hear Gavin and Lena talking. Lena's rage faltered as Gavin explained. Then she heard their laughter, when she peeked around the corner Lena had a roller in her hand and was helping cover the mural. \n\nThe last five weeks Alex was a basket case. As much as Gavin tried to get her to let him or Lena help, she refused it. The one time she did allow it, she nit-picked the entire time and drove him crazy. \n\nGavin arrived with lunch but she met him with a smile at the edge of the tarps. \n\n\"Hey,\" he laughed as she pushed on his chest not allowing him to enter. \n\n\"Hey handsome,\" she said with a broad smile. \n\n\"I can't see it?\" he asked her. \n\n\"No,\" she smiled. \"I'm almost done!\" \n\n\"You know, being your Dom, you don't get that choice,\" he told her with a tick of his eyebrow in bemusement. \n\n\"Please don't?\" she asked changing her tone. ",
        "\"You know I've been pretty lenient on you, saving your consequences until you are done and what not,\" he said frowning. \n\n\"Consequences?\" Alex furrowed her brow. \n\n\"Yes I'm keeping a running total for disobedience, snotty attitude, smart ass answers,\" Gavin pointed out. \"I've given you a long leash, sort to speak, but this is getting tiresome.\" \n\n\"How many have I earned?\" she asked thinking of all the things she had done. The disobeying his rules of eating, water and rest alone should make the number enormous. \n\n\"Really?\" he smiled. She looked up at him and he winked at her. \n\n\"You're fucking with me,\" she shook her head. \n\n\"I'd rather be fucking you, but in lieu thereof, fucking with you is fun too!\" he laughed stroking her face as he said it. \n\n\"God I love your laugh,\" she told him with a shake of her head as she put her arms around him. \"I wish you would do it more often!\" \n\n\"Well,\" he kissed her nose. \"I've been doing it more since you came along!\" \n\n\"Please wait for the unveiling?\" she asked sweetly. \n\n\"Beg me some more,\" he smiled his secret smile. \n\n\"Pretty please?\" She bowed her head. \"With me in whip cream on top?\" \n\n\"Talked me into it,\" he said. \"Can I take you to lunch today?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" she nodded. \n\n\"You're shitting me!\" he gasped. \"I can pull you from the wall during daylight hours?\" \n\n\"I'm waiting for the last bit to dry so I can put the finishing touches on,\" she smiled. \n\n\"So you are using me to kill time,\" he shook his head. \n\n\"Hey!\" Lena's voice called out from beyond the tarp that evening. Alex was just walking along the wall now, touching up here and there. \"Great and powerful Oz, can you come out here for a moment?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Alex laughed as she made her way down. \n\nThe wall was done, and she happy with it. It turned out better than her sketches even. It was a good thing as well, tomorrow was the unveiling and both the Mayor and Gabby were furious when she wouldn't allow them to see it either. She wasn't going to let anyone see it! \n\nStepping out into the setting sun she gasped. \n\n\"Mom...Dad!\" she stuttered out in shock. \"What are you doing here?\" \n\n\"We came for the unveiling!\" her father said pulling her into a warm hug. In her stunned state it took a minute for her to return it. \n\n\"Oh my God!\" she gasped as she pulled back from him. Her mother came in and hugged her loosely. Alex rolled her eyes. Her mother was never very affectionate. \n\n\"You smell,\" her mother complained as she attempted to pull some of the paint from her hair. \n\n\"I've been working under a tarp for three months,\" Alex defended with a roll of her eyes. The first dig of the Mother spurs. \n\n\"You are nothing but skin and bones,\" her father complained as he took her back into a hug regardless of her smell. \n\n\"I know,\" she frowned as she nestled into his chest and smelled his Old Spice. It brought back memories from her childhood. \"I've been so busy!\" \n\n\"You still look beautiful!\" he smiled proudly. \n\n\"That's because I'm your daughter,\" she shook her head. \"You are required by law to say that!\" She looked to Lena who was smiling. \n\n\"What did you tell them?\" she asked her roomie. \n\nShe just came to the realization that she had not told them about the wall. She had not told them about the art showing, she had not told them about Gavin! Holy shit, where does she begin? \n\n\"I told them about the wall,\" Lena said with a wink knowing exactly what she meant. \"You have been down here every time they called! So I had to tell them something or they would have thought I let you join the Foreign Legion or something.\" \n\n\"Oh,\" Alex smiled. She was relieved that Lena didn't let out about the rest. It was something she wanted to tell them. But when she was ready. \n\n\"What else does she need to tell us?\" Alex's mother asked noting the panic in her daughter's eyes. \n\n\"I have a lot to tell you,\" Alex smiled but she didn't know where to start! \n\n\"Like?\" Her mother scowled. \n\n\"Well,\" Alex shook her head. \n\nStart with the easy stuff first she decided. All of this with her father would be no problem. Alex's overly judgmental, religious mother would be another story all together. \n\nShe never approved of Alex's free living lifestyle. Her stubbornness. Of living in the city. Of any of her relationships. \n\nIf it was up to her mother, Alex would have settled down with a man right out of high school. A man Alex's mother would have chosen from their church as anything else was unworthy. She would have popped out a few kids by now, as that was what good Christian women did. Alex would have been completely miserable. \n\nShe would have never left Pennsylvania and would have been in a pew right next to her for Tuesday night Bible study, Wednesday night church services, Saturday children's church and then traditional Sunday services to top it all off. \n\nAlex shook her head as she read the immediate disproval in her mother's eyes. She had seen it enough in her life to see it without looking really. The tone in her voice dripped with it. \n\n\"I have had my first art showing and I sold a few paintings,\" she told them as she could see the disappointment building in her mother. \n\n\"My goodness!\" her father gasped. \"That's fantastic!\" \n\nJust then her phone rang and she pulled it out of her pocket. It was Gavin. Holy shit. How does she handle this? She rubbed her forehead in anguish as she walked away putting the phone to her ear. \n\n\"Good evening, Sir,\" she semi whispered as she moved away from Lena and her parents. \n\n\"Why are you whispering?\" he asked her in a similar whispered tone which got her giggling. \n\n\"I've got a monumental problem here,\" she said softly. \n\n\"You are not painting over it again!\" he said loudly, then laughing knowing that wasn't the problem. He hoped. She was out of time anyway. \n\n\"No,\" she laughed with him. \"My parents are here.\" \n\n\"Ok,\" he said slowly. \"Do you not like your parents?\" \n\n\"No, I love them, but I haven't told them about you,\" she frowned. \n\n\"Embarrassed of me, I see,\" he laughed. \n\n\"Absolutely not!\" she growled. \"You are the best thing that has ever happened to me!\" \n\n\"Well, you are young, there is still time,\" he laughed as she rolled her eyes at his statement. \n\n\"It's just I don't know if you want to meet them or not,\" she said after she was a good distance away. \n\n\"Are you ready for me to meet them?\" he asked her. \n\n\"I'd love to show you off!\" she told him her smile growing. \n\n\"Ok,\" he said softly. \"I was going to take you out to dinner tonight, to celebrate your first night in three months of not having to deal with the wall, but let's have dinner at home. We can cook for them.\" \n\n\"Really?\" she asked as she began tapping her toes. \n\n\"Yeah, unless you think they would rather go out,\" Gavin suggested. \n\n\"No,\" she smiled as she danced fully where she was turning in a circle, her free hand waving over her head. \"Let's make dinner at home.\" \n\nShe was beside herself that he was addressing the condo as 'home', and that she was a part of it. He wasn't calling it 'my home' or 'my condo'. It was just 'home'. She walked back to the three of them. \n\n\"Good phone call?\" her father asked with a smile noting the dance. \n\n\"Yes,\" she smiled. \"That was the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\" \n\n\"And that is?\" her mother led on not smiling like her husband was. The smile on her daughter's face meant it was a boy. She had seen it before. \n\n\"That was Gavin,\" Alex smiled. \"We have been dating for about four months now.\" \n\n\"Four months?\" her father gasped. \"And you didn't tell us?\" \n\n\"Well,\" Alex shrugged embarrassedly. \"I didn't want to jinx it.\" \n\n\"Does this one have a job?\" her mother asked immediately with a deep frown. \n\n\"Yes,\" Alex growled. With the one question, Alex lost a bit of her happiness that Gavin wanted to meet her parents. She instantly began to rethink the idea of introducing them now. \n\n\"Really?\" her mother asked disbelieving. \n\n\"Yes mother! Why do you have to be like that?\" Alex barked as she crossed her arms angrily across her chest. \n\n\"Because the last three we have met have been unemployed artists,\" her mother pointed out disdainfully. \n\n\"I'm an unemployed artist,\" Alex groused. \"Sorry to be such an embarrassment! I didn't realize you despised us so much!\" \n\n\"That's not what I said,\" her mother defended angrily. \"Don't go putting words into my mouth!\" \n\n\"You don't have to say it,\" Alex growled, her fists balling up. \"It's the tone you use.\" \n\n\"I have a tone?\" her mother smiled. This was the same fight they had numerous times. More times that Alex could count and she was tired of it. She was an adult now. Not beholden to their rules or their desires. \n\n\"Marylyn,\" Alex's father cut in. \"We haven't seen Alex in over a year, let's not start the first day! Can we not just be happy for her? I mean, she has this incredible accomplishment of this mural. And she has a man that makes her happy. She is now making money with her artwork. In some cases, that makes her very successful!\" \n\n\"Alfred,\" Marylyn started back, tired of this constant defense of their youngest daughter. Alex looked to Lena who mouthed the word 'sorry' to her. Alex shook her head, it wasn't her fault. \n\n\"Enough,\" he said firmly cutting her off. He turned to Alex with apologetic eyes and a soft smile. \n\n\"Alex, can we meet him?\" her father asked. \n\n\"Please?\" he pleaded when she hesitated. She was thinking about not going through with it. She wanted to say 'as long as mother doesn't come', but knew that wasn't going to happen. \n\n\"Yes,\" she smiled when her father put his hands on her shoulders. \"He has invited us to his place for dinner.\" \n\n\"He doesn't live with a large group of guys, does he?\" Marylyn asked remembering the last boyfriend she had. He was some sort of poet, from what she could remember, and he lived with six or seven other artists sharing a small two bedroom apartment. \n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Alex fumed. \n\n\"Do not use the Lord's name in vain!\" Marylyn chastised angrily. \n\n\"Do not embarrass me!\" Alex warned back. \"Or it will be the last guy you meet until I have popped out a couple of kids!\" The threat caused her mother to gasp. \n\n\"Both of you take a deep breath,\" Alfred said firmly. \"You two can't keep going on like this!\" \n\n\"Sorry Dad,\" Alex exhaled. Her mother said nothing as she scowled angrily as she crossed her arms. \n\nThey walked into the condo building and the man behind the counter stood up. \n\n\"Good evening Miss Lasko,\" the man said formally. \n\n\"Good evening Mike,\" Alex smiled at him. \"Is he home yet?\" \n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" he nodded. \"Is the wall ready?\" he asked. \n\n\"Finished it today,\" Alex smiled as they waited for the elevator. \"Are you going to come by and see it?\" \n\n\"I wouldn't miss it Miss Lasko,\" the door man smiled. \n\nAlex's hand shook as she pulled her key to the door. Her mother looked down at her with an up-ticked brow. \n\n\"You have a key to his place?\" her mother asked, her words dripping with disproval. \n\n\"It's how I get in,\" Alex said sarcastically not looking at her. \n\n\"Do you live here?\" her mother asked. Alex dropped her head. \n\nRight then and there she wanted to blurt it all out. The parties she had been to. The things she had seen. The things Gavin had done to her! Just to shock the shit out of her prudish, royal highness! To tell her that she had been with another woman, that she could deep throat a cock! It all welled in her and begged for release just to give her mother a heart attack! \n\n\"Yes, from time to time. I still have the apartment with Lena and I share rent with her, but I stay here a lot,\" Alex said trying to control her anger. \n\n\"Well, that won't make my Bible study group happy,\" Marylyn fumed. \n\n\"Well, don't tell them!\" Alex barked turning to her mother. \"I know I'm a huge disappointment to you, not nearly as good as my sisters as they have done your bidding, but your holy roller friends should be used to your one wayward daughter! The one blemish to your Sainthood!\" \n\n\"Absolutely enough!\" Alfred barked. \"Marylyn, under no circumstances are you to embarrass Alex tonight!\" he threatened. \"We are guests in this man's house, therefore keep your holier than thou in check!\" \n\nHe looked to Alex and mustered a smile. \n\n\"I'm sorry honey,\" he said to her. \"I'm looking forward to meeting him...any man that can make you smile and happy is already a good man in my book!\" he told her with a wink. \n\n\"Thanks Dad,\" she smiled. Why couldn't he have come alone? This would be so much easier without her mother! She opened the door and walked in. Taking their light jackets from them she hung them up on the coat rack. She took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. This could be disastrous. \n\n\"Gavin?\" she called out. \n\n\"Hey!\" he smiled as he came out of the kitchen. He was dressed in his traditional suit minus the jacket. His face drained and it filled with concern as soon as he saw her. \n\n\"You look exhausted!\" he said immediately, taking her in a hug and squeezing her warmly. She pulled his head down and kissed his lips. Something he was unsure she wanted in front of her parents so he didn't try. When she did it he picked up that she wasn't kissing him happily, this was something else. \n\n\"I'm better now,\" she smiled. \"Gavin,\" she said as she turned putting her hand in his and clutched nervously. \"This is my mom and Dad, Alfred and Marylyn Lasko.\" \n\n\"Mr. Lasko,\" Gavin smiled taking the man's hand and giving it a firm shake. \"Mrs. Lasko.\" Gavin smiled at her while he shook her hand softly. \n\n\"Welcome,\" he smiled moving back with Alex. \n\n\"Thank you for the invitation,\" Alfred smiled. \"And please call me Al.\" \n\n\"Thanks Al,\" Gavin smiled. \"And it's Gavin.\" He ushered them into the dining room and pulled out a seat for Alex's mother. \"Dinner is almost done, here have a seat.\" \n\nShe took the offered chair with a wary eye at Alex. Alex tried to control her smile as her mother seemed surprised. \n\n\"Dinner is just about done,\" Gavin told them again. \"If you would excuse me.\" He disappeared into the kitchen and Alex followed him in. \n\n\"Wow!\" he gasped. \"Your mother looks...well...,\" he shook his head. \n\n\"Bitchy?\" Alex said for him causing him to chuckle. \"Try living with her!\" \n\n\"Pass!\" he grinned. \n\nAlex pressed him against the counter with her body, her eyes giving away what she wanted. \n\n\"Really?\" he grinned. \"Your parents are just in the other room.\" He said as she kissed his neck. Her hands running across his body under his silk shirt. \n\n\"I don't care,\" she told him. \"I need fucked.\" \n\nHe folded her arms behind her back and held them. He kissed her hard, their teeth clicking. Their tongues fighting. When he pulled back her face was flushed with passion. \n\n\"You will have to wait!\" he said slowly with a wicked smile. \"Like I have.\" She closed her eyes. \n\nAfter dinner was passed around Marylyn seemed put off that grace was not said as they began to eat. Alex could see the frown. She was sure Gavin saw it but couldn't tell if he knew why. \n\n\"So,\" Marylyn began slowly after she said her own prayer before eating. \"Alex says you work, but she didn't say what you did.\" \n\n\"Oh,\" Gavin shrugged. \"I'm a doctor.\" He said nonchalantly, looking at her with a smile. \n\n\"A doctor?\" she asked slowly, her face said she was stunned. \n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" he nodded. \n\nAlex wanted to jump up and do a happy dance right there. That's right mom! I have a doctor! She wanted to scream while she danced. Not only does he have a job, he is what mother's dream of for their daughters! A fucking doctor! \n\nShe wanted to scream at the top of her lungs all of Gavin's fabulous attributes. His affection. His attentiveness. His soft way. His generosity. The fact he gives multiple orgasms because one is such a lonely number! She would keep that last one to herself. Maybe. It depends on if her mother pisses her off. \n\n\"I've heard most doctors don't believe in God,\" Marylyn began. It caused Alex to gasp. She looked to her father for help who seemed as aghast as she was. \n\n\"Well,\" Gavin said putting his fork down to give her his undivided attention. \"I know several doctors that believe.\" \n\n\"And you?\" Marylyn asked pointedly. \"Do you believe in God?\" \n\n\"My faith is reaffirmed every time your daughter smiles at me,\" Gavin told her. \"But I'm not a church goer. I believe God doesn't care too much about churches. I believe as long as you worship him, the rest is for your benefit. Not His.\" \n\n\"No church?\" Marylyn gasped, finding a chink that she could exploit. \n\n\"Mother,\" Alex warned with her voice. \n\n\"I'm trying to get to know this man you live with,\" Marylyn told her in a half snarl. \"Perhaps if you would have told us about him to begin with, we wouldn't be finding out this way!\" \n\n\"Gavin,\" Alex began with a shake of her head. \"I'm so sorry.\" \n\n\"Nothing to apologize for,\" Gavin assured her taking her hand and kissing it. \"Marylyn is right, she is getting to know me. I would be protective of you as well.\" \n\n\"I haven't been in a church in years,\" Gavin admitted. \"But I do pray to thank Him for the blessings in my life.\" \n\n\"Is that often?\" \n\n\"Every day since Alex has come into my life,\" Gavin winked at her. Alex melted. Ok, he was not real. This was a dream. Not only was he not put off or intimidated by her mother, he was holding his own with compliments that he showered her with. \n\n\"Hmm,\" Marylyn smiled as she looked down at her plate. Alex hoped the inquisition was over. \n\n\"So what hospital do you work for?\" Alfred asked. \n\n\"I'm a private physician,\" Gavin explained. \"I have affiliations with most of the major hospitals in the area.\" \n\n\"Private physician?\" Marylyn seized. \"Sounds dubious!\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Gavin nodded with a chuckle at her assessment. \"I provide medical assistance to CEO's, professional athletes, politicians.\" \n\n\"But you don't have an office?\" she asked him coolly. \n\n\"No,\" he shook his head. \"I go to them. They like their privacy, I like to make sure that happens.\" \n\n\"Sounds like you keep secrets,\" she pointed out. \n\n\"That's true,\" Gavin agreed. \"I'm not allowed to discuss medical records with anyone. But, then again, that would be same if I was at a hospital as well.\" Gavin teased. Alfred laughed as he got the joke. Gavin smiled at Alex when Marylyn didn't respond to the subtle jab. \n\n\"Do you know why Alex has failed to introduce us earlier, or even why she hasn't mention you to us?\" Marylyn asked him. \n\n\"I'm guessing because we are still getting to know one another,\" Gavin told her with a shrug. \"We were only a month into our relationship when Gabby gave her the Expo opportunity. The poor girl has been working herself to a frazzle every day. Driving me sick with worry!\" \n\n\"I guess living together speeds up the process!\" Marylyn rolled her eyes. \n\n\"Well,\" Gavin shook his head. \"That's actually been a fairly recent thing. The condo is closer to the park, closer to her work. It was more of convenience than anything else.\" \n\n\"I see,\" she frowned. \"Do your parents approve of living together before you are married?\" \n\n\"Well,\" Gavin said softly. \"My parents would have adored Alex, the way she cares for me would have made them approve of her immediately. But, unfortunately, my parents have passed.\" \n\n\"Oh my God,\" Alex closed her eyes. The nightmare was getting worse. Can the floor please open up and swallow her like Jonah and the whale? Gavin patted her hand. Marylyn looked embarrassed. Even she could see the pain in his eyes. \n\n\"My mother died four years ago,\" Gavin explained. \"Breast cancer, something she fought for over a decade. My father four months later, from a broken heart. At least I believe it was a broken heart anyway, as he was healthy as an ox, but the idea of living without mom was more than he could stand.\" \n\n\"Alex reminds me of her,\" Gavin smiled. \"She was a fighter...just like Alex. When the doctors told my mom she had only months to live, she fought for another four years. Seeing the world with my dad by her side as that was their retirement plan.\" ",
        "\"My mother would have adored Alex,\" Gavin said again. \"She was always on me about finding a strong woman. One who could keep me interested. A girl who could keep me in line. She didn't approve of too many of my choices. Alex, on the other hand, was what she wanted all along, she is exactly what my mother described as the perfect daughter in law!\" \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Marylyn said softly. \"I didn't mean to bring up something to upset you.\" \n\n\"No,\" Gavin assured her. \"It's fine.\" \n\nAlfred and Gavin seemed to get along greatly, which made Alex very happy. They shared jokes with one another. Talked about Alex's stubbornness like she wasn't there which made her scowl at both of them. \n\n\"Where are you guys staying?\" Gavin asked Alfred. \n\n\"Oh, we are getting a hotel room,\" he said as Gavin showed him some of Alex's work he had around his condo. \n\n\"Nonsense!\" Gavin told him. \"I have a guest room here, that way we can all ride over together for the unveiling!\" \n\n\"No, we wouldn't want to be an intrusion,\" Alfred said with a shake of his head. \n\n\"Really,\" Gavin insisted. \"It would make us both happy to have you here.\" \n\nAlex just watched on in a stunned silence. When her father looked at her she smiled and nodded that she wanted it as well. \n\nAlex was naked and in the submissive position when he entered the bedroom. He stopped and leaned against the door. \n\n\"Wow,\" he smiled. \"It takes my breath away when I see you like that.\" \n\n\"I have neglected my duties long enough,\" she said softly. \"It's time I catch up.\" \n\n\"Is that what I am? A duty?\" he smiled as she shook her head but never looked up. \n\n\"You can twist anything, can't you?\" she asked from her kneeling position. \n\n\"I can twist you,\" he said coming to her and sitting on the bed. \"So, do you think your parents would mind a little kinky sex going on in the next room?\" \n\n\"You are the one who invited them,\" she reminded. \"I was ready to all kinds of wicked things to you!\" \n\n\"Hmm,\" he smiled as he stroked her shoulders. His fingers enjoying the long lost feel of her. She went prone, her hands outstretched as she put her face to the floor as his fingers walked slowly down her spine. \n\n\"I love the way your body responds to me,\" he whispered. His fingers going down the valley of her ass to her sex causing her to sigh. She was wet already. She got wet just waiting for him to come into the bedroom. Thinking of all the things she had now. With him. Because of him. \n\nHis fingers gently pushed the lips of her sex apart and entered slowly causing her body to tense and her mouth to gasp with a deep exhale. The things he did to her with his hands! \n\n\"You look exhausted,\" he said as he pulled his fingers back. She turned her head to the side to look at him. He inserted his wet fingers into his mouth with a smile. That smile. The one she loved to make him do. \n\n\"I'm fine,\" she assured him. \"I need you.\" \n\n\"Undress me,\" he said softly. She rose to her knees and then made her way to him. Staring into his eyes she found the same lust in his eyes that she felt, as she undid his tie and slowly pulled it from him. \n\n\"Will you need this?\" she smiled. \n\n\"Not tonight,\" he said as he ran the tips of his fingers around her breasts. \n\nShe set it to the side then let her fingers undo the buttons on his shirt. Slowly, one by one. She pushed it off his shoulders as he brought her nipples hard under his soft manipulating fingers. She then pulled his undershirt off and looked over his body. \n\n\"You have lost weight,\" she pointed out herself. Her eyebrows furrowing. \n\n\"A little,\" he said as he pulled her chin in to kiss her lips. \n\n\"Because of me?\" she asked guiltily. \n\n\"Shush,\" he whispered against her lips. His mouth moved to her ear and she melted into a deep sigh. The way he said it confirmed her question. \n\nHer hands fumbled with his belt, he stood to help her out. She smiled as she pulled his pants down and his hard cock sprung into view. \n\n\"God I've missed him!\" she whispered as she began to kiss the underside of his shaft. \"I've almost forgotten your taste!\" \n\nShe used her teeth to gently nip around the crown of his head. Licking the sensitive spot on the underside, just beneath the crown. Looking up at him she stuck her tongue out and licked the entire underside of his cock. From the balls up to his head. Her eyes never leaving him. \n\nSwirling around his head and then with one quick motion took him all the way down her throat. The sensation of being there made him gasp. She looked up at him from that positon and saw his head dropped back, relishing the feel of her mouth. Slowly she let herself off. \n\n\"God you taste delicious!\" she marveled. \n\n\"To bed,\" he said picking his head up. \"I want to taste you as well.\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she smiled taking his offered hand up. He got in and she waited. \n\n\"How do you want me, Sir?\" she asked sweetly. \n\n\"On my face,\" he smiled. \"I need to satisfy my hunger.\" \n\n\"69?\" she asked, her smile hopeful. \n\n\"In a little bit,\" he smiled. \"Right now, I want your delicious pussy on my lips.\" \n\n\"Yes Sir,\" she smiled as she carefully mounted his face. She put her hands on his chest as his tongue slithered into her. Her body shook with desire for him. His gentle strokes of his tongue driving her mad with lust. With each stroked he hit her clit, causing her to jump. \n\n\"Please sir,\" she begged softly. \"Can I suck him?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" he said never stopping his gentle tonguing. As she slowly made her way down she felt his tongue enter her ass causing her to gasp and smile at the invasion. She stopped and held her position on him at an angle as his tongue fucked her ass. With each deep invasion she would rock backward on his face to push him deeper within her tight ring. \n\nShe growled when she finally got her mouth on his cock. The feel of his hot shaft in her mouth had forced the growl of satisfaction. She deep throated him again as he pushed his tongue as deep as he could. His hands pulling apart her sex to allow him unfettered access to her depths. \n\nShe devoured his cock, softly and deeply at first, but more aggressively as her body approached nirvana. When she came she forced his cock down her throat to keep from telling her parents in the next room, that their little girl was cumming on her Dom's face, coating it with her stickiness. \n\nGavin slowly wet his finger then gently pushed it in her ass. She held still as he did this. It burned and caused her to hiss subtly. He never stopped his laps of her sex, but never took his eyes off his finger invading her taboo hole. He relished it. \n\nOnce he had his finger in, she began to suckle his balls, she felt how heavy they were. Full. She tickled them with the tip of her soft tongue before sucking them in gently. As her second orgasm approached she lifted herself up and rocked on his face driving his tongue deeper as her body shook with her orgasm. She bit her lip to keep from crying out, her fingers digging into his skin, leaving her own marks on him. \n\nOnce her orgasm subsided she pulled herself off his face and inched her way down. Taking hold of his shaft she guided him into her. He slid in and they both gasped. She held still for a few moments as her body had mini quakes of orgasmic residue. He sat up and put his arms around her and nuzzled her back. His hands fondling her breasts at first before he folded her arms behind her and held them, bringing a smile to her face. \n\n\"To let you use these fantastic hands or not?\" he teased as his hot breath washed over her back. He then took each finger into his mouth and sucked them slowly. Letting her feel the soft wetness of his mouth. \n\n\"Please?\" she whispered. He released them and she smiled. She gently cupped his balls with them making him smile. She began a slow grind on his cock. Her body shaking as she brought herself to another orgasm on his shaft, the sound of her wetness made them both smile. \n\n\"Taste yourself, see what I have found to be the most exquisite taste I have ever encountered,\" he commanded. \n\nShe instantly withdrew from his cock and turned around to kneel in between his legs. She took hold of his cock and stared at him with a wicked smile as she slowly took him in her mouth. Her lips enclosing his shaft, causing it to disappear from view as she lowered herself. \n\nShe brought herself off just as slowly as she realized it was maddening to him. With an open mouth she covered his lips with hers and they kissed passionately. He picked her up and slid back into her causing her head to fall to the side of his, as he held her hips firmly and lifted and brought her back down forcefully. His cock driving into her depths. She buried her face into the side of his neck as another orgasm washed out of her. Her teeth gently biting into his shoulder as her body shook. He never stopped his assault on her sex with his cock. Driving upward to push her through her excitement. \n\nHe cupped her ass with his powerful hands as she pushed off of him to stare into his eyes as she began to ride him with a gusto. Her body grinding his hardness while she bit her lip to control the sounds of her passion. His cock driving deeper and deeper in her as she began to lean backward impaling herself more and more. He ran his hand over her flat stomach as she did so, enjoying her every square inch of her body. Her mouth hung open as another orgasm possessed her. Her muscles hard and flexed as it coursed through her body. \n\nWhen she came down her eyes locked on his and he recognized it easily. \n\n\"Trying to Switch on me?\" he laughed. \n\n\"No Sir,\" she smiled easing back, her face hanging just inches off his, her hair surrounding their faces. \"I want your cum!\" \n\nHe grinned as she began to fuck him harder. He slipped his finger back into her ass and this caused both of them to gasp in pleasure. He could feel his cock as she rode him now. She was stretched to, what she thought, was the limit! \n\n\"Do you want my cum, Little One?\" he asked her as he sat up holding her ass in his hands as she rode him. His lips kissing her deeply. She wrapped her legs around his back holding him tightly. \n\n\"Yes Sir!\" she gasped. \n\n\"Beg for it,\" he whispered in her ear. \n\n\"Please Sir,\" she grunted as she rode him. \"Give me your cum!\" \n\n\"More,\" he demanded. \n\n\"Please! I want it!\" she said in between her grunts as he thrust upward into her. \n\n\"More,\" \n\n\"Cum for me Sir!\" \n\n\"How much do you want it?\" \n\n\"Please!\" she begged against his lips. His mouth found her nipples and his teeth nipped there. \n\n\"Fuck yes,\" she gasped. \"Please! Cum for me! Give me your precious seed!\" \n\n\"Cum, for me, PLEASE!\" she gasped as she looked into his eyes. Her voice was raising and he began to kiss her as his orgasm approached. \n\n\"You are going to cum for me!\" she smiled as she recognized it. He nodded and laid back and she doubled her speed. She watched him carefully as he held onto her hips. \"Cum Sir! Shoot your hot cum for me!\" She continued to beg. \n\nRight as his orgasm was about to explode she hopped off his cock and slid down to take his cock in her mouth. He lifted his head and watched her drink greedily as wave after enormous wave exploded from his cock. She could feel the cum surge through the vein on the underside of his cock. It throbbed against her bottom lips as she held his cock with her mouth. \n\nShe struggled with his cum, as it quickly filled her mouth with its salty flavor. She swallowed multiple times but some still managed to leak out of her mouth around his cock as she pulled his cock with her small hand, jerking his cum into her. \n\nOnce his orgasm abated she swallowed what she had left in her mouth, then began to lick the cum off her hand. The small amount which had escaped from the mouth because of the copious amount he erupted with overflowed and caught there. \n\nHe watched her as his breathing came back to him. She looked absolutely beautiful there, his cum on her lips and chin. Her tongue licking it off her hand. \n\n\"Thank you Sir!\" she smiled as she suckled him clean. \"I needed that!\" \n\nHe pulled her up and spooned with her. His cock against her back as she wrapped her arms around his. He kissed the back of her head and inhaled her scent. That made his secret smile come out. The smell of her, in his nose. Like a rose, its sweet scent leading him to a lullaby. \n\nThe next morning, Alex stood nervously to the side of the tarp. The crowd was growing by the minute. Gabby had come over and tried to peek but Alex shooed her away. Gavin and her parents sat in the front row. Her dad and Gavin chatting amiably. Her mother scowling at her from time to time. \n\nShe had been short with Alex all morning. Alex wondered if she heard their lovemaking in the next room. At the time, when they were in the throes of their passion, she didn't care. But in the morning she wondered if she was able to keep quiet enough. Her father told her not to worry about her mother's poor mood and to not let it bother her special day. This day was about her, not her mother, he told her with a kiss. \n\nThe Mayor stood at the lectern and gave a brief speech before he introduced Alex who approached nervously. She had the notecards of her speech in her quaking hand. She was never good at public speaking, and this large crowd was causing her knees to knock. \n\n\"Thank you Mr. Mayor,\" she said adjusting the microphone to fit her short height. \"Good morning,\" she said to the crowd as all eyes fell on her. She took a deep breath and looked to Gavin who gave her a wink for courage. \n\n\"I would like to thank a few people before we unveil the wall,\" she began slowly, her nervousness causing her voice to shake slightly. She hoped it wasn't too noticeable. \n\n\"First, I would like to thank the Mayor for giving me this opportunity. I would like to thank Gabby Battera, who discovered me and gave me this once in a lifetime opportunity. I would like to thank Maole Cardo for giving me my first art showing where I would meet Gabby,\" she took a deep breath as she shuffled her cards. Her heart nearly stopped as the cards nearly exploded from her hand in a shower of white paper. She gathered her composure before beginning again. \n\n\"I would like to thank my roommate Lena Anderson, who supported this artist when she couldn't pay her half the rent. Which was a lot!\" Alex said with a smile. \n\nThis got the crowd to laugh and Alex was happy about that because it got her to relax. She let the laughter die down before beginning. She could hear her heartbeat in her ears. She took a deep breath before continuing. \n\n\"I would like to thank my parents, who are here today from Pennsylvania to see this moment,\" she said looking at her father as he wiped a tear from his eye. \n\n\"My Dad taught Art to high school students back home, which included me. He always told me I had to pay my dues for the things I wanted. As I stand here today, I realized something. I realized that I didn't pay them alone, he paid them with me. I am humbled by that fact. Dad, this is what you brought to life!\" she said with a wave of her hand to the unseen wall. \n\n\"To do something like this, a lot has to happen,\" she adlibbed. \"You have to be a good artist, you also have to be in the right place at the right time. But most of all you have to have a strong group around you who believe in you and support you. I have that. In Lena and my father, and then in one more person who God has graced me with.\" \n\n\"So lastly, but certainly not least,\" she said taking a deep breath as her father's tears of pride caused her voice to break. \"As I said, no one does something like this alone, I have listed several people that were instrumental, but none are more important than the man who has stolen my heart! He stood by me...and when I thought I couldn't do this, he said I could. When I wanted to change my mind about what to put on this wall, he stood by me and helped. All the hours I spent here, he made sure I had all I needed. He encouraged me every step of the way, sacrificing things that I will never be able to repay. He made sure I had everything. From dinners, to a shoulder to rest on when I needed it. To a simple wink of encouragement.\" \n\n\"I know I most certainly would not be here if not for him,\" she looked down at her notes. Her heart beat impossibly fast. She was unsure how he would respond to being singled out like this. He was always low key. He would never have allowed this if he knew she was going to do it. \n\n\"Thank you Gavin, for all you have given me, for all you have done for me and for all you have introduced me to. Without you, I'm not here. Without you I wouldn't have had the strength to do this. Without you I wouldn't have met Maole. Without you...I wouldn't know what it is like to fall...in love. I love you.\" \n\nThe words tumbling from her lips surprised even her. She had no idea she was going to say them. They weren't in her notes. They were just there. On her lips. Then in the open for all to hear. She quickly turned to the mayor. \n\n\"Mr. Mayor, will you do the honors?\" she smiled at him. Her heart beating fast in her chest. \n\n\"Absolutely!\" he said as he got up to pull the rope to reveal the wall to everyone. Alex stole a peek at Gavin to see his reaction to her bold proclamation. She didn't know why she even said it. It just felt right to say. But now she was afraid it would scare him off. \n\nGavin was saying something to her father, then looked to her with his eyes. She couldn't read him. \n\nThere was a loud round of applause, and a mix of oohs and aahs. The crowd stood and applauded boisterously. She smiled with pride as she let out a breath of relief."
