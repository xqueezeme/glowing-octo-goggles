        "\"Why?\" Mikael could not stop himself from demanding. Last time he had known. She thought he was the weakest link, wanted to try and manipulate him into helping her escape. But he was certain after his little lesson with knife play and edging, she would never again call him to her bed. And that was fine by him, he allowed that little voice to lie. \n\nThe thing was...the way she said it. So loud. So clear. It was as if she had actually meant it. As if he really was her choice. But he knew that was not possible. Or was it?\n\nHe covered the distance between them, until he loomed large over her. \"What? You want to taste more of the bad boy, Kirsty? Feel my knife drawing patterns on that damned ivory skin? Or maybe you need me to edge you a bit more this time? Push you higher and higher, closer and closer, but not let you quite get there...until I am ready that is?\"\n\nHe loved the way her cheeks and neck could flame as brightly red as her hair. \"What? Is baby brother's knight in shining armor routine wearing thin? He not spending enough time with his pretty face buried between those soft thighs?\"\n\nHer quick intake of breath, the way she shifted her weight from foot to foot and steadfastly stared at the floor gave him his answer. \"Of course, we both know big brother only has one thing on his mind right now. Breeding his baby into your fertile little cunt,\" he allowed his hand to drift lightly over her lower abdomen. \n\n\"Don't worry though. I have no interest in joining my brothers in sperm wars. One child is enough for me.\" This time he did not allow her to hide from him as he lifted her chin until their eyes met. \"I have other things in mind for you, dear wife,\" he spat the words with all the vitriol he felt. \"Strip!\"\n\nShe shook her head or tried to as much as his fingers upon her chin allowed. \"No is not an option now. You chose me. You follow my orders this night.\" That thought alone should be enough to insure that this was the last time she called him. \n\nBut he was not ready to keep things so simple, \"You have two choices now. One you strip like I told you.\" He trailed the finger of his other hand from her cheek down her neck to the deep V of that damned jumper that plunged so fucking low to reveal the soft swell of her tits. \"Or I cut them off you,\" he whispered almost against her lips. \"And you know I will too.\"\n\nHis hand trailed lower to the underside of her breast. He cupped it a squeezed firmly. She gave a sweet gasp and jumped just a bit, enough to tell him that he had her full attention now. \"Of course, I might not want to play 'daddy roulette' with my brothers, but that does not mean I won't enjoy the fruits of their labors. These tits will be absolutely mind blowing once you get pregnant. And nursing their son? Fuck woman, with these...well, I am sure the little one won't mind sharing every now and then.\"\n\nHe chuckled at how wide those expressive eyes could get. So he had managed to shock her, he liked it. He wrapped his arm about her waist and bent his head. He used his tongue as he would his knife to draw a winding trail across her alabaster skin. He could spend hours playing connect the dots with those freckles and his knife. \n\nHe shook his head, reminding himself that was not the point. If her first taste of the bad boy had not been enough to scare her off, then her second would surely be. And that was what he wanted, right? To be left the fuck alone. As long as she was good to his child...what the fuck did he care about light brown dots that cried out to his warped mind to find patterns in their starry skies?\n\nHad he not learned anything the first time? Marriage was not for him. If he could not be enough for Greta in a 'real' marriage, what kind of fucking chance did he stand in this fucked up 'tradition' that passed as one in his family? No, it was not a game he wanted to play. \n\nHe had enough trouble just stepping out of Sven's shadow on \u00c6gir's Captive...with his father and their uncles. Of course, baby brother had always been the ladies' favorite whether with their mother or in the clubs they sometimes frequented. What would it take for him to learn? Hell, he could not even manage to earn his own child's love and affection. Let alone this woman's...any woman's. \n\nHe released her and stepped back. No, better to keep his distance. To make sure that she was never again tempted to 'choose' him. \"I said strip and if you are not naked when I get back, then I hope you do not like that outfit. You have already cost Bjorn his favorite shirt.\" He reminded her of how he had cut his brother's shirt off of her the last time. He left the rest to her imagination...a mind fuck...as he turned his back to her and walked over to the trunk against the wall. \n\n***\n\nKirsty's fingers trembled as she reached for the bottom of her jumper. Why did this man demand so much? Why the naked thing with him all the time? Sure, she had ended up naked in Sven's bed that first time, but considering the man's penchant for corsets and stockings, that had probably been more about making it harder for her to run away. \n\nAnd while Bjorn might have softened his command to put on his shirt that first night with the reminder that she would not go naked to any other first date, some part of her still could not help but see it as a rejection of her plus-sized body...especially from him. Hell, that shirt had stayed on the whole rest of that night...even when he...when they...\n\nBut time was ticking away as she watched him rummaging through that 'pirate's chest.' And she had no doubt that he meant what he said. So why did her nipples get painfully hard inside her bra at the thought of his knife cutting it away? Of its blade trailing across her breasts...she tossed the jumper on that chair, which looked more like a throne. Her bra followed quickly. \n\nHer breasts felt painfully tight as she remembered his words earlier. How the hell had he managed to make something like pregnancy and breastfeeding sound so fucking erotic? Oh, she knew that it was to some men. Hell, she had cruised the fetish list at that site. Of course, that was one that she would have categorized as...your kink is not my kink. Until she saw the look in those eyes. For a moment they had even softened to that wispy grey of a partly cloudy day.\n\nHer fingers fumbled with the button on her denim mini-skirt. Maybe he was one of those types? Maybe he had acquired a taste for such things when his wife was pregnant with Monika? But still how could he find a pregnant woman sexy if the baby was not his?  \n\nAnd why did his assertion that he would not be joining the 'sperm wars' as he so indelicately named it bother her? Wasn't she having a hard enough time with the concept of just contemplating whether or not she might be pregnant? Let alone the burning question of Sven or Bjorn? What was wrong with her that some part of her felt bereft that the child could not be Mikael's?\n\nShe tried to push those thoughts away as easily as she pushed the skirt and her tights down her legs. She saw him rise from where he had knelt upon the floor. His hand was behind him so she had no idea what was in it as he walked towards her. She quickly tossed the skirt and tights towards the 'throne' but they fell short and landed on the floor at its base. \n\nHer eyes widened as she noticed those same thick metal rings through the mouth of dogs which curved upwards at the end of each arm. And another at the top of the damned thing. The roughhewn furnishings and dark panelling as well as the low lighting gave this place the feel of a... But what did she know? She had only read about such places in her books. \n\nHe laughed and the sound reverberated around the room. \"How the hell did you ever survive out there in the real world? Anyone could read you. Every fucking thought you have, it is all right there in your face. In those eyes,\" he said as he came to stand once more in front of her. \n\n\"To answer that question...yes. An ancient and probably priceless one. Hell, big brother could quit worrying about fishing if we ever decided to put this furniture on the market. None of us even know how old the damned things are; hundreds of years old for certain. But yes, those rings are meant for one thing and one thing only...to tie our captive brides to us.\"\n\nKirsty gasped then, \"Oh that one is truly priceless, Kirsty. Yes, as much as my beloved brothers want to ignore it and pretend that it is not so, the way that my father looks at her sometimes leaves me very little option when it comes to overlooking the obvious truth. That our beloved and saintly mother was...or maybe still is...just as kinky as you are, my dear wife.\"\n\nKirsty shook her head. So she and Petrine had spent the afternoon discussing the 'facts of life' or more accurately the basics of polyandry. How it was possible for one woman to love more than one man. And while the topic of conversation itself had not been easy, considering her own mother's idea of 'the talk' had been to hand her the standard, NHS approved leaflet on puberty, menstruation, and how babies were really made with a healthy dose of how not to make them thrown in for good measure. \n\nShe knew that Petrine sensed her discomfort a couple of times, she even commented on it once...something about she would keep it to the PG-version. They had certainly not talked about... About BDSM. About bedrooms that looked more like dungeons. Or anything of the kind. So perhaps like Sven and Bjorn, she could hope...believe...\n\nBut the twinkle in the woman's eye when she looked across the table at Olaf sometimes. Of course, the hardest part for Kirsty was reconciling the strong, stalwart woman with submissive. While the two women had taken markedly different paths and Petrine had a true warmth and openness that Nancy Dickens never would, her mother and mother-in-law were more alike than she wanted to think about. She simply could not imagine the woman kneeling for any man...no matter how handsome or strong her Norse fishermen might have been.\n\n\"No,\" she shook her head and whispered.\n\nMikael chuckled more softly this time. The sound brushed her cheek as he leaned in, \"I have no desire to talk or think about my parents' kink or what they might or might not have done in this bed right now either.\" \n\nHer eyes grew wider as she caught the glint of the pale light on his knife. Her heart pounded and her nipples tightened so painfully that she bit her lower lip as he ran the tip across her bare shoulder. \"Someone does not understand what the word 'naked' means.\" Before she could open her mouth to protest, the edge of the blade was between her skin and the sheer lace of the knickers which matched her bra. \n\nWith a quick jerk the materials fell lose. He repeated the action on the other side. \"Spread your legs, slut.\"\n\nKirsty had begun to realize that Bjorn might be right, that she might need to add 'dirty talk' to her fetish list. Although something told her that profile would be or maybe even had already been hacked. It would disappear from that site as surely as she had from her old life. \n\nBut she was not prepared for what that word did to her. Neither Bjorn nor Sven had used that terms. But if pussy, cunt, cock, twat and their vivid descriptions of all the very naughty things they were going to do to her made her wet...that word practically made her knees buckle. She knew that she should be offended. Perhaps even a tiny corner of her brain still was. But the way he said it. \n\nHe sighed as he leaned in even closer. \"Is something wrong with your hearing, slut? I said open those sweet thighs. From now on panties...knickers, you call them? They have no place in this house. Your cunt will be open, bare, for us. Do you understand me?\" \n\nKirsty swallowed the knot that was choking her as she obeyed. The scrap of lace and elastic fell into his hand. He brought it to his face. She held her breath and the room began to spin as he placed it over his nose and inhaled. \"Wet and ready already, my sweet whore wife?\"\n\nHe tossed the scrap away without even looking where it might have landed. He shoved her back onto the bed. Those eyes were once again as dark as the blackest storm as he leaned over her. Her heart thudded with fear...and excitement...as she climbed on to the bed and scooted backwards until her head hit the solid wood of the headboard. \n\nBut he simply followed her, crawled inch by inch across the mattress, looming larger than life, his eyes holding her gaze the whole time. She put up her hand then, reaching for his chest, thinking that perhaps she could try talking...reasoning with him...somehow. But suddenly the rope that had held the curtains back was about her wrist as he cinched it tighter, drawing her arm back to rest against the headboard. \n\nShe shook her head and tried to reach for it with her other hand, to loosen the bond. But that only made it worse as he captured that hand as well. He wedged his large body more fully between her thighs, spreading them apart...though not as indecently as the spreader bar that he had that first night. \"Mikael, please...\" she began.\n\nHis knife blade lay flat over her lips, \"Too late for talking, Kirsty. The only words that matter this night you said already...'I chose Mikael.' Everything after that is no longer yours to decide. Did my sweet mother forget to mention that part of this warped tradition? Oh, she likes to think that choice is some kind of special gift, but the truth is...it is just a matter of to whom you surrender. But you very much surrender...submit...with those words.\" \n\n\"And tonight...if never again...you choose to submit to me and I intend on pushing you beyond any limits you ever imagined. Make this a night that you will never fucking forget, dear wife.\" Kirsty wished with all of heart that her hands were not tied then. Not for the reason he might have thought. Though his words were harsh, his tone guttural, she was almost certain the man had no idea how much of his pain he truly revealed with them. If he had, he would have never said them. \n\n'If never again' alone told her all she needed to know about this man...and come what may...no matter what his worse was...no matter what...she promised herself that she would not prove him right again. Not this time, not with her. \n\nShe sighed and there was only one way to accomplish that. Surrender. Fully. Completely. Totally. Not just the easy part of her. Not just for her pleasure. Not out of curiosity about this lifestyle that she knew next to nothing about except what she had read in those books. No, her submission was the only way. And slim hope that it was, it was still better than none. \n\nShe closed her eyes for a moment. She sought something deep inside of her. A place she had never gone before...not with Sven...not even with Bjorn. A place that was frightening in and of itself. A place where she was even more vulnerable than her naked body on display for this man. She willed herself to fight through all the doubts, all the insecurities, all those voices that warred in her mind. \n\nShe willed them quiet. She found the peace in surrendering herself. It was strange...odd did not begin to cover it...but the words that flitted through her brain were those that the priest would say as she knelt for assembly on Friday mornings... 'Not my will, but thine be done.'\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, they boldly met his as she whispered the two magic words he needed most then...\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\n***\n\n'Fuck her,' his mind scream. That was not the response he wanted. Fear. He wanted to see that fear in her eyes again. That he could handle. Not this. This...willingness. But she would not get off so easily this time. \n\n\"Kirsty, you know there are other options, things I can do to that responsive little body of yours,\" his eyes held the challenge. \"Last time I edged you. Pushed you right to the point and then denied you.\" \n\nHe bent lower and took one of those impossibly hard nipples between his teeth. He bit down upon it to test the lengths to which this woman was prepared to go. While she jumped and squealed at first contact, he felt her body go limp beneath his, the fight drain from her. He wanted that fight, so he fought back harder, pushed more.\n\n\"Maybe this time instead of edging you, I'll try forced orgasms. Making you come over and over and over again until your body cannot take anymore. Would you like that, dear wife? Would you like me to play this sweet body,\" his hand trailed over her soft skin. He watched tiny hairs stand upon end and felt her shiver. But when he looked back in those damned expressive eyes of hers, it was not fear that he saw but need...pure lust. \n\n\"You would. You would like to come and come all over my face, wouldn't you? You loved having that sweet pussy eaten, didn't you?\" There it was, that look, maybe not fear, but embarrassment. She even started to turn her head in denial, but she could not. Instead she dropped his gaze and whispered, \"Yes Sir,\" once more. It fuelled his fires. \n\n\"That is not enough though, I want more this time. I am going to make you come so fucking hard that you squirt.\" That did it. Those eyes snapped back to his and blazed...that fear...and its light twin excitement. \"Oh, I see you have been exploring the dark side. Reading Popular Kink, were we? Heard all about women who come so hard that their pussy juice gushed like a river from their cunts?\"\n\nHe reached up and laced his fingers through her hair. He pulled hard until her head banged against the headboard, \"You would not mind seeing me drowned, would you? Go ahead, I dare you, wife, drown me in your sweet cunt juices.\" He could see her chest rising and falling so quickly that he doubted that any true oxygen exchange was possible. \n\n\"Why wait? It is not like you need me to play with my knife to get you warmed up now is it? I bet that if I put my hand between your legs you would be soaking wet already? Aren't you, my sweet slut wife? You can't wait for the bad boy to use you, can you?\" he demanded, not expecting a response.\n\n\"No Sir. Use me. Take me. Do what you want with me,\" she whispered breathlessly.\n\nIt was a challenge, like waving a damned red cape in front of an angry bull. She had no idea what he wanted. But before this night was over he would show her. \n\n\"Open your fucking legs for me, slut,\" he savored the tiny hesitation. Was it because she was embarrassed at how accurate his assessment was? Or was it that word? \n\nHonestly, he had been surprised that she had not objected to it. But he recognized the slight cringe each time he used it. He knew he probably should not. Knew that she was not one of his whores, or the wizened subs that he met online or in the clubs. They were easy. Safe. This woman was neither. But perhaps if he used that word often enough, he could make himself forget that.\n\nBut she did not hesitate long as those sweet thighs spread open to him like doors opening on a palace. He matched actions to words as his fingers found the slick folds of her cunt. She was most definitely wet. But not wet enough. \n\nHe pushed his fingers deep inside of her and watched those eyes widen as a soft moan escaped her throat, then they shut. Those expressive blue pools were denied him. He pressed the heel of his hand hard against her mound. He could almost feel her clitoris throbbing beneath his touch. It was not his main interest at the moment though. \n\nIt did not take him long to find the thick ridge of tissue, the nerve center of her sweet pussy, her G-spot. He was not gentle, that was not what this job needed, as his fingers lunged against it, putting pressure upon it. Pressure, release, pressure, release. But this one did not need a huge warm up. Her body knew what it wanted as her hips arched up off of the bed. \n\n\"That's my good slut. Come for me. Come harder than you ever fucking have,\" he was tired of the games with this woman. He knew what he wanted. He shifted position on the bed so that he lay on his stomach between those soft ivory pillows. He did not allow her to come down from that pinnacle though as his fingers plunged in and out, out and in. ",
        "He felt the muscles inside her cunt squeezing. He could not help but imagine what that would feel like around his cock. 'Damn her,' he would not allow himself to go there. Not with her. Not with his wife. He would not let another one lie and use him. He would not be vulnerable like that...ever again.\n\nHe bent his head. Buried his face next to his hand. His tongue had no problem whatsoever finding what it sought. The damned thing was swollen and impossibly hard. He bit down around the tender flesh for a moment. Held it captive between his teeth, just as she was their captive. He swirled his tongue around and over it. The damned thing was almost as hard as his own teeth around it. His fingers kept up the deep, fast pace that was careening this woman straight towards what he wanted most. \n\nDamn it. Still it was not enough. If he would not allow himself to bury his hard cock inside of her, then the least he could do was substitute his tongue. Tongue fuck her and taste those pussy juices from the very source. He pushed her thighs back, angled her hips and tried to get a better position. But she was moving too much. He could not get the angle he wanted.\n\nHe slapped her ass cheek, \"Be still, bitch.\" Her body jumped in his hands. He used his hand once more to lift those sweet cheeks, tilt her pelvis up to meet his mouth. The problem was to get just the right position he needed both hands. But then his fingers could not be buried knuckles deep in those wet folds, pushing her higher and higher. \n\n\"Fuck,\" he spat around the hard throbbing flesh between his teeth. He needed more hands. And while he knew where four more could easily be found. He was in no fucking mood to share. \n\nHonestly, he might not ever be. It was not like after this, he would get the chance very often. Only when she got desperate enough for a taste of his darkness. There was no fucking way he was going to share even one of those rare occasions with his brothers. \n\nBesides, she was barely coming to terms with their fucked lifestyle as it was. There was no way she was ready for that kind of thing. He frowned...would he ever be? Probably not, but he would think about that later. He was not going to waste what precious time he had with her...thinking about his brothers. \n\nBut there was another option. Reluctantly, he abandoned his efforts. Those eyes flew open the moment he released her sweet cunt. He wanted to laugh at the very pouty face she made...as if someone had stolen her favorite toy. He shook himself; he would never be that. He was merely the bad boy. The middle one as always.\n\nHe was not sure if it was that thought or the need to wipe the pout off her pretty face which made him slap her mound. He smiled at his near perfect aim as the tender flesh pinked. As worked up as she was, he knew that the blow landed right on her swollen clit. The shocked and pained expression only confirmed that fact. \n\n\"Don't go anywhere,\" he joked as he stared at her bound wrists. Her skin looked so fucking pale against the dark wood. He scooted off of the bed and knelt before the trunk once more. While the tiebacks for the drapes might be long enough to secure her hands, it would take a longer length of rope for what he had in mind this time. But it was no problem finding that. \n\nHe smiled at the length of soft flexible leather, which caught his attention as well. Leave it to baby brother to make sure the damned toy box was nicely restocked for them. But then again, the kid had been planning this for at least a year. \n\nHe still could not figure out why his baby brother wanted any of this. With his face and body, he could have easily been a male model or actor. With his fucking brain, he could have gone to just about any university in the world. Why the fuck did he stay? And especially, why the fuck would he 'want' this sharing crap when he could have any fucking woman he wanted...all to himself? \n\nMikael stopped that line of thought before it went in a very dark direction. Right now the only thing he wanted to think about was the man's excellent taste in toys. And perhaps gloat a bit, since he was certain Bjorn thought it would be he, who first got the chance to introduce 'their wife' to the pain of the tawse. But it would be he, who had that pleasure. \n\nHe made certain that she could not see the tawse, but her eyes grew wider at the rope alone. \"Since you cannot seem to remain still for me to munch on that sweet pussy, I suppose the only solution to make sure that you cannot move,\" he answered with a smile as he laced the rope through the ring in the center of the headboard. He evened it out and knotted the two strands together behind her neck. \n\nHe held up her hair and positioned the knot in the hollow at the base of her head. Then he brought both ends around...and crossed them in front around her neck. Her eyes widened even more as he chuckled. He reached down and pushed her right leg as far forward onto her chest as he could. He wrapped the rope on the left side around her thigh a couple of times securing it with knots before he fed the rope through the same ring on the right side of the bed that her wrist was bound to.\n\nHe repeated the process on the left side before lifting her fabulous tits, running the ropes just under them so that it lifted them even higher. He stared into her eyes as he ran his fingers under the place where the ropes crossed, almost exactly over her Adam's apple. Like this, there was plenty of room, her airway would not truly be restricted at all. Just enough pressure to entice and enthral, a not-so-gentle reminder of her vulnerability.\n\nHe held her gaze as he brought the tawse up from where he had half hidden it in the folds of the quilt. He brought it down solidly on her Venus mons. It was still slightly pink from the one 'love tap' he had given it earlier. But this was enough to send blood coursing to the area...pinking it even further.\n\nIt was also enough to make her jump. To try and lower her legs...for that rope to tighten about her neck. And those huge eyes told him that she realized it too. He reached down and replaced the tawse with his knife. He ran it across her cheek as he loved to do so fucking much...never enough to break the skin of course, or even to leave a mark of any kind. Just enough to get her attention and raise a thin pink line, which faded quickly.\n\nHe ran it slowly down the side of her face and neck to where the rope crossed. He slipped it just under the top one and tugged. Not enough to cut clean through, not even to weaken it enough for her to break free. Just enough that he could finish the job in a single quick slice...if he needed to. \n\nHe leaned over her, staring into those wide eyes as he whispered, \"Trust me,\" against her lips. She nodded her head but that too tightened the rope, impeding her air way, just a bit so that when she did reply it was a deep, throaty whisper that made his hard cock twitch inside the tight confines of his jeans, \"Yes Sir.\"\n\n\"Good girl,\" he said though the words were out before he had time to consider them. Once said he could not take them back of course, but he would be more careful about opening his mouth in the future.\n\nOf course, there were other things he could be doing with his mouth, especially now that she was positioned just the way he wanted her. Those soft, creamy thighs with their trail of light brown stars were spread so fucking wide that he could practically see inside her tight cunt. He could not resist running his fingers around the rim of it just a bit. \"I think you are even more wet, slut. Is it the rope? Mine might not be as pretty a design as big brother's but it gets the job done, doesn't it?\"\n\nShe tried to nod her head once more, but quickly reconsidered that, \"Yes Sir.\" His cock twitched again, damn the woman. \n\n\"Or was it the pain?\" He dropped the knife on the bed, close enough that he could reach it quickly though. He picked up the leather and used it as he would have his knife to draw pretty trails along the inside of her thighs. He smiled as he noticed the thin brown line at the very top of her right one. The place where he had cut her last time was healing nicely. His mark. He could almost still taste her blood. \n\nAnd he could most definitely still taste that sweet pussy on his lips. He chuckled as he remember the teasing he had taken when he grew the facial hair...flavor saver...or was that savor...both probably, especially with her cunt. But before he got back to that one... \"Do you know what this is, Kirsty?\" he asked as he held up the tawse.\n\nShe shook her head and he chuckled. They really were going to have to work on some of her bad habits. But there was no need for him to correct her about poor manners when the rope around her neck did the job for him, \"No Sir.\"\n\n\"Tawse. Have you heard of them?\"\n\nThis time her head remained still but those eyes flared open and her pupils dilated, \"I'll take that as a yes then.\"\n\n\"Since you are practically a virgin to pain, we shall begin slowly. See what your threshold is. But like I said I will push you beyond your limits.\"\n\nHe watched as she swallowed, as her top teeth chewed that bottom lip, \"Yes Sir,\" was her only response.\n\n\"Five. We will begin with five. The barehanded and that last one don't count. Those were warm ups, understood?\"\n\n\"Yes Sir.\"\n\nHe caught himself this time before those words were out of his mouth. \"You will count for me. It should not be too much trouble this time since we are only going to five, but just so you know...if you lose count, we start over from the beginning. Understood?\"\n\nThe \"Yes Sir\" was a bit quieter and longer coming this time. More reluctant. But it came anyway. Just as he was going to make her...once her sweet pussy was red, raw and even more sensitive than it usually was. \n\nHe took pleasure in pushing her just a bit further then. \"And good girls always remember their manners. Thank their Doms for the pain. Do not forget the words...'Thank you Sir' after each.\" He grinned broadly as he added, \"Or we start over from one, do you understand me, slut?\"\n\n\"Yes Sir\" were her words, but he far preferred the slight tremble he felt in her thighs that told him far more than words ever could.\n\nHe gave her no warning as he brought the leather down right in the very center of her shaved mound. She jumped at first contact and he watched as the ropes tightened around her neck, but she quickly forced her body to relax, \"One. Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nHe fought back the need to smile as he repeated the process, aiming just a tad lower this time. Again she could not stop her body's shock response but was even quicker to recover this time. \"Two. Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nThis time he adjusted the angle of the leather in his hand as he brought it down right over the opening of her tight cunt. She squealed this time as well as jumping. \"Three. Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes and bit down harder on that bottom lip. He hesitated. Not because he had any intention of stopping. He said five and he meant five. That was another lesson his 'wife' would have to learn...no one played him anymore. Of course, if he honestly believed she had reached her limit then, the remaining ones could be softer. Baby brother had even wisely purchased a toy with soft sheep skin on the handle. But he was not to that point yet as he drew out her trepidation. \n\nHe saw her peak beneath those closed eye lids as if checking to see if the next one was coming but he just leaned back on his heels and laughed, \"What? Are you waiting for something, slut?\"\n\nShe shook her head and whimpered, \"No, Sir.\"\n\n\"Good then you should not mind this,\" he replied as he brought the tawse back down on her Venus mons. He could tell that he had managed to catch her clit perfectly this time by the deep, guttural and mindless moan that escaped her lips. \n\nHe reached out and ran his palm across her flesh. It was warm to the touch. He scraped his finger nails across it and she flinched. Oh yes, his slut wife was not only more responsive than they could have imagined, she also had one hell of a pain threshold. \n\nHe debated for a moment. The soft tender approach with the sheep skin? But something told him that she would be almost disappointed. He did not want to encourage bad behavior like pouting, did he? Well, maybe, since punishment would be such fun. But since he could still smell and taste her pussy around his mouth that would have to wait. \n\nHe smiled as he changed the angle once more, landing another one directly over her open pussy lips. She jumped and moaned, \"Five. Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nHe laughed as he bent forward. His large body fitting perfectly between those indecently spread thighs. He allowed the rough wool of his shirt to scratch against those hard nipples and savored her slight tremble as he wrapped his hand through her hair and pulled her head back. She opened those eyes and looked up at him.\n\n\"No, Kirsty. Wrong. That would have been one but since you got even that wrong we begin all over again,\" the look of utter shock and horror in that expressive face thrilled him as few things ever had. He watched then as the truth dawned on her. \"Yes, you forgot four. So we start over again.\"\n\nHe saw her open her mouth. He prepared for her to argue with him, to plead, to beg for mercy. Not that there was much of that left inside of him...and he saved all of it for his daughter. He was not prepared for her gentle sigh as she dropped his gaze and whispered, \"Yes, Sir,\" again.\n\nIt enraged him. The next one landed once more over her open hole. The hole he wanted to bury himself in. The one he swore he never would. He would not give her that power. Her eyes closed and her whole body arched with the force of the blow, her face reddened to the point that he almost reached for the knife. \n\nThen she collapsed back against the quilt. When she opened her eyes, there were tears in them, but she only whispered, \"One. Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nHe rose up over her, used his size to accentuate her vulnerability as he brought the tawse down rapidly on her mound again. He could see the shaved skin flame red this time. But he also saw how it glistened in dim light. \"Two. Thank you, Sir,\" her voice was a bit stronger.\n\nHe used his fingers to probe the opening of that hole, which beckoned to him. If she had been wet before, her cunt was practically flooding now. He could not wait to taste it much longer. He smiled at her, \"Not only are you a good little whore, but damn woman, you having the makings of a real pain slut too,\" to accentuate his point, he shoved his fingers as deep inside of her as he could. \n\nHe knew that she was tender from the leather but still he found her G-spot once more...he worked it hard as he brought the tawse down on the mound again and again. Her body was arching in a powerful orgasm as he combined her pain and pleasure. \"Three. Oh, four. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir,\" she cried as the muscles inside of her threatened to draw his whole hand in, the contractions of her orgasm were so powerful.\n\nHe had lost patience with that part of the game. All he wanted was to taste that sweet pussy one more time. To drink her in...over and over again. He flipped the leather pad and brought the softer sheep's wool down on the red, tender flesh. Though her eyes were tightly closed, she arched her body once more. With a smile, she whispered, \"Five. Thank you, Sir.\" \n\nHe tossed the damned thing away and did what he had been waiting to do...bury his face between those thighs that were spread so fucking wide. His tongue found her clit. Her labia practically scorched him, it was so hot from the beating. \n\nYes, their wife was definitely a pain slut in the making. He fought back the need to be the one to push those limits higher and higher. He reminded himself that after this night, she was not likely to want seconds of the bad boy for a long time. He tried to convince himself that did not matter. But as she crested another peak and her whole body reddened with the power of her release on his tongue and fingers, he recognized that he was lying to himself.\n\nHe did not allow her to come down from that orgasm as he pushed her higher. He captured her clit. He held it firmly between his front teeth as his tongue flicked back and forth over the slick surface. His fingers inside of her pounded away. He knew she would be sore tomorrow, but damn her not in the way he wanted most. And he took that frustration out upon her as she screamed. \n\nHe smiled around her swollen love button. \"Go ahead and scream, slut. This room is practically sound proof,\" he chuckled and felt her tremble as the vibration travelled straight to her clit. \"Thank Odin. Otherwise I am sure we would be even more fucked in the head.\"\n\nBut it was not conversation he wanted with the taste of her cunt filling his nose, mouth, his very fucking soul...if he even had one anymore. She was thrashing against the ropes. He could see her occasionally choking herself as she strained against them, but every time just as he was certain he would need to cut her free...her body relaxed and she took in great gasps of air. \n\nHe could still feel her cunt squeezing his fingers but the contractions were less strong than they had been. He knew what he wanted then as he released her swollen clitoris from between his teeth. He licked it, flicked it back and forth and felt her thighs begin to tremble beneath his hands. Then he continued lower, slowly licking a trail from it down past her open hole to her other tight hole. \n\nSven had warned him off this one. But damn he was never one to follow anyone's rules but his own as he toyed with it for a moment. His tongue rimmed the edges and he feasted upon the way those expressive eyes widened with shock. He gave it a final lick as he slowly pressed a finger inside of it. She jumped at the invasion though he knew it was more from the shock of it than pain. \n\nHe placed his other hand on top of her mound to hold her still. He was pleased to note how warm the flesh there still was from her pussy spanking. He worked his finger slowly in and out of her back door, stretching it just a bit more each time as his tongue began the return journey.\n\nBut this time it lingered. Homed in upon that open hole, which his throbbing cock coveted so fucking much. He knew that she would not deny him this. Hell, she probably would welcome, desperately wanted or even needed his thick cock to fill her greedy cunt. But he would not give this woman that power over him. Over his cock anyway.\n\nHis tongue was a whole other matter as he first licked around the edges, rimmed her sweet pussy as he had her asshole. He savored her juices like a fine wine. Hell, he had never been a wine connoisseur but a pussy one was another matter...and this was top quality. The best. But not even that was enough.\n\nHe used his hand that rested on her mound to spread her lips even further apart as he buried his face even deeper within her folds. His tongue did what he would not allow his cock as it sank deep inside of her tight folds. He used his tongue and his finger to work both holes in tandem. As she went flying once more. \n\n\"Fuck,\" she screamed. A deep chuckle erupted from his throat and was absorbed into her cunt. He got the feeling that their sweet innocent wife did not use that word often. \n\n\"Tongue fucking to be exact, sweetheart,\" he replied as he licked from her hole back up to that button which still stood at full attention. He captured it and bit down harder than he had before. She startled and the rope tightened around her pretty neck.  \n\n\"But you still have not given me what I want, Kirsty.\" The puzzle look on her face thrilled him as he added a touch more pressure before releasing her clitoris from between his teeth. He stilled his finger in her ass as he adjusted his position on the bed. Laying on his stomach, he got comfortable and went in for the long hall.",
        "He leaned his face against her mound and smiled, \"Don't you remember, dear wife?\" \n\nShe shook her head and whispered, \"No, Sir.\" \n\nHe licked her clit once more, not for any other reason than to bite back those words...good girl. Once he had himself back under control he met her gaze, \"You still have not drowned me in your sweet pussy juice.\"\n\nThose eyes almost popped out of her head as he grinned and added the single word...\"Squirting.\"\n\nHe saw her chest heave, her nipple tightened, and the dark pink flesh puckered. He did not give her time to think then. He replaced the hand which had held her firmly down with his face, burying his tongue within her folds and once more working that sensitive button with it. He used the hand that had been there to return once more to her cunt. \n\nHe pushed three fingers inside of her this time. It was more than he had dared before. He went at her like a man possessed, an animal. His tongue on her clitoris, three fingers stuffed as far as he could get them inside her tight pussy and another now fully buried in her ass. \n\nAnd it was just what it took. This time as he probed as hard as he could against that bundle of nerves just inside of her cunt, he pressed from the other side as well. Squeezing her g-spot between his fingers. Her legs dropped. He knew that she was trying to find some way to plant her feet upon the bed and arched against him. But he had tied her back too tightly. \n\nHer scream then was louder than he had ever heard. For a moment, he feared that it might wake his brothers...or his daughter. But he was beyond the point of caring as the first of her sweet juices drenched his face. He lapped at them like a man dying of thirst in the desert. \n\nThen he went back for more. It was not enough. He was not sure it ever would be with this woman. And as much as that bothered him, he was too busy lapping up her pussy nectar to give a shit right then. \n\nHe knew he should not. That she was too inexperienced still, but he was beyond caring as he slipped his fingers out of both holes. She whimpered. Fuck, that sound drove him mad. He lifted his head and used the hand that had been inside her cunt to slap her mound once more. Barehanded...and hard.\n\n\"Did I say I was done with you, bitch? This pussy is mine...you offered it to me for the night. Remember...I chose Mikael. Well, Mikael is nowhere near being done using it yet, slut,\" he enjoyed the way that her tits bounced against the rope as she tried to breath. \n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\nHe smiled as he shoved two fingers in that tight ass then. And it was tight. Virgin tight. But he knew that too would not last. He lowered his head and began to suck on her clit like it was a third nipple. But even that was not enough as he rammed four fingers inside her tight pussy, finding that ridge of nerve endings and tormenting them as much as she was fucking with his mind.\n\nHe had warned her. He would push her beyond every limit she had...and that was just what he did.\n\n***\n\nKirsty was mindless...truly mindless by the time she felt his knife against her throat. She knew she should be scared but she was too far gone by then. His face was blurry but she thought she managed to smile at him. She tried anyway. \n\nThen he flicked his wrist. She felt the pull around her neck as the rope tightened. She was beyond counting how many times that had happened. Beyond counting how many times this man had made her come. His face glistened with what she knew was her own bodily fluids. This close she could even smell it upon him. Her pussy. Her cunt. \n\nHe had threatened to force orgasms upon her. And he had...more than she could have counted. She was so lost in mindless wanderings of her mind that she chuckled, \"One million. Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nHis eyes danced then. It was the first time this man had looked half way human...except when he was with his little girl. And for just a moment, she felt hope build inside of her. She believed that she could do it. Could be what this man needed as easily as she could Bjorn...or even Sven. But then it was gone and that mask was back in place. Her heart sank with it.\n\nThe knife that thrilled her more than it frightened her...although the combination of the two was a powerful force...slipped once more between the layers of rope. With one more quick jerk she felt the self-imposed noose around her neck tighten painfully. Tighter even than Bjorn's hand had been. Then the pressure was gone completely as her legs simply fell down without the tension to hold them up.\n\nShe was certainly not capable of controlling her own body at the moment. He had shown her that...over and over...and over. It was not just the orgasms, which seemed to all roll into one continuous one. She had lost count of the number of times that she had...\n\nHe laughed again, \"What? I warned you, did I not?\" He said as he turned to the right. Instead of cutting this rope, he untied it. His big hands enveloped hers. He rubbed them as they began to tingle. \"Move your fingers for me.\" She nodded her head and began to wiggle them as he turned his attention to the other arm. \n\nThen he worked to unravel the maze of rope that had held her legs back. She had no idea how long he took but it did not seem very long as she just sort of floated. But he brought her back to reality quick enough with the solid thud of his barehanded connecting with her outer thigh. All she could thank was, \"Thank you, Sir.\"\n\n\"That's better, slut,\" he said as he tossed the rope to the side and repositioned them both so that she was half draped across his upper body. \n\nThey stayed like that for a bit, not speaking at all. She drifted in and out of reality. Wondered for a moment if there really was such a thing. At the moment she was not so sure. Especially when she would have sworn that he kissed her forehead and whispered \"Good girl.\"\n\n***\n\nWhen he was certain she was asleep, he rolled her onto her side and snuck from the room. He headed first to the bathroom, but his half hard cock made that one damned difficult. \n\nThen he slipped quietly into Monika's room. He knelt next to her little bed and felt that all too familiar tightening in his chest. The same one that he had gotten since the moment he saw that first grainy grey photo of the blob that would become his child. The same one that choked him and brought tears to his eyes from the moment the nurse handed her to him. \n\nWhen she slept, she was just like any other child. He could almost picture her laughing and talking with other children on the school playground. Imagine her going on a first date. Graduating college. Smiling up at him as he walked her down the aisle. He bit back the pain and tears. He was not certain if any of that was in his child's future. \n\nHe thought about the woman he had left in that big bed. The bed that had greeted generations of brides. The bed in which generations had been made and born. Did she hold the key? Was it possible that she might be able to unlock his daughter's world? Help him to bridge the chasm that separated them? \n\nHe knew he had gotten carried away. Had gone too far. Again. But every time he was around her, she just seemed to push his buttons. Unleash the pain and angry, the beast which dwelled inside of him. But he knew he had to get that under control and quickly. \n\nToo much was riding on this. Not just his brothers' futures. Or even his parents'. He knew his father's dreams, but as long as Monika and he needed them, he knew they would remain just that...dreams. But most importantly this little girl's future was at stake. He had already lost one mother for her. He could not afford to be the reason that another abandoned her. \n\nHe remembered them in the car that afternoon. The way that their heads are bent together over than tablet. The way that his daughter rocked so happily in her boaster seat as the woman smiled and laughed at her. That was what was important, he reminded himself. A mother for Monika. One that might have the very expertize necessary to save his daughter.\n\nHe brushed the soft brown curls back from her forehead. Even in her sleep she frowned and turned away from him in the gentle glow of her night light. His heart broke. When would he ever learn? He could never be enough. Not for the women he loved. He had not been able to soften the pain when his mother needed him most. He had certainly not been able to reach Greta. Now even his own daughter turned away from him. Was it any wonder that she would too?\n\n\"I chose Mikael,\" he could almost hear the words. Almost believe for a single heart beat that she had meant them. But he knew better. It was just a temporary infatuation with the bad boy. It would pass...all too quickly. And he would once more be left locked alone, on the outside looking in. \n\n\"I promise you, baby girl, Papa will do whatever it takes. I won't let you down again,\" he swore as he resisted the urge to touch her just once more. Instead he rose and walked across the room, stood in the door way for a long moment, just watching her sleep. And wondering about all those what ifs in this life. \n\nHis eyes were cloudy by the time he turned and ran into the wall that was his 'baby' brother. \"Everything all right?\" he asked stiffly. \n\nMikael clinched his fists by his side. He was not in the best of moods anyway after the way he lost control with her. He certainly did not need Bjorn reminding him of that. \"Nothing I can't handle. You making it a habit to hang out in hallways these days?\"\n\nBjorn smiled and shrugged, \"Just needed to pee, man.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I was heading downstairs to get some water, so if you don't mind?\" he replied as he tried to shove past him. \n\n\"Don't forget to bring some back for...\"\n\nMikael spun around. He shoved Bjorn against the wall, pinned him with his forearm across the chest, \"I do not need you tell me my responsibilities, Baby brother.\"\n\nBjorn's nose flared as he met Mikael's gaze, \"Are you sure about that?\"\n\nMikael was certain that Bjorn's face would not have been quite so pretty tomorrow had not the other door opened. Sven stood sleepy in the doorway, \"Enough. Both of you. Before you wake the child or the woman.\" He turned first to Bjorn, \"You need sleep so go fucking get it. You think she's going to be pleased if you look like shit tomorrow too?\"\n\nBjorn snorted as Mikael released the arm lock from across his body. He stared at both of them for a long moment, before he disappeared back into his room. Sven shook his head at his disappearing back, \"Seems baby brother is not so whippy on the whole sharing thing when it is not his turn.\"\n\nMikael laughed sardonically, \"I still have not figured him out. Why the hell would he even want to when he could have any fucking woman he wanted?\"\n\nSven's face darkened for a moment, \"Too many of Mama's fancy fairy tales. Remember by the time that he was old enough to remember much of anything she had come to terms with things. Everything in his world always was the roses and never the thrones.\"\n\nMikael's throat tightened at his own childhood memories, \"Stig should not have allowed Mama her own way with that one. He would have been better off if he had come to sea sooner...or maybe not at all.\"\n\nSven sighed as he looked at that closed door, \"He did what he thought was best at the time. Who are we to judge him for that?\"\n\nMikael nodded, \"Well, good night, big brother. Like I said I was just going downstairs for some water.\"\n\nSven laughed, \"Remind me and we will pick up one of those mini-fridge things the next time we are in the city.\"\n\n\"What? And ruin the whole doom and gloom atmosphere in there? Mama's damned quilt is bad enough without some fucking mini-bar contraption,\" he joked.\n\nSven laughed, \"I don't know maybe get Olaf to hide it under a spanking bench?\"\n\nMikael chuckled, \"Don't give the old man any ideas. He spends enough damned time in that workshop as it is.\"\n\n\"It is good to see you laugh, little brother.\"\n\n\"Not like you do it very much either, big brother,\" he replied.\n\nSven shrugged, \"I don't know maybe we will both have something to laugh about,\" he said as he stared at the closed bedroom door once more. \"Well good night.\"\n\nMikael nodded and headed down stairs. It was anything but...a good night. Well, other than those words echoing so clearly in his mind...\"I chose Mikael.\" If only...but his was a life time of 'if onlys.'"
