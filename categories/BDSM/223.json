I am incredibly grateful to my new proof reader blunajana who offered to help me and has done an amazing job. I hope you enjoy this chapter. ~ellie\n\n*****\n\nCharles and Josh had taken Nik home to the farm the following day. By the evening, she had become ill and it was obvious she was suffering from substance withdrawal. It had taken a further two days for her to recover enough to understand the seriousness of her situation. Her excuses initially sounded reasonable but as evidence of her misdeeds and extravagant lifestyle were uncovered by family investigations in the city; her parents no longer listened to her accusations of how she had been mistreated by her brothers, particularly Josh.\n\nDrugs, violence and standover tactics reminiscent of all that they stood against throughout history had pushed Joseph to threaten to disown her and call the authorities. At the urgings of his wife, he had relented and arranged a place for her in a secure rehabilitation center. It would be some time before she would be welcome back into the family and he was clear about that fact as she prepared to leave the farm.\n\n\"Please Mama, don't let them do this to me, I love you so much, I'm a good girl you know I am. I just need another chance to live my life the way you wanted,\" she pleaded seeing her mother's tears. \"I could stay here on the farm where you could look after me properly, don't let him send away like this.\"\n\n\"Joseph, are you sure this is necessary?\" Antonia asked softly.\n\n\"She is fooling you again,\" he replied not having taken his eyes from his daughter who had grinned slyly as Antonia turned to her husband. \"She takes all and gives nothing back not even contrition.\" He looked at Nik sadly, \"You have shamed your family and taken no responsibility for your actions.\" Joseph said. \"Your brother has accepted the responsibility for his actions and you would let him take responsibility for yours as well.\"\n\n\"I've done nothing wrong, Papa!\" Nik yelled in frustration.\n\n\"That is why you must go,\" he said softly reaching out to touch his daughter's cheek in a rare show of affection. \"You don't understand how very wrong you have been.\" He kissed her forehead and nodded at the men standing on either side of her. \"Be well, Veronica,\" he whispered and watched as she was manhandled onto the light plane screaming obscenities at everyone around her. Then he took his wife's arm and led her inside their home.\n\n\"Poor Joshua, he had no idea,\" Antonia sobbed. \"How long will he punish himself?\" she wondered out loud.\n\nJosh had been beside himself as each new revelation about Nik's life came out in the days following their arrival at the farm. He had stayed through all of it despite his father understanding that his role in Nik's demise was not intentional. Joseph had called her a master manipulator and accepted some of the blame for her current situation, as all his sons did now. It was different for Josh, though, being her twin and having what he thought was a close bond with her.\n\nHe had watched her leave from the windows at the front of the house. He couldn't bear to look her in the eyes as she was taken away. His concern now what that she would one day be allowed to return. His mind wandered back over all of the revelations that had come out since their arrival here.\n\nThe slave girl who served as Nik's housekeeper had been found beaten and miserable in a tiny room within her apartment. Grateful for her rescue she had told all of Nik's secrets and had been brought to the farm to heal and confront her Mistress. She told of lavish weekly parties that degenerated into drug and alcohol fuelled orgies. She spoke of her obsession with Josh and her rage over his new girlfriend. Mostly she recounted the incidents of Nik's violent temper when something didn't occur exactly as she had planned it. The girl had been in fear of her life in recent weeks as Nik's violent outbursts had become more frequent. \n\nUntil faced with the battered girl, Nik had maintained that she had never hurt anyone and all she had done was offer Peri and her mother some friendly advice because she didn't want to see Josh hurt. When faced with the girl and her story she had pronounced her a liar. The girl was clearly jealous of her and just trying to cause trouble within the family. \n\nAfter finding the girl, Romeo and Jules had begun a deeper investigation and the evidence of her psychopathic nature mounted up. The tantrums they had experienced were nothing compared to how she reacted when people not in the family crossed her. The money she had taken from Josh was just a mere drop in the bucket compared to the debts she had amassed and it would seem that she was heavily involved in the designer drug scene, not only as a client but as a distributor too.\n\nNik had hidden that side of her life well, though, and with each shocking revelation, the brothers knew they should have paid closer attention to her and done something sooner. If not for her reaction to Josh's relationship with Peri they would probably all be none the wiser and Nik would have eventually died of an overdose or worse yet killed someone. As it was, they weren't certain she hadn't.\n\n*****\n\nJosh had been gone for almost a week, and Peri sighed and looked at her phone. They spoke to each other several times a day, and she knew he would welcome her call anytime, but at this moment she was tentative. He had told her of Nik's fate, that she would leave the farm this morning and not be there for the holidays. Her heart broke for him hearing the guilt and sadness in his voice.\n\nShe looked down at the two books sitting on her desk. Newly printed with real leather covers decorated with gold embossed titles. She smiled and ran a finger over the bigger volume of the two books she had done so far. They weren't a hundred percent complete by any means, but she was happy with what she had accomplished. She desperately wanted to call Josh but just couldn't bring herself to disturb him today until he had called her. In his absence, she decided to show Dante and Emilio. They had looked after her as if she was one of their priceless treasures in Josh's absence and she had come to think of them as her brothers as well.\n\nTaking her phone with her just in case Josh called, she gathered the books and went to the large office the brothers shared. She tapped lightly on the door. .\n\n\"You don't have to knock, Peri, we have told you that often enough,\" Emilio smiled and welcomed her in.\n\n\"What have you brought us to look at this time? Another dusty old tome for our collection?\" Dante chuckled knowing it was the history she had been working on but enjoying her blush when he teased her.\n\n\"Something like that,\" Peri giggled in return. \"I need an honest opinion. I have had these made into what I hope the finished books will look like, but as much as I ran a sketchy idea past Josh for the graphics he wasn't here for the final okay, and I am a bit nervous about showing him when we see each other again.\"\n\n\"Well hand it over then,\" Dante held out his hand.\n\n\"This is the main one showing the family line back as far as I have been able to go for now,\" she placed the book in Dante's hands holding the second volume to her chest as they looked it over. \n\n\"This is brilliant,\" Emilio enthused. \"Each table, who sat on it, and where it was located. The only thing I can think to add is a little bit of history of the individual people and what happened to them, as well as anything noteworthy they did aside of being our ancestors.\"\n\n\"I thought of that too and rather than bogging down the lineage side of things with a lot of extra text I thought maybe I could create one of these for each table,\" she presented the second book which detailed the original table. Taking the table from the lineage volume and creating a story of each member and his or her family. Taking the advice of Bianca and Carmen and cutting out all the cousins had made the whole process more streamlined. The man who sat at the head of the original table of Donati was an amazing man in his own right and Peri had loved researching his life and that of his children.\n\n\"So in this volume, you have just got the two diagrams of all of the twelve, the original and the current listed by the heads of the tables only,\" He flicked back to the front pages of the book. \"Then the rest is just our table line through history to present day.\"\n\n\"You did all this in just a little over a month?\" Dante sat back and looked at her seriously.\n\n\"Oh God it's bad isn't it,\" she said grabbing at the books. \"I just really wanted something to show your parents what Josh and I had worked on together, and now I have gone and messed it all up because I rushed it too much.\"\n\n\"Did you not hear me say it was brilliant? I said it was brilliant right?\" Emilio appealed to Dante.\n\n\"You might have mumbled it. It's a bad habit you have,\" Dante smirked. \"The watermarked graphics are genius, it's simple and true and if people want more information about something they can go to the volumes for each table. I would say it's better than anything I have seen in the family histories. Though I think you will have one very large problem.\" He considered the gold embossed leather of the cover showing the Donati family crest as Peri looked at him with a worried expression.\n\n\"Papa will be impressed, I don't see a problem,\" Emilio seemed to consider where the problem lay.\n\n\"Of course, he will. He will be so impressed he will take it with him to the Sitting,\" Dante chuckled. \"She has barely started the histories, and they will be demanding she does the same for each table.\"\n\n\"Just as well Josh is in publishing now, he can get her all the help she needs,\" Emilio chuckled. \"Shit, they will probably fund the whole thing between them. I think Josh's publishing house just took off before he even gets in the door.\"\n\n\"Stop teasing,\" Peri laughed with them. \"I just wanted some feedback on the look and feel of it. You don't have to take the joke that far.\" She had almost had a panic attack as they spoke until she realised they were teasing her.\n\n\"We're not joking. You have work for the rest of your life now, whether you believe us or not,\" Dante chuckled.\n\n\"Have you tried to go back further than Giambattista Donati?\" Emilio asked curious as to whether she just did the tables or was constructing a full family lineage.\n\n\"I've been trying but the history is very murky because of all the punitive wars and battles with the bordering countries. I still have some pathways to follow up on but I would hate to say anything concrete without being totally sure,\" she explained.\n\n\"Would you mind if I took a look?\" Emilio asked. \n\n\"It's all in note form I'm afraid I just sort of ran with this over the last few weeks because I wanted it done for the holidays so Josh could show his father how well he had done on it. It means a lot to him,\" her voice petered out as they both began to talk at once.\n\n\"You're going to let Josh take the credit for this?\" They asked incredulously.\n\n\"He had done a lot of the research before he met me, I just filled in the blanks and tried to make it look pretty,\" she immediately defended Josh.\n\n\"We had the book, we know what state it was in before he met you,\" Dante chuckled, \"And we know firsthand how hard you have worked on it.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't worry, Josh wouldn't do that,\" Emilio could see she was defensive. \"I am betting he will be more than happy to present both the book and the girl to Papa.\" He winked at her.\n\n\"Oh, that reminds me, did you speak to Josh yesterday?\" She asked. Josh had told her last night that he would be staying at the farm and that either Emilio or Dante would drive her to the farm when they went.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Dante nodded. \"I'll take you to farm with me on Thursday, Lio isn't going until Friday.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I appreciate it,\" Peri smiled at the thought of seeing Josh again. She had missed him terribly over the last week. \"Just tell me what time and where to meet you, do you want me to come here?\" She realised she had no idea where he lived.\n\n\"I'll pick you up from your house early, say six, it's a long drive and best to get on the road early and avoid the city traffic all escaping for the holidays,\" he said. \n\n\"Sounds good I am always an early riser, so I don't mind at all,\" she said stopping herself from asking exactly where the farm was. Josh had always evaded her questions about the place where his parents lived and life on the farm. All she had to go on was the general notion that it was a step back in time to a strict, more traditional way of life.\n\n\"Did you still want to see my notes on the family tree?\" Peri asked gathering the two books and standing up from her chair.\n\n\"I do but it will have to wait we have a family thing going on today,\" Emilio said apologetically. \"Maybe tomorrow before you leave for the holidays,\" he suggested.\n\n\"No hurry it will still be there next year,\" she smiled. \"Thanks for looking this over for me.\"\n\n\"How much do you think Josh has told her?\" Dante asked after watching Peri walk from the room.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Emilio said. \"I would hazard a guess that he has prepared her in some way without actually telling her. I doubt she will be shocked. It will just be a matter of whether she loves him enough to submit to tradition.\"\n\n\"We all did at some point in time,\" Dante agreed acknowledging that it was very different for family members who spent time serving as a slave. What a girl coming into the family was asked to endure for the love of her man could be harsh depending on if he were favoured to be the next table head. Ben was the favoured one, but Emily had come from a southern table and so did had endured her trial before she arrived at the farm. So far he had been the only one dumb enough to think that love could withstand anything. He felt for Peri, but he wouldn't interfere, this was a lesson both she and Josh must learn on their own.\n\n*****\n\n\"You were all taught to drive by the same person weren't you?\" Peri asked as she and Dante had driven out of the city in the early morning light.\n\n\"No, but I did teach Josh to drive,\" Dante chuckled.\n\n\"That makes sense then,\" Peri tried to relax as the scenery raced past her window, \"He doesn't seem to be aware he has a brake pedal either. Where exactly are we going?\"\n\n\"To the middle of nowhere, nothing for kilometres in any direction but farmland and cane fields,\" Dante continued to chuckle. \n\n\"There must be a town or something close by, how else would they shop or access the council or anything. Can you, at least, tell me how long it will take to get there and a general direction?\" she asked feeling frustrated by the air of secrecy around the farm. \n\n\"They have a plane, its fly in and fly out usually but with everyone is going up for the holidays, so the families with small children get to use the plane, and the rest of us drive north-west for around six hours or so to get there,\" Dante explained. \n\n\"Is that six hours for you or six hours for a normal person who can read the speed limits?\" She grinned.\n\n\"We'll probably make it in under five maybe sooner if I push it,\" he grinned.\n\n\"Don't push it on my behalf. I'm quite content to get there in one piece, and Josh might be a little upset if you left pieces of me along the road to find,\" she grimaced.\n\n\"Don't worry so much, this car if fitted with every safety feature possible and could drive itself there,\" he took his hands off the wheel and rested them in his lap making her squeal in fright. \"Alright, alright calm down, I'll drive but it won't be as much fun.\"\n\n\"I can live with less of that sort of fun, thanks,\" Peri shook her head.\n\nThey drove on making small talk for over two hours before Dante stopped in a small town and offered to buy her breakfast or, at least, a snack at a local caf\u00e9.\n\n\"Sounds great I need to stretch,\" she agreed easily getting out of the car.\n\n\"I haven't travelled much,\" Peri admitted. \"This is such a pretty little town.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I like to stop here on the way to and from the farm. Stops me from going road crazy staring at the bitumen for so long. It's a nice friendly place, where everyone says hello and smiles,\" Dante agreed as he nodded to a man on the sidewalk who had tipped his hat.\n\n\"My gosh, I will never eat all this,\" Peri exclaimed as the waitress brought out her order. Feeling hungry, Peri had ordered eggs Benedict without realising how big a country breakfast was. \"I order this in the city all the time and it's only half the size.\"\n\n\"Just eat what you can, no pressure. I don't want you arriving and telling Josh I made you sick on the way,\" Dante said easily. He was enjoying Peri's company on the drive more than he thought he would. Generally speaking, he enjoyed the solitude of the long drive. Coming from a family as large and as close as his was, time alone was a precious commodity and the drive home to the farm was one of those precious times. She was easy to talk to and could keep up her end of the conversation on just about any topic he threw at her.\n\nAfter breakfast, they got back on the road and continued the journey without delay. Peri became increasingly quiet, and Dante saw that she was counting on her fingers.\n\n\"Nervous?\" He asked softly.\n\n\"Terrified,\" she admitted. \"I'm excited at the same time and also worried I will mess up the names, there are just so many of you. I feel like I should have brought presents with me, but Josh said you didn't do that at Christmas time. Still I should have brought more than I did for your parents. This big family thing is just so strange for me, it's been just mum and me for a whike now. I'm glad she is spending the holidays with Charles, though. I would hate to think of her alone for Christmas.\"\n\n\"You have met most of the others too. Bianca and Carmen and Emily will all be there. I'll be there if you need a hand but I imagine Josh will have that covered,\" he smirked.\n\n\"I can't wait to see him. It feels like forever since he had to leave,\" she smiled widely thinking about the man she loved.\n\n\"Looks like he feels the same way,\" Dante pointed at a horse rider approaching the road from the side field.\n\n\"Josh?\" she asked in wonder as Dante pulled over close to where Josh had been heading. She got out of the car and ran to the fence to watch as Josh rode up looking every inch the professional cowboy.\n\n\"Yo Lil bro,\" Dante called out as he neared the fence. \"Picked up something of yours I thought you might like back,\" he grinned as Josh stepped out of the saddle and strode to where Peri stood.\n\n\"Thanks, D. she's exactly what I wanted for Christmas,\" he kissed her awkwardly with the fence between them before lifting her over it . \"I'll take her from here, see you at home.\"\n\n\"Yeah see you there later, much later,\" Dante laughed and climbed into his car gunning the engine and pulling away at speed.\n\n\"Hello you,\" Josh smiled and kissed her again.\n\n\"Mine,\" she said simply cupping his cheek with one hand when he let her up for air. \"I have missed you so much.\"\n\n\"I have missed you more,\" he smiled and led her to the horse.\n\n\"Josh I've never even seen a real horse let alone ridden one,\" she baulked at the idea that he wanted her to get on the huge animal.\n\n\"Trust me,\" Josh said soothingly and took the horses reins pulling it toward them. \"This is Dobby he's old and very gentle.\" He took Peri's hand and touched it to the horse's soft nose. The horse snorted at the new smell making Peri step back against Josh, who now stood behind her. \"That just means he likes you. Not as much as I do, however, so be brave,\" he picked her up and helped her into the saddle before climbing behind her. He cradled her between his arms as he took the reins and spurred Dobby off into a slow walk.",
        "Peri didn't like the bumpy gait of the horse, but Josh explained that the farm was still some distance away, so she clung to the mane as he wrapped an arm around her and nudged the horse to a faster pace.\n\nHe brought the horse to a standstill beside a small running creek and helped her off. She clung to him grateful to have her feet back on solid ground. \n\n\"The house is still a long way away isn't it?\" she asked dreading the answer.\n\n\"Yes, but I may be able to organise some more agreeable transport for you if you can show me that you missed me as much as I missed you,\" he pulled her into his arms and kissed her deeply.\n\n\"I think I can do that,\" she grinned and looked around not seeing another living soul for miles.\n\nHe took her hand and led her down to the creek, then sat on a rock and watching her for a moment as she dipped her foot into the edge of the water. \n\n\"It's cold!\" she said looking up at him. \n\n\"You won't feel it once you're in there, now strip for me I need to see every inch of you,\" he grinned and pulled off his own shirt. She looked around knowing that no one else was there to see her but feeling like she should check. She hummed to herself as she slowly stripped for him in what she hoped was a very sexy way. Josh wasted no time once she was sliding her panties down her thighs and he stood pushing his jeans off and stalking toward her with a determined face. He grabbed her then and waded into the water dumping her into the large swimming hole he had known since he was a child. Diving in after her he helped her to her feet in the chest deep water and held her until the shock of the cold water subsided. \n\nHe smiled moving away slightly as she began to warm up watching her big beautiful breasts bounce on the surface of the water, their hard nipples pointing toward him. He reached and took the hard nubs in his fingers pulling her toward him with a smile and kissing her again. Wrapping her legs around his hips as she clung to him she mewled in pleasure as he entered her, his hand still playing with her breasts.\n\nIt was a gentler movement than he wanted and needed but he reminded himself that this was only the beginning of their holiday bliss and that he would take every opportunity to show her around the property that was his childhood home. He had dreamt of being with her here in his favourite place in the world, and though his need was great, he slowed himself down enjoying the feel of her and the gentle waves that surrounded them.\n\nRealising after some time that she seemed just as unsatisfied by the gentler pace of their lovemaking he walked with her to the ledge he had stood on before diving in to be with her. He perched her on the edge and widened his stance in the shallower water to enter her with more force than he had been able to holding her in the water. She smiled and mewled as he continued to thrust hard and he grabbed at her breasts as she arched back squeezing them and sliding his hand back to pinch and twist her nipples.\n\nHe groaned as she cried out into the trees around them and two birds took flight startling her and changing their natural rhythm. He felt her muscles tense, and he growled leaning forward to bite her shoulder blade regaining her focus and rhythm to match his own. The water splashed around them as they built to their climax's and came in loudly disturbing the idyllic countryside.\n\nJosh pulled her from the ledge into the water and floated on his back breathing raggedly as she floated beside him. Content in each other's company they swam and kissed talking about how Josh would often escape here to this swimming hole in the creek rather than doing his chores. A faint hum sounded in the distance slowly growing louder, and Peri frowned at Josh wondering what it was.\n\n\"That's the cavalry arriving to rescue you from riding back to the house,\" Josh chuckled. \"My brothers always knew where to find me on a hot summers day.\"\n\n\"Your brothers are coming here?\" Peri self-consciously crossed her hands over her breasts. \"Josh you can't let them see me like this, which brothers?\"\n\n\"I dunno depends on who was around when D. arrived I guess,\" he chuckled. \"I will get your clothes for you don't panic,\" he laughed easily. \"It's not like they haven't seen a girl before we have four sisters remember.\"\n\n\"They're not my brothers!\" Peri was mortified that her first introduction to the brothers she hadn't yet met would be like this.\n\n\"They are still a few minutes away. We can barely hear them,\" Josh laughed getting out of the creek and grabbing his boxers before pulling a towel the size of a sheet from his saddle. \"Come on then they will be here soon enough,\" he held out the towel urging to her move. Despite his words, he had no wish to have his brothers ogle his future wife either. He watched her climb out after him and wrapped the towel around her leading her to where she had discarded her clothes and leaving her to dress as he pulled on his jeans and shirt.\n\n\"I told you. You have to ride the horse back,\" Dante chuckled as he and another man pulled up on quads just as Peri slipped her dress over head and pulled it into place. \"The quads are too noisy to catch anyone doing anything by surprise.\" Peri blushed deeply picking up her shoes and moving closer to Josh.\n\n\"Yeah alright,\" the man shook his head and got off the quad. \"An introduction might be nice before I hand over my bike to a city chick,\" he said to Josh approaching them both.\n\n\"Peri this is Carlo, older brother extraordinaire, taught me all the cool stuff about life on the farm,\" Josh chuckled. \"He was the bad one that paved the way for us younger siblings.\"\n\n\"What can I say I am a trailblazer,\" he explained stepping forward to wrap a large hand around each of her shoulders and pull her into a long, noisy kiss. \"Nice to meet you, not a bad kisser for a city chick,\" he grinned waiting for Peri's reaction.\n\n\"Gee, I dunno, it's was pretty ordinary if you ask me,\" Peri considered the man, \"I would hate to give you a low rating based on just one kiss, that wouldn't be fair at all,\" she said trying to keep a straight face. \"Perhaps you should try again and not make it so sloppy.\" Dante roared with laughter as both Carlo and Josh stared at Peri unbelievingly. \"I guess if you taught Josh everything he knows you can't be that bad all the time.\"\n\n\"This is gonna be a fun Christmas,\" Carlo chuckled to no one in particular. \"You'll keep city chick.\" He turned to Josh. \"I like her already, so you can take the quad, and I'll give old Dobby a workout. Mama wants to see Peri, like an hour ago, so move it.\" He untethered the horse and mounted him taking off at a gallop.\n\n\"You know it's a race right?\" Dante said to Josh, who made no move toward the quad.\n\n\"Yeah but he can win this one, I'll follow in a few minutes,\" Josh wrapped an arm around Peri and led her over to the quad. \"We haven't even got our shoes on yet.\"\n\n\"Come on then, we don't have all day,\" Dante grumbled and stepped onto his quad starting the ignition.\n\nThey quickly put on their shoes and followed the speeding Dante across the dry brown grassland. Peri clung to Josh as he seemed to hit every bump in their path possible. She wasn't so much frightened as she was terrified at the speed they were going. The grass turned into green fields, and the track got smoother allowing Peri to finally open her eyes if not release her death grip around Josh's waist. She barely saw any of the scenery that raced by her and before she could take in the immensity of what Josh called the farm house they had pulled up in front of it leaving the quads in the forecourt.\n\nPeri looked up at the stucco-covered building in awe. She had assumed it would be a big house, but this was more in the style of a resort with a series of intersecting building clustered around the large forecourt in a horseshoe shape. She had been trying to remember how well she had gotten along with Antonia when they had met in the city and quash any nervousness she felt but standing here at the entrance to their home the butterflies roared to life in her belly.\n\n\"Let's find Mama,\" Josh said taking her hand and leading her inside the house. After walking through the foyer and several large rooms that boggled Peri's mind with their splendour, they found Antonia in a huge room full of tables covered with baskets overflowing with Christmas goodies.\n\n\"Here she is,\" Josh said with a smile pulling Peri into the room.\n\n\"Hello again,\" Peri whispered and cleared her throat, speaking louder, \"It's lovely to be here, thank you for letting Josh invite me for the holidays.\"\n\n\"I hope you still think it's lovely to be here after we put you to work,\" Antonia laughed coming from behind a table to embrace her and kiss both of her cheeks.\n\n\"I'm happy to help out just tell me what you need me to do,\" she replied overenthusiastically.\n\n\"I am not that mean that I won't let you unpack and look around the house first,\" Antonia laughed lightly. \"We have done what we can, for now, you go and freshen up and I will organise lunch for us. We were waiting for you to arrive.\"\n\n\"Oh gosh, I am so sorry. Josh met us along the way, and we took our time coming back,\" Peri blushed.\n\n\"I understand completely it's been a while since you have seen each other,\" she grinned at Josh who startled by the conversation said nothing. \"Show Peri up to her room and no dawdling up there, or I will come and find you myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mama,\" Josh laughed and took Peri's hand again leading her back through the house and upstairs.\n\nPeri was surprised at the difference between the room she was shown to and the rest of the house. Even the corridor she had walked along with is stark walls and polished wood floors decorated with gilded urns that reached her waist, and large paintings were in complete contrast to the modern feel of the room she entered.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" she whispered not wanting to disturb the pristine feel of the perfectly furnished room. \"I feel like I have walked into a resort rather than the farm house I was expecting.\"\n\n\"I've never stayed in a guest room before,\" he seemed to consider her words. \"I guess it's a bit like a hotel room. I never thought about it much because this is just home to me.\"\n\n\"Is your room nearby?\" She asked with a smile.\n\n\"Not really but I am planning on staying in here with you anyway,\" he grinned seeing the disappointment on her face offered, \"Would you like to see my room?\" Her face brightened considerably. \"Well, not exactly my room but the room I share with Carlo.\"\n\n\"You share a room?\" She seemed stunned by the idea but took his hand as he led her back out into the hall.\n\n\"There are twelve of us, even in a house this big that's a lot of rooms to maintain. It was pretty well planned in reality. By the time I came along Carlo was starting boarding school and by the time he came back home I was leaving so, we only ever spent the good times together, holidays, and weddings. We never spent enough time together to get on each other's nerves despite sharing a room. We had a better deal than the twins or Ang and Ben.\"\n\n\"You didn't share with Nik?\" Peri asked curiously.\n\n\"When we were babies I think we did but then Maryanne came along, and Nik had another girl to share with,\" he shrugged. \"She spent most of the time in my room anyway when Carlo wasn't there.\"\n\n\"This place is huge, I just know I am going to get lost,\" she whispered holding tightly to his hand as they walked through the upper corridors of the house.\n\n\"Someone is always around to point the way, that's the thing with big families, no privacy or solitude,\" he chuckled and led her into a large comfortable room with two double beds. It was neat and tidy but had that haphazard look of the collection of stuff over time. The bookshelves were crammed with a variety of books on wide-ranging topics and the desks though tidy were overcrowded. It was a fairly typical guy's room, she thought and considering how austere Josh's apartment was with a place for everything and everything in its place she was surprised by the lived-in feel of his bedroom. \n\n\"So this is your bed?\" she asked walking to the bed that seemed to have less haphazard clutter surrounding it and sitting on the edge.\n\n\"That would be mine,\" Carlo said coming into the room with a smile, \"You're welcome to join me in it, though.\" He waggled his eyebrows.\n\nPeri jumped up quickly and Josh chuckled, rolling his eyes at his brother. \n\n\"Come down for lunch, you two can play explorers later,\" he said easily and turned and led the way.\n\nAs they followed Carlo back down to the first floor, it occurred to Peri how little Josh had told her about his home and family. All she knew was from the research she had done on the family book. The reality of being here and meeting Joseph Donati made her feel anxious all of a sudden. Her inner voice that made her question whether what others said about her reared up out of the recesses of her mind, and she wondered if Nik had been right. Maybe she would never fit in here with these people. Josh seemed unconcerned as he held her hand but doubt had crept into her mind, and she wished she knew more about his family and life here on the farm rather than the history of the family.\n\nThe noise of a large group of people talking reached them well before they entered the dining room. Children sat at one long table while a group of adults, Josh's family all sat at another. The chatter was full of laughter, and Peri was pleased to see that Emily was there with Ben and Pete and she smiled at them with genuine warmth before Josh led her to the head of the table.\n\n\"Papa, this is Peri,\" Josh introduced her. Joseph Donati looked up and surveyed her with startlingly blue eyes.\n\n\"Welcome to my table, sit and eat. We will talk after,\" he said with a smile and waved them to vacant chairs. Peri sat opposite Emily between Josh and Dante listening to the conversations going on around her. Collared men and women brought out platters of salads and cold meats as well as a range of freshly baked bread. \n\n\"You look great, Emily,\" Peri said into a lull in the conversation around her. \n\n\"I feel great,\" she said happily. \"I love Christmas here. I can't wait until the festival tomorrow.\"\n\n\"There's a festival?\" Peri looked from Emily to Josh.\n\n\"Sure it happens every year, I told you that Christmas Eve we had a party when you asked me what to pack\" Josh shrugged and hid a small smile. \n\n\"A festival is a little different to a party, Josh,\" she shook her head. \"You've hardly told me anything about your home and how you celebrate Christmas.\"\n\n\"Every family has their traditions,\" he laughed hearing her anxiety and trying to alleviate it. \n\n\"I guess,\" she lowered her eyes and thought of Andie at home alone this Christmas, watching old movies without her and opening the gift she left next to the miniature tree on the sideboard. She would call her after lunch and see what plans she had made with Charles. \"I think you should tell me more about yours before I say or do anything else wrong.\"\n\n\"There's nothing much to tell, it's just Christmas,\" he wrapped and arm around her shoulder and pulled her close to his side. \"Besides, you couldn't possibly do anything wrong unless you're planning on taking up Carlo on his offer of sharing his bed.\" Ben and Pete chuckled overhearing the conversation making Peri frown at Josh.\n\n\"Angelo isn't here?\" she asked looking around the table for another unfamiliar man.\n\n\"He'll be here tomorrow,\" Ben said easily, \"He has a separate place on the west side of the property.\" \n\nThe chatter continued during lunch, and as the plates were cleared away, BJ came to sit on Josh's lap with a serious expression. \n\n\"Did she write it?\" He whispered. Josh grinned and nodded at the boy. \n\n\"Santa's already got it and given it his approval as long as you are on your best behaviour from now on,\" Josh whispered back loudly so that Peri would realise that BJ asked about the letter he had said she would write to Santa.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said moving from Josh's lap to hers to hug her tightly.\n\n\"You're very welcome,\" Peri laughed cradling the little boy in her arms and smiling.\n\n\"Oh God,\" Ben groaned. \"Not you too.\" He flicked an olive at Josh, who batted it away deftly. \"Stop trying to kidnap my son.\"\n\n\"The boy has taste, I'd sit in her lap all day if she's let me,\" Josh chortled.\n\n\"Better find Nanny and see if she is taking you to Zio Ang's house this afternoon,\" Ben said lightly to BJ, who whooped and slid from Peri's lap and ran back towards his sisters.\n\nEmily smiled indulgently. \"You know when you have a son Josh this will all come back to haunt you,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Lost a bet with Carlo a few years ago so he has dibs on my first born, you'll have to fight him for the boy,\" he grinned.\n\n\"You bet your first born child?\" Peri blinked. \"The mother doesn't have any say in it?\"\n\n\"I hadn't met you yet. I was so sure I could beat him it was a moot point. Until he cheated and won,\" he shrugged and the people around them just laughed harder. \"Ben still hasn't told Emily he lost BJ to me in a bet.\"\n\n\"It didn't count. He cheated,\" Ben said reasonably to Emily as if that absolved him from betting his first born son.\n\n\"A bet's a bet,\" Josh winked at Emily, who had begun to frown at them. \"Look at Pete, Papa won him in a bet from Charles, and he's just like a brother now. BJ will love it with us. I'll have to rename him JJ though. He can't be Ben Junior once he's mine.\" \n\nPete spluttered his coffee and shook his head unable to respond through his laughter.\n\n\"Now I know it's not true,\" Emily laughed with them again. \"You are such an arse sometimes Joshua!\"\n\n\"Joshua,\" Joseph's voice sounded from the end of the table. \"You and Peri will join me in the Athenaeum\" He stood and walked from the table.\n\n\"Oh gosh the books, I left my books upstairs, and I need them,\" Peri said in a panic to Josh.\n\n\"What books?\" he stood and helped her to her feet.\n\n\"I finished a version of what I was working on, and I wanted to show you and your father, I really want to make a good impression. I'll run up and get them I will only be a minute, I promise,\" Peri talked fast in her panic.\n\n\"Get 'em for her Josh, it'll be worth it, trust me,\" Dante interrupted after hearing the panic in her voice. \"I'll walk her to the Athenaeum you can meet us there.\"\n\n\"They're in the front pocket of my suitcase,\" relief flooded into Peri's voice and Josh took off at a trot to retrieve the books.\n\n\"So what do you think of the farm so far,\" Dante asked steering her in the direction his father had walked.\n\n\"It's huge and not at all like any farm I have ever seen or read about,\" she admitted. \"Not that I have seen very much.\"\n\nThey went out of the house and along a covered walkway entering a totally separate part of the house. The bottom floor that they walked into looked like the server and switch room at the company she had worked for. The big glass doored cabinets held twinkling lights which were reflected back from the doors of the metal cabinets that sat around them and the desks that seemed unused there. It had that musty smell of electricity and metal, and she wrinkled her nose briefly before starting up the stairs to the second floor.\n\nThe second floor was like a cross between an immense library and a museum. It reminded Peri of the auction house and its large warehouse storage of family relics but in a much nicer setting. It had an old world charm about it and she smiled looking at the book-lined walls and understood where Josh got his love of books and publishing from.\n\nA long table with fourteen chairs stood in the centre of the polished wood floor. Around the edges of the warehouse-sized room were smaller bays with comfortable couches and low tables surrounded by shelves crammed with books and artefacts. Some she realised must have been replicas. ",
        "Joseph was seated in a tall-backed armchair that gave her the impression of a throne at the far end of the room, and she couldn't contain her nervousness as she approached him. The whole family seemed to love and respect this man as well as fear him. She knew he ruled this family with a tight grip, and she wasn't sure what would happen if he decided he didn't like her or if she wasn't good enough for one of his sons.\n\n\"Josh has just gone to collect something Peri brought to show you, so I volunteered to show her the way,\" Dante said in answer to his father's raised eyebrow.\n\n\"Have a seat, girl,\" Joseph said pleasantly. \"Dante tells me you are doing a wonderful job in the family repository.\"\n\n\"I love it there. I feel so lucky that they let me work for them; it's like my dream job. It's a big job but I am making some headway and discovering all sorts of interesting things I'd never thought to see outside of a museum,\" she said enthusiastically. \"I am so grateful they gave me a chance after losing my last job.\" She stopped realising that probably wasn't a wise thing to say.\n\n\"Joshua told me that his relationship with you was not viewed well by the management there,\" Joseph nodded. \"How is it they found out about the relationship?\"\n\n\"We were seen outside work together and rumours began,\" she said telling a half truth. \"When I was confronted with the question, I couldn't deny how I felt about Joshua, and I didn't want to deny it. So it was agreed that it would be better if I found other employment. I am glad now that it happened; working with Dante and Emilio is wonderful.\"\n\n\"I am happy things worked out so well for you then,\" he said with a half-smile. He wondered whether she would still be as happy to work for the family if her relationship with Joshua did not progress. Time would tell on all things he knew. He could see why his wife had liked the girl, she was thoughtful in her answers and loyal to Joshua. She had not mentioned Veronica's involvement in her leaving her former employment nor the girl who had engineered it. \n\n\"You can go, Dante. I am sure Joshua is on his way. I won't harm the girl if she is not chaperoned for a few minutes,\" he chortled.\n\nDante drew himself up as if he would say something but instead touched her shoulder affectionately and walked away.\n\n\"It seems you have enchanted my family,\" Joseph turned his attention back to Peri. \"Each of my sons has told me of your good qualities and my wife believes your love for my son is deep and abiding.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you have me at a disadvantage,\" Peri said softly. \"Despite my work on family projects I know very little about you and your home here on the farm.\"\n\n\"Do not worry about that, it is our way until we are sure of the people we would welcome into our home and family. I do not seem like an ogre to you, do I?\" He asked with another chortle.\n\n\"I think that the man who raised Josh must be a wonderful role model\" she answered in a roundabout way. \n\n\"Very diplomatic,\" he said acknowledging that he too was beginning to like the girl.\n\n\"Ah and here he is, with his head in a book as always,\" Joseph announced as Josh walked toward them.\n\n\"These are fabulous I had no idea you were this advanced,\" he looked up seeing her anxiousness as he pursued the books she had created.\n\n\"You left me with an excessive amount of free time over the last week,\" she said with a grin. \"It was a bit of a rush to do the printing, and it's not perfect. I am sure your new company will be able to make them look better, but they have the general feel I was thinking would work and give your father an idea of what we were doing with all of that information.\" She had emphasised the word \"We\" giving Josh his share of credit for the books he held in his hands.\n\n\"Here Papa, look at this,\" he passed the volume that had the history of the table from most recent back to the original table. \n\nPeri stayed silent as both men poured over the two volumes at length murmuring amongst themselves about the graphics and the idea of a volume for each table throughout history to tell a little more about more than just the head of the table. She held her breath each time they glanced up at her wishing they would say something directly to her so she could explain her work to them.\n\n\"This is very impressive Joshua,\" Joseph finally put the books down.\n\n\"I had very little to do with it except to approve her suggestions,\" he admitted. \"I had no idea that this was coming. I am as impressed as you are with the idea of the volumes. I had only seen the research for the table history,\" he tapped a book. \"I had not seen the graphics as yet though she mentioned to me on the phone and I gave her the go ahead to do what she thought best. We can discuss any changes and editing that need to happen, but I like what she had done so far.\"\n\n\"I did try to explain my vision and in your absence I showed them to Dante and Emilio to get their opinions before I brought them here to show you both,\" her anxiousness for their approval showed in her voice and face.\n\nJoseph considered her again. She had gone ahead on the project alone but had sought out the approval of the Donati men despite obviously having a keen eye for detail and a very clever idea of how to present so much information in an easy to read streamlined manner. He was impressed by her on many levels at that moment, but she would still need to undergo the trial. It was family law, and he would adhere to tradition. She would learn that this family had one Master and they each served him for the common good.\n\n\"Do you plan one of these extra volumes for each table?\" Joseph asked, \"Or just the first out of respect for Giambattista Donati?\"\n\n\"I had thought to do each table,\" she said quietly. \"It will take some time though as the family becomes obscure from time to time, particularly during the world wars.\"\n\n\"I understand. I would like you to continue despite the hardship of finding information. I can give you some names of older family archivists to contact in Italy and see if they have any new information,\" he seemed to consider her. \"First though we must discuss Joshua's request to make you a Donati through marriage.\"\n\n\"A Donati?\" Peri squeaked and looked wide-eyed at Josh.\n\n\"I have told you more than once that I planned to marry you, and you seemed quite happy about the prospect. This is how we do it in my family, I will explain everything once I have Papa's blessing to do so, I am bound by tradition until he gives us his blessing,\" he took her hand and smiled softly. \"I love you Peri, and I want a future with you as part of my family.\"\n\n\"I love you too,\" she whispered unsure of why she was speaking so quietly. \"As long as you are in my future I will be happy.\" Josh looked at his father expectantly as she finished speaking.\n\n\"Are you sure Joshua?\" He asked solemnly. \"If you are both are determined to marry, she must endure the trial as all others have before her but it will be harder for her because she is not from a table and doesn't understand our ways.\"\n\n\"I am sure and confident of her answer,\" Josh said equally solemnly as Peri's mind raced around the word trial.\n\n\"Any person joining our family whether as a slave, plebeian or patrician must sign a contract and will be put to a trial to show their loyalty and love of the family. Each family member also must endure a trial at the age of eighteen to better understand the humble beginnings of our family and why we embrace the traditional life that surrounds us here,\" Joseph lectured. \"Those who seek us out and our children expect to endure the trial, women like you who come here with one of our sons do not understand this expectation.\"\n\nPeri had a million questions but she stayed silent looking between Josh and his father in curiosity touched with fear.\n\n\"You have the choice now that Joshua has made his intention known and once I have given my blessing to agree to stay here in this place and endure the trial or to leave not only this place but the family and Joshua. No one would stop you or blame you for such a decision. It is yours to make of your own free-will and no one would force you to change that decision.\" The lecturing tone returned. \"If you love Joshua as much as he claims to love you I would hope that you would choose to endure the trial and be a better woman for it.\"\n\n\"Will I know what is involved in the trial before I consent to it?\" Peri asked into the silence as he took another long pause.\n\n\"You would be asked to sign a contract and become a slave to the family for a determined period, usually three or six months,\" Joseph answered seriously. \"You would serve the family without hesitation in a variety of assignations including but not limited to that of a kept woman, a maid, a cook.\"\n\nHer mind reeled at the thought of being a kept woman and having sex with anyone other than Josh, but she also considered the man she loved who looked at her expectantly. She went over her options at this point. The time frame might be an issue she didn't like having to leave Andie for so long when it was only the two of them. She also hated to leave the work that remained undone at the auction house not to mention the family history she had begun. Her mind worked quickly, and she looked into Josephs cool blue eyes as he studied her reaction.\n\n\"May I ask questions?\" She asked tentatively.\n\n\"You may,\" he tilted his head curiously. This had not been the reaction he had expected after the girl Dante had brought here had run away like a scared rabbit.\n\n\"I know the family is very important to you and is at the core of your world here,\" she paused and swallowed loudly. \"My family is beyond small. It's just my mother and me. I would hate to leave her alone for such a long amount of time. Could I perhaps spend some time here each month serving the way you wish in any capacity you wish and a small amount of time in the city serving by working on the family history and the family artefacts as I have been?\"\n\nJoseph said nothing but rather just stared at her unbelievingly. He had never considered this would become a negotiation but he liked that she had a commitment to her mother and their relationship.\n\n\"I would obey all of the rules set out in the contract. I love Josh and I would without hesitation endure anything if he asked me to but I was just wondering if seeing my mother for a few days each month would possibly be an option,\" Peri smiled at Josh as she proclaimed her love and commitment to him.\n\n\"So you would agree to the trial even if there was no option to see your mother though we would possibly allow you contact through Skype or phone,\" Joseph pressed her then adding the digital contact with her mother as an option without seeming like he was negotiating with the girl.\n\n\"When would the contract begin? Would I be able to return home and explain to her that I have to be here on the farm for work or research or something?\" she tried to think of how she would explain such a lengthy absence to Andie.\n\nJosh looked at his father and saw the tell-tale creases forming around his eyes that told of his rising impatience. He was sure no other girl had dared to ask questions of him or try to negotiate a contract, and he worried that Peri was pushing his father too far.\n\n\"It seems that enduring anything for Joshua comes with some hesitation and stipulations,\" Joseph said slowly his voice dropping to a low rumble. \"Despite that, I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. If I send Joshua away for,\" he looked at his watch, \"two hours while we discuss these hesitations would you consent to serve me as a slave in that time? You would need to speak to me with only truth in your words and heart, and you would be required to obey every command I gave. If you can do this, I will give my blessing and give you from the twenty-seventh to the thirty-first to return home and see your mother before returning to the farm for no less than three and as much as six months.\"\n\n\"I consent,\" she said after a quick look at Josh's worried expression.\n\n\"Joshua, leave us,\" He commanded in a loud hard voice. When Josh hesitated momentarily, he raised it further, \"Do you wish to marry this girl or not?\"\n\n\"Of course, I do,\" Josh responded without thinking.\n\n\"Then leave us, go and help Carlo with the festival preparations,\" he said darkly a frown forming on his face. \"She has consented. It is no longer up to you. Close the doors when you go.\"\n\n\"Yes, Papa,\" Josh gave Peri a long look and walked away. She heard rather than saw the heavy wooden doors at the top of the staircase close essentially locking her in the room with this man.\n\n\"Count to twenty-five loudly and slowly,\" he commanded staring at Peri. His hand on a small console beside his chair she hadn't noticed before.\n\n*****\n\nJosh stared at the door hearing his father's command to Peri. He knew he had seconds to descend the twenty steps and make it out of the door downstairs before it was locked from the inside. It was how all their punishments began and he worried for Peri. He almost ran into Dante as he hurried out the door pushing it closed behind him and heard the click of the deadbolts inside.\n\n\"That sounds ominous,\" Dante stared at the door.\n\n\"They're negotiating,\" Josh said woodenly not sure exactly what had happened back up there.\n\n\"Papa doesn't negotiate with anyone,\" he patted Josh's shoulder. \"He must like her,\" he tried to ease his brothers worry.\n\n\"I dunno about that I've never seen anyone question him before,\" Josh rubbed his chin. \n\n\"Tell me what happened and I'll tell you if you need to worry,\" Dante started walking keeping his hand on Josh's shoulder to guide him away from the door.\n\nJosh went through the whole conversation and his impressions at Dante's prompting. He was more confused than ever when he had finished telling his brother his concerns.\n\n\"Okay here is what I know, first we better find Carlo because Papa will check. Second that girl has already said yes, she was just asking about the details which is fair enough. She loves you Josh, enough to consent to two hours of serving father or possibly apologising for questioning him,\" he chuckled. \"Most importantly of all, she said yes! Stop worrying and start celebrating. In six months' time, you will be married to the girl of your dreams.\"\n\n\"Yeah there is gonna have to be a lot of dreaming with her stuck here on the farm and me in the city, starting a new business,\" Josh grumbled.\n\nThey walked back through to the front of the house where a cherry picker hoisted up its occupants to decorate the enormous fir tree that grew there. Tradition dictated all of the holidays on the farm but this was one tradition they all enjoyed and Josh ran and picked up BJ from behind hoisting the little boy on his shoulders as he watched his father and two of his sister hanging decorations on the upper branches of the tree.\n\n\"It'll be good to have everyone home for the holidays,\" Carlo smiled as he came to stand next to Josh. \"Well almost everyone,\" he regretted the words as soon as he had said then. \"Where's Peri?\"\n\n\"Dad's got her locked in the athenaeum. I'm supposed to help you for a couple of hours,\" Josh said not keeping the concern from his voice.\n\n\"Shit I owe Ben twenty bucks,\" Carlo grumbled making Josh turn to look at him. \"What? It was a compliment, she seemed so sweet I didn't think slavery would be her thing. You should see some of the sluts that are in training at the moment. Then you'd know it was a compliment.\"\n\n\"We all did it,\" Josh shrugged, \"Even the girls.\"\n\n\"Do you really think she will get the same treatment as the Donati princesses?\" Carlo said seriously. \"If anything, I think she will get a harder time because she is a commoner about to marry a Donati.\" Josh scowled at him, and he held up his hands, \"Don't shoot the messenger and if you think about it, you know I'm right.\"\n\n\"Zio,\" a little voice from above his head asked, \"What's a slut?\"\n\n\"A word that if Papa or Nonno hear you say will get you a spanking,\" Josh said seriously pulling the little boy off his shoulders and squatting down beside him to talk to him man to man. \"Promise quick that you will never say it again before Santa finds out.\"\n\n\"But he said it,\" BJ pointed a finger at Carlo.\n\n\"That's why he never gets anything but coal in his stocking. He's a very naughty Zio,\" Josh explained seriously. \"If Nonno heard him say it he would get out his whip!\" BJ looked up at Carlo, who nodded and rubbed his ass.\n\n\"Alright, I promise,\" BJ agreed. \n\n\"How'd it go?\" Ben came down off the cherry picker, letting Pete go up with two more of his girls. He walked over to where Josh was talking with BJ.\n\n\"I dunno,\" Josh shrugged, \"It started okay and then went sideways, ask me again in a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"Papa, is it true Zio Carlo only ever gets coal in his stocking from Santa?\" BJ interrupted loudly.\n\n\"Yes he is a very naughty boy, he is on Santa's naughty list permanently,\" Ben nodded. \"What did you do?\" He narrowed his eyes at Carlo.\n\n\"Nothing, I've been a goddamn saint since you all arrived,\" Carlo huffed.\n\n\"He says bad words,\" BJ announced with a giggle.\n\n*****\n\nJoseph looked a Peri with a hard stare for a long moment after she finished counting making her feel uneasy. She fidgeted under his scrutiny and opened her mouth to speak and break the silence, but he held up his hand to stop her.\n\n\"Tell me what you know of our family and our traditions from all of your research and what Josh has told you,\" he commanded.\n\n\"In modern day terms, I believe that your family are one of twelve families that network and aide each other in business and family matters. The head of each family has the rights similar to that of the Roman Pater Familias, which gives you ownership rights over the people related to you by blood and those that work for you and with you and you have certain rights to their property as well. I know each of your sons who has a family business including Josh, who is in the process of acquiring a business with the help of the family will pay a certain percentage of its profits back to you, or into the family coffers so to speak. \n\n\"You respect and help those you work with and employ, but they too must respect the ideals of the family and serve to better it. You hold to the laws of the ancient twelve tables and the rights of even the lowest classes to exist and be happy in their work and life. So I know that even as a slave for this family that I would be treated fairly and my wishes taken into account.\" She took a deep breath. I understand that you hold great power and wealth, and you are to be respected and obeyed, but I also know that you have a great love for your family because that shows in each of your children and how they treat others.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Joseph said. She was an intelligent girl who had understood the research she had done and had obviously looked into how their modern day households ran.\n\n\"Originally I misunderstood and got caught up in the word slavery. I know now that rather than being coerced into such a lowly position you offer paid employment with good benefits for those willing to undertake that type of work for a set period. The only difference between a house slave and a housekeeper in an average family are the hours of work, which I understand the girls are duly compensated for,\" she considered what she had said so far. \n\n\"I am not sure I understand the rules or laws around kept women and consenting slaves or what the differences between them are. But I have only been working on the book for a short time, and I am sure it will become clear in time, especially as I get to know family life here on the farm,\" she said assuming she still had his blessing to submit to a trial so she could marry Josh.\n\n\"We just refer to them as Kept, men are also Kept from time to time though those that would take on that life are harder to find in modern times,\" he added she stopped. \"It does not surprise me that this part would confuse you it is a difficult concept for most women. Women believe that sex and love should be intertwined and inseparable. It is not so. Love is about the heart, romance and strong emotions. Sex is merely a pleasurable act of lust and hormones, there is no emotion tied to it, the emotions are tied to the person without whom you cannot live,\" he explained further. \"I know some desperately in love people who have never had sex and others who have sex but share a loveless marriage.\"",
        "Peri frowned, she had never thought of it that way. \"Society preaches monogamy. It is assumed you marry and have sex with that one person for the rest of your life,\" she vocalised her thoughts.\n\n\"I have always held great passion for Antonia. She is the one I dream of, the one who rules my heart and the one I long to make love to. There are certain times when she would rather I left her alone in that sense. I too prefer not to have sex from time to time, I have a bad back it is part of getting old, but still I would not refuse her one of life's joys just because I could not perform the dance myself. In either of these cases, there are the Kept, who are available whenever we wish or slaves who have said that if asked for consent they might be willing sexual partners.\" Joseph watched her carefully as he explained the difference and why they might be called upon.\n\n\"Emily will be unable to meet her husband's needs for the next six months. Do you think she would deny him a visit to the Kept?\" He asked reasonably. \"Once you are married you and Joshua can discuss your preferences and limitations but know that I have right to supersede even that because you will be family and under my dominion.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Peri said finally. \"Kept women sign away their right to consent and are available to members of the family as needed. Slaves with consent can be asked but have the right of refusal,\" she summarised to get his approval of her understanding. \n\n\"Go on,\" he encouraged.\n\n\"Sex is not love, and the members of your family do not impose monogamy or judge others on that basis,\" she added not sure if she had adequately summarised the gist of what he had told her.\n\n\"That is well put. I will ask you to sign a three-month contract as a Kept. Although you will not be confined to the kept house, you will undergo an intensive training regime before joining the house slaves. This will mean you are available to me and any member of my family who desires you during that time. Joshua is well aware that training with the Kept will be part of the contract,\" Joseph reassured her after she looked towards the doors he had gone through leaving her alone with him. \n\nHer mind worked quickly. With most of his siblings in the city or not living in the big house that would mean she would be beholden to Joseph, Antonia and Carlo for the duration of that contract. She desperately wanted to talk to Josh and hear him say that he was aware of all his father was saying. She needed to hear him say that he wanted her to do this. Being a slave was no big deal to her when she considered being made a cook or a maid. Sexual submission to anyone but Josh just seemed wrong somehow, and she looked up at Joseph, who was studying her intently.\n\n\"You have more information now about my expectations of a future wife for my youngest son,\" Joseph said in an even voice. \"Emily, Bianca and Carmen have all come from tables with the same values and went through a similar trial as did all of my children on their eighteenth year. I have not singled you out for this treatment.\"\n\n\"I would just like to hear Josh say that he knows and is happy that I will be signing a Kept contract, please. Then I will accept and agree to the trial and everything it entails,\" she said quietly.\n\nJoseph picked up his phone and pressed a button holding it out in front of him. \"Papa?\" Josh's concerned voice came through loudly and clearly. \n\n\"This girl has more questions in her than you did as a boy,\" Joseph said sternly. \"You are aware that the trial facing Peri would include training with the Kept are you not?\" Joseph said leaving the phone on speaker and staring directly at her.\n\n\"Yes Papa,\" Josh said with confusion colouring his voice.\n\n\"You wish her to agree to it, do you not?\" He asked his eyes not moving from Peri's expressive face.\n\n\"Yes. I know she will agree because she loves me as much as I love her and this is the way to have a future together that will include the biggest part of my life, my family,\" he said with feeling knowing she was listening to his answers now. \"Peri, a few months is nothing compared to the rest of our lives.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Joshua,\" Joseph said abruptly cutting him off and withdrew the phone placing it on the console beside him. \n\n\"Have I angered you with my questions?\" Peri asked the smile from her face dropping with the abrupt ending of the phone call.\n\n\"Not at all but it is good for him to worry about you,\" he said with a half-smile. \"Now that the formality is done, and you understand the expectations of you,\" he began undoing his belt slowly. \"You have consented to be here with me and speak the truth as well as obey my every command for two hours. As a reward for being honest with me, I will start your contract today, and you will still be allowed to go home and see your mother. I will not interfere with the time you have with Joshua during the holidays, however, should the opportunity present itself as it has at this moment, you will make yourself available to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, umm Sir,\" she hesitated over his name. Closing her eyes and swallowing deeply she told herself she could do this, it was what Josh wanted. It was what she wanted. She could do this, a few months of servitude for a lifetime of happiness.\n\n\"Sir is fine,\" he said gently, \"You have a beautiful smile, it was one of the first things I noticed about you during lunch,\" he reached his hand into his pants and drew out his cock fisting it slowly. \"I would like to see that beautiful smile wrapped around my cock.\" He threw a cushion on the floor between his legs and motion for her to kneel on it. This would be the biggest test of her agreement to all he had said.\n\nSurprising herself, Peri moved with little hesitation to the cushion running the mantra of \"A lifetime of happiness\" through her head as she bent over the older man's thick veiny cock. Kissing the tip she stretched her lips over the swollen helmet and fluttered her tongue softly beneath the head making him elicit a groan of pleasure. His hands wound into her hair, and he gently encouraged her to take more moving her head slowly up and down until he had filled her mouth and she felt like she might gag.\n\nKnowing what Josh liked after many, many hours of practise, she tried her best to move with a rhythm and pace that allowed her to breath and pay attention to the swollen purple glands at the head of his cock while still take as much as she could of him into her mouth. His cock was thicker than Josh's, but she was grateful that it did not have the same length. Though it wasn't much shorter and she found herself swallowing around just the tip as she pressed her head down taking all of him. Pulling her head back to lick and flutter her tongue under the glands she would look up with teary eyes to find him gazing down at her and a low groan escaping his lips. \n\nHis hand wound tighter into her hair, and his hips began to move, as she began to quicken her pace keeping her tongue flat and her lips tightly suctioning around the thick shaft of flesh. He groaned loudly as he started to come and she pulled her head back slightly only to have him tighten his grip further and hold her head in place as he thrust his hips up into her mouth several more times. \n\n\"Swallow it all,\" he rasped as she gulped feeling a small dribble escape the corner of her mouth. She swallowed several times, and as he released her hair, she gently cleaned all remnants from his cock and the corners of her mouth before kneeling back on the cushion.\n\n\"You have some skill in the oral arts, Joshua should be congratulated. I wonder what else my son has taught you,\" he looked at her speculatively knowing his son's preferences when using the Kept reasonably well. \n\nPeri did not answer knowing it was more of a thought than a question directed at her. \"Six months,\" she reminded herself. \"Six months for a lifetime with the man I love.\" \n\n\"What a sweet girl you are,\" he stroked her face gently. \"I can see why Joshua loves you as he does.\" He could also see why Veronica had seen her as a threat to the life she had made for herself. Veronica would have seen her access to his bankroll coming to an end and at that moment the excessive lifestyle she enjoyed. They had all been blind to it, most of all Josh, who blamed himself. He deserved the happy life this girl could bring him. \n\nHe would sign her to a contract today and let Josh announce their engagement at Christmas when everyone was gathered together. He momentarily thought again of Veronica, who was in a secure facility drying out and atoning for her sins but put the thought from him as he stood and walked to one of the side bays where his desk lay hidden behind a sturdy bookcase.\n\n\"Come and we will deal with the contract now,\" Joseph called to her, \"Then I will talk to Joshua.\""
