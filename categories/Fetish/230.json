        "\"Are you okay? You were making kissie faces and you said something about you do. Come on get in the shower and wash your hair we need to set it.\" \n\nI dragged myself out of bed and went to the shower. Once I came back out I felt a lot better, more awake. Thankfully Josie didn't pursue the question of my dream. By this time I knew I couldn't lie to her and if she found out that I had dreams about marrying her it would throw a wet blanket on this whole affair. As of right now I didn't want to stop seeing her. \n\nI sat while she rolled up my hair with the hot roller then she sat on my lap and started putting on my make up. She plucked a few of my eyebrows not enough to make them look too feminine. Then she said \n\n\"You know your going to have to learn to do this yourself soon. And we need to do something with your hair. This rolling it up all the time is a pain. But I don't want to cut the length, I like it long.\" \n\n\"You're going to have to teach me about make up. I can't see any other way of learning.\" I told her. \n\n\"We really need to get you your own make up. Mine is keyed to my skin tone, which is a lot darker then yours. But we'll have to use mine for today.\" \n\nThen she started to tell me about what to put on and when. Then she started talking about skin tones and less is more before I knew it I was totally lost with what she was saying. Before I knew it my make up was done. While she went for a shower I put on my bustier and stockings as well as my matching Nikki panties. \n\nI was surprised that I had so many panties with the name Nikki on them. Seeing they were embroidered I can't see how she had so many if she bought them all when we went shopping. She must have ordered them on Wednesday before picking me up. \n\nWhen she came out of the shower I was told to remove the rollers then put on the turtleneck sweater, so when she did my hair it wouldn't get mess it up. After she got her makeup on and did her hair she sat me down to do mine. Ten minutes later she was done but still wasn't happy with it. \n\nI put on my skirt, heels and jacket and was ready. Josie took a black purse and put in some make up and the perfume she had used on me and handed me the purse. I was told to put the stuff from my wallet in it. I was confused why I would have to bring it, but I did it anyway. I was ready to go and so was Josie. That's when the reality of what I was going to doing hit. Josie saw this or was waiting for it; she came to me and said.\n\n\"Take it easy all my sisters husband dress up all the time. They act as hostess for the parties all the time. At least I'm not making you suck and fuck them.\" If that last part was meant to relax me it didn't work. \n\nAs we drove to Jolene's house Josie went over things I need to know on behaving like a girl like how to sit and how to get up from a seated position. Mostly I had to keep my knees together all the time. She told me that I did most of these things already, she was just reinforcing it. Through most of the ride to Jolene's house she kept her hand on my thigh to relax me, but it didn't work. \n\nJolene's house was really a mansion. It had sixteen rooms not including the six bathrooms. It was gated off from the street with a security gate out front. When Josie pulled up to the gate she was asked who was there. I was sure it was Jolene's voice that asked. Josie told her it was Josie and Nikki before the gate open for us to enter. \n\nWhen we got out of the car I could barely stand. I was so nervous my knees wouldn't hold my weight. When I could walk I felt like I was on my way to the gas chamber. Each step seemed to take forever. Josie was at my side chatting on about something that I couldn't hear because the clicking of my heels on the concrete drive was so loud in my ears. \n\nThere were eight stone steps from the drive to the front porch and beyond that was the double front doors to the house itself. Looking at the steps I realized that I didn't know how to walk up steps in heels. I've only had to deal with walking on carpet and the tile in Josie's kitchen. Josie saw my apprehension and said \n\n\"Just bring you foot down flat on each step. It's not that hard. And please smile you look like your going to you own execution.\" \n\n\"Right now I wish I was.\" I told her then I took my first step\n\nThe steps weren't as bad as I thought they would be. I was up to the porch before I realize it. The porch stretched across the width of the house and was ten feet from the steps to the doors. The door opened as we got with in arms reach of it by Bobbie dressed in her French maids uniform. Her uniform was the same style as Misty's was except Bobbie's was pink were Misty's was red. \n\n\"My mistress is in the dinning room were there is a breakfast buffet. May I take your coats?\" Bobbie said to us after she curtsied. \n\n\"Thank you Bobbie, is my mother here yet?\" Josie asked as she handed over her jacket. At first I didn't want to take off mine. I felt it hid the fact that I was wearing female cloths. Then common sense took over and I hand Bobbie mine as well.\n\n\"Yes she stayed the night. She also is in the dinning room as well as Miss Catherine and Miss Susan.\" \n\n\"Thank You Bobbie. I would like to introduce you to my friend Nikki.\" Then to me she said \"Nikki this is Bobbie, Jolene's maid.\" Bobbie did a deep curtsy and said \n\n\"Welcome to my Mistress's home we hope you enjoy your stay.\" I thanked her and then Josie took my arm and said \n\n\"Come on lets get something to eat I'm starving. I bet you are too, seeing we haven't had anything to eat since you made that wonderful lunch for me yesterday.\" \n\nI wasn't hungry at all. I felt if I had eaten something, I would have thrown it up already. I walked along side Josie to the dinning room. When we reached it I saw that everyone was there. I knew that my humiliation was going to start. Josie waked up to her mother and said \n\n\"Mother I would like you to meet my friend Nikki.\" Her mother stood and put her arms around me and kissed my cheek and said.\n\n\"So good to meet you. Let me introduce you to my family.\" \n\nAnita introduced me to each of her three other daughters as if I hadn't already met them the night before. Jolene was the only one who said she had already met me. Each sister and each husband kissed one cheek or the other. \n\nWhen introductions were over Josie took me over to the buffet and said, \"See that wasn't so bad. I bet you thought everyone was going to laugh at you didn't you?\" I nodded my head then she said, \"I told you I would never do anything to humiliate you.\" \n\nI didn't feel like eating very much, my stomach still had butterflies in it. I took some fruit and a roll and sat down next to Josie. I did remember to hold my skirt flat against me as I sat down and due to the bustier my back stayed straight as I eat. Being not very hungry I took small bites of my food. The hardest thing I found was to always keep my knees together, but so far I was doing that pretty well. \n\nEvery one was discussing the up coming game, not being a big football fan I stayed quiet. Jolene had Bobbie roll out a white board. The kind you see in offices that you write on with special markers. Each sister's name was written on the board along with each husband with a space between them. The only one missing was Josie's. Jolene said\n\n\"Josie are you two going to get in on this?\" \n\n\"I would like to but just between Nikki and I, since were not married.\" She told her \n\n\"That's between you two then, but you still need your names on the board so there's no disagreement.\" She told Josie and me, and then Josie asked me \n\n\"Do you want to, it'll be a lot more fun while we watch and it will be just between us.\"\n\n\"I guess, what's the bet.\" I asked \n\n\"The loser has to do what the winner wants for one day. Of cause it's just between ourselves, no outsiders.\" She told me. I figure that was safe what more could she do to me. I told her okay. \"Okay since you lost the last bet you pick first.\" \n\nTampa was playing Philly in Philly, I knew Tampa was tough and they had a great defense. Philly just barely got in to the playoffs so I picked Tampa. When I said it everyone groaned except for Josie, she couldn't be happier. Bobbie wrote down Tampa next to my name. Then every one else, who picked, picked Philly. \n\nEveryone stood and went into the TV room. Jolene had a six-foot by three-foot plasma screen TV. It was the first I had ever seen; of cause there was surround sound so we would get all the noise as well as the action. All the men sat on one couch and all the women sat on another. I went to sit with the men when Josie said \n\n\"No, no you're a girl today so you sit with the girls.\" I sat between Josie and her mother. Then Josie said. \"You really should have picked Philly.\"\n\n\"Tampa's a much better team. Philly barely got in to the playoffs.\" I told her \n\n\"That maybe but Tampa has never won a game when the temperature is below forty. The high for Philly today is going to be fifteen degrees.\" Once she told me this I knew she was right.\n\n\"I don't suppose I could change my pick can I?\" I asked. Josie giggled and her mother said\n\n\"Not hardly. You need to check every thing when you bet around here. You might get lucky, but I think the best you can hope for is breaking even on the next game.\" She then put her hand on my stocking clad thigh and asked. \n\n\"So Nikki how long have you been playing dress up?\" Her question surprised me. I was sure she knew but up to that point no one had mentioned it.\n\n\"Since yesterday, unless you count night gowns then since Wednesday.\" I told her truthfully. Then I looked to Josie. She just smiled the wonderful smile of hers.\n\n\"I find that hard to believe. You're just so natural.\" She told me as she stroked my thigh. I wasn't sure what was happening, but I had this feeling everything could go very wrong very quickly if she wanted it to. \n\n\"I don't know how I could prove it to you?\" I told her \n\n\"Don't worry, if I wanted to find out I could. I really don't care if you're having fun with it then enjoy it. If you didn't like it then I doubt you would be here. So relax and enjoy it, you make a wonderful girl. In fact I thing my husband's been drooling over you.\" I shot a look over to where Ted was sitting and I could see he was looking at me. When I swallowed Anita must have heard it, because she started to laugh then she said \n\n\"Don't worry he won't touch you unless you become a hostess. And since you're not married to one of my daughters that's not going to happen.\" That made me feel a little better but not much. \n\nWhen the game started all chatting and teasing stopped. I never seen a group of people get so into a game that had nothing to do with there home town. Packer fans are loud and they act like they were playing the game too, but that's a local fan. This group acted like half was from Philly and the other half was from Tampa. Due to their enthusiasm I got into the game as well. Though I didn't have much to cheer about. Tampa was living up to their reputation, by the end of the first half they were down twenty-one to zero. And I didn't hold out much hope for the second half. \n\nDuring the half time break we all got up to stretch. I followed Josie into the dinning room where Bobbie had change the food from breakfast to finger foods. I took a few chicken wings and some more fruit and walked over to look out at the back yard through the dinning room window. Josie left to use the bathroom while she was gone Michael came up to me and said \n\n\"Is it true this is your first time?\" I told him it was. \"I can't believe it you look great. When I first started dressing I looked awful.\" \n\n\"You looked pretty good to me last night.' I told him \n\n\"Thanks but that was after years of practice, but you, you're perfect. The hardest thing I found to do was sitting. I always wanted to spread my legs. You haven't once today, even when you got all worked up when Tampa almost scored that touch down. I never once saw your panties.\"\n\n\"Thanks, I guess.\" I said grudgingly. I mean what do you say to some one when they admit to trying to look up your skirt. He took my hand and said \n\n\"Believe it or not that was a compliment. All us guys try to find some flaw it each other. It's kind of like a competition to see who makes the fewest mistakes. And right now I haven't found a one and either has Frank.\" I could see he was sincere with his comment.\n\n\"Hey you're not trying to move in on my girl. Are you Mike?\" Josie said as she came up to us.\n\n\"I doubt that's a possibility Josie. I was just telling her what a great job she was doing.\" \n\n\"She has been perfect hasn't she? At least that's what my dad told me.\" She told Mike. After Mike left she said to me \"Are you ok you seem sad?\" \n\n\"Not sad maybe just depressed. It's hard to understand how I can be so good at this. I've been a guy all my life and in a few days I'm this perfect make believe girl.\" I swear I could have cried at that point \n\n\"Hey don't read to much into this, remember why you doing it.\" She said \n\n\"Because I lost that bet,\" I told her \n\n\"No, why are you wearing girls cloths to start with?\" She asked \n\n\"Because you wanted me to and because I wanted to make you happy.\" \n\n\"Right your doing it for me. And you know the better you are at this the happier I'll be. Now I hate to pop your bubble but your not that perfect. You make-up needs touching up.\" \n\n\"Thanks, but I was looking for something a little more substantial then that.\" I told her, but I laughed any way only it came out more as a giggle. Josie smiled her special smile and I felt so much better.\n\n\"Come on lets go find you a mirror. Oh and bring you purse.\" She told me. \n\nI grabbed my purse and followed behind Josie. When we got to the bathroom she came in with me. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that only my lips needed touching up. So I pulled the lipstick out of my purse and went to hand it to her.\n\n\"Why don't you try it, if you mess it up we can clean it off and try again.\" \n\nFirst I wipe off the old lipstick, and then with my shaking hands I tried to apply a new coat. I tried twice, but stopped short of my lips because the shaking got worse. Josie then slid her hand up the under of my skirt and rubbed her hand on my naked bottom. This surprisingly work, I relaxed and coated my lips. When I was done I thought I had done a good job. I turned to Josie and she smiled at me and put her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. The kiss was long and hard and her tongue slid into my mouth. When the tingle forced us to separate she said \n\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't help myself. Watching you put on that lipstick for me was so exciting I just had to kiss you. Now you have to do it again and so do I.\" When we had both our lips painted she asked\n\n\"Do you have to go before we go back to the game?\" I told her I did then I turned to the commode and lifted the seat. She giggled and said \"Sweetie girls don't stand when they pee. Only boys do.\"\n\nI knew she was right of cause I just didn't think I was supposed to go that far. With out question I pulled my panties down and sat to pee. When I was done I even wiped the head of my cock with tissue before standing and pulling up my panties making sure my cock was between my legs. After I washed my hands she said \n\n\"I'd kiss you again, but then you'll have to redo you lips. Come on the third quarter is probable almost over.\" \n\nWhen we got back in the TV room the third quarter was over and Tampa had scored a touch down. In the fourth quarter Tampa scored twice more tying up the score. But in the final two minutes Philly drove down the field and scored the game wining field goal. Even thought I had lost I didn't feel that bad. It was a good game and due to the enthusiasm of everyone it was really fun. \n\nWhile we waited for the next game we moved back to the dinning room where Bobbie had open several bottles of wine. Josie looked at the bottles and said to Jolene \n\n\"You brought out the ninety six?\" \n\n\"Yes in honor of Nikki, a special wine for a special girl. I hope you like it.\" Jolene told me \n\n\"You should feel honored Nikki. This has to be the best wine to come out of Napa in a long time.\" Josie told me \n\n\"Then it's probable wasted on me. The only way I could tell a good wine from a bad one is the good one has a cork.\" I said which got a laugh from everyone.\n\n\"If you stick around Josie long enough she'll teach you everything you need to know. Her pallet is remarkable.\" Ted told me. \n\n\"Thank you daddy but I get my knowledge from you.\" She said with a slight blush to her cheeks \n\n\"Knowledge is one thing what you have is a gift.\" He told her. Normally when a father shows more attention to one daughter then he does to his others, they would show some signs of jealousy, but not this group. Everyone knew that Josie was good and they respected it. \n\nJosie tried to tell me what was so good about it and what to look for. All I knew was it was the best wine I every tasted. When I looked at my glass I saw a lipstick ring on it so I knew I was going to have to redo my lips again shortly. We talked and munched on food till Jolene asked about the next game. I picked the Chargers while all the rest of the losers of the first game picked the Colts. \n\nBefore the game and at the half I made a trip to the bathroom to fix my make up. On each trip I found Bobbie out side the bathroom door as I was leaving. And each time she offered me her services. The first time I declined she seemed pleased that I had, but on the second trip she seemed annoyed that I had refused. Josie had been keeping my wineglass full though most of the game. And each trip to the bathroom had resulted in a need to pee. True to my girl side I sat to pee, as Josie had wanted, even thought she wasn't there to see me. \n\nThis game wasn't near as exciting as the last was mostly because the Colts blew out the Chargers by a score of forty-two to zero. Josie and I left after the game and everyone said that they would see me tomorrow. Which I knew meant that I would once again be dressed as Nikki. It really didn't seem to bother me that much because they didn't make a big deal over it. \n\nWalking down the steps was a lot harder then going up and being slightly tipsy from the wine didn't help matters. When we were driving Josie said that she needed to make a stop to pick up some make up and conditioner seeing I was now using as much as she was. When she stopped at a beauty supply stores she said. \n\n\"You need to come in with me so I can match you skin color to the make up.\" \n\nI know that our agreement was that I do as she says with no questions asked, but I felt that this was going a little far. It was one thing to be dressed around her family but another to be around total strangers. Even though I knew I shouldn't do this I wanted to keep my end of the bet. When I told her okay and went to get out of the car the look on her face was priceless. This was the first time I shocked her. There wouldn't be many but it was well worth any embarrassment just to see that look on her face.\n\nWhen we went in to the store Josie handed me a basket and then preceded to fill it. By the time she was done the basket was full of all kinds of bottles and jars. Not to mention, the twelve hot oil treatments for the hair and a case of shampoo and conditioner. When she was done she said \n\n\"I know how you feel about me paying for things. Do you want to pay or should I.\" I told her I would then I realized that my credit card had my picture on it. I knew when the clerk saw the picture she would know immediately that I was the man in the picture. A check wouldn't have worked as my ID also had a picture on it and I knew I didn't have enough cash to cover the bill so I said \n\n\"Maybe you should pay and I'll pay you back.\" \n\n\"No. If I pay then that's it I will not except your check this time.\" I agreed though reluctantly. ",
        "When we left the store Josie said that we had one more stop to make. I knew I had opened a can of worms with my agreement to go into the first store. When we stopped we were at the same hair salon that we had been to a few day's earlier. \n\n\"We can go in here I was here the other day as Nick. They'll recognize me.\" \n\n\"Judy worked on you the other day. She's not here today. Are you coming?\" She asked as she stepped out of the car. I had little recourse but to follow \n\n\"Hi Josie. It's surprise to see you here today.\" The girl behind the reception desk said. The place was pretty dead. There were only three or four people there and they all seem to be workers. \n\n\"Your not closed yet are you?\" Josie asked.\n\n\"No we still have another hour and a half before we can close. What can I do for you?\" \n\n\"My friend here has a problem and I told her you could solve it for her. You see she works for this guy that has a really jealous wife. And she needs to keep herself as unattractive as possible so the wife won't force her husband to get rid of her. Any way what my friend needs is to look as mannish as possible during the week but can just brush out her hair on the weekend and look hot, you know really sexy. \" \n\n\"Making her look sexy isn't going to be a problem. Making her look plain that's going to be a challenge. If we split her hair down the middle and pull it into a low ponytail then she'll look more mannish. Actually if she puts her hair in a French braid there will be very little we have to cut off. And for work she just pull it back in to an ponytail.\" Beth told us \n\n\"You'll have to teach her how to braid her hair I don't know. Do you Nikki.\" Josie asked. I shook my head no.\" \n\n\"It's easy, I'll have you doing it blind folded in fifteen minutes. Come on let's get you in back and wash you hair. Josie are you going to wait.\" \n\n\"No I have a few errands to run I'll be back in a half an hour. Oh do you do ear piercing?\" \n\n\"Of cause. Do you want another set?\" Beth asked her \n\n\"I was thinking of it but I'm not sure. Well I'll be back.\" \n\nBeth took me in the back and washed my hair then she sat me in the chair and started cutting. I was getting nervous because it seemed that she was cutting an awful lot of hair. I didn't want to look to feminine for work, even though I was beginning to wonder if I looked masculine at all. When she was done cutting and my hair was mostly dry she should me how to but it in a French braid, then let me do it myself. It took a few tries till I finally got the hang of it, but once I did it didn't seem that hard. Then she pulled it back into a ponytail and said \n\n\"Dam if you take off your make up you could almost pass for a guy.\"\n\nI know I felt myself blush at that. Then she showed me how if I used a hot curling brush I could change my hair to something even sexier. When she was done she asked if I wanted my ears pierced. \n\n\"I don't think that would be a good idea with my bosses wife.\" I told her \n\n\"I have some clear plastic post you could wear. They're pretty hard to see, or you could wear men style earrings their pretty low key.\" \n\nIn the end I agreed to get my ears pierced mostly because I knew Josie wanted me too. In short order both my ears were pierced and I now own two pairs of clear posts and two pairs of men's earrings. On my way out to the cashier's desk I wondered how I was going to pay for this. I figured I could tell them I forgot my credit card and wait for Josie to come back to pay. To my relief Josie was already there when I came out. \n\n\"Wow don't you look nice. You are going to be able to look plain for work aren't you?\" She asked \n\n\"She'll look as plain as she did before but she better wear men's cloths or she still look sexy as hell.\" Beth told her, which had me blushing like a June bride. \n\nJosie paid the bill and we left. While we were walking to the car she kept looking at me. When we got back to the car I saw a bunch of boxes and some bags behind the front seat. When I asked what they were she said \n\n\"I just bought my new girl friend a few presents. And don't give me that look. My mother doesn't care and we don't have to tell anyone else. Beside it makes me happy to buy you things and that is what you want to do isn't it.\" \n\n\"Yes it is, but it feels strange to have you buy me things.\" I told her \n\n\"It felt strange to wear panties too but you're doing that for me and I'm sure it felt strange to dress like a girl and act like one. So let me buy you things so I can be happy.\" She told me though she wasn't looking at my face.\"\n\n\"Ok but don't go overboard.\" I told her \n\n\"I won't. I promise not to buy you any boats cars or multinational corporations.\" She said then giggled. It must have finally hit her \"You got you ears pierced. Did you do that for me?\" \n\n\"I don't know anyone else I would do it for.\" I told her. She threw her arms around me and hugged me so tight I thought she was going to strangle me. \n\n\"I can't believe you did that for me. I was going to take you out to dinner but now I going to take you home and make love to you all night.\" \n\nShe started the car and drove as fast as she could through the streets of Oakland. When she stopped for a light she couldn't run she called a pizza place and ordered a pizza to be delivered. When she pulled into the garage she started to throw things at me from the rear seat. \n\nWhile we were putting away the cloths that she had bought me the pizza guy came. So we stopped what we were doing and eat while it was still hot. While we were eating she said \n\n\"Bobbie tells me you refused her offer twice.\" \n\n\"Yes she seemed a little put out that I did. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.\" I told her \n\n\"She was hurt mostly because she felt you didn't think she was good enough.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry she took it the wrong way. I just wasn't in the need at that time. Do I have to have sex with her.\" \n\n\"No not really. She's just insecure that's all. Even though she's not submissive by nature she likes to know she's desirable. When you turned her down for the second time she felt you didn't find her desirable enough. And you did kiss Misty yesterday.\" When she said that I remembered how desirable I did find Misty. I didn't find Bobbie anywhere near that desirable. \n\n\"I'm sorry I didn't know that would cause a problem.\" I told her \n\n\"It's not so much a problem as it seems. They all like to be desired. They go though a lot of work getting ready and they are expected to offer the services to all the men. So if one of them turns them down they feel slighted.\" \n\n\"Did Misty feel slighted?\" I asked \n\n\"No but you did explain to her why you wouldn't and you kissed her. That in itself was a sign that you found her desirable.\" \n\n\"So what should I do, have sex with them just so I don't offend them? \n\n\"I don't want you to force yourself, but at the least show them some affection like you did with Misty. I would like you to try it once just so you know what it feels like, but I won't force you.\" \n\nI didn't find Bobby as desirable as I found Misty the night before. Bobbie didn't flirt with me the way Misty did. Misty was much more seductive in her approach then Bobbie was. Bobbie just expected I would want her and that was it. I told this to Josie and she said \n\n\"You have a valid point Misty is always flirting with us even the girls. Maybe Bobbie just needs to try harder. You maybe right she just expects everyone to find her desirable and she just doesn't put an effort into it anymore.\" She said \n\n\"I'm not trying to get her in trouble.\" I told her \n\n\"No she won't get into trouble. She just needs to remember that we get as much as we give out. Just like you, you know how to flirt with people.\" \n\n\"I'm the worlds worse flirt, I've tried and never got anywhere.\" I told her \n\n\"You must be kidding. You flirted with me right from the start. And all day today you were flirting with all the men and most of the ladies including my mother.\" \n\n\"I don't know what your talking about I never flirted with you. I surely never flirted with your mother and as far as the men are concerned I would never flirt with them.\" I told her sounding indigent\n\n\"You lie. Do you remember the dark hair beauty with big brown eyes comment? And you don't remember when my mother told you my father was drooling over you. You looked over to him in that way you do when you look down then up with just your eyes. And when you were talking with Mike you were holding his hand. I don't suppose you even remember licking you lips when you were talking to Frank.\" \n\n\"You're just taking this all out of content. I don't remember touching Mike at all and your father I didn't want him to see me looking at him. I remember the big eye comment but that was just a come-on. And as far as Frank is concern I was eating at the time.\" I told her \n\n\"Eating my eye, haven't you ever heard of a napkin? You are the biggest flirt I know, you don't even realize your doing it.\" She said with a laugh.\n\n\"I'm sorry maybe your right and I don't even know I'm doing it.\" I told her. \n\n\"Don't be sorry it's what attracted me to you in the first place. When I got that call from my sister that she wasn't going to make our date I was so relieved because I was going to spend more time with you.\" \n\nI hung my head ashamed of myself. How could I flirt with her father and her brothers in law? I didn't know what to say and she realized I was feeling sorry for myself. \n\n\"Oh no you don't no feeling sorry for yourself.\" She came over to me and sat on my lap and said. \"If I ever see you feeling sorry for yourself because of this I going to paddle your bottom so hard you won't be able to sit for a week. Now what are you going to wear tomorrow?\" I saw my opening and I went for it \n\n\"I thought one of those new leather pants and button down shirt.\" \n\n\"Oh no you owe me two days and I intend to collect one of them tomorrow. Besides everyone is expecting Nikki tomorrow. Now what are you going to wear?\" I knew when I was beat. \n\n\"I don't know why don't you decide.\" I told her. This did not sit well with her either. \n\n\"What's the matter Nikki don't you like what we're doing, I thought you like dressing up for me?\" \n\n\"I do but I don't want everyone thinking I'm flirting with them. I don't want to lead them on. I don't want them thinking I'm a tease.\"\n\n\"Well you are flirting with them but it's natural you can't help it. You're not leading them on because they know you not available. As for you being a tease that my dear you are, but again you can't help it. If your worried they may think your gay don't they know you and I are a couple so there's no way you could be.\" \n\n\"I just can't understand how I could be this good at trying to be a female. There must be something wrong with me. Maybe I should see a doctor about this?\" I told her \n\n\"First of all I sure some doctor will find that there is something wrong with you mentally, but until you met me you never once wanted to do this did you.\"\n\n\"No. I never thought once about wearing women's cloths in fact I thought that men that did were gay and they only did it to attract other men. How could I go back to the way I was knowing I did this and I was god at it?\" I told her hearing my frustration in my voice.\n\n\"Don't you understand that you're doing it for me not because you want to, but because I want you to? You would never have done this on your own. You're not gay or anything close to it. You're just a submissive man who is doing what I want you to. When you went to the bathroom today after you fixed your make up. Did you sit to pee or did you stand?\" \n\n\"I sat like you wanted me too.\" I told her \n\n\"Why I wasn't there to see and I'm sure you always stood to pee before? Why did you sit this time?\" \n\n\"Because you told me girls sit to pee. So I was sure you wanted me to sit all the time when I was dressed like one.\" \n\n\"So you did it because I wanted you too. Now answer me this and I want you to think about your answer before you say it. Have you ever had the desire to suck a cock or have sex with a man?\" She asked I almost answered instantly but I stopped and though it over then said \n\n\"No I never have, even now dress as I am I still don't have any urge to do it with another man.\" \n\n\"See you're not gay and I don't think you could ever be. Now the next question I don't want answer for, it's some thing you need to think about. If I wanted you to suck a cock and let a man fuck you up the ass would you do it for me.\" I almost shouted no but she put her hand over my mouth and said. \"I don't want an answer but that is something you're going to have to answer on your own and some day that answer will change our whole relationship.\" After she finished telling me this she stood and left the room.\n\nI sat there thinking over what she had asked. I couldn't understand why she would want me to do this. Then I remembered her sisters and their husbands. I thought about how each husband preformed the hostess duties for their wives. How each submitted themselves to each of the other husbands and performed oral and anal services for them. But I didn't have to do this I wasn't a husband. If I became her husband I would have to perform the duties as hostess for her. That was what she was asking me. Now the question was could I do this, could I suck Michael's cock and let him fuck me. Not only did I have to let them but I also had to show I enjoyed it and I desired it. \n\nI couldn't answer this question. I didn't want to answer it. I was afraid of the answer. I was afraid that I would do it; I would do any thing for my Josie. But this seemed so strange to even comprehend. I let the question pass. I knew I didn't need to answer it yet and as far as marrying Josie, it was a mute point. She didn't want to marry me she told me twice that she didn't and besides who thinks about marrying someone a week after you met. \n\nI went in search of Josie. I didn't find her anywhere. I checked all the rooms except for her study and her playroom. I knew I wasn't allowed in either of those two rooms unless I was invited. I did see a light on in her study from under the door. I knew she was not happy about the way our conversation went over during dinner so I thought to cheer her up I would pick out something to wear for tomorrow. \n\nI went through all my cloths that we had bought to find something. I thought that the black leather dress was sexy and I knew I looked good in it, but it wasn't something one would wear during the day it was more for evening. Actually it was more to wear to a club for dancing. I wound up taking a navy blue knee length skirt and a pink button down blouse. I choose a pair of calfskin boots with a five-inch stiletto heel. For under garments I choose a pink bustier and matching thong panty. The stockings would be nude in color. \n\nOnce my outfit was chosen I hung it on the armoire so I wouldn't have to go looking for it tomorrow. I then took a shower and shaved as close as I could, making sure that not even stubble was present, I then dressed in a baby doll nightly. Josie still hadn't made an appearance. I was starting to get a little worried that she was mad at me, though I didn't know why she would be. \n\nWhile I was waiting for her I decided to try putting on some make up. My first attempt was pretty bad; I looked like a clown so I scrubbed that off then tried again. My second attempt was better since I used a lot less, but it still wasn't right, not like Josie had done. My third attempt was much better seeing I used very little. I wouldn't say it was perfect but it wasn't that bad. \n\n\"Well what have we got here?\" Josie asked from the doorway. Her words startled me. \n\n\"While I was waiting for you I thought I could practice putting on make up like you wanted me to.\" I told her as she came closer to me and looked at my face through the mirror. Josie's eyes were all red and swollen as if she had been crying. I asked if anything was wrong. \n\n\"No there isn't anything wrong. You've done a pretty good job on your make up for a first timer. It's a little heavy on the mascara but the rest is pretty good. I was thinking if you don't want to go tomorrow as Nikki you don't have to. I'll collect my bet some other way.\" \n\nI know this may seem strange, but now that I had resigned myself to the fact that I was going to go as Nikki. I was disappointed that she didn't want me to go as Nikki. My disappointment must have show on my face as she said \n\n\"What's the matter now sweetie? I thought you would be happy not having to go as Nikki.\" She asked \n\n\"I want to please you so I picked out an outfit for tomorrow and I was practicing on my makeup so you wouldn't have to do it.\" I told her almost in tears. Josie looked around the room and saw the outfit hanging on the armoire and then sat on my lap smile and said \n\n\"Look sweetie I want you to be happy too. I thought you would enjoy this as much as I have. You seem so natural at it I thought you were enjoying it, but if you going to question your masculinity all the time and I'm going to have to reassure you all the time it's not going to be fun for either of us.\"\n\nI thought about what she said and I told her \"Your right I'm not gay but I have enjoyed dressing up for you. I really like the way girl cloths feel on me. You like me in them and everyone else seem to like me in them. So why not enjoy it. Besides once we break off this relationship I'll go back to the way I was. But it will be something I'll always remember.\" \n\n\"That's a good way to think about it. I like you as my girlfriend but I'm going to need you to be my boyfriend too. You can't always dress up you know.\" She told me. \n\n\"What ever you want I'll make every effort to please you.\" I told her. \n\n\"You have always pleased me. Now let me get a shower and we'll make love before we go to sleep.\" She told me as she got off my lap and went into the bathroom. \n\nWhile Josie was in the bathroom showering I went and lit all the candles in the bedroom and turned off the lights. Once that was done I went to the kitchen and fill two glasses from the wine that we had with the pizza. When I returned to the bedroom I found Josie already on the bed as naked as the day she was born. Her beauty took my breath away. \n\nHer bronze colored skin glowed in the candlelight as she lay on her side. Her left hand was on her left breast, cupping it gently. I could see she was deep in thought as I watched her hand squeeze her breast before moving down to her tummy. To my amazement I watched as her hand went between her legs as a smile came to her lips. A groan escaped her lips before she said.\n\n\"I hope your enjoying the show. Some day soon you will perform for me.\" Again I felt the heat of embarrassment on my face as I told her I did enjoy watching her. \"I'm glad my pet now come and lie next to me, but first remove your nightgown. Leave the panties on.\" \n\nI placed a glass of wine on each nightstand before removing my nightie then I lay down next to her. Her mouth attacked me the instant my head hit the pillow. We kissed for god only knows how long while her hands roved over my body. Her fingers would pinch and pull my nipples, something no one has ever done before. When she saw that I like what she was doing she started to pinch and pull them harder. \n\nHer mouth moved to my nipples next and she sucked and bit them. Causing them to harden like pencil erasers. Mean while her hand had started to stroke my cock. Pre-cum flowed from the tip, which puddle on my stomach. When she had a good supply of it she coated one of her fingers in it and brought it to my lips. \n\nWith out thinking I sucked her finger into my mouth and savored it. It was slick like oil but there was very little taste, slightly salty, but very pleasant, nothing like the thick goo that would come later. \n\nShe then moved down between my legs and took the head of my cock into her mouth. Her mouth slid up and down the shaft several times before taking it deep in her throat. Again the uniqueness of it took my breath away. I strained hard not to cum from the feel of her throat as it wrapped around my cock. She then pulled her mouth up to the tip and sucked on the head and the first three or four inches before going back down to the bottom. ",
        "She continued this for some time, how long I couldn't even fathom a guess. All I knew is I wanted her to keep doing it. After a while she pulled her mouth clear off my cock and said while she stroked me \n\n\"Nikki my sweet, the next time I take you into my throat I want you to cum for me.\" \n\nAll I could do was shake my head yes and she took me back in her mouth. She sucked me for a few more minutes then she took me into her throat. When I felt her lips touch the base of my cock I came. I pumped two jets into her throat before she pulled her lips back up my cock and pumped the last three into her mouth with her hand. \n\nShe pumped my cock for a few seconds after I had stopped cuming to get out any remaining cum. Then she slid up my body till her mouth was even with mine. Her lips descended to mine for a kiss and as our lips touched her tongue slid between my lips and I could taste the cum on her tongue. When I open my lips, hers open as well and I felt something flow into my mouth. It only took me a second to realize what she had done. She had feed me my own cum. She pulled her mouth from mine and said \n\n\"Don't swallow, try and push it back in my mouth.\" \n\nHer mouth went back to mine and we kissed as we swapped cum and saliva from one mouth to the other. After a minute or so she pulled off my mouth and swallowed what was in hers and told me to swallow as well. I saw no way around it and since I already had it in my mouth what difference would it make. So I swallowed, as I did so I felt Josie's body shutter and a smile lit up her face. A smile that told me she was pleased with what just happen.\n\n\"Thank you I always wanted to do that. It has to be the most intimate kiss two lover could share.\" Josie told me as she smiled down at me. \n\n\"You never did that before?\" I asked \n\n\"No. I've read about it a few times but never had a lover to do it with. My brothers in law are not lovers they are playthings to use for my pleasure. You are my first lover I've had in a long time.\" When she told me this I felt so special. I wanted her to do it to me all the time. \n\nWe kissed again but this time she took my hands that had remain at my side and placed them on her sides. I was given the impression that it was ok to touch her. My hands roamed over her body as we kissed then when she broke our kiss she said \n\n\"It's okay for you to touch me as long as we're not sucking or fucking. I know it's strange, but it's just the way I am.\" \n\nWhen she started to move up giving my mouth something new to kiss or suck she took my hands in hers and pinned them to the bed above my head. Like last night she directed my mouth to different parts of her body till once again she sat with her bottom on my chest and my head between her legs looking up at her wonderful pussy. \n\nI was still amazed at how beautiful it looked. Completely free of any hair, her lips were swollen with need, a need I wanted to fill. She moisture dripped from her slit in anticipation of what was to come. Her breathing was short as she looked down at me and a smile lit up her face. \n\n\"You can't possible know how much I love seeing you like this, knowing I'm going to cover that mouth of yours with my pussy.\" She told me.\n\n\"You can't possible know how much I want to be here. I can't wait for you to cover my mouth with your pussy and have you cum on me. I love the tasted of you sweet cream.\" I told her. She put her hands around my head and said \n\n\"Then come my sweet and suck my clit and make me cum.\" \n\nShe pulled my head up and tilted her pelvis so my mouth came into contact with her clit. My tongue flicked out of my mouth and it swiped at her clit causing her to moan. When her pelvis tilted forward a little more I took her hard clit into my mouth and sucked hard on it. She moaned again as a tremble passed over her. I took her clit between my teeth and bit down on it just slightly. It was all she needed as she slid forward and down so my head was forced into the mattress and her pussy covered my mouth and nose. \n\nI knew I was in precarious position. If she didn't get off me in time I could die in this position, but I really didn't care. My only thought was to have her cum fill my mouth. My whole world at this time revolved around her taste and her smell. When her cum filled my waiting mouth I wanted to keep it there but I was forced to swallow as it started to overflow my mouth. \n\nWhen her flow slowed I moved my face just slightly to stimulate her clit with my nose and she came once more. When that flow slowed she pulled off my face to allow me to breathe air once more. I took two deep breaths and went after her clit once more. Josie screamed and sat down once again on my face as she came. When she was done cuming she pulled back so she was resting on my chest and out of the reach of my mouth. \n\nShe sat there breathing hard and I was doing the same below her. When she could speak again she said. \"You really must love this as much as I do.\"\n\n\"I do I really love the way you tasted and the way you smell. I can't think of any where I would rather be then right here under you as you cum.\" I told her \n\n\"If we continue this relationship you're going to find yourself right there, almost daily, but that's enough for today. Well one more time but that will be after I ride your cock. Then you can taste what we taste like together.\" She told me with that special smile of hers. \n\nI wasn't sure if I was going to like that, but I knew I was going to try it whether I wanted to or not. I knew my cum didn't taste that bad and it was mine after all. I loved the taste of hers the two combined should be ok too. \n\nWhile I was thinking this over Josie had moved down my body. I was disappointed that she didn't give me the chance to lick her bottom, but I wasn't complaining seeing where she was headed. She straddled my waist pinning my cock between our bodies then she laid down on me and kissed me before saying \n\n\"You do know not to cum until I say you can, don't you?\" \n\n\"Yes my Mistress I wait your command.\" I told her in jest. \n\nShe didn't take it that way as a smile came to her lips and a shiver shook her body as if she caught a chill. She wasted little time after that as she sat up and then knelt up taking my cock in her hand and lining it up with her hole. I looked down and watched as the head of my cock spread her wet pussy lips open before she sank down taking me all into her in one motion. \n\nJosie sighed as she hit bottom then she started her up and down motion. The tingle started instantly and I knew I was going to last a long time. I closed my eyes and imagined what my cock was doing inside her\n\nI felt her insides squeeze me tight with wet heat. I felt her muscles grab at me as she moved up and release their grip as she moved down. When I looked at her face it looked like she was in another world only concentrating on what she was doing. If she was some one else I would have felt used but with Josie it was the way she made love. The way she liked to take control. \n\nAfter she rode me upright for a time she then leaned forward on her hands and rode me like that for a while as her tits bounced up and down in front of my face. I wanted nothing more then to take one of those nipples in my mouth and suck on it, but I knew I was not allowed too. \n\nShe switched from upright to a half-prone position several times, then she collapsed on top of me breathing very hard. Her sweat soaked body felt oh so good on top of me as she caught her breath. I couldn't help myself as I kissed her forehead. She looked up at me smiled and said \n\n\"I can't believe you can last this long. Give me a minute and I'll start again.\" \n\nI know I wasn't suppose to touch her while we were fucking, but I took a chance seeing we weren't actually fucking at this moment. I reached around her and hugged her to me. As I waited for her to tell me to stop I hear her almost purr then I felt her kiss my neck with little nibbling kisses. \n\nWe lay like that for a few minutes till she got her breathing under control then she pushed herself up causing my arms to relinquish their hold of her. She sat up and started again. This time she let out all the stops, as she seemed hell bent on making me cum. If that was her wish she got it because after a few minutes of her sweet pounding I was moaning a long with her. The tingle had no affect as she rode me to the enviable. I grasped at the sheets as I held my orgasm at bay, but I knew I wouldn't last long. She then leaned over while still riding me and said\n\n\"Now Nikki cum inside me. Let me feel you fill me with your hot cum.\" \n\nI needed nothing more then those words as I started to cum. I grunted as each jet of cum seared up my cock and shot out of the tip. Josie grunted a long with me as each burst of cum was fired. She collapsed on to me while I continued to fill her. \n\nShe lay on top of me panting for a minute or two. Then in a flash she was gone. When I came I had closed my eyes and relished the feeling. When I realized that she was no longer lying on top of me I open my eyes.\n\nThe first and only thing I saw was her very red wet slit inches away from my mouth. Her knees had straddled my head and her head was down by my cock. I watched as a dollop of cum leaked out of her. Then I heard her say \n\n\"If you want to clean me then show me.\"\n\nI reached out with my tongue and licked at the glob of peril white cum that had just escaped from her slit. It had cooled slightly and it was thick, thicker then what she had deposited in my mouth after she sucked me off. Though it was thicker in texture and I'm sure was mostly mine it still had her flavor to it. For some reason it tasted even better then it had last night\n\nMy mouth covered her slit as my tongue shot up her hole. Josie seeing I wanted this immediately settled down and forced my head to the mattress and started to clean up around my cock. When she did this my mouth was instantly filled with our combined cum. I swallowed down the first load and then my tongue went in search of more. I licked at the walls of her pussy trying to clean her out as much as possible. When I couldn't find any more Josie sat up and more poured out of her.\n\nThrough out this my chin had been stimulating her clit and when she felt our thick cum drain out of her she came once more. This caused another large flow of mostly her cum to drain into my mouth, but I could still taste my own mixed in with it. When all the cum had drain out of her, she eased up and shifted forward and presented me with her bottom. I didn't need any instructions on what was expected of me. \n\nMy mouth went straight to her ass and my tongue started to lick her crack as Josie once more sat apron my face. Every time my tongue brushed by her tight little hole she would squeal with delight. When I did lick her hole in earnest, I did so with the flat of my tongue so she didn't think I was trying to penetrate her. \n\nWhen she had enough she rose up and shifted around to lie down next to me once more. Her body lay half on top of me and half on my side and she rested her head on my shoulder. When I had my breathing under control she kissed me and her tongue explored my mouth. When we stopped kissing she said \n\n\"I just want you to know I have never been as sexually satisfied as I am right now. You were a perfect lover.\" \n\n\"You were perfect too, I wish this would never end.\" I told her. She kissed me again then rested her head once more on my shoulder. We both must have fell a sleep\n\nWhen I awoke Sunday morning I felt sticky. The dried cum on my face had harden and felt stiff. Josie was still lying on my shoulder; in fact I don't think she had moved all night. My movements must have waked her as well. She stretched and kissed me and said \n\n\"My love you definitely need a shower. You stink like a unwashed pussy.\" \n\n\"Well you smell pretty ripe yourself.\" I told her \n\n\"That maybe but my asshole is very clean.\" She said with a giggle \"Come on we have to be going, let's get in the shower.\" \n\nWe took a shower together that lasted longer then it should have seeing we played more then we washed. Once we were done and dried off I told Josie that she should do her makeup first seeing she was faster then I was. While she did her make up I went into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. I returned to the bedroom and stripped off the bed linen and with Josie's help we remade the bed. Then I sat and put on my make up when I was finished I asked Josie what she thought. \n\n\"Pretty good, just the right amount of mascara and the colors are blended perfectly. Are you sure you never done this before?\" She asked as she giggled watching my face blush up. Then she added, \"Come on you slut you still have to get dress and do your hair.\" \n\nI wanted to do it the way Beth did my hair yesterday with the curling brush but I didn't have one and neither did Josie. So I French braided it. As I started getting dressed Josie came back in to the bedroom with two cups of coffee and said.\n\n\"You did that French braid pretty well. I wish I could do that with mine.\" I asked her why she couldn't \"Well for one thing my hair is curly where yours is straight and mine is a lot longer.\" I though about this and said \n\n\"The length shouldn't have anything to do with it. You just keep braiding till you run out of hair. And the curls shouldn't have any effect either. Would you like me to try it on you?\" \n\n\"If you would like to try. I just don't think it would work.\" She told me as she sat down at the make up table. \n\nShe was right it was harder with longer hair, but once I got the braid going it wasn't to bad as long as I remember to pull her hair tight to keep it from curling. When I was done I realized I was right the first time I saw her. Her hair was long enough to reach her bottom and a little more. When I was done I asked what she thought. \n\n\"I think it's wonderful. I didn't think you could do it, but it came out great.\" She kissed me and thanked me then told me to hurry and get dressed or we'll miss breakfast. \n\nI dressed as quickly as I could, but I still wasn't as fast as Josie is. While I sat to put on my boots Josie came to me and put a gold necklace around my neck with Nikki's name on it. The name was written in small letters maybe a quarter-inch wide. Then she removed the clear post from my ears and put in posts with diamonds. \n\n\"I didn't think I would ever get to give you these. I didn't think you would get your ears pierced for me.\" She told me after she had both earrings in, then she said \"I know how you feel about presents, but I hope you won't try to give them back. I really want you to have them to remember me by when you leave.\" Her last she said and she quickly left the bedroom. I was sure she had tears in her eyes. \n\nSunday was much of a replay of Saturday with the exception I picked the right team for the first game, but Josie picked the winning team for the second game. So in essence we broke even, which was a slight disappointment to both of us. I just wasn't sure if I wanted to win or lose. \n\nThough out the day Bobbie asked me three times if I wanted her services, but I still didn't feel that attracted to her. By the end of the day she was getting short with me and even had to be reprimanded by Jolene. \n\nWhen we got back to Josie's house I started to get my things together to take back to the hotel because I knew the next week or so were going to be hell as I would be working none stop getting the system installed and programmed. I had two weeks to get this done before I started to do training classes on the third week. \n\nJosie insisted that I pack my Nick panties so I could wear them to work. She also had me pack some of my Nikki under things to wear when we made love in the hotel. We made love again that night before going to sleep. This time Josie seemed distracted as if she had some thing on her mind. \n\nJosie drove me to my hotel Monday morning so I could pick up my car. She helped me carry my bags to the hotel room. Once inside she took me in her arms and kissed me. She kissed me so hard, harder the she ever had, I had this feeling that it was for the last time. \n\n\"I am going to see you again aren't I?\" I asked after we stopped kissing \n\n\"Of cause you are why do you ask?\" \n\n\"I just had this strange feeling that you just kissed me for the last time.\" I told her \n\n\"No I'll come over when you want me to. I know it's going to be hard to get time for us to be together with all the work you're going to be doing. I know I'm going to miss you terribly until I see you again.\" She told me and I saw her eyes start to water up then she turned away from me and said\n\n\"I have to be going, call me when you get the chance.\" She said this as she walked out the door.\n\nWhat that was all about I didn't know. I wanted to run after her to stop her and ask what was the matter, but I didn't. For some reason I held back I didn't want her to feel I was crowding her. Once she was gone I quickly changed back to my boxers so I could start to feel like my old self again. \n\nI counted this trip to be one of my luckiest in finding Josie. And today that luck continued as the director of information system told me I was going to have three of his Tec's to help me on the installation and programming. I knew he wanted his people with me so they knew what I did and how I did it. I had a lot of respect for him after this; he knew it was up to him to keep this place running after I left. He knew by doing this his people would know what they needed to know if anything happen. \n\nI started out but showing the Tec's how to set up each system to each of the old systems. All three Tec's were fast learner and by noon every one was working on his or her own. I went back to check each installation for the first hour till I felt comfortable with them. By three in the afternoon we had half the work I had planed to take all week on done and I figured that we would be completed by noon on Wednesday. \n\nEach day went much the same I'd showed up at the job site at eight in the morning and worked straight though until five. At seven Josie showed up at my hotel and we went to dinner. After dinner we went back to my hotel and made love for a few hours before see left for home. She didn't like staying over night because it made her feel cheap because of the way men looked at her when she left in the morning. \n\nThis was the way our lives went for the next three weeks. I would stay at my hotel during the week and on the weekends I would stay with Josie. During the week she would meet me for dinner then we would go back to my hotel and make love till she went home. \n\nBy the end of the third week I didn't want her to leave. I wanted her to stay with me always. I knew I was in love with her; I couldn't deign it any longer. I also knew that I only had one week left in San Francisco before I moved on to my next assignment or back to Chicago. \n\nOn the Thursday before the super bowl I went to a jewelry store and bought a four-caret diamond engagement ring. On Friday we were suppose to go out to dinner then back to her house for the night. Then drive to her mother's villa in Napa for the weekend. They always had a big party for super bowl Sunday. We would return on Monday. I figured that I could ask her on Friday during dinner. \n\nJosie had been crabby all week, she seem to be getting upset over the littlest thing. She blamed it on the fact that her period was coming and she said she always get emotional during that. I also knew there would be no sex during her cycle. \n\nFriday I left the job site at noon and made my way back to my hotel. Fridays were the days I would use the hair remover on my body as per Josie instructions. On the way to the hotel I stopped at a florist and had a dozen long stem roses sent to her house. I was promised that they would be there in an hour. At five o'clock I got a call from Josie ",
        "\"I got your flowers and their lovely. I'm sorry my sweet my period started today so I can't reward you.\" She told. My reward for anything I did, that she liked was her sitting on my face for an hour or more. \n\n\"That's okay, your happiness is all the reward I need.\" I told her \n\n\"Are you at the hotel yet?\" She asked though her giggles \n\n\"Yes I'm waiting for you\" \n\n\"I'll be there at seven meet me out front with your bags. And please wear something sexy under your suit.\" She told me before hanging up. \n\nI knew that something sexy meant stocking garters and camisole all of which I was already wearing. My bags were all ready backed and all I had to do was count the minutes till she came. \n\nEach minute seem to take forever. I was so nervous I could hardly sit still. I had a bourbon and soda to calm me, but it didn't work. The TV didn't help either. \n\nAt six forty five I went down to the lobby to wait. To my surprise I found Josie already waiting outside. This was unusually as she was always on time, almost to the second. After putting my bag in the back seat I got in next to her. I expected to get one of her long deep kisses like I always got but instead I got a peck on the cheek. I was extremely disappointed. I let it go, I didn't want to start the night off on the wrong foot. \n\nThe restaurant was very romantic with its candle lit tables. Josie chatted on endlessly since the time we came in till she had ordered the food and the wine. When she stopped speaking I pulled the ring box out of my jacket pocket and when to one knee in front of her. She looked at me in stun silence; her eyes were as big as saucers. I cleared my throat and said. \n\n\"Josie my love, you are the most wonderful women I have ever met. Would you please consent to be my wife?\" I said as I offered the ring to her. \n\nThe answer I got was not what I was expecting. Tears pour out of Josie's eyes almost instantly. She then reached for the ring, but stopped before taking it then she jumped up and ran out of the restaurant. I was shocked at this move. I didn't know what to think or do for that matter. After a minute or so I realized I was still on my knee holding the ring in my hands in a restaurant full of people. I knew they had seen what I had done and Josie's reaction. \n\nI stood and closed the ring box and put it in my pocket. I then pulled a hundred-dollar bill from my wallet and threw it on the table and walked out of the restaurant with out lifting my head to look at anyone. I couldn't stand it if they laughed at me. \n\nI walked out of the restaurant and found out from the valet that Josie, had took her keys and found her car on her own then drove away in a squeal of tires. I had the valet call me a cab to take me back to my hotel. On the way I had the driver stop at a package store and picked up a bottle of bourbon to drown my sorrows in. \n\nI was back in my hotel room about two hours when I heard the first knock on my door. I had already drunk a third of the bottle of bourbon by this time. Most of it was straight as I had run out of soda and didn't care to go out for more. When the fourth knock sounded I was starting to get annoyed with it so I got up to see who it could be \n\nWhen I open the door I found Josie on the other side. I had just enough bourbon in me to feel tore between dropping to my knees and asking her forgiveness for being so bold or slamming the door in her face. I almost did slam the door, but when her tears started again I stopped. \n\n\"Please don't be mad at me. I couldn't stand it if you were mad at me.\" She said just before she started crying in earnest. \n\nThe cold facade I had put up came crumbing down as my heart went out to her. I took her in my arms and pulled her into the room and closed the door. I guided her to the couch and after sitting her down I went to get the facial tissues from the bedroom I poured her a drink and once she calmed down I said. \n\n\"It's ok I guess you don't love me as much as I love you.\" She went to say something but I put my hand over her mouth to stop her then I continued. \"You have to understand I never met anyone like you and with me leaving next week I had to ask. I should have known you wouldn't want to marry someone like me.\" She pulled my hand from her mouth and asked.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"You know submissive to you. I'm sure you want someone who is more domineering then you are. Not some one like me.\" \n\n\"You are just the man I would marry. You have all the traits I've been looking for in a man, except one. If it was up to me I could live with out that trait but unfortunately it isn't up to me its up to my mother. You have to ask her for her permission to beg me to marry you. Even then she'll probable say no because you're not bisexual.\" \n\nI knew what she was saying. I knew that this was going to be a problem but I was willing to take my turn as hostess for the chance of marrying her. I told her this and she said \n\n\"You still don't understand. Neither my mother nor I would make you do anything that was against your nature. I just don't think you would enjoy yourself submitting to my brothers in law sexually. I couldn't ask you or tell you to do that if I know you really don't like doing it.\" She said as she started to cry again. \n\n\"Look we don't know if I would like it or not. I never tried it and you won't do my bottom. I know I've wanted you to do that since I first saw it in that movie.\" I told her \n\n\"You also never have taken Bobbie up on her offer either.\" \n\n\"That's because she doesn't turn me on. And lately she has been a real bitch to me. I haven't had a chance with Misty again she turned me on. And I haven't met Fannie yet.\" I told her she laughed and said \n\n\"Bobbie's mad at you because every time you don't do anything with her she gets a spanking. Jolene wants her to figure out on her own why you don't find her attractive.\" \n\n\"Well that's not fair. How is she suppose to know she's doing something wrong if no one tells her?\" \n\n\"My sister has given her enough hints, besides Jolene is really enjoying spanking her bottom every week.\" Josie told me. Her mood had lifted during this conversation she was even smiling now. I still didn't know where all this was going. Finally I said \n\n\"Josie I love you with all my heart, but if this relationship is going to end maybe we should end it now.\"\n\n\"Nick I love you too. I have since that first weekend we were together, but there are some things I need from you before we can go any further. First you have to ask my mother for permission to beg me to take you as my husband. And I do mean beg. Secondly I have to know if you would enjoy servicing my brothers in law and any other man I tell you too. There are other things like quitting your job and you moving here but those can wait until I know the answer to the second part.\" \n\n\"Well how are we going to do that? I mean you won't do my bottom because I know you want me to be a virgin on our wedding night.\" I told her \n\n\"If your comfortable sucking a cock I think you would enjoy getting fuck. I think I can get Cathy to let you have Michael this weekend if you want to try it.\" \n\n\"I want to try it, I'll never know if I don't and I want you to marry me so of cause I want to try it. Besides you know I love the taste of my own cum.\" \n\n\"Yes I do know it. Now let's pack you up and get you home and I'll let you practice on my strap on. Just so you know what to expect. Then I'll give you your reward for the flowers.\" \n\n\"What a minute you told me your period started today.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry I lied to you about that. You have to understand every time you went back to your hotel for the week it reminded me that one day your would be leavening for good. It tore me up every week. So this weekend I wasn't going to get sexual with you and I was going to be very mean to you so you would call it off. I couldn't because I made that deal with you. Can you forgive me?\"\n\n\"I'll forgive you anything. I always wondered why you looked like you were going to cry when you dropped me off.\" \n\n\"That's because I always did. I would go home each Monday and cry my eyes out. You don't know how many times I wanted to ask you to move out of this hotel and into my house, but I knew that would only make things worse in the end. Now come on and lets get you packed up I can't wait to start filling you mouth with my cock.\" She said with a smile \n\n\"I have one question why do I have to give up my job? You could stand to have me gone for six weeks at a time couldn't you.\" I said teasingly. \n\n\"Oh no I can't. My husband will be home every night to cook me dinner and tend to my needs. And if you even think I'm going to move to Chicago, you have another guess coming. I will not leave my family for any reason.\" She told me \n\n\"I was only teasing you. I knew you would leave your family. I guess I could go to work for your sister, she did offer me a job.\" \n\n\"There is that possibility, but I think you should take the job of my house keeper for the first year were together. Or I'll find you something else to do that you won't need to go to every day. And don't give me any of that I'm a man and I need to work crap. When you become my husband you will do as I say. You do understand that don't you.\" \n\n\"Yes Mistress I understand.\" I told her and I truly meant it. The smile that lit up her face spoke volumes. \n\nWe packed up what was left of my belongings from the room, with the exception of my boxers, which I haven't worn since the Monday after Nikki came into existence. I wore them that day, but felt guilty the whole day, so from then on I only wore my Nick or Nikki panties. I threw the boxers in the trash then left the room for the last time. After packing my suitcases in my rental car I checked out of the hotel. Since I still was obligated to the job site for another week I kept the car. \n\nAbout an hour later we pulled into her drive way. After emptying the car and putting every thing away, we eat the pizza she had ordered on the way home. We sat for a few minutes then she said \n\n\"I think we should start. We have a long drive tomorrow and I like to get started early. Do you have any questions?\" \n\n\"Just one when I do Mike do I do him as Nick or as Nikki?\" \n\n\"That's up to you. On our wedding night you will be Nikki, but you will submit your bottom to me when I want it regardless of which persona you are in at the time.\" She told me \n\n\"I understand that. I will submit to you when ever and where ever you wish, but for the first time I'm with another guy I think I would rather do it as Nikki.\" I told her \n\n\"Good I was planning on you going as Nikki anyway because you still owe me two days. Now why don't you go put on a nightgown while I get my strap on? Also I want you to put on some make up and fix your hair.\" \n\n\"Yes ma'am, where should I meet you?\" I asked, already Nikki's persona was coming out.\n\n\"I'll come to you, just wait for me in the bedroom\" She told me as she left the room. \n\nTwenty minutes later I was freshly showered and had my make up on. My hair was in a French braid and I was dressed in a white peignoir set. I felt like I was a bride on her wedding night waiting for her husband. Josie came in wearing a pair of jeans with an obvious bulge where she shouldn't have one. She was wearing a polo shirt and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail. \n\nWith out saying a word she came to me and took me in her arms and kissed me. While we kissed she took my hand and placed it on her bulging crotch. It felt like she really had a hard on. It was firm, yet pliable. My hand stroked it through the jeans as we kissed I could also feel the head of it under her polo shirt. So I knew it was long, longer then I was and thicker too. \n\nI next felt Josie push down on my shoulders so I knew she wanted me to go to my knees. Once I was knelling in front of her my hands went to the waistband of her jeans automatically. I just wished that I could stop my hands from shaking. The shaking wasn't from fear as one might guess, but from excitement. Nikki had taken over my mine and she thought like a girl and this was what a girl did. She was excited to finally do something that girls do. \n\nWhen the button on the waistband was undone and the zipper was pull down Nikki pulled on the pants of her lover to lower then to the floor. The black satin panties were still holding the object of her desire. She then pulled on those to release the pink rubber cock that was trapped inside of them.\n\nNikki took the cock in her trembling hand, as a smile lit up her face. Her mouth watered at the thought of taking it in her mouth for the first time. Her hand moved up and down the shaft of that cock for a minute while she gathered herself control then she knelt up and took the head into her mouth. \n\nA groan escaped her lips as her tongue touched the head of her lover's cock. Her mouth sealed around the head and she sucked it as her tongue swirled around the head. Then her mouth moved down the length of the shaft taking it in till it hit her throat. Her head bobbed up and down on the shaft while one hand held it steady and the other hand went in search of the testicles that should be attached to it. \n\nShe didn't find any, but she did find the leather strap that held the cock in place. The strap went between the legs of her lover and up the back. Nikki sneak her fingers under the strap and found the slick slit of her lover instead. She slid her finger up the slit till it made contact with her lover's clit. Her finger played with her lover clit while her mouth continued to suck the hard cock in her mouth. \n\nShe knew she had to do more with the cock. Men loved when their woman could take their cock into their throats. Nikki's mouth slid down the cock till it hit her throat. She willed her throat muscles to relax then she slid down the rest of the way. At first it felt strange to have such a large object in her throat, but after a few seconds she welcomed it. Some how it felt right for it to be there. \n\nShe heard her lover groan when she felt warm liquid on the fingers that were under the strap. She knew she had just made her lover cum and she felt proud that she had. Her mouth started to go up and down on the cock. Though it came out of her throat she made sure that it went back in again on each down stroke. She did this a few more times till the cock was pulled out of her mouth and her lover stepped away. \n\nInstantly I took my mind back from Nikki I was disoriented with what had just taken place. I knew what had just happen, but if I tried to tell someone they would think I was a nut case. I tried to compose myself as Josie sat on her make up chair. She was getting herself under control from the orgasm she had just experienced. When she was able to speak she said. \n\n\"You\u2019re going to tell me that was the first time you ever done that aren't you.\" I nodded my head afraid what would come out if I spoke. \n\nI have a tendency not to believe you. But that dazed look in your eyes while you were doing it tells me that Nikki was more in control then Nick was. Am I right?\" I nodded my head stun that she knew what had happen.\n\n\"I've seen that look before. It happens mostly while your putting on make up and doing your hair. I've also seen it when you picking out something to wear. I think it happens when you need to think like a girl. That's why it happened now because sucking cock is a girl's thing so Nikki took over. If you suck Mike off like that tomorrow you'll have him cuming in no time. But the big question is did you enjoy it?\"\n\n\"I did, but Nikki enjoyed it more.\" I told her she laughed and said she thought so. I took a good look at the dildo that was still attracted to the strap on around Josie waist. It was longer and thicker then mine. I know Josie told me once that I was one of the biggest she ever had so I asked. \n\n\"Is Mike as big as that one?\" \n\n\"No he's smaller then you are. I thought I would use this one so when you sucked his, it wouldn't seem that big. Besides I don't own a smaller one. Don't worry you going to do just fine. Let me take a shower then we'll make love.\" \n\nJosie stood and removed her strap on before going into the bathroom. I quickly lit all the candles and got on the bed in just my panties. Josie came out in the nude and climbed into bed next to me still damp from the shower. We kissed for a few moments before she said \n\n\"I was thinking in the shower, maybe Nikki isn't attracted to women.\" I looked at her speechless then she continued, \"Think about it, the only time you've seen Bobbie you were dressed as Nikki. Maybe she isn't sexually attracted to other women.\" \n\n\"That can't be she's attracted to you.\" I said \n\n\"No Nick is there when we make love I don't see that dazed look in your eyes. When we kiss, even when you're dressed I don't see it. I do see it a lot when we go to my sisters house when you flirt with all the men.\" \n\n\"You said I flirt with the women too.\" I said through my embarrassment \n\n\"The flirting you do with the women is harmless. In fact if the woman isn't attracted to other women she probably wouldn't notice it, but what Nikki does with the men is outrageous. I feel sorry for you if we get married. The first party you host, your going to be in the bedroom more then you are out of it.\" \n\n\"Maybe I'll get lucky and I won't be the big loser for a while.\" I told her \n\n\"Honey you know as well as I do you're not that good at picking football games. Besides you're forgetting about the weekly Friday poker and movie night.\"\n\n\"You mean that happens every Friday. How do you decide who has to do it.\" I asked \n\n\"The wives take turns except for this month. Susie and Cathy are taking turns because Bobbie has to do the football parties.\" \n\n\"How come Bobbie has to do all the football parties?\" \n\n\"She was the big loser on the last Sunday of the regular season. So she has to do all the post season and the super bowl. That's why she was so upset.\" She told me\n\n\"I could see why. Having to service the other husbands every weekend for a month.\" After I said this Josie sat up and said\n\n\"It has nothing to do with servicing the men. It has to do with all the work that goes into the party. She has to cook all the food and make sure every thing is cleaned up. She has to make sure every one is happy. Offering she sexual services to the men is easy compared to that. If you think giving a blowjob and offering you bottom to three men is a chore maybe you shouldn't talk to my mother. The husbands love that part it's all the work before hand that they dread.\" \n\nI realized she was right so I said, \"Let's see what happens tomorrow. I know that I like what we did to night and I know Nikki loved it.\" When I told her this she laughed and said \n\n\"Wouldn't it be terrible if it was because I made you go as Nikki and she wasn't attracted to Bobbie because Nikki saw her as another female. And all this time Bobbie's been getting spanked because she couldn't entice Nikki into the bed room.\" \n\n\"That would be terrible. I would really feel bad if that were why she was punished.\" I told her. \n\n\"Oh don't feel too bad. Robert loves to be tied down and paddled. At lease he liked it when I did it.\"\n\n\"I have another question how come I can't work if all your brothers in-law work?\" \n\n\"First of all none of my brothers in-law work. Robert has the dealerships, but he has sales managers run them he just checks up on them once in a while his real passion is cars. He has thirty-two classic cars and is always looking for more. Frank is a Doctor, but he doesn't have much of a practice. Mostly he does surgery for the needy as does Michael. Neither of them really works, but they do devote their time and talent to the needy. And god bless them for it.\" \n\n\"The real reason your not going to work for the first year is your going to go to school. Unless you think you can cook like Bobbie has every weekend for the last month. Plus you're going to have to learn flower arranging and a host of other things. When you host your first party I want to be proud of you. You do want me to be proud of you don't you?\" ",
        "\"Of cause I do, but what if my first party is before I learn all that.\" I asked. I was starting to get a little worried that I wouldn't learn all this fast enough. \n\n\"Your first party will be our, house warming party, once it's built. That should take a year or so. You wouldn't be a hostess until then. But if you lose at poker then you'll have to pay that debt with whoever you lose to. The guys make up the rules there so you'll have to ask them, but again it will only be blow jobs till we're married.\" She told me. I didn't know that was what they meant by favors. \n\n\"I gather we won't be livening here?\" Josie laughed and said \n\n\"Sweetheart you've seen Jolene's and Cathy's houses, do you really think my home would be this small. This is like a bachelor pad, we'll live here until my house is built that should take about a year.\" \n\n\"This is too much to ingest all at once.\" I told her \n\n\"I know honey it is a lot but I want you to know what you're getting yourself into. It's not that bad we will have a lot of fun too. Have you ever been sailing in the Gulf of Mexico or diving in the waters off Tahiti?\" \n\n\"No I can say I have.\" \n\n\"I have several times. And I want you to experience it too. So don't think I'm just looking for a servant, some one to do the house keeping for me. I do want a husband that will share all these things with me. But there are something's you have to do, and I expect you to do them and enjoy them.\" \n\nWith that said Josie laid on top me and we kissed. We made love that night like never before. She couldn't get enough of my mouth on her pussy and I could have stayed under her all night and into the next day. When she rode my cock she did so for close to an hour, stopping several times to catch her breathe. When I was given her permission to cum, I came like a fire hose in her. When I cleaned her out after, my mouth was filled to over flowing with our combined juices. And they never tasted sweeter then they did that night. When we were done she lay in my arms as we feel asleep. When I dreamed that night it was only of Josie and as always the last dream of the night was of our wedding. \n\nPlease continue to the next part "
