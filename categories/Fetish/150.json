        "Fia leaves early the next morning. She's already dressed in a blouse and pencil skirt when she wakes you with a kiss. You turn your mouth away, saying you've got morning breath, but she just laughs and turns your head back to kiss you again, properly, her hips hot like the first time she kissed you at your wedding.\n\n\"Even with morning breath you taste delicious,\" she says. She glances in the dresser mirror and checks her lipstick. \"Sorry to race away. I'd love to spend the day just lounging around and showing you more of the mansion, but I've called a meeting. You'll be okay here on your own?\"\n\nYou nod, but you don't really feel all that confident. \n\nFia notices and ruffles your hair. \"The place is pretty idiot proof. Just experiment with all the buttons until you work out what they do. There's a remote on the coffee table that controls everything. Any problems, call the concierge on 131. Oh, and there's a phone - on the kitchen bench, I think - it's yours. My private number's in it, so if you really need to contact me use that. I know you'll only use it in an emergency. My number's on the wallscreen as well if you find that easier to use.\"\n\nHer watch beeps and she crumples up the tissue she's been using to adjust her lipstick and tosses it in the bin. She ducks back and kisses you on the forehead. \"I'll be home as soon as I can. Let's have a romantic dinner on the balcony.\"\n\nYou insist on seeing her off. She leads you up a small flight of stairs that end in a heavy door that she has to unlock. Amused by the confusion on your face, she says, \"Oh, the car's just for weekend jaunts. I usually take the helicopter to the office.\"\n\nFia opens the door and a fresh morning breeze blows into your faces. She kisses you a final time then leaves you to watch from the doorway as she walks across to the helicopter waiting on the helipad. Turbines whine as the rotor starts its lazy spin and soon the displaced air is blowing into your face, forcing you to push your hair clear of your eyes.\n\nFia waves to you from the cockpit and mouths something you can't hear over the noise of the blades now swiftly cutting through the air.\n\nThen the helicopter takes off and in a few moments it's a dark spot swinging over the glittering blue-gold of the bay. \n\nFeeling bereft, you watch the helicopter until it dwindles from view. You close the door on the exquisite view of the early-morning bay and descend to the living room. Without Fia around, the apartment is as eerily quiet as last night.\n\nThe remote is where she said it would be, but it takes you longer to find the phone. You finally find it on the arm of the sofa and flip through the contacts.\n\nThere are a lot of names you don't recognise. Fia's is there and also the woman she was talking to last night: Elana. She must be a secretary or something like that.\n\nYou put the phone on the coffee table and return to the remote. There are no labels next to the buttons, just strange glyphs you can't understand, but with a little experimenting you soon find you can turn the windows clear and opaque at will, lower a huge screen that's part of a home theatre, turn the sound system on and also activate the wallscreen.\n\nThe wallscreen is on the wall opposite the three with the windows that overlook the bay. It puts your small one at home to shame. You flick your hand in front of it and take it through all its options: videophone, television, internet. You feel too fragile to check your email as you originally intended and instead file through the list of contact profiles.\n\nSo that's what Elana looks like.\n\nOnce you've learned how everything works, you take a quick shower and then it's time to explore. The kitchen is the first port of call.\n\nThere's a huge walk-in pantry and a double-doored refrigerator, but both are almost totally bare. The pantry has a lot of instant stuff in it, as does the freezer section of the fridge. You uncover multiple open jars of the same thing: pickles and balsamic vinegar, and you mutter in exasperation at such gross inefficiency.\n\nYou sit down and write a shopping list on some Cantarella-themed stationery. There's a lot to buy. You get back on the wallscreen and place an order with the local supermarket. You'd have liked to have gone shopping in person, but you'll have time for that later. The rest of the apartment still beckons to be explored.\n\nYou find the guest bedrooms, complete with their own en suites, and a study. It's locked. Probably where Fia keeps all of her important documents. There's also a small gym and a training room attached to it. Fencing dolls arrayed against the far wall.\n\nOf course. Fia's an accomplished fencer.\n\nThe apartment has three balconies. The largest one is on the upper floor so that it doesn't obscure the view from the living room, and from the table and chairs and the second mini bar there you decide it must be for entertaining. The second is an intimate little balcony just off from your bedroom with an outside bench shielded by flower boxes. The third L-shaped balcony on the first floor commands a view of both the bay and the mountains. There's a small swimming pool attached to it as well as a Jacuzzi and a cottage garden. \n\nYou sit down on a rattan chair next to a rosemary bush already in bloom and run your hand through its fragrant branches as you look out across the bay. You soon find what you're looking for: the Cantarella HQ.\n\nYou lie back and wonder what Fia is doing right now. You've only known her for a day, but you're already missing her. So this is what married life must be like, then. Lying back in luxury and missing your wife.\n\nYou shake your head and get up. A husband has a lot of duties, after all. \n\nEven though the apartment is clean, it's very unorganised and you spend your morning sorting out piles of books and linen stacked in strange places. Then the concierge contacts you to say your groceries have arrived. The delivery woman brings them up, boggling at the view while she stacks the bags on the kitchen counter. \n\nAfter you pack everything away you busy yourself with exploring the kitchen. There are a number of top of the range appliances, some of them still in their original packaging.\n\nIt's obvious Fia seldom cooks. She probably doesn't have the time.\n\nYou put the kitchen through its paces. You bake some cupcakes, the scent sweetening the air when you pull them out to cool before icing them. It's a cheery, familiar smell, and the apartment feels more like home because of it.\n\nOnce you've iced the cupcakes, you get to work on deciding a menu for tonight's dinner. You had a glance at the frozen meals in the freezer before throwing them out and it's obvious that Fia likes meat.\n\nWell, she is a barracuda after all.\n\nYou've just put the roast on when there's a trilling from the living room. It's the wallscreen. You grab a tea-towel to wipe your hands with and hurry out to pick up the call, expecting it to be Fia.\n\nThe face that appears on the wallscreen isn't her, though. It's a woman around the same age as Fia who you don't recognise. When she sees you she arches her eyebrows, her dark eyes going wide, but then a smile flashes into being on her lips, a smile disarmingly sweet. She leans forward to get a closer look at you, pushing aside the lock of glossy black hair that falls across her sharp and fox-like face. \n\nYour heart skips. Whoever she is, she's very beautiful.\n\n\"Please excuse the intrusion,\" she says. \"Is Fia at home?\"\n\nYou shake your head. She's at a meeting, you say. You glance at the tickertape information filing by at the base of the screen.\n\n...Quinn Asakura, Managing Director of Cayetano-Kichijouten Banking Corporation...\n\nAsakura nods. \"Ah. That's why I wasn't able to reach her at her office, then.\" Her eyes flick down and you realise you're still holding the tea-towel. Her smile deepens. \"Doing some cooking? I'm sorry to have dragged you away from it.\"\n\nYou protest that there's no need for her to apologise. You had just finished icing your cupcakes when her call came through.\n\nAsakura chuckles. \"I had no idea that Fia had hired a personal cook. You seem very young for the position.\" Her eyes slide over you. Dressed only in your room clothes you feel almost naked under her gaze. \"Very young. But you're no doubt very good at what you do.\"\n\nYou stammer that you're not a cook, really, but Fia's husband. The woman's eyebrows fly upwards.\n\n\"Ah. I must apologise for my rudeness, then,\" she says. \"I had no idea Fia was planning on getting married.\" She quickly composes herself. \"First, my most heartfelt congratulations. I'm Quinn Asakura, but please call me Quinn. I'm a business associate of Fia's.\"\n\nYou introduce yourself, stumbling over the words. Quin's beauty is striking, and the intensity with which she looks at you makes everything you say sound like a lie.\n\n\"Well, Fia's done a good job keeping you under wraps,\" Quinn remarks. \"I can see why. Jealousy is bad for business, after all. You're more than adorable.\"\n\nYou stare down at your feet, mortified by her praise. Quinn laughs and you look back up.\n\n\"My, my! I believe I've made you blush again. I must apologise. I'll let you get back to your cooking. But would you let Fia know that I'd very much enjoy hearing from her?\" Her eyes glitter as she glances at the tea-towel still in your hands. \"And of course I owe you both a wedding gift. Something for the kitchen would not go amiss, yes?\"\n\nYou say that there's really no need but Quinn dismisses your protest with the sweep of a hand.\n\n\"No, no, no. I insist. And once I've decided to do something, there's no point arguing with me.\" She smiles. \"Just ask Fia about that.\" You see Quinn reach towards her own screen and press it. \"I'm sending you an invitation to my next soiree. I suppose Fia might be annoyed by the imposition, but you really need to come and press the flesh with us. Hopefully you can coax Fia out of her little bubble. For a barracuda she really does enjoy the isolation of an aquarium.\" Quinn winks at you and breaks the connection.\n\nThe details of the invitation float across the wallscreen and you stand there, staring at them, dumbfounded by your whirlwind introduction to Fia's world. Then you hear the oven click over and you hurry back to the kitchen.\n\n------\n\nYou sit at the table and look at the time on the fridge's display.\n\n9.15.\n\nFia sent you a message that she was going to be a little late and to expect her at 7.30, so you'd timed the meal to be ready just before then. \n\nNow the duck salmis has gone cold, as have the potatoes Lyonnaise and artichoke puree. You found a large number of bottles of a particular type of beer in the mini bar and you decided that it must be Fia's favourite, so there's one sitting beside her meal. The bottle glistens with condensation, too warm to drink. You've already swapped numerous warm beers with cold ones, expecting Fia home at any moment, but this time you put the bottle back in the fridge and don't replace it.\n\nSuddenly, you hear the distant hum of what might be her chopper. You hurry over to the window. There's a group of lights floating over the darkened bay.\n\nFia?\n\nA black shape behind the lights appears and grows larger. Then it swings up overhead and you know it has to be her.\n\nYou bounce up the stairs and by the time you've worked out how to open the door Fia is on the other side. She's fumbling for her key card, her hair dishevelled, her eyes dark and tired.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she says, pecking you on the cheek. \"I know I said I'd be back earlier but there was drama in Marketing. I had to fire the Director and there was a bit of unpleasantness. A lot of unpleasantness.\" Her eyes flick over you. \"You're a real sight for sore eyes, you know. I've been dealing with lawyers in starched shirts all day.\"\n\nAs you lead her down the stairs she sniffs the air. \"Wow, that smells amazing.\" When she sees the food itself waiting on the table she stops and rubs at her eyes with the back of a hand. \"Damn. You did all this for me?\"\n\nYou nod. You're sorry you didn't get the timing right and that the food's cold, but you can probably reheat everything.\n\nFia tosses her briefcase aside and sweeps you up into her powerful arms. Her kiss misses your mouth, your lips merely brushing when you turn away, not expecting it. \n\nFia makes no further attempt. She hugs you close. \"I'm really, really sorry.\"\n\nYou shake your head. You're just happy she's home. It's true. The apartment had grown dark and cold and lonely without her. \n\nFia sits down at the table and you bring her a fresh beer. She gratefully twists it open and takes a long drink.\n\n\"How d'you know Menabrea's my favourite?\"\n\nThe mini bar was full of them, you say. \n\nFia squeezes her forehead. \"Of course. I'm not thinking.\"\n\nShe moves to carve the bird but you stop her, insisting that you do it. You cut a couple of big slices, serve the sides and then pour the sauce.\n\nShe eyes the food predatorily and you tell her not to wait for you. But she shakes her head. \"It's our first real meal together,\" she says. \"We need to do it properly.\"\n\nAs you serve your own meal she gets some champagne from the minibar. \n\n\"Trento spumante,\" she says, peeling the foil from around the cork. \"I've been leaving this for a special occasion.\" She takes your hand in the middle of slicing the duck and makes you help her pump the bottle up and down. The cork bursts out with a pop and foaming champagne floods your hands.\n\nYou gasp at the foam dripping onto the floor but Fia just laughs. \"Oh, don't worry about it! I'll tell the concierge we need the carpet cleaned.\" She spills more champagne on the floor intentionally then pours the bubbling liquid into the glasses. \"I know you shouldn't mix champagne and beer, but it's been a long day. A very long day.\" She hands you a glass and you bring them together with a chime of crystal.\n\nFia takes a sip and shivers in delight. \"I'll make it up to you,\" she says. \"Getting sucked into my shambles of a life.\"\n\nYou sit down to your meal. Fia is in high spirits and devours everything. She barely says anything between mouthfuls and seeing her enjoying the food makes you flush with happiness. \n\nYou enjoy watching her eat so much that she's on the point of finishing her plate when you remember the call from Quinn. As soon as you mention her name Fia stops eating and looks at you. She chews the morsel still in her mouth, swallows and says, \"What did she say?\"\n\nYou tell her about the party invitation. Fia rolls her eyes. \"I was dreading that. A party, huh?\"\n\nYou ask Fia if she doesn't like Quinn. She snorts. \"I don't have to like her, just do business with her.\" She looks you right in the eyes, her face serious. \"Don't accept any more calls from Quinn Asakura.\"\n\nYou nod then ask whether you'll be going to the party.\n\n\"We have to,\" says Quinn with a sigh. \"But enough about that woman. Seconds please!\" She pushes her empty plate at you.\n\nYou fix her seconds and as she digs in you get up to start packing the leftovers away. Fia places a hand on yours. \"Just leave it. Let's go relax outside. Grab the champagne would you?\"\n\nShe leads you out onto the main balcony and pulls up a couch. Seated together, you gaze out across the glossy bay. The city sparks on the opposite side, spilling its neon light across the water. The view is serenely beautiful. \n\nThe champagne starts to go to your head. Fia feels so warm beside you, and over the warm salt scent of the ocean you can smell her. Tired, you rest your head on her shoulder and she places her hand on your knee.\n\nFia pours herself another glass and freshens yours. \"So, tell me all about your day,\" she says. When you tell her you spent most of the day tidying stuff up she laughs. \"I noticed. You did more than just that, though. You know, I've lived here for years, but until tonight it never felt like home. Coming back to you was... well.\" She encircles your shoulder with an arm and tousles your hair. \"So how do you feel?\"\n\nHappy, you tell her. It's true. You think you're starting to get used to the idea of being married.\n\n\"I'm happy too,\" says Fia.\n\nThe bottle of champagne is soon finished and Fia goes and gets another one. \"Well, I was going to keep it for another important occasion, but this one is so special I think we need to open it.\"\n\nThis time the foil causes her some trouble, but she eventually struggles it off. She hands you the bottle.\n\n\"Your turn to pop the cork,\" she says.\n\nNervous, you hold the neck of the bottle out over the bay and turn your head away as you ease the cork out little by little with your thumb. Fia laughs and grabs hold of the bottle and shakes it wildly. The resultant foamy blast flings the cork out into the darkness.\n\nShe overfills both glasses and you sit back down. You wonder out loud whether the cork has hit the ground yet. Fia puts her glass down and turns to you. Her eyes are hot, her smile sultry. \n\n\"Can I kiss you?\"\n\nSurprised, you nod. She takes the glass from your hands and then she's kissing you. Her tongue is hot, sticky with champagne. Fia pushes you against the back of the chair, her lips glued to yours as she cups your chin with her hands, her fingers teasing up into the hair behind your ears. \n\nThe kiss is voracious. She presses down on you, her body covering yours. All you can smell is her, the scent of her body, the salt of perspiration, the acid of the champagne.\n\nThe sudden intensity sets your heart racing. You feel yourself getting stiff. Fia slides her hands down from your face and begins to unbutton your shirt, but she soon gives up on this with a snort of frustration and dips her hands lower.\n\nThey're in between your legs, cupping your hardness. Fia breaks the kiss, drawing your bottom lip between her own lips and mouthing it. \"Looks like you're ready,\" she mutters.\n\nShe dips her tongue back into your mouth and this time she's even more aggressive. You struggle, but her tongue stays in your mouth, intent on exploring everywhere. Her hands are pulling your shirt from out of the waist of your pants and her fingernails score across your stomach. It's hard to breathe. \n\n\"C'mon. Let's get these damn pants off,\" she hisses against your lips as she fumbles with your belt.\n\nYou start pushing back at her, desperate to breathe, frightened by how quickly everything is happening. Only then does Fia break the kiss, leaving you gasping, chest heaving. She lies back, wiping at her mouth with the back of her hand.\n\n\"Jesus,\" she mutters, frowning. \"I'm sorry. I... Jesus, I was just too worked up.\" \n\nYou lie there, staring at her, stammering that it's okay and that you just couldn't breathe. It's a lie, though. She did scare you. \n\nFia shakes her head. Without a word she picks up the champagne and glasses and goes inside. You follow her. She places them in the sink and then sits on the couch and puts her face in her hands.\n\n\"I'm such a fuck up,\" she mutters. \"I promised I'd take things slow with you and then I just...\"\n\nYou sit down next to her, biting your lip. You're not sure what to say. You feel worthless for making her feel this way. You should have just let her do whatever she wanted. It's a husband's job to keep his woman happy. A husband isn't just someone to tidy the house and organise the bookshelves and make dinner. It's his job to support her, and please her as well. And you've failed utterly.\n\nYou lean over and embrace her. She shivers and moves as if to pull herself away, but then she looks up from her hands. Her eyes are moist.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she whispers. \"I'm under a lot of stress. Things... well, things are a bit hard for me at the moment.\"\n\nYou hug her tighter and she turns and throws her arms around you.\n\n\"Let's go to bed,\" she says. Then she laughs. \"For sleep, I mean.\"",
        "-----\n\nYou wake in the middle of the night. Fia's not there. Alarmed, you slip out of bed and pad over to the door. A muffled sound is coming from downstairs, the living room. Another call, maybe?\n\nNo, not words. Noises. \n\nYou open the door just enough to slip out. You try not to make any noise. You drop to your knees at the balustrade and peer down. Nothing, but the noise is clearer now.\n\nMurmuring and then a gasp.\n\nYou tiptoe down the stairway and near the bottom you spot Fia. She's lying back on the couch, her eyes closed, her nightdress bunched up around her stomach. One hand is under the cup of her bra and the other is moving inside her underpants. Her chest heaving, she bites her lip, smothering a gasp that tries to escape. \n\nYou know exactly what she's doing. You've caught Loretta doing it more than once. She's playing with herself.\n\nFia takes her hand from her underwear and puts one and then two fingers into her mouth before sliding them back inside. \n\nYou ache with shame as you watch her. You've reduced her to this. You're the one who's supposed to please her, to keep her happy. It's like you're not her husband at all, just some kid that she's babysitting, playing at being a husband.\n\nFia's gasps grow more frequent, the fingers inside her underwear more violent. Then she cries out and lifts her knees up as her entire body shudders.\n\nYou flee then, up the stairs and back into the bedroom. You slide into bed and push your face into the pillow. Your eyes feel hot and wet.\n\nDon't cry, you fool. She'll know you saw her. She'll be humiliated.\n\nYou squeeze your eyes shut and try to relax your body. Fia's footsteps pass the door on their way to the bathroom. Flowing water swishes from the tap and a short while later the door opens.\n\nAre her footsteps guilty as she approaches the bed? Maybe you're imagining things.\n\nFia slides in beside you, leaving a gap between your bodies. She lies on her back and it's only a few moments before her breathing deepens and she starts to snore.\n\nFor you, however, an eternity passes while you struggle to sleep, the weight of your failure as a husband crushing your heart.\n\n------------\n\nThe next morning you wake before Fia. You barely slept at all during the night and instead just lay there on the bed, listening to her breathe and watching her sleep. The barracuda had looked so peaceful, her head resting on the pillow, her chestnut hair curlicued over the pale skin of her cheek and neck.\n\nWhen she comes down the stairs still in her nightdress and rubbing her eyes, you've already got her coffee and breakfast ready. You get her to sit down and bring her breakfast to her. It's just some brioche and jam but her eyes light up when she sees it.\n\nShe samples the brioche and murmurs in appreciation. \"Don't tell me you just baked this!\"\n\nYou fight down a blush and nod, saying that brioche is incredibly easy to make. Anyway, you made the dough last night since refrigeration always makes it taste better. \n\nYou fuss around, making sure that Fia has everything she needs for her coffee. She has it with lots of sugar and lots of cream. Once she's happy you make yourself some tea and sit down across the breakfast nook from her.\n\nFia, her mouth full of brioche, examines you, frowning. \"You look tired.\"\n\nYou say that you had trouble sleeping last night.\n\n\"I think I must be working you too hard,\" she says, but her teasing seems forced. Her alarm beeps and she gobbles the rest of her breakfast and rushes off to get ready for the day.\n\nWhen she returns she's transformed back into the barracuda, her pencil skirt and blouse tight and accessorised today with a cravat; her lipstick is that stark red colour that so struck you the first time you met her.\n\nShe kisses you with her bloody lips, grabs her briefcase and is gone.\n\nThe rest of the day passes slowly. You have a lot of time to ponder your relationship so far. It was a shock seeing Fia last night pleasuring herself, forced to satisfy herself after you'd failed so miserably. Of course she'd been eager to make love to you: it's what people get married for, not just for children. Lovemaking breeds intimacy between a husband and wife. Loretta used to talk about it a lot, since your parents slept in separate rooms. \n\nYou don't want that to happen between you and Fia. You remember the forcefulness of her touch, the eagerness of her questing tongue in your mouth. Even when she'd been so frightening, she had smelled delicious, a different smell from before, a powerfully sexy one. \n\nYou get hard thinking about her, but you leave yourself frustrated. Maybe it's punishment for your failure. Anyway, you feel like it would be taking something for yourself which should be hers.\n\nThat night Fia returns early. You're in the middle of your dinner preparations when she comes down the stairs.\n\nShe sees her beer waiting of her on the table and walks straight past it to where you're deglazing the carrots in a pan. She embraces you from behind and starts kissing your neck, her breasts press against your back, enveloping you in her scent. Like last night, there's a hint of perspiration that you find deeply exciting.\n\nYou almost burn yourself and Fia lets go of you, laughing. \"I missed you,\" she says.\n\nYou get dinner on the table. Fia is sitting on the couch. She's taken off her pantihose and is massaging a foot raised up on the ottoman.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she says as you walk in. \"I know my feet are gross. They really hurt though. The floors of the boardroom are hard and I spent most of the day pacing them.\"\n\nYou push aside the ottoman and kneel down in front of her, saying you want to help. Fia blinks.\n\n\"Are you sure? But my feet are still sweaty from... oh!\"\n\nYou're already cradling her right foot in your hands. It's sweaty, like she said, but you don't care. It's her foot, after all: a surprisingly delicate foot and you quickly learn all about it as you get to work massaging it.\n\nFia sits back, moaning and grimacing as your fingers delve into her tight muscles. \n\n\"Oh god. Why are you so good at this?\"\n\nYou learned how to do it from a professional masseur, you explain. You mother insisted you take lessons, saying that it was an essential skill for a man to have.\n\n\"I think I need to kiss you mother when I see her next,\" murmurs Fia, closing her eyes. \"Yes. Just there.\"\n\nYou do a good job. You're eager to please her, especially after last night, and seeing her lying back and murmuring and moaning as your fingers dig into the tightness of her foot excites you. Fia bites her lip, her now dishevelled hair falling across her face as you get to work on a particularly stubborn knot. \n\nOnce the foot is done you move on to the other. You cup her heel in your hands and bring your face closer, ostensibly deciding where best to begin, but really to sample the delicious scent of her feet. You're embarrassed by the sudden desire to do so and try and conceal it by running of your knuckles across her arch.\n\nFia gasps and curls her toes and you can't resist bringing your lips against her sole, then, and kissing it. \n\nFia gasps again. \"Hey, what are you doing?\"\n\nCaught, you go back to massaging her foot, your gaze lowered to hide your heated face. \n\n\"No, do it again,\" she says. \"Please. I liked it.\" \n\nReally? Feeling like a pervert, you bring your lips against her arch again. This time you poke the tip of your tongue against her skin, tasting the salt of her perspiration, and Fia moans. \n\nYou kiss her again before turning your attention to her toes, which you kiss in turn. Fia starts to squirm. \n\nYou kiss her big toe, flicking your tongue at her skin again since she enjoyed it so much when you did the same to her arch. Then you dip your tongue in between her big toe and the toe beside it. \n\nFia gasps.\n\nYou feel a surge of excitement that your tongue is making her feel so good. You tease her, running your tongue across her toes, flicking underneath the first knuckle of each of them in turn. Fia squirms in agony but you hold onto her foot, not letting it get away, and slip her little toe fully into your mouth and suck on it.\n\nFia jerks her foot away with a yelp. While you're still kneeling there in surprise, she leans down and pulls you up onto her lap. She brings her face to yours, her eyes hot and eager, but when your lips touch she hesitates. \n\nYou reassure her by kissing her. It's a soft, butterfly kiss just against her lips but it leaves Fia breathless. She kisses you back, harder. Her arms sweep around your neck and sighing you melt into her embrace.\n\nHer kisses grow hotter. Her hair falls across your face, her tongue delving into your mouth as she caresses your chest and stomach through your shirt.\n\nYou're more than excited now. You squirm with shame, knowing your hardness must be obvious to her. A moment later you feel her hand brush across your erection and she whispers against your lips.\n\n\"May I?\"\n\nYou nod and she continues kissing you as her hand works at undoing your belt. She gets your belt off with little effort and then she unbuttons and unzips you and slips your pants and underwear down to your knees in a single impatient motion.\n\nFia draws her sticky lips from yours and glances down at your nakedness. \"Wow. You're bigger than I expected.\" Her fingers touch you and your breath explodes out of you. \"Are you really okay with this?\"\n\nYou nod. The delight that speared through you when she touched you was incredible, but it's nothing compared to how it feels now when her hands curl around your length and she strokes you once.\n\nYou cry out. Fia stops. \"Oh, does it hurt?\" she murmurs. \"Maybe I should stop, then.\"\n\nYou bury your face in her chest, not wanting to show her how excited you are. But Fia takes it as a no and she begins to tease you with slow and gentle strokes.\n\nSmall gasps burst from you and you start spilling out in your eagerness. Fia chuckles and runs her fingertips over the sensitive head and draws the stickiness there down along your length. The stroking is slick and easier now and you get harder and harder. Fia knows what's she doing and she quickly learns what you like. \n\nHow many times has she done this before, you wonder? You feel the hot sting of jealousy but it just as quickly disappears as pleasure wracks your body.\n\nHer strokes become more fervent. Fia coaxes your face from her chest with coos and stroking of the hair then attacks your mouth again. The eager hot wetness of her tongue is too much for you and with a cry you reach the peak of your excitement. Hot shame fills you in equal measure with the most exquisite pleasure as you come. Fia's hand grows sticky with your copious semen but she makes no move to stop stroking you, and you're grateful for the fact. Pleasure flows over you with each stroke and you moan against her soft chest.\n\n\"Good boy,\" says Fia. \"You came a lot, didn't you? You must have kept yourself for me all day. I'm very happy.\" \n\nShe continues to caress you as you go soft. Then she gets up and grabs a handful of tissues and wipes off her hands. She cleans you off next, humming happily. \n\n\"Dinner will have to wait,\" she says. \"I think I need to give you a bath. I should have one too.\" Her eyes are dark, her pupils large as she considers you from beneath her heavy lashes. \"Shall we have one together? In the interests of conserving water?\"\n\nYou nod. You feel sleepy after your orgasm and you feel like going to bed. But you feel guilty again, too. Fia was so attentive to your desire and you didn't have a chance to properly finish your massage.\n\nShe pulls your pants and underwear off and helps you up from the sofa. You redden with embarrassment as she leads you, naked from the waist down, up the stairs to the bathroom.\n\n\"Just let me get the bath ready,\" she says.\n\nShe disappears inside leaving you in the corridor. Water hisses. A few moments later the door opens again and Fia is standing there, a towel around her torso. She puts her hands on her hips, her face stern. \n\n\"What are you doing? Get that top off!\"\n\nYou do as she says. You begin to fold up your shirt but Fia grabs you and drags you into the bathroom.\n\nThe bath is huge, the size of a Jacuzzi. For all that talk of conserving water, it's pouring out of a hidden faucet in the wall in a torrent. Steam fills the room. You take a step forward and yelp when Fia slaps you on your bare butt. \n\n\"Hurry up, you!\"\n\nYou pad across the chilly tiles, glad for the steam covering your nakedness. You have to clamber into the bath since the steps are hidden and as you slip into the water you gasp at how hot it is. \n\nThere's a gentle surge in the water as Fia herself gets in. She looms out of the steam and grabs you from behind, making you yelp again.\n\n\"Hehe. My husband's a nervous little thing, isn't he?\"\n\nShe throws her arms around your neck and presses against you, her breasts, slick and hot, squashing against your back. Her lips, cool now in contrast to the heat of the steam and the water, run along the side of your neck. She murmurs happily as her hands slip along your ribs and down between your legs.\n\nYou gasp and panic that Fia might want you to get hard again. But she just whispers mollifying noises in your ear and gets to work washing you. Soon a loofa gets involved and she has you raise your arms so that she can clean under them with the strawberry scented foam.\n\n\"Strawberry is my favourite scent,\" she whispers to you. \"But it's our little secret. I don't know what the board would say if they knew the Barracuda had the taste of a ten year old girl. They'd probably see it as weakness. Some of them are out to get me, you know.\" She sighs. \"You're the only thing keeping me together right now. I had no idea being married to you would make me so happy... so happy.\"\n\nHer words and the gentle touch of her washing bring a smile to your lips. You had no idea you'd be as happy as you are either. The scary barracuda of last night seems far away now.\n\nYou turn and hug Fia to you. She's surprised by your sudden assertiveness and drops the loofa. You bring your face close to hers and tilt your head, gazing shyly up at her.\n\nShe knows what you want. She kisses you, gentle at first, but then the barracuda in her comes back and she kisses you harder. With her breasts against your chest now you're amazed at how big they are. Growing up with your sisters you've only seen bare breasts that were modest in size. Fia's are large but firm with only the slightest of heaviness to them. In the bath her pale body has turned a bright glistening pink, but her hard nipples are pinker still.\n\nFia breaks the kiss, gasping. \"Uh, we really need to finish washing you.\" \n\nShe has you stand up and turn around so that she can get to work washing your stomach, butt and thighs. She giggles as she gently pats the loofa between your legs.\n\n\"This spot needs some extra attention, I think.\"\n\nYou're covered in foam from the stomach down after lying in the water and you're glad of the modesty it gives you. But the smooth warmth of Fia's body pressed against yours and her teasing with the loofa soon gets you hard again. \n\nFia says nothing but keeps washing you as if nothing has happened. She takes a plastic basin and sluices clear water over you revealing your glistening nakedness. She reaches over and takes you in her hand, stroking your already hard length.\n\n\"I'm a lucky woman,\" she murmurs as she leans forward and slips her lips over the head.\n\nYour legs go weak and you shiver as a never-before experience pleasure spears through you. Fia makes you sit back on the edge of the bath as she slips her lips further down your shaft. She's able to get most of you in her mouth and the feeling of slick heat is excruciatingly pleasurable. \n\nFia notices your balls tightening and she slows down, but it's already too late. You stammer out a warning just as you start coming in her mouth. Even while being overwhelmed with pleasure you try and push her away, concerned that she'll be disgusted, but Fia grasps your hips and keeps her mouth glued to you as waves of semen jet into her mouth. She mutters happily, her throat moving as she swallows.\n\nYour hands clutch the edge of the bath as Fia's sucking leaves you shuddering, scarcely believing the intensity of the delicious sensations spilling over you. Fia swallows the last of your semen and pops you out of her mouth to lick at the small amount pooling on the tip.\n\n\"And I just cleaned this,\" she complains, pouting. She sweeps a small dab of semen at the corner of her mouth with her tongue and then retrieves the loofa and goes back to washing you between the legs as you soften. She gazes up at you. \"This thing isn't going to get hard again, is it? I think I've probably had my daily intake of protein already.\"\n\nAlthough still dazed by your climax, you're coherent enough to try and apologise for coming so quickly.\n\nFia snorts. \"You really don't know anything about girls, do you? I'm flattered you came so quick. I think you might be getting used to me.\"\n\nShe finishes washing you and you slip down gratefully back into the water. She applies some more bath foam to the loofa and glances at you. \"I need to wash myself, but maybe...\" She holds out the loofa towards you, dropping her gaze in uncharacteristic embarrassment. \"I don't know. Maybe you'd like to...\"\n\nYou nod and take the loofa. It's your job, after all, to attend to your wife's needs. She watches you as you glide through the water to her and tentatively place the foamy loofa against one arm. Fia stretches her arm out and you soap the length of it, followed by her other arm. Then she lifts them and you give her armpits attention. After that you hesitate, but she takes the end of the loofa and guides it onto her chest.\n\nYour heart racing, you slide the loofa over her breasts, coating them in white foam. \n\n\"Don't forget to wash between them,\" says Fia. \"It gets pretty sweaty there.\" \n\nAfter she feels that you've given them enough attention she turns around and you soap the beautiful expanse of her back. \n\nFia looks over her shoulder. \"I need to wash the rest of myself now, but if you're too embarrassed, I can do it myself.\"\n\nYou shake your head, your heart pumping hard in your chest. Pleased, Fia smiles and slowly eases herself up out of the water. Some foam sticks to her, covering her sex but her flat stomach, wide hips and generous thighs are all bare, glistening and pink. You quickly apply foam to her long legs, shyly going higher until you're washing her thighs and lower stomach.\n\nWhen she's happy with the job you've done to her front, Fia turns around, kneels forward in the water and stretches her torso over the edge of the bath. You know what is expected of you. You dab foam over the back of her legs and the curve of her buttocks but then stop. Fia looks back at you, pouting.\n\n\"Don't be so bashful,\" she says. \"I washed you properly, right?\"\n\nThe blush thankfully invisible on your already bath-hot skin, you dab the loofa between Fia's legs again, washing her properly this time. Once you're finished she remains lying there and you realise you've forgotten to rinse her. You pour the water over her, the foam sliding from her body.\n\nYou planned on averting your eyes, but curiosity gets the better of you and you gaze at the naked beauty of your wife. From behind, Fia's sex is surprisingly puffy, pink, the inner lips discrete. \n\nSuddenly she flips over and you fall back onto your bottom with a splash. A mocking grin burst onto her face. \"I could feel your eyes burning into me. Did you get a good look?\"\n\nYou shake your head, unable to meet her gaze, but Fia just laughs. She's sitting up on the edge of the bath now, leaning back on her elbows, considering you with glittering eyes. She parts her legs and crooks a finger at you.\n\nSwallowing, you sit there staring at her.",
        "\"You're curious, right? Why don't you have a good look then?\"\n\nWhen you're too bashful to make a move, Fia grabs your hand with an impatient snort and pulls you forward onto your knees. She lets go of your hand and leans back. With your face level with the edge of the bath, you can see everything. Her pubic hair is dark, neatly trimmed.\n\n\"I like to stay natural,\" she murmurs without a trace of embarrassment. \"I hope you don't mind. Shaving it all off is too itchy and makes me feel like a little kid.\"\n\nYou don't understand why she'd think you'd mind. Grown-up women are supposed to have hair there, right? Blushing, you watch as she parts her lips with her fingers. Fia's fingers flutter light across her pinkening sex. She's glistening there, an even deeper pink than the rest of her bath-hot body. \n\nShe's getting excited just by having you look at her.\n\nLast night pushes itself into your mind. Fia, lying back on the sofa, her hand in her underpants, her fingers deep within her, relieving the tension you left her with.\n\nSwallowing, you place your hands against her inner thighs and lean forward between her legs.\n\nFia's eyes flash open. \"Hey, what are you...?\"\n\nOne night you lay outside Loretta's door eavesdropping as she and Genevieve, her best friend at the time, talked in hushed whispers about all sorts of female secrets. One had been what they liked getting their boyfriends to do to them. In a few minutes of graphic, giggling description you'd learned far more than the textbook your parents gave you had been able to teach you.\n\nNow you have the chance to put it into practice. Eager to please her, you kiss the inside of Fia's thighs with little butterfly kisses, the pink skin hot moist and taut against your lips. You flick the tip of your tongue across her skin then, trailing a lazy meander up towards her sex. The scent of her is incredible, deep and spicy, an intoxication more than a scent, and you feel the nerves along your spine from the base of your neck to your penis tingling in excitement. \n\nFia moans. Striving to stay still, her hands grip the edge of the bath. She opens her legs wider and you decide that teasing her any more would be shameful. You run your hands further up her thighs and touch her for the first time with your fingertips. Fia yelps and you pull your hands away, but she quickly grabs them and puts them back.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she breathes. \"It's just... it's been a long time since anyone has touched me there.\"\n\nThe truth of her words is obvious. Her sex is swollen, sticky with her desire. Trembling, you part her lips and kiss the top where that hard little button is.\n\nFia shudders and you have to hold on to her thighs to keep your mouth in place. Her reaction gives you confidence and you move forward and lick the same spot. \n\nSo this is what a woman tastes like. Salty and savoury and utterly delicious.\n\nFia's entwines the fingers of both hands in your hair and she pulls you closer, keeping your head in place between her legs as you start licking her in earnest.\n\nYou do your best to pleasure her, alternating between licking long licks and short flicks of the tongue with caresses of your lips, just like you remember Loretta's friend saying she preferred. Fia seems no different. The velvet skin against your lips and mouth grows hotter and more slick and the erotic fragrance enveloping you deepens. Fia is quivering now like she's being tortured, but she still keeps your face locked between her legs. And yet the hands holding your head are gentle: if you wanted to pull away you know you could. But there's no way you're going to stop until you've fully satisfied her.\n\nIt doesn't take long. Fia soon cries out, her feet lifting out of the water, her toes curling. She trembles, trapping your head between her thighs as you keep licking at her. Her juices are flowing from her now, their flavour overpowering.\n\nFia shudders a final time and then her body goes slack, releasing you. You fall back gasping in the foamy water and Fia slides in after you. Her eyes are dazed, half-closed, but she still manages to throw her arms around your neck and pepper your startled face with kisses.\n\nShe lays back then and pulls you backwards onto her lap, continuing to hug you, only now from behind. Your head rests back against the slick softness of her breasts. The foam in the bath has started to thin and the steam is clearing as the water cools, the sink and other parts of the bathroom looming back into existence like a landscape appearing out of dissolving mist. You realise your mind is wandering and Fia seems about to fall asleep as well. She cuddles you to her.\n\n\"I can't remember it ever being like that,\" she murmurs at last. \"Are you sure that's the first time you've ever done it?\" You nod. She squeezes you tight. \"Huh. Just a natural, I guess. And you looked so sexy, your butt sticking out of the water and wiggling about. I think seeing that was what finally drove me over the edge.\" She sighs. \"The water's going to get cold. We can get out if you like.\"\n\nYou tell her you want to stay in here with her a little longer.\n\n\"Heh. Me too. I guess I just love water. I am a barracuda, after all.\"\n\nThe two of you laze together in the water until it grows cold. You feel content, safe and loved, overjoyed that you were able to please her so well. The tension that had existed between the two seems far away, now.\n\n\"I'm sorry I've been so tense,\" she says as if reading your mind. \"I... things have been a bit challenging with the company recently.\"\n\nShe opens up, then, about what's been happening with the takeover of Lunghezza Motori. You don't understand a lot of the business terminology she uses, even though she's obviously trying to keep things simple for you, but you get the gist: her takeover of the company is not going well. Lunghezza Motori has drawn on an unexpected source of funds to defend itself against the buyout by initiating a takeover of Fia's own company.\n\n\"It's called the Pacman defence,\" she says. \"I don't know whether you've ever played the videogame. The one with the little yellow guy and the ghosts?\"\n\nYou tell her you know the game. Loretta loves playing old games and she's often shown off her prowess to you.\n\n\"Old?\" Fia gasps and squeezes you, but relents just as quickly and snuggles you instead. \"Yeah, I guess it is an old game. Well, you know how when Pacman eats a pill he can turn on those ghosts that have been trying to get him? Well, that's what Lunghezza Motori is doing. They've swallowed a pill and I'm trying to find out where they got it. But in our game ghosts can swallow pills as well, and it's just a race now to see who can eat the biggest one.'\n\nSo Fia could lose her company? You turn around and glimpse the worry on her face in the split second before she masks it with a grin.\n\n\"No chance,\" she says. \"Gobbling things up is my forte, after all.\" She snaps her teeth at you and you shy away in mock terror, laughing. Her face grows sultry. \"You have to be careful being married to a barracuda. They'll try and gobble you up when you least expect it.\" She drops a hand between your legs and grabs you. You yelp and try to squirm away but she wraps her free arm around your torso and holds you back. You manage to slip free and it becomes a splashing match as Fia chases you laughing around the bath. Soon you're wrestling, then the holds become embraces and you kiss until your lips are bruised and the bath water turns cold."
