        "Part One\n\nAdam's world was turned upside down when his wife Amy, the love of his life since they had met at university, had died within a few months of being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer. They were both only 45 years old but they had spent over half of their lives together and had been each other's only ever sexual partners. They had been unable to have children, even though they had tried everything to conceive, and Adam was glad of that now otherwise, had they had any, they would now be without their mother. He had taken a sabbatical from work to help care for her and had laid her to rest. Now, twelve months later, he was sat alone in a coffee shop slowly stirring a spoon around and around in his coffee cup whilst reading the news on his iPhone, killing time before going to see a lawyer about Amy's will. Every so often Adam looked up and stared around the coffee shop in what Amy and he had termed \"people watching\", something they both enjoyed doing particularly at airports. As the coffee shop was situated in the downtown financial district it was mainly full of what looked like business professionals either staring into their smartphones or tapping away on their laptops.\n\nSat on a high stool at the bar in the window was an attractive young woman probably in her late twenties or early thirties. Adam immediately recognised her as the young associate in a firm of lawyers who had represented the company he worked for when they had sued a competitor for breach of intellectual copyright. As head of technology in the company Adam had worked closely with her and was impressed with her professionalism and her quiet but determined manner. She was completely engrossed in what she was doing and if she wasn't tapping the keyboard of her laptop, reading her notes or sipping her coffee she pulled what appeared to be an elastic hair band from her wrist and twirled it around her fingers whilst looking at her screen. He remembered her as being rather tall with long legs, a slim figure, full breasts and thick, wavy, dark auburn hair that came half way down her back. She had always worn business dress when he had met with her but today she was wearing knee high black leather stiletto boots and what looked like an extremely fluffy, black, round neck angora sweater dress that accentuated her curves, particularly her breasts. As she was sat down the dress had ridden up to between her knees and her thighs and just covered the lacy tops of what appeared to be black lacy holdups.\n\nAdam was minded to go over and speak to her but he told himself that she probably wouldn't remember him and she appeared to be so engrossed in what she was doing that he didn't want to disturb her. He was head down in an article and he didn't notice her get up from her seat, walk towards the door, stop and then make her way over to where he was sitting. He looked up as he heard his name being said to see her standing in front of him carrying her coat and purse in one arm and pulling her flight case that she used to carry all of her work in the other hand.\n\n\"Adam. How lovely to see you.\"\n\n\"Hello Rebecca. Sorry I didn't see you standing there. It's lovely to see you too. How are you?\"\n\nHe got up and was about to hold his hand out to shake hers but she moved towards him, put her hands to his shoulders, pulled him into her and kissed him lightly on both cheeks. The smell of her perfume was very subtle but intoxicating.\n\n\"I'm very well. I ran into your CEO last week at a breakfast seminar and he told me what had happened to your wife. I was so sorry to hear about her. If there is anything I can do please let me know. He also said that you had quit your job?\"\n\n\"Thanks, that's very kind of you. Yes I finished last month. I found it hard after Amy passed away going back to work in the same place and then going home to an empty house. Too many memories.\"\n\n\"I can understand that. What will you do instead?\"\n\n\"Not sure long term but, in the short term, I am going to go off on my motorbike to visit the places that Amy and I said we would always go and see, but didn't because of work and other commitments. The life assurance we took out when we got married plus the one from her company means our mortgage and debts will be paid off and I won't have to work for quite a while.\"\n\n\"Good for you. I hope it all goes well for you. So what brings you to this part of town?\"\n\n\"I've got an appointment with a lawyer to go through the probate application for Amy's will. I thought that it would be straightforward and I've tried to do it myself a number of times but it keeps getting rejected. It appears to be beyond my limited knowledge of the law and so I need to turn to the professionals.\"\n\nRebecca put her fingers to mouth and pondered for a few seconds before she spoke.\n\n\"Look, I'm not a specialist in inheritance law but why don't you let me have a look before you go to an expensive lawyer.\"\n\n\"But you are an expensive lawyer,\" Adam laughed.\n\nRebecca laughed back. \"Look, you gave me a bundle of help when we were working on that breach of copyright suit so this is the least I can do in return. No fee; just buy me dinner sometime.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? I wouldn't want to impose and I guess you're as busy as always?\"\n\n\"Always busy but it would be great to work with you again. I still have your cell phone number so I'll give you a call to arrange to meet up in the next few days. Is that okay?\"\n\n\"That's great. Give me a call whenever. My cell phone is always on.\"\n\nThe next day Adam received a text message from her suggesting that he go over to her apartment on the following Friday evening. They could have a drink while she went through all of the paperwork he had regarding Amy's will and estate. Not having anything else planned Adam immediately replied to accept her invitation and ask for her address and, at 8pm sharp, Adam stood outside the door to her apartment carrying a bottle of red wine, a bottle of white wine and a bunch of flowers. He had been well taught by Amy to never turn up at anyone's home without a gift and he smiled to himself as he thought of what she would have said had he not done so.\n\nHe knocked on her door and she opened it practically immediately, almost as if she had been waiting for him to arrive. She was wearing a pair of tight white jeans and a fluffy gold coloured short sleeved, round neck mohair sweater while her hair was tied up in a ponytail. She took the wine from his hands and thanked him for the flowers. \"They are absolutely beautiful. You didn't need to buy them but thank you anyway.\" She leaned in and kissed him on both cheeks and he couldn't resist reciprocating and felt the softness of the mohair as he put his hands on her shoulders. She led him down the hallway and into the lounge.\n\n\"Make yourself comfortable on the sofa while I put the flowers in water and get us some drinks. What would you like; red wine, white wine, beer or something stronger? \"\n\n\"Red wine would be great.\"\n\n\"Get the will and probate papers out while I get the drinks.\"\n\nAfter she had returned with their drinks she laid everything out on the large coffee table and sorted it into piles. While Adam sat on the sofa nursing his wine she sat with her back to him cross legged on the floor going through everything and asking him question after question. As she leaned over the table her sweater rode up and her jeans pulled down exposing the bare skin of her lower back and he saw that she had a tattoo of a dolphin leaping over waves at the base of her spine. Adam scanned his eyes up and down her back and became intrigued with the fluff at the hem of her sweater rubbing against her bare skin and had never thought of wool against a woman's skin as being sexy before. At one point she wanted him to read something and so she shifted to the side allowing him to look at the document. As he finished and looked at her he noticed the swell of her firm breasts inside the sweater and could tell that she wasn't wearing a bra as her nipples were slightly protruding. As he looked up she was staring into his eyes and, flustered, he quickly looked back at the documents and tried to maintain focus on why he was here and what she was doing to help him.\n\nJust before 11pm she pulled all of the separate piles together into one and moved them to the side of the coffee table. \"I think that's enough for tonight. I have everything I need in order to be able to complete the forms. It should only take me another couple of hours and I can do that over the weekend. If you sign them now I can send them off to the probate office on Monday. Is that okay?\"\n\n\"That would be absolutely brilliant. So, as regards payment for your professional services, when do you have a free evening so that I can take you to dinner?\"\n\n\"I already have plans for this weekend but how about the following Saturday?\"\n\n\"That's good for me. I'll pick you up here at 8pm.\"\n\nAdam spent the following week clearing the house of the remnants of Amy's illness so all that was left were her possessions from before she became ill. He didn't feel ready to clear those and left everything as she had left it. At times his grief seemed overwhelming but he knew that Amy would have wanted him to get on with his life. He went to her grave every day to talk to her, tell her how he would always love her and miss her but also tell her of his plans. She had loved riding pillion on their motorbike, sitting there daydreaming and looking to the left and right admiring the scenery. She always said that, apart from their love making, it was the closest she felt to him as her groin and legs were pressed hard against him. When he sped up to overtake he always tapped her left leg and she always leaned forward and put her arms around his waist. Their plans to ride across the country to the west coast had never reached fruition and he wanted to put their plans into action as part of his grieving process.\n\nAs Saturday evening loomed he began to have second thoughts of going out to dinner with Rebecca. He was caught between being seen as disloyal for going out with an attractive young woman so soon after laying Amy to rest but knowing that he should keep to his word and take her dinner as a thank you for her sorting out the probate. Deciding that Amy would have not thought it disloyal and would have expected him to keep his word, he showered and shaved, dressed in the suit that Amy had always loved him wearing and drove to Rebecca's apartment. As she had the first time he went to her apartment, she answered the door as soon as he had finished knocking. This time she was wearing a figure hugging black dress that came to just above her knees and looked absolutely stunning. Adam stood there with his mouth open and while surreptitiously looking her up and down.\n\n\"\"Wow, you look gorgeous\", he exclaimed.\n\n\"You don't look too bad yourself. Let me get my wrap and purse. I won't be a second.\"\n\nHe had made a reservation at a renowned sea food restaurant on the shore about half an hour's drive from her apartment. Adam was initially a little nervous as they drove but Rebecca soon put him at ease and, by the time they arrived, he was relaxed for the first time in months and felt ready to enjoy the evening. The food and wine were superb and Rebecca totally managed the conversation to allow Adam to open up about almost everything. Towards the end of their meal he realised that mostly all of the conversation had been about him and so he tried to turn it around to find out more about Rebecca.\n\n\"Are you still seeing that young lawyer you were seeing when we worked together?\"\n\n\"No we finished a good couple of years ago. He was a really nice guy and we got along really well, probably because we had the law in common, but it wasn't meant to go anywhere.\"\n\n\"Nobody since? Sorry I am being really nosey. I was just feeling guilty that I may have taken you away from someone on a Saturday evening.\"\n\n\"No you haven't taken me away from anyone. As regards relationships, I think that I'm too focussed on my career at the moment to want to put the required energy into a relationship. When Mister Right becomes available my priorities will change.\"\n\n\"Well if you don't mind me saying, you are a talented lawyer and a beautiful woman. I'm sure that you will meet Mister Right at some point and know that he is the one.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know I will. I just have to wait until he finds me.\"\n\nAdam knew that Rebecca was a positive and assured woman but his experience had shown him that a person had to have luck to meet the love of their life. He had been lucky to have met Amy and for them to have fallen in love.\n\nOver coffee back at her apartment she asked him how long he planned to be away for and offered, as a friend, to look after his legal affairs whilst he was away. Adam replied that he didn't know how long he was going to be away for but, as he didn't have any family or other friends who would be able to do it for him and, not wanting to pay an expensive lawyer to do it, he was happy to accept. Also, deep down he was pleased that she wanted to keep in contact with him.\n\nShe already had his email address and cell phone number and told him that she would keep him updated regularly and that, if he needed to sign any documents, she would send them to where he was going to be at that time. Adam told her that he had created a blog so that his family and friends could follow him on his travels and said that he would send her the web address so she could also follow. When he went to leave she hugged him tightly and kissed him gently on his lips.\n\n\"I am so glad I bumped into you at that coffee shop. Thank you for such a lovely evening\", she whispered.\n\n\"And thank you so much for this evening and for everything you have done\", he replied. He hugged her back and kissed her tenderly on the forehead. With that he left.\n\nTwo weeks later and, after a final visit to Amy's grave, Adam sat on his motorbike on the driveway to his house. His panniers, top box and tank bag were full of his clothes and essential tools and his roll bag, containing his sleeping bag and lightweight tent, was strapped to the pillion seat. After turning to take one last look at the house he pulled in the clutch, selected first gear, opened the throttle, let the clutch out and roared away.\n\nRebecca checked Adam's blog every day, added to the comments on some of his photos, texted him once a week to keep him up to date on the probate and, a month into his odyssey, sent him a couple of documents that he needed to sign and return. His journey had taken him all the way up the east coast and into Canada, visiting Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto before heading back into the States to Chicago and the start of the historic Route 66. Two months later, and after numerous detours and elongated stays at places he and Amy had spoken about so often, Adam arrived at Santa Monica pier, the end of Route 66. He checked into a hotel just off the beach and sat on his balcony drinking a cold beer while he updated his blog. The sun was just going down and for the first time since Amy's death he felt at peace. He also felt really tired from being on the bike for such a long journey and had decided to spend some time relaxing on the beach while he thought about what he was going to do next.\n\nHis cell phone rang. It was Rebecca calling.\n\n\"Hey Rebecca, how's it going?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, thanks. I've just seen your last blog entry. You must be so pleased to have reached the end?\"\n\n\"Well my arse is really pleased that it doesn't have to sit on the saddle for a while so I guess the answer is yes.\"\n\nThey chatted for some considerable time while he told her of some of the funny incidents that had happened to him on the road and the people that he had met. He could sense from the way that she laughed and the questions she asked that she was genuinely interested and pleased for him.\n\n\"Anyway, that's enough of what's been going on with me. What has been happening in your life?\"\n\n\"Oh you know. Work, work and more work. Looking at your blog has made me really envious. I think that I could do with a vacation myself.\"\n\n\"Well why don't you pack a bag and come and join me?\"\n\n\"I would love to but I have so much on that I can't spare the time. And talking of work, I phoned as I have the final set of papers that I need you to sign. Where are you staying so I can send them to you?\"\n\nAdam hesitated for a few seconds before saying that he wasn't sure as he was thinking of moving up the coast the next day so would call her as soon as he knew where he would be for a few days.\n\nAs Rebecca sat at her desk the next day her secretary brought in an envelope that had been delivered by courier. When she opened the envelope it contained a first class return ticket to Los Angeles; departing on Friday and returning on Monday. A note inside the envelope read \"Clear your diary and come and join me on the beach for the weekend. Love, Adam\".\n\nThree days later Rebecca was sat on the balcony of Adam's hotel room sipping a cold beer enjoying the warmth of the late afternoon sunshine. Adam had picked her up from the airport in a hired limousine and was now down in reception arranging a room for her, something he had forgotten to do prior to her arrival.\n\n\"Ready for another beer?\" he asked as he stepped through the doorway onto the balcony, holding two bottles in his hands.\n\n\"Absolutely\", she replied as she held her hand out for one of the bottles. He handed her one and leaned over the railing and stared down into the street.\n\nShe rolled her eyes up and down his body; from his broad shoulders, down his back, over his tight arse and all the way down his legs. She thought that he had become leaner and more toned than the last time she had seen him. She had thought him handsome before but he now looked ruggedly handsome. He had let his hair grow longer and he was now sporting a short stubble beard. Standing there in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops he looked so different from the suited and booted corporate executive that she had first met. She started to feel that familiar tingle in her groin that she always had when she was around him. She had never felt the need to pursue a man and, given that at the time they first met he was a happily married man, fifteen years her senior and had shown no signs of being interested in her, she told herself that she should put it down as an unrequited schoolgirl crush.\n\nThe more she stared at him, that familiar tingle in her groin started to grow into a raging inferno and she felt that she would explode at any minute. She had never wanted any man as badly as she now wanted him but she was minded that it may be too soon after Amy's passing and that, if she made the first move and he was not ready, she may put him off completely. Be patient she told herself. If he wants you he will come to you when he is ready.\n\nShe stood up and stepped over to the railings to stand shoulder to shoulder with him. The warmth from her shoulder flowed through him and they stood together with their beers in their hands, looking out towards the ocean without a word being said or a sip being taken.\n\n\"Thank you for transporting me across the country to join you in a beer\", she said.\n\nWithout turning to look at her, Adam put his left arm around her shoulder and pulled her into him.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. There is, however, a slight problem.\"\n\n\"What's the problem?\"\n\n\"It's your room.\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"You haven't got one. I forgot to make a reservation for you when you said that you were coming and when I went to reception they told me they didn't have anything available. In fact, they told me that I would be lucky to find anything anywhere given that it is July 4<sup>th</sup>.\"\n\n\"That does seem a bit of a problem. I suppose that I could always sleep on the beach. Or you could?\"\n\n\"How would you feel about sharing my room for the weekend? I will sleep on the sofa.\"",
        "\"Well if you're sure, that would be fine with me.\"\n\n\"Good. Now get your party frock on and let me take you out to dinner.\"\n\nAdam took Rebecca to a small and intimate Italian restaurant that he had found a few days earlier and after a wonderful dinner and a couple of bottles of wine they ambled back to the hotel along the seafront. As they walked Rebecca put her arm through his and he didn't make any move to remove it. They went for coffee and a final night cap in the hotel bar before going upstairs to their room. While Rebecca went into the bathroom to get ready for bed, Adam threw a blanket, sheet and a couple of pillows onto the sofa and then stripped down to his shorts before hopping into the make shift bed. Ten minutes later Rebecca came out dressed in a long tee shirt and hopped into the bed.\n\n\"Are you okay for me to turn out the light roomy?\" she said before bursting into a fit of giggles.\n\n\"Yes roomy. I hope you don't snore or you'll find something being thrown at you.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that anyone has ever told me that I snore\", she said indignantly. \"Are you sure that you're going to be okay sleeping on that sofa? You don't look very comfortable all squashed up.\"\n\n\"After sleeping on the ground on numerous occasions over the last few months this will be like sleeping on a fluffy cloud.\"\n\n\"Well if you're sure. I don't mind swapping you know. I've always wanted to sleep on something fluffy.\"\n\n\"I'll be fine. Now go to sleep before I change my mind.\"\n\nFor the next thirty minutes Adam tossed and turned trying to get comfortable enough to be able to go to sleep. In between each turn he could hear soft breathing coming from the queen sized bed. After another thirty minutes he decided there was no way he was ever going to be able to sleep on the sofa and so he picked up his pillows, tip toed across the floor and slid as gently as he could into the other side of the bed, hoping that he didn't wake her.\n\n\"I was wondering how long it would take before you gave up\", she said half asleep. \"Now can we please go to sleep?\"\n\nThe early morning sun spilled in through the balcony door and washed across Adam's face causing him to gradually stir from his deep sleep. He slowly opened his eyes and then turned over. She was still lying there on her side with her back to him, her thick auburn hair strewn across the pillow. She must have thrown off the covers during the night and her tee shirt had ridden up showing her long legs and the firm round cheeks of her arse which looked like smooth round peaches and his first instinct was to stroke his hand over them and then kiss them. He had thought about her wearing that gold coloured mohair sweater while kneeling in front of him quite a lot while he was travelling. Now he had to admit to himself that he was attracted to her and was not na\u00efve enough to not admit that Rebecca must be attracted to him, otherwise why would she have flown across the country to join him? Whilst Amy had been his one and only lover he knew that there had been times in their life together when women had shown they were attracted to him. Amy had laughed at him when he once mentioned that he thought one of his female colleagues was \"coming\" onto him. She told him that he should be flattered that women were attracted to him, as he was a handsome man, but he should remember that if he strayed with one of those women she would cut his balls off.\n\nHis thoughts about Rebecca's arse and his love for Amy put him in a real dilemma. He hadn't felt really horny since Amy had taken ill but, having Rebecca's peach like arse lying in front of him across the bed, he definitely started to get an erection. Amy was no longer there to do damage to his testicles but as the dilemma of lust over loyalty was being mulled over in his head he added another dimension; if he didn't make a move would Rebecca think he wasn't attracted to her? He was now getting into a real panic but he then thought about what Amy would say; life goes on and he deserved to be happy again. With that positive thought in his head he sidled across the bed, placed his hand lightly on one of Rebecca's arse cheeks and slowly moved it over and all around. Her feminine fragrance rose up both of his nostrils and was intoxicating. After a few minutes she rolled onto her front to allow him better access to both cheeks. \"Don't stop\", she whispered.\n\nAdam moved closer and kneeled up against her to allow him to use both hands. He ran them lightly over her arse, over her lower back and waist, up her back under the tee shirt she was wearing and then down the back of her legs. She started to let out little gasps of, what he presumed was, pleasure and then spread her legs. He moved to the end of the bed and kneeled in between her legs. He ran his hands up the back of her legs and, as he approached the crack in her arse, he used his thumbs to widen the crack. He then lowered his head towards his thumbs and ran his tongue up from the bottom of her crack to the top. He continued to do this as he ran his hands up her back and then back down the side and around the outside of her arse as she groaned and ground herself into the bed.\n\nAdam clambered off to the side of the bed and then, as he continued to run his right hand up her back, his left hand continued to caress her arse and then move down between her legs. She raised herself up to allow him better access and, cupping his hand, he ran it up and over her fanny using his middle finger to draw a line up and down her outer lips. He could feel the heat building in her fanny and the wetness starting to ooze out. Her breathing was becoming shallower and faster and, as he inserted his middle finger into her, she gasped and groaned. She wriggled and pulled her knees up towards her chest which pushed her arse higher and her fanny further out. This allowed more access and invited him to insert another finger into her. In fact she was so wet that he was able to insert a third finger and as he pushed in and out she began writhing and moaning louder.\n\n\"Harder Adam, harder\", she panted as she pushed her fanny back into his fingers every time he pulled out.\n\nMinutes later he could feel her vaginal muscles start to tense as they clenched his fingers harder and he knew that she was close to coming. He started to plant light kisses on the cheeks of her arse and that was probably enough to send her over the edge. With a huge groan she came but continued to writhe and push against his fingers.\n\n\"For fuck's sake don't stop. DON'T STOP!!\" she cried as wave after wave of crashing orgasms engulfed her.\n\nSensing that she had finished climaxing, he slowly pulled his fingers out and watched as her breathing started to slow and she lowered herself down and stretched her legs out. Moments later she rolled onto her back and pulled up her tee shirt that was soaked in perspiration. It was the first time that he had actually seen her breasts. They were firm and round with deep pink areola and nipples like small rosebuds. Adam was definitely a breast man and he couldn't take his eyes off them.\n\n\"Hey, I'm up here you know\", she said, almost indignantly, but secretly pleased at what he was staring at. She smiled and brushed away her hair that was stuck to the sides of her face as a result of the perspiration that had built up during her orgasms. \"What a lovely way to say good morning.\"\n\n\"Good morning to you\", he replied. \"I'm sorry. I couldn't resist wanting to touch and kiss your beautiful arse when I woke up and saw it staring at me. I hope that was okay?\" His voice was a little hesitant as he stared into her dark eyes.\n\n\"I think I can safely say that was more than okay. I have dreamed for years about being woken up like that.\" She was about to add by 'someone she really loved', but she stopped herself as she didn't want him to feel that she was being too forward as regards her emotions. \"Would you like to join me?\" She held her arms up inviting him to lie down with her and he moved up the bed and lay in the crook of her arm with his arm over her breasts. She could sense that it was too soon after Amy's death for him to make love to her through intercourse and wanted to take things slowly.\n\nThey laid in that position for what seemed an eternity as far as Rebecca was concerned. She caressed his head with her free hand, stroking her long fingers through his hair and down the back of his neck. She could feel that he still had an erection as it was hard up against her hip. Slowly she moved her hand over his shoulders, across his arm and down the side of his ribcage and stopped at his hip as she could feel him begin to tense.\n\n\"Would you like me to say good morning to you now?\"\n\nWithout saying a word, his hand moved from covering her breasts up to the side of her face where he tenderly stroked her cheek. She took that to be a yes and ran her fingers gently up his erection. Shifting herself a little she was just able to get to his balls and started to stroke them very lightly, but she wanted full access to everything so she rolled him onto his back and moved onto her side. His fully erect cock was about nine inches long and deliciously thick. Her long fingers were just able to curl all the way around and she slowly stroked up and down, running her thumb over the head at the top of every up stroke.\n\nHis breathing was getting deeper and, with his eyes closed, he was moving his head from one side to the other. She gazed at him lovingly as her hands began to move faster and faster up his cock. She really wanted to take his deliciously thick cock into her mouth and deep into her throat but knew that this was a first step for him. For her this was making love but she suspected that, for him, it was just sex. Feeling the base of his cock starting to twitch and sensing that he was about to come, she grabbed tighter and stroked faster until he exploded, sending ribbon after ribbon of cum onto his stomach until the last dribbles ran down over her fingers that still grasped him firmly.\n\nAs his cock softened, Rebecca let go, rolled over and reached the box of tissues that were on the bedside table. Taking out a large wad of tissues she firstly wiped off the small amount of cum that was on her hand and then mopped up the large pools from his stomach. Without saying a word she kissed him lightly on the lips, jumped off the bed and went into the bathroom. Adam lay there with his eyes closed letting his heartbeat and breathing get back to something like normal. This had been his first time with a woman other than Amy and he wasn't sure what was expected of him in these circumstances. \"Just act as you would have acted with me\", he heard Amy's voice tell him in his head. \"Words of thanks would be totally inappropriate. Actions speak louder than words.\"\n\nAccepting that the words in his head were correct, he got up from the bed, put on his shorts that were now lying on the floor and walked to the bathroom. Rebecca was standing in front of the mirror removing her makeup. She was still naked and he stood right behind her, put his arms around her waist and tenderly kissed the back of her neck. She smiled into the mirror and then blew him a kiss.\n\n\"Can't a girl get any peace to get herself ready to go to breakfast?\" she exclaimed.\n\nAdam pulled her round and kissed her firmly on the lips. She responded immediately and opened her mouth leading him into a long and deep kiss. No tongues just affection.\n\n\"Now fuck off back into the bedroom until I've finished in here and then you can use it.\"\n\nHe pecked her again on the lips, gave her a large smile and sauntered back into the bedroom.\n\nTwenty minutes later she walked back into the bedroom wearing a towel wrapped around her. She saw Adam standing on the balcony still wearing just his shorts basking in the warm morning sun staring in the direction of the ocean. This time it was her turn to walk up behind him and wrap her arms around his waist, laying her cheek against his back. She was about to say 'penny for your thoughts' but she probably already knew what he was thinking. He put both of his hands on hers and continued to enjoy the sun and the view.\n\n\"A day on the beach or do you fancy riding up the coast on the back of my bike? Or something else?\"\n\n\"I've never been on the back of a motorbike so I fancy that, but haven't you had enough of riding for a while.\"\n\n\"I never get enough of riding. There's a bike store down the road so we can go and get you kitted out after breakfast.\"\n\nHe turned around to face her, stared deeply into her eyes and then kissed her softly on the lips.\n\n\"I'll be in and out of the bathroom in ten minutes so you'd better be ready or I'll go to breakfast without you.\"\n\nWith that he stepped off the balcony back into the room and pulled her towel away from her leaving her totally naked and exposed for the second it took for her arms to cover her breasts and groin.\n\nShe screamed and chased him into the bathroom where he slammed the door and locked it behind him. Hammering on the door she yelled \"You bastard! I'll get you back for that\", but all she heard back was the sound of him laughing his head off as he switched on the shower.\n\nIt was twenty minutes later, not the ten he that had said, when he emerged. He was wearing a towel wrapped around his waist and had shaved off his beard.\n\n\"Why did you shave off the beard? I liked it as it covered your ugly mug.\"\n\n\"I thought you may appreciate a soft jaw and face later\", he replied as he raised his eyebrows and looked at her wide eyed.\n\n\"Humm. I don't know what you're thinking about but whatever it is you can forget it. Now are we going to breakfast as I am famished?\"\n\nTwo hours later, after a leisurely breakfast and a trip to the motorbike store, they were standing beside his bike. She was now dressed in textile jacket and jeans, short touring boots, gloves and an open face helmet with integral sun visor. Adam smiled as he looked her up and down. A mental picture of her wearing leather jeans with that gold mohair sweater flashed into his head.\n\n\"What are you staring at biker boy?\"\n\nRebecca's voice brought him back to his senses.\n\n\"Just wondering how hot you would look dressed in leather gear.\"\n\n\"I am hot, but not in the way you're probably thinking of. Are we going to get going before all you see of me is a pool of water on the sidewalk?\"\n\nOn the way to the bike store Adam had instructed her on how to ride as pillion and so he climbed on, planted both feet on the ground, started it up and told her she could now get on board. She climbed on warily and wrapped her arms around his waist. He pulled away into the traffic and followed the directions to Route 1, the Pacific Coast Highway. His plan was to ride to Santa Barbara, which was a couple of hours away, stop there for lunch and then head back to the hotel. As they rode along Rebecca began to relax and enjoy the experience. She leaned back against his top box and held onto the grab handles which meant that she wasn't looking at Adam's back and was able to enjoy the scenery of the coastline. Sitting high up on the back of a motorbike allowed Rebecca to see so much more than sitting in a car and as they passed through Malibu she was able to see the beach front houses that she had seen so many times on television. For Rebecca, the ride to Santa Barbara was over too quickly. She was starting to understand Adam's feeling of freedom while riding but for her the real enjoyment was being so physically close to him with her groin pressed into his arse.\n\nAfter an extended lunch they rode back to Santa Monica at a leisurely pace, stopping at the odd vista point to allow Rebecca to take photographs. They persuaded a fellow tourist to take a couple of photos of them sat on the bike with the ocean in the background and Rebecca told him that he should post on then on his blog, to which he agreed. After parking the bike in the secure garage that Adam was using while in Santa Monica they ambled back to the hotel via the seafront and stopped for a couple of drinks at a bar. As they sat drinking their cold beers and watching the sun beginning to set he leaned across and took hold of her hand under the table.\n\n\"So what did you think of your first experience on the back of my bike?\"\n\n\"Absolutely brilliant. Loved every moment. So am I invited to join you again?\"\n\n\"Of course you are. How do you fancy riding up into the Hollywood Hills tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Well I haven't got anything else planned so I may as well join you.\"\n\n\"Don't sound too keen. You know I could always take the attractive young waitress who served us at breakfast. She told me the other day that she would like to join me for a ride. I presume she was talking about a bike ride but ...\"\n\n\"I don't imagine that she had a bike in mind by the way she kept looking at you. And, even if she did, she certainly wouldn't look as good as me in biking gear.\"\n\nShe looked him square in the eye and they both laughed out loud.\n\nThat evening they went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant that had been recommended to Adam. Rebecca was wearing a very fetching short and tight yellow mini dress that accentuated her full breasts and her long legs. Her long hair was down and tied in a loose pigtail that she had slung over her shoulder. Adam noticed that she got a lot of admiring glances from men and some women while they walked to the restaurant and he felt rather pleased with himself that she was with him. The evening was warm and balmy and they sat at an outside table watching the world go by while eating hot and spicy food and drinking cold beers. Conversation centred around their road trip that day and Adam opened up about the trips that Amy and he had made over the years. He leaned across the table and took her hand.\n\n\"Thank you for coming out with me today. It was lovely to have a pillion sat behind me again.\"\n\nIt was well after midnight before they arrived back at their hotel room and they were both tired as well as a little drunk. Rebecca went to the bathroom first and, as she had last night, came out wearing her long tee shirt. Adam had been spending the time updating his blog with the photos that they had taken of Santa Barbara, plus the ones of them sat on the bike with the ocean in the background.\n\n\"Will you be starting off on the sofa again tonight or joining me in the bed from the start?\"\n\n\"If it's okay with you I would like to join you in bed from the start?\"\n\n\"Well go and brush your teeth and then join me.\"\n\nAdam sauntered off to the bathroom, brushed his teeth, undressed down to his shorts and came back into the bedroom. Rebecca has turned off all of the lights except for one lamp in the corner. She was lying on her side facing away from the bathroom on the far side of the bed with just a sheet covering her at the waist. Adam crept into the bed, moved right up behind her and placed his hand on her shoulder where he applied gentle pressure so that she rolled onto her back. He smiled at her, leaned in and kissed her lightly on the lips. The fragrance and taste of her lip gloss was intoxicating and he ran his tongue over his lips. She placed her hand tenderly on his cheek and moved her lips to his. Their lips joined and they kissed gently until Rebecca opened her mouth wider and began to push her tongue into his mouth. Adam's mouth responded, their lips pressed hard together, feasting on each other, their tongues swirling and clashing together.\n\nAdam ran the fingers of his left hand up her neck behind her ears and through her thick hair. She cooed and continued to do so while he kissed the other side of her neck and then ran the tip of his tongue down to her breasts. As he kissed the now erect nipple on her right breast he moved his other hand down from her neck to her left breast and started to roll her nipple between his fingers. He suck greedily on her nipples while, with her eyes closed, she continued to coo and run her tongue around her lips. Leaving her nipple, his tongue moved down her body, across her stomach and hips to her thighs, where he started to run it up the soft skin towards her hairless fanny, which had started to leak pre-cum and glistened at the edges of her labia.",
        "He settled himself between her legs and she opened them wider to expose her inner lips allowing his tongue full access. His tongue moved up and down over her lips and he then stiffened it and drove it into her fanny. She gasped and ran her fingers through his hair. His tongue then found her hooded clitoris, which was by now fully erect, and he started to flick it while at the same time inserting one and then two fingers into her dripping wet fanny. She groaned deeply and writhed on the bed pushing her arse into the mattress. While he lapped at her juicy fanny, moving his fingers in and out and licking and flicking her engorged clit, he used the other to massage her breasts and pinch her nipples. Unable to control herself any longer she cried out and one huge orgasm flooded through her body. As Adam continued to lick, flick and push his fingers deeper into her, wave after wave of smaller orgasms came one after another until she could take no more and pushed his head away from her fanny.\n\n\"Oh my god\", she gasped, \"Please no more. I don't think that my body can take another orgasm for a while. Now come here and kiss me again.\"\n\nDutifully, Adam move from between her legs, positioned himself by her side and leaned in to kiss her, which was prolonged and deep.\n\n\"That was sensational,\" she whispered, \"now lie back and let me take that gorgeous thick cock of yours into my mouth. I have been thinking of nothing else since this morning.\"\n\n\"Really!! You dirty lawyer you.\"\n\n\"Oh you haven't seen anything yet big boy. Now lie down and do as you're told.\"\n\nRebecca lightly rubbed his balls and let her middle finger run down his perineum while running her tongue up and down his shaft. Adam lay back with his eyes closed. He and Amy had had a wonderful sex life but she hadn't really like taking him in her mouth, so feeling Rebecca lick the tip of his cock and then move her lips further and further down his shaft was something really new to him. He tried to hold himself from coming too early and she must have sensed that he was nearly there as she gripped the bottom with both hands and moved up and down faster.\n\n\"God I'm coming,\" he groaned \"don't stop.\"\n\nHe exploded into her mouth and, as he pumped, she sucked and licked as hard as she could. She only removed him from her mouth as he become soft and she had swallowed all of his cum.\n\nHe held out his arms and she crawled up and snuggled into him.\n\n\"That was fantastic. You are a very gifted and dirty lawyer in all senses of the word.\"\n\n\"Why thank you kind sir. You are a wonderful kisser too, in all senses of the word.\"\n\nHe kissed her tenderly on the top of her head, closed his eyes and fell asleep. He awoke as the sun began to stream into the room. He had slept deeply and felt fully refreshed and eager for the day to start, something he hadn't done for such a long time. They were still cuddling and he could feel Rebecca's breath brush over the light down of hair on his chest. He laid there looking at the ceiling, thinking about the last couple of days and how much he was enjoying her company. Was it too soon to begin a full on relationship, he asked himself. He knew that Amy would have told him that he deserved to be happy but he wondered whether his family and friends would think that it was too soon after losing Amy. However, he knew that he was starting to have real feelings for her and that she deserved him to be open and honest with her. I need to discuss everything with her before she flies back east tomorrow, he told himself. She stirred and, once again, he kissed her on the top of her head.\n\n\"Good morning sleepy head.\"\n\nShe propped herself up, gave him a broad smile and then a long and deep kiss.\n\n\"Good morning to you. I could murder a long cold orange juice. Would you mind if I ordered room service?\"\n\n\"I'm thirsty and hungry as well so order away.\"\n\nShe rolled over him, sat on the edge of the bed, picked up the phone and ordered juice, coffee, eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes and fruit. Putting down the phone, Rebecca leaned over and kissed him again before walking to the bathroom. He stared at her long legs and beautiful curvy arse as they moved away from him.\n\n\"Stop gawping at my arse biker boy. I'm going to have a shower and you can go in after me. Breakfast will be at least twenty minutes so we have plenty of time.\"\n\nAs Adam stood at the sink shaving, he kept staring at her reflection in the mirror as she took her shower. She did have the most gorgeous figure, he thought to himself, and very attractive.\n\nThey took their breakfast on the balcony, enjoying the warmth of the early morning sunshine. No words only broad smiles were exchanged every time they looked at each other. When all of the juice, coffee and iced water had been drunk and most of the food eaten, Adam leaned back in his chair and stretched his arms above his head and spoke.\n\n\"So are you still up for another bike ride today?\"\n\n\"Certainly am. I'd like to go and see the Hollywood Sign.\"\n\n\"That's a great idea. I suppose that's a must for every visitor to LA. Why don't we take the bike and ride along Mulholland Drive?\"\n\n\"Ok let's go.\"\n\nEight hours later they were back in their hotel room lying on the bed looking through the photos they had both taken and selecting which ones Adam should upload to his blog.\n\n\"I'm going to miss riding on the bike tomorrow. I have had such a fantastic time sitting behind you looking at all of the sights and scenery. Life behind my desk next week will be really boring.\"\n\n\"It's a shame you weren't with me on the ride into LA last week. I came along the Angeles Crest Highway and the scenery was stunning.\"\n\n\"Don't rub salt into the wound you bastard\", she said as she punched him playfully on the arm.\n\nHe laughed. \"Your wound will have even more salt rubbed into it when you see the photos that I'll be taking in Monterey and San Francisco later this week.\"\n\nHe paused and then said in a soft voice \"Why don't you come with me?\"\n\nShe looked deeply into his eyes to determine whether he was serious and concluded that he was.\n\n\"At this moment in time there's nothing I would love to do more, but you know I can't. I have people who are relying on me. Maybe another time?\" she said wistfully.\n\nHe looked slightly sad but knew that she was a person who was committed to doing what she said she was going to do and left it at that.\n\n\"I will be with you in spirit and will look forward to seeing the photos from the rest of your journey. Maybe another opportunity will come up where I can join you? There's always Labor Day weekend, if you're still not back by then. What is your plan anyway?\"\n\n\"I am going north up the coast to Carmel, Monterey and then onto San Francisco. From there I am going to ride through Oregon and up to Seattle, and then over the border to Vancouver. I'm then coming back over the border and heading to Yellowstone National Park.\" Then in a quiet voice he said \"Amy had always wanted to go to Yellowstone to see the wildlife, particularly the bears. She loved bears.\"\n\nShe lovingly touched his arm, looked into his eyes and smiled. He waited a minute before starting again.\n\n\"After Yellowstone I'm heading towards Denver and Colorado Springs, possibly via Salt Lake City and the mountains of Utah. From there to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota and then back to Chicago. I could time it to get to Chicago for Labor Day weekend? How do you fancy joining me to ride to Niagara Falls and then back home?\"\n\n\"I would love to\", she replied and then leaned in to kiss him. \"I think I'll go and buy my own helmet and gear so I feel like a real biker chick. What do you think?\"\n\n\"I can't wait to see them. I'll send the address of the store I get my gear from. They'll get you fully kitted out with the right under garments as well. Just remember, leather trousers need to be really, really, tight\", he laughed.\n\n\"Umm, didn't know that you were into leather but it sounds good to me. I may have a few surprises for you, if you play your cards right.\"\n\nThat evening Adam took her to a lovely little fish restaurant in Little Venice and they walked back to the hotel along the beach. They both took their shoes off and walked in the water hand in hand enjoying the sound of the waves washing onto the sand. Adam decided that this moment was the time to tell her of his feelings for her and the dilemma he had. They walked while he spoke and, when she thought that he had finished getting everything off his chest, she stopped and stood facing him.\n\n\"Adam, I have something to say to you as well. I have been in love with you since we worked together. I thought it was just a crush at first but every day that has gone by since then I have thought of you. I hoped that I would find someone else so that my love for you would lessen but it never has. I knew that you were happily married to Amy and I would never have come between you as I respected you too much. It broke my heart when I heard about Amy, knowing how much you had loved her and the pain and grief you must have been going through and still are. Selfishly though, I did hope that we would meet again and dreamed that something like this weekend would happen. I didn't expect it to be so soon after Amy and I completely understand your dilemma. What I can say is that I love you and will wait until you are ready.\"\n\nHe pulled her to him and wrapped his arms around her before kissing her tenderly.\n\n\"You are the most amazing woman and my feelings for you are growing stronger every day. I would love nothing more than to fly back home with you but I need to finish my odyssey so that I can start the next chapter of my life. You do understand that don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. If I were you I would want to do that as well.\"\n\nHe smiled and kissed her again. \"Let's go back to the hotel.\"\n\nBack in their hotel room Adam went to the bathroom and quickly brushed his teeth before Rebecca went in taking her carry on flight bag with her. While she was in the bathroom Adam undressed, switched off the lights, pulled the curtains back to allow the light from the clear blue moon into the room, climbed into bed and sat back against the headboard. Rebecca came out of the bathroom five minutes later wearing a bright red baby doll nightie. She stood briefly in the doorway to allow Adam to get a clear view, to which he gasped and his body shuddered. He gave her a wide smile, pulled the bed covers back to invite her to join him, slid down and laid on his side. She walked slowly towards the bed, climbed in and laid down next to him. He raised his hand to her cheek, ran it through her hair and moved his lips to hers. They kissed softly and he could taste the perfumed bright red lip gloss that she had applied.\n\nTheir kissing began slowly, gradually increasing in intensity until their mouths were wide open and Rebecca was pushing her tongue into his mouth. Without stopping Adam moved across her. She opened her legs and he slid between them, his cock and balls pressed against her fanny which was already on fire and leaking. Slightly adjusting his knees he pushed the tip of his throbbing cock against the outer lips of her fanny. Her kissing became more intense and, as he started to push his cock slowly in, her tongue pushed further into his mouth. She gasped as the girth of his cock stretched her inner lips. When he was all the way in he stopped and allowed their bodies to almost become one. Her arms and legs moved to entwine him and hold him there.\n\nWhen he sensed that she was ready he began to pull out and push back in. His movements began slowly, gradually building in speed and the length to which he withdrew. As the intensity increased, her finger nails on one hand started to dig into his back while her other hand grabbed the back of his head forcing his lips harder against hers. With Amy, Adam had learned how to prolong himself but, with this level of intensity, he wasn't sure that he would be able to hold himself for as long. She was close to coming herself and sensing that he was close himself she flexed her vaginal muscles to clamp his cock and hold him rigidly inside her. \"Oh my god, I'm coming!' he gasped and with that he climaxed and burst into her. She grasped his arse with her finger nails digging into him.\n\n\"Don't stop pumping baby. I'm coming. I'm coming\", she screamed and seconds later she gasped and climaxed.\n\nShe could feel his cock becoming softer but continued to pull his groin hard into her as she came for a second and then a third time. Exhausted, he laid on top of her gasping for breath. Their sweaty bodies melded together and stayed like that for what seemed ages until Adam kissed her and rolled off to the side. He grasped her hand and pulled it to his lips where he kissed it.\n\n\"God that was marvellous\", she whispered. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"I am superb. Thank you so much.\"\n\nHe raised his arm and she rolled in to nestle tight against him. Totally spent they fell asleep in that position. Adam woke as the sun peeked into the room. Rebecca had moved away during the night and was still asleep lying on her side facing him. He stared at her beautiful face slightly covered with her hair and smiled to himself. He hadn't felt so contented for such a long time and the dilemmas that he had spoken to her about yesterday felt like that they had been washed away.\n\nShe opened her eyes and smiled at him. \"Make love to me again\", she said in a low husky voice.\n\nHe duly rolled in between her opened legs, leaned down and began to kiss her. Their love making that morning was not as frenetic as it had been the night before but was slow, tender and loving. As they lay cuddled into each other's arms afterwards she whispered \"I love you\".\n\nWithout hesitation he replied \"And I love you too.\"\n\nThree hours later, and after another leisurely breakfast on their balcony, they were standing at the LAX security gate hugging each other tightly. She didn't want to leave and he didn't want her to go but they both knew that she had to. After a final lingering kiss she walked through security and waved him goodbye. He blew her a kiss, watched her disappear behind the barrier and walked out to get a cab back to the hotel. The next day Adam checked out of the hotel and started off on the next stage of his odyssey.\n\nRebecca counted down the days to the Labor Day weekend. She worked hard during the day to ensure that she had enough free time late in the evening to phone or FaceTime Adam every night. Because of the time difference he had changed his days to start earlier so that he could be in his hotel for when she called. She would lie on her bed and stroke herself while she was speaking to him. The urge to feel him inside of her usually resulted in her coming hard without too much effort and he loved hearing her pant and squeal down the phone or watch her face on the screen while she came. He looked forward all day to either hearing her voice or seeing her beautiful face, or both. If she was on FaceTime she would lie naked to allow him to see her gorgeous body.\n\nOne evening she was so desperate to FaceTime him that she had forgotten to undress and was still wearing the gold coloured mohair sweater that he had fantasized about her wearing. When she went to take it off so he could see her tits he shouted into the phone.\n\n\"No!!! Don't take it off. Keep it on and rub your nipples so that I can see them poking through the mohair.\"\n\n\"So how long have you had a thing about my sweater?\" she asked in a perplexed voice.\n\n\"Since the first time I was in your apartment and you were kneeling in front of me going through all of the probate paperwork. It's been one of my fantasies ever since. Don't ask me why but it is. I loved the way the fuzziness of it nestles against your bare back. By the way I never complimented you on your very artistic and sexy tattoo. How long have you had that?\"\n\n\"Oh, a few years ago now. One of my few boyfriends had tattoos and suggested that I get one. In my job I couldn't have anything that would show so one on the base of my spine seemed to the right place. I love dolphins and have always wanted to swim with them.\"\n\nAs she rubbed her nipples with her free hand they became fully erect and she wondered why she had never done it before as it was rather sensual. She pointed her phone at her chest as she rubbed and she could hear Adam's breathing getting deeper so she knew that he was getting turned on and masturbating.\n\n\"I bet you would love to suck my nipples at this point, wouldn't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"You are spot on\", he gasped. \"And at the same time I would like to kneel over your face and pound my throbbing dick deep into your mouth.\"\n\n\"Now that sounds really good. I would run my tongue up and down your gorgeous shaft and then take you fully into my hot mouth. And when you came I would lap up every drop of your steaming hot cum.\"\n\nShe heard him gasp and knew that he had cum. She smiled to herself and started of dreaming of their next meeting.\n\nA week before she was due to meet him in Chicago Rebecca went to the bike clothing store that Adam had told her about. She spent hours choosing her gear and a shed load of money. She wanted everything to be perfect and chose a flip lid helmet with a built in sun visor in the same color as the tank on his bike. She also got them to install the same model Bluetooth communicator into her new helmet so that they could talk while riding or she could listen to her music. She didn't tell him that she had bought it all as she wanted to model it for him in person when they next met.\n\nAdam's odyssey went to plan and he had adjusted the number of days so that he would reach Chicago for the Labor Day weekend. He thought of Amy every day and when he reached the sights that she had wanted to go to, particularly Yellowstone, his sense of loss was still hard to bear. However, he also thought of Rebecca every day and, as each day went by, he began to miss being with her more and more. The psychological battle between a love lost and a new love was sometimes difficult for him to reconcile. At those points he spoke to Amy in his head and asked for her wisdom and advice. Her advice was always the same; 'keep me in your heart but live for the now and enjoy your life.'\n\nRebecca had booked the hotel in Chicago and sent him the details. She had chosen one with views of the harbour with secure underground parking and had booked her flight so that she could be in the room before he arrived as she wanted to surprise him. She had packed her biker clothing rather than wear it all on the plane and had been very sparing with the other clothing that she had brought with her in her holdall. Adam was going to empty one of his panniers, box it up along with his roll bag and get it all sent back home so that she could put her gear into it. Her thinking was that anything she couldn't get into the pannier she would put in the box. She checked into the hotel just after noon and waited to hear from him that he had arrived. She took a leisurely bath while waiting, rubbed body lotion all over and wore the perfume that she knew he liked. She laid all of the biking gear out on the bed, ready to put it on when she heard that he was on his way up.\n\nAt just after 4pm he phoned to say that he had just parked up, was unloading his panniers and would be with her in ten minutes. She squeezed into her leather jeans and jacket, put her new knee length laced touring boots on and placed the helmet at the bottom of the bed. She lay on her side on the bed with one leg cocked and waited for him. When he knocked on the door she called out that it was unlocked. He opened the door, came in and let it close behind him. When he saw her on the bed he dropped his bag and his jaw.\n\n\"Wow. What a sight for sore eyes!\"\n\n\"Well come over here and give your biker bitch a big kiss\", she squealed.\n\nNot needing a second invitation he ran across the room, jumped onto the bed next to her and planted a big kiss on her lips. She pulled him to her and drove her lips against his. When she let him go, he kneeled back and admired her gear.",
        "\"God I have missed you so much.\"\n\n\"Not half as much as I have missed you, biker boy.\"\n\nShe looked him up and down. He looked tired, his hair was long and he was in need of a shave but he was still handsome. They ordered coffee and a snack while he told her of his journey into Chicago. After gulping down several cups of coffee and eating his sandwich she suggested that he have a nice hot bath and a shave. While he undressed she ran the bath and then sat on the toilet while he relaxed in the hot steamy water telling him about her experience of buying her biking gear and showed him what her helmet looked like on. He loved the colour and was overjoyed that she had had a communicator unit installed. She washed his back and his hair for him and left him sat in the bath shaving. Back in the bedroom she stripped off her under shirt and bra and pulled on the gold coloured mohair sweater that she had left in her bag.\n\n\"If these leather biker jeans and my mohair sweater don't send him over the top then I'm not sure what will\", she thought to herself and laid on the bed to wait for him.\n\nTen minutes later he strolled out of the bathroom totally naked and, for the second time that afternoon, his jaw dropped almost to the ground.\n\n\"Fuck me!\" was all he could say, as his eyes nearly popped out of his head and his cock became fully erect in a nanosecond.\n\n\"Well I was hoping that you would want to fuck me when you saw me wearing this but we could always try the other way round. Has your fantasy come true?\"\n\nHe just nodded and rubbed his eyes with his hands. \"If only I had my camera to hand.\"\n\n\"Well maybe we could take some photos later but, for now, why don't you come here and have your wicked way with your biker bitch?\"\n\nAdam didn't need a second invitation. He practically sprinted across the room and dived onto her. His hands were all over her breasts pinching at her nipples through the mohair and his tongue was grinding away at her tonsils. He moved between her legs loving the feeling of her leather clad legs against his legs and groin and the soft mohair against his stomach and chest. He had to stop to pull her leather jeans off but, as soon as they were, his engorged thick mushroom headed cock slid into her warm, soft and very moist fanny where it stayed until she had come twice and his orgasm was so strong that he didn't think that he would ever stop pumping. As they lay on the bed afterwards totally exhausted she nestled into him and whispered \"Worth the wait biker boy?\"\n\n\"Definitely so biker girl.\"\n\nShe awoke the next morning still in his arms, feeling the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed and the pumping of his heartbeat in her ear. She had never felt so contented in her life but there was a nagging feeling deep in her stomach as to what their lives would be become when Adam had finished his odyssey. Her love for him had turned into being in love with him over the last few months and she could not imagine life without him. Loving and being in love were so different. She told herself that she must continue to take things slowly and let him determine the pace at which their relationship developed. She ran her hand lightly across his chest and down over his stomach until it reached his cock. She brushed her fingers over his pubic hair, around his thick cock and down to his balls where she cupped them, feeling the sack begin to firm. He stirred and she took hold of his cock between her thumb and index finger as it began to become erect, slowly moving them up and down the shaft. She was becoming moist herself and, when she felt that his cock was fully erect, she wriggled out from his arm, straddled herself across him while directing his swollen cock into her fanny and began to ride him.\n\nAs she rode him she was massaging her breasts that were still encased in the mohair sweater until her nipples were fully extended. He opened his eyes and enjoyed the view as she ground her fanny up and down the length of his cock.\n\n\"Here, let me do that for you\", he said and raised his hands towards her breasts.\n\nShe leaned forward to allow him to cup and then slowly stroke each mohair covered breast, running his thumbs over the erect nipples. He had never imagined running his hands over a sweater would be such a turn on but it was. Rebecca was starting to ride faster and faster and he knew that he was going to explode at any second. She grabbed his hands that were still grasping her breasts and squeezed them tightly, forcing his hands to press harder. With a loud gasp he came and she could feel the warm ribbons of his cum shoot into her. She ground harder and harder and then slumped down onto him so that his wilting cock was pushed up against her clit, rubbing her fanny up and down until her own orgasm burst violently through her.\n\nShe stayed slumped on his chest getting her breath back. He wrapped both of his arms around her pulling her into him and nuzzled his face into her neck feeling the fuzziness of her sweater ticking his nose.\n\n\"What a way to start the day. You are an insatiable young lady\", he whispered in her ear.\n\nShe raised herself up onto her forearms and kissed him.\n\n\"I have to admit that I cannot get enough of that lovely thick cock of yours inside me. Now you order breakfast while I shower and get ready. The hotel is arranging to ship your stuff back to my apartment so if you can clear out one of your panniers I will try and get my gear into it. Anything I can't get in will get shipped back with your stuff.\"\n\nWith that she kissed him again, jumped off the bed and disappeared into the bathroom. Adam duly followed her orders and, an hour or so later, they were in the garage loading everything onto the bike. He had synched their communicators while she was in the bathroom and so once he was astride the bike and she had hopped on behind him he gunned the bike out of the garage and into the Chicago traffic.\n\nIt was over 500 miles to Niagara Falls from Chicago and it was a hard day's riding for Adam. Rebecca had total confidence in Adam's riding ability and, once they were outside of Chicago, she relaxed and sat back against the top box with her hands lightly clutching the grab rails. When they weren't talking, she watched the scenery glide past enjoying the views and the sense of freedom. They stopped every couple of hours to stretch their legs and they arrived at their hotel in Niagara just as the sun was beginning to set. Adam had booked a suite overlooking the river and falls and, as the porter closed the door behind him, Adam fell backwards onto the queen sized bed totally exhausted. Rebecca was standing at the large window admiring the view.\n\n\"Just look at this wonderful view\", she said without turning around.\n\n\"I am looking at a wonderful view that I haven't seen from this angle before\", he replied staring at her leather clad arse.\n\n\"Down biker boy! I can't imagine either of us would want to ride any more today. My arse and fanny are saddle sore.\"\n\n\"Amy always used to call it having pillion pussy.\"\n\n\"Well I know what she must have meant. Come and take a look at this view of the falls, it's magnificent. We can then get showered and go for something to eat.\"\n\nThey stood together holding hands marvelling at the stunning view and then both went to shower together, for the first time. They lathered each other and washed each other's hair but were too tired to do anything else. Wrapped in the hotel's soft fluffy dressing gowns, they lay down on the bed to rest before going to dinner. Adam woke just after midnight. smiled to himself, closed his eyes and went back to sleep.\n\nFive days later they pulled into the underground garage at Rebecca's apartment block. Adam switched off the engine and Rebecca climbed off, took her helmet off, shook her mane of hair and waited for him to put the bike up on its centre stand.\n\n\"Are you going to stay tonight or are you heading off back to your place?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't think I can be bothered to ride for another hour so is it okay if I stay here tonight?\"\n\n\"You don't need to ask. You are always more than welcome. I could do with a long soak in a steaming hot bath and then crawl into bed. What do you say?\"\n\n\"That sounds good to me. Shall we order a take out?\"\n\n\"Yep and open a bottle of wine to celebrate the end of your journey.\"\n\nAs Rebecca soaked in the bath Adam ordered the take out, opened the wine and took two glasses into the bathroom. She was covered in bubbles and, after he had set down the glasses of wine on the side of the bath, he leaned over and kissed her. \"What was that for?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just to thank you. I really enjoyed riding with you.\"\n\n\"There's no need to thank me. I should be thanking you for letting me join you on part of your odyssey and to showing me how enjoyable riding on the back of a bike can be. I loved every minute of it, probably because it was with you.\"\n\nShe looked him in straight in the eyes for a few seconds and decided that this was the time to tell him how she really felt.\n\n\"You do know that I am in love with you don't you?\"\n\nHis eyes lit up and he gave her the most beautiful smile she thought she had ever seen.\n\n\"When you left California and I was riding on my own again it didn't feel right. Riding alone gives you so much time to think. I thought I would never experience a love like I had for Amy again in my lifetime but I have fallen head over heels in love with you. Two beautiful biker girls in one lifetime. How lucky can one man get?\"\n\nShe swung her arm and soaked him with water and bubbles.\n\n\"Come here and show me how much you love me biker boy.\"\n\nTheir love making that night was tender, loving and totally fulfilling for both of them.\n\nPart Two\n\nOver breakfast the next morning Rebecca asked him if he had any plans for the weekend.\n\n\"I was planning on taking the bike back to my house and sorting everything out. The bike could do with a deep clean as could most of my clothes. What about you?\"\n\n\"I need to go and see my mom as I haven't seen her for a couple of weeks. Actually she only lives about ten miles from your house on the shore. I don't suppose you fancy dropping me off and then picking me up later?\"\n\nShe laughed and said jokingly that she thought her mom would love to see her in her leathers.\n\n\"Does she know about me?\" he asked. \"I mean I am fifteen years older than you.\"\n\nBlushing she replied that her mom knew all about him and had never said anything about the age difference probably because her dad had been twenty years older than her mom and had been divorced twice before marrying her. Adam dropped Rebecca off at her mom's house and then rode to his where he spent the afternoon washing his clothing and cleaning the bike. When he had finished he sent Rebecca a text to say that he would be another hour and rode to Amy's grave where he put flowers on the headstone and spoke to her about his journey and Rebecca. He arrived back at Rebecca's mom's house just after 6pm, parked the bike, removed his helmet and rang the doorbell. Rebecca answered the door, kissed him and led him through to the decking at the rear of the house where her mom was sitting on one of the sun loungers. She was wearing a large floppy hat and sunglasses and, as she got up to greet Adam, she removed them.\n\nAdam was gobsmacked. She was an older version of Rebecca; slightly shorter, had the same thick auburn hair although slightly more copper in colour and was as stunning as her daughter. He guessed that she couldn't be more than ten years older than him.\n\nRebecca introduced them to each other.\n\n\"Adam, this is my mom, Colette. Mom, this is Adam.\"\n\n\"Adam\", she said holding out her hand to shake his, \"how lovely to finally meet the man my daughter hasn't stopped talking about all afternoon. Please take a seat. Would you like a cold drink?\"\n\n\"A cold beer would be great, if you have one?\"\n\n\"Rebecca, go and get Adam a beer and bring a new bottle of wine out for us. There's another one in the fridge.\"\n\nRebecca trotted off to get the drinks and Adam sat down on the edge of one of the other sun loungers. While they waited for Rebecca to return Colette asked Adam about his trip and by the time Rebecca came back with the drinks they were sat close together on one sun lounger looking at Adam's photos on his phone. Colette seemed to be really interested and asked Adam to send her a couple of the photos he had taken of Rebecca when they were in California. As the sun began to set Rebecca and Adam said their goodbyes and jumped back on the bike for their journey back to the city. When they were back in Rebecca's apartment and she was preparing dinner for them Adam asked her about her mom as she hadn't really spoken about her before.\n\nRebecca told him that her maternal grandmother had been French and had met her grandfather when he was in the army stationed in Europe in the early sixties. Her grandmother got pregnant with her mom and they had married so that she could come to the States when her grandfather had been posted back home for his final tour before retiring. Her mom spoke fluent French, Italian, Spanish and a little bit of German. She had met Rebecca's father after she had graduated in Modern Languages when he employed her as a translator in his publishing business. They had begun an affair within a year and two years later her dad divorced his second wife and married her mom. Rebecca, who was their only child, was born a year later and they stayed married up until when her dad had died five years ago.\n\n\"She hasn't found anyone else since your dad died then? She is an extremely attractive woman and I can't imagine that she hasn't had any other men pursuing her.\"\n\nRebecca laughed. \"She certainly is and has had her fair share of male suitors since dad passed but she says they are all sixty plus and either divorced or widowed. Apparently, one older man in her life is enough and, anyway, apart from the country club where she plays golf and tennis once a week she doesn't really go anywhere to meet anyone else. She always tells me that she is really happy with her life. She still does a bit of translating for some publishers she knows, plays golf and tennis in the spring and summer, loves gardening and in the winter she knits.\"\n\n\"Aargh so that's where you got my favourite sweater from?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why did you think that I knitted it!? I mean I can knit, but not as well as my mom. She has got a little eBay store and sells them on there.\"\n\nThe next morning Rebecca went back to work and Adam wandered idly around the apartment not knowing what to do with his self now that he was back and no longer working. He was thinking that he should sit down and list his interests to see whether anything came up that he could spend his time doing. Just as he was about to start Rebecca rang him on his cell phone.\n\n\"Hi babe, are you doing anything?\"\n\n\"Not really. I was just thinking about that. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Do you play golf?\"\n\n\"Well I do, but I haven't played for about two years.\"\n\n\"My mom just phoned and asked whether you were doing anything and, if you weren't, would you like to join her for a round of golf this afternoon as her playing partner has let her down at short notice? I said that I didn't know if you played but would ask. I think that she wants to get to know you and playing golf is a good way as you don't have to talk much. So, would you like to?\"\n\nAdam wanted to say no but didn't want to offend either Rebecca or her mom so he said yes and took Colette's number so that he could call her. He waited a few minutes before calling Colette, thinking of excuses that he could use as to why he couldn't play but as soon as he called he lost his nerve and said that he would be over late morning. He rode his bike back to his house, changed into his golf clothes, found his clubs and threw them in the back of his garaged SUV before driving to Colette's house. Just like Rebecca, Colette opened her front door as soon as rang the doorbell and startled him.\n\n\"God, how do you and Rebecca do that?\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Answer the door just as I have rung the doorbell.\"\n\nShe laughed and he thought that her laugh sounded just like Rebecca's.\n\n\"That would be telling. We are so alike in lots of ways, as are most mothers and daughters. Shall we go to play golf?\"\n\nThe September sunshine was warm and the golf course was in immaculate condition. Their conversations at each tee were mainly about the previous hole and the hazards that were on the next hole. It took Adam nine holes before his golf swing started to improve but it didn't improve enough as she easily beat him over the eighteen holes. After finishing, they sat on the terrace overlooking the eighteenth green having coffee.\n\n\"So, Adam, what are you going to do with your time now? I guess that you're a little too young to contemplate retiring.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I do know that I don't want to go back to what I was doing. I need something new.\"\n\n\"Are you any good at DIY?\"\n\n\"Not too bad. Amy and I refurbished our house. It was really run down when we bought it and we didn't have a lot of cash to play with so I did most of the labouring and we only used the professionals for things I couldn't do. It took us ages as we both worked full time but it became our hobby for two years.\"\n\n\"Would you be interested in doing some work around my house? I need some rooms decorating, my basement being made into a workroom and studio and I want a pergola built at the bottom of the garden between the changing rooms and the pool. I will pay you of course.\"\n\nAdam mulled it over for a few seconds. He didn't have anything else to do and it would be good to do some physical labour rather than sit at a desk in front of a computer.\n\n\"When do you want me to start?\"\n\n\"Brilliant. You can start whenever it suits you. Also, while the weather is good perhaps we can get a round of golf in every week?\"\n\nRebecca was really pleased that he had agreed to do the work as she knew that her mom desperately wanted it all done and, as a reward, she wore the gold mohair sweater for him that night along her cream fishnet stockings and matching lacy French knickers.\n\n\"Just think what your reward will be when you actually complete all of the work for her. This is just for saying that you will.\"\n\nThe sex was frenetic as Rebecca blew him into oblivion and then, when he had recovered enough to get another erection, she mounted him with her back to him so that he could see her tattoo and the fluff of the mohair stroking her bare back. He ran his hands up and down the sweater feeling himself getting closer and closer to yet another amazing climax. Just before he came she let out a loud scream and came herself, continuing to pump up and down until she came again and again. As he exploded into her, he grabbed the bottom of the sweater and pulled it and her down hard onto his dick, driving himself further and further into her.\n\n\"Was that good for you darling?\" she asked when he had finally finished pumping and she had moved to lie beside him.\n\n\"Need you ask? That was fucking mind blowing.\"\n\nAdam worked hard; completing the decorating firstly and then building the pergola before the weather turned and he wouldn't be able to work outside. He returned back to Rebecca's apartment each night totally exhausted, but really pleased with what he had achieved each day. Colette brought him endless cups of coffee or cold drinks and, if she wasn't playing either tennis or golf that day, they would sit together to eat their lunch.\n\n \n\nBeing with Colette every day reminded him of the times when he had worked with Rebecca as her mannerisms and thought processes were the same as Rebecca's. When he wanted to show her something or get her view on something she would come and stand or sit right up against him. Like Rebecca, she was a very touchy feely person and she touched his hand and arm a lot when they were together. She didn't wear the same fragrance as Rebecca but, to Adam, it became as intoxicating and would linger in his nostrils for the rest of the day as did the clean and fresh smell of her thick copper coloured hair. Adam found her as easy to talk to as Rebecca and the more he got to know her, the more at ease he felt with her and whilst they ate their lunch that Colette made for them every day, they chatted about their lives and interests.",
        "One day the conversation over lunch turned to long term illnesses and Colette told him of her husband's chronic heart failure and the impact it had on their lives. He had suffered from high blood pressure for years, which his doctor had put down to the stress of running a business, and he hadn't taken the advice from his doctor to slow down. After having a massive heart attack he was subsequently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy where the heart muscles progressively weaken and he died two years later. He had been an active and virile man before his heart attack and seeing him become frail and unable to do anything had been heart breaking for both Colette and Rebecca. Rebecca already had her apartment in the city and Colette couldn't bear to stay in their home alone with all of the memories of their life together, so she had sold up and moved to the house on the shore.\n\nAdam told her about Amy's illness and how shattering it had been to lose her at such an early age. Like Colette he also couldn't bear to stay in their home because of the memories but was in two minds about selling as he loved living near the shore, even though he had not stayed there for one night since returning from his odyssey.\n\n\"So why don't you sell and buy something else?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's probably because I don't want to live in someone else's house.\"\n\n\"So have you thought about designing and building your own?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking about that but building plots on the shore are difficult to find and they're also very expensive.\"\n\nColette started to twirl the stem of her water glass between her fingers and Adam knew that she was in deep thinking mode. Colette knew from talking to her daughter how Rebecca felt about Adam and, as the days and weeks passed, she began to understand exactly why Rebecca had fallen for him. He was ruggedly handsome but she also found him charming, witty and a great conversationalist. What she liked most about him was that he appeared to be completely selfless, always putting Rebecca and probably everyone else who knew him first.\n\n\"I'd like to think that we have become good friends over the last couple of months so do you mind if I asked you something very personal?\"\n\n\"Fire away\", he replied.\n\n\"Do you love my daughter?\"\n\nAdam smiled at her as if she knew what his answer would be but he would tell her anyway.\n\n\"I thought that I would never experience a love like I had for Amy again in my lifetime but I have fallen head over heels in love with Rebecca and my love for her grows stronger each and every day. She is a wonderful woman. I'm not sure what she's doing with someone like me when she could have her pick of young and ambitious men.\"\n\nColette smiled back at him when she heard confirmation of what Rebecca had told her.\n\n\"She's with you because you make her happy. You are a handsome, kind and caring man and she is in love with you and I can fully understand that. Now I'm not going to ask you what your intentions are because that is between you and Rebecca but I want to offer you something that could potentially benefit the both of you.\"\n\nShe paused for a few seconds waiting to see if there was a reaction from Adam, which there wasn't.\n\n\"When I bought this house it also came with the plot of land to the right of it. I thought at the time that I could either sell it at some point or build a vacation rental property on it. How would you feel if I leased you the land so that you can design and build a house on it?\"\n\nAdam looked her straight in the eye and pondered for a few seconds.\n\n\"That's very generous of you, and I have to admit that it is appealing as I love the location and the thought of designing and building my own house, but I should discuss the idea with Rebecca first. Is that okay with you?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. I wouldn't have expected anything else of you.\n\nOn his evening drive back to Rebecca's apartment he mulled over their lunchtime conversation and how he would broach the subject with Rebecca. Another thought also came into his head. When Colette had asked him if he loved Rebecca and he had answered her he remembered what she had said; 'She's with you because you make her happy; you are a handsome, kind and caring man and she is in love with you and I can fully understand that.' What did she mean by that he asked himself? Did she also find him handsome and have feelings for him? He definitely found her attractive. She was an older version of Rebecca, although she certainly didn't look her age, in both looks and demeanour and he had to admit that he really liked her and was growing rather fond of her the more that he got to know her. In fact, when she was close to him and he could smell her fragrance he had started to think of her in sexual terms, but he tried hard to put them out of his mind as she was the mother of his girlfriend.\n\nAs he and Rebecca lay cuddled up together in bed after their nightly session of steamy and passionate lovemaking he broached the subject of the plot of land and her mother's offer to lease it to him. She pulled away from him; propped herself up on her elbows and looked him fully in the face. A big smile was on her face.\n\n\"Does that mean you would build us a house? A house for us?\"\n\n\"Of course a house for us. That's if you would like to share a house with me?\"\n\n\"Well why wouldn't I want to share a house with the love of my life; especially as he is going to build it for us? And it will be next door to mom and we will be able to see more of her; if that is okay with you?\"\n\n\"I have no problem with living next door to your mom. I really like her a lot.\"\n\n\"Oh Adam I am so happy with all of this. You are such a lovely man and I know my mom really likes you and is very fond of you.\"\n\n\"Well it appears to be okay with you so I will say yes to your mom when I see her tomorrow. And for the record I am very fond of your mom.\"\n\nThe next morning Adam told Colette of the discussion that he and Rebecca had had and that, if the offer was still there, then he would be pleased to lease the plot of land from her for its true commercial value. Colette was delighted and threw her arms around him, gave him a huge hug and kissed him on both cheeks. Then to his utter surprise she gave him a kiss on his lips, holding her lips to his until his responded to their softness and the taste of her lip gloss.\n\n\"Oh Adam,\" she said \"that is wonderful news. I can't wait for you both to be so close. I'll get my lawyer onto it straight away.\"\n\nA few days later Colette asked Adam if he could do her a big favour. Her friend, who usually took the photographs of her wearing the sweaters she was selling on eBay, was not well and Colette really wanted to get two new sweaters listed so could Adam take them? Adam had just finished knocking the plasterboard out for the walls that were going to be moved so he was covered head to toe in dust.\n\n\"Well, I'll have a go but I am not a natural photographer so they may not be as good as the ones your friend takes. Let me have a shower to clean up and I'll be right with you.\"\n\nAdam went upstairs to shower in the family bathroom. The door to the bathroom did not shut properly and had come ajar on its own accord so, as Adam was drying himself after showering, he could see through the gap into the hallway and across into Colette's bedroom. Colette was standing in front of her wardrobe mirrors brushing her hair. She had changed and was wearing an extremely fluffy turquoise mohair sweater which went halfway down her thighs, black fishnet stockings and black stiletto boots that went to just above the knee. The sweater hugged her figure and was tight across her arse. Adam was transfixed, stopped drying himself and, as his eyes went up and down admiring everything he saw, his cock started to become erect.\n\nWith one last stroke through her hair Colette put the brush down and then ran both hands up and down her sides and over her arse several times. Adam gulped and, as she started to turn around, he stepped behind the door not believing what he had just seen or his reaction. His cock was so swollen and he was desperate to stroke it and masturbate but, just as he was about to start, he heard Colette shouting that she was ready whenever he was. He started to dress but found it difficult to button up his jeans with such a huge swollen cock and, as he stepped out of the bathroom and into the hallway, he shouted to Colette asking where she was.\n\n\"I'm in my bedroom just across the hallway from the bathroom. Come on in.\"\n\nAdam pushed the half open door and stepped into her bedroom. Colette was sitting on the edge of the bed fiddling with her digital SLR camera and looked up as he came in.\n\n\"I think I've got everything ready for this sweater. I bought some studio lighting equipment last year as our indoor pictures were very dark and didn't show the fluffiness of the sweaters. Dorothy usually uses the tripod as she does tend to shake when holding the camera for any length of time. It's up to you whether you want to use it. Have you used a digital SLR before?\"\n\nAdam replied that he hadn't so Colette told him to sit down next to her and she would show him the basic functions. She leaned across and held the camera in front of him while she started to explain everything but Adam didn't hear anything. Her fragrance had wafted up his nostrils and was playing havoc with his brain and his eyes were feasting on the fluffy mohair as it hugged her neck and melded with her thick copper coloured hair.\n\n\"Adam.\" Her saying his name brought him back to his senses. \"Do you think that you are ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes\", he answered, although he hadn't heard a word she said.\n\n\"Right let's start with the shots on the bed.\"\n\nShe climbed onto the middle of the bed, kneeled up with her knees apart and pulled the sweater tight between her legs before letting go.\n\n\"The focus and lighting should be okay so just take the shot when you are ready. I will change position every so often so just continue to shoot when you think the pose is good.\"\n\nColette moved from kneeling, to lying on her front, to lying on her back with her hair lying alongside on the pillow. Adam continued to take multiple shots of each pose until Colette said to stop. She got off the bed and came round to look at the shots that Adam had taken.\n\n\"They're very good Adam so I think that we'll stop there and move over to the mirror. I like to have shots of me in the mirror so I can show both the front and the back of the sweater at the same time. If you can stand in front of the mirror I will set the focus and then we can change places.\"\n\nAfter Colette had focussed the camera they swapped places and Adam took numerous shots with her standing to the left, to the right and straight ahead. Colette came back to the camera and reviewed the shots.\n\n\"They look good Adam. I particularly like the close ups you did. You have an eye for this so I may have to keep you on for future shots. Right let me change into the second sweater and we can go down to the poolside for those ones.\"\n\nAdam carried the camera, tripod and lights downstairs and out to the pool and waited for her to come down. He had to admit that he was rather enjoying taking photographs of Colette and a couple of minutes later she appeared out of the French doors wearing a brilliant white turtleneck sweater. This one was a shorter than the last one, coming down to her waist and was also thicker and baggier as well as being extremely fluffy, although it didn't show off her curves as well as the turquoise one. Colette wanted shots of her lying down alongside the pool and then climbing up the steps which Adam duly took. He then suggested that she sit on the side of the pool with her legs dangling in the water and he would get some different shots from the back and front. He particularly liked the close up shots of her hair and the turtleneck with the water in the background and Colette was also most impressed.\n\nHe had to admit that Colette made a good model for her sweaters as her good looks and her thick long copper coloured hair lying on top of the mohair looked very hot. Her poses were rather seductive for selling sweaters on eBay, he thought, but if that's what it takes to get a good price then why shouldn't she. No wonder she is able to command such a high price for some sweaters he told himself; her customers were buying the image of her as well as the sweater.\n\n\"I am going to send some of these to Rebecca to see what she thinks of your photography skills\", Colette said later when they were sat having a coffee in the kitchen.\n\n\"She will probably laugh as she said the ones that I put on my blog were rather one dimensional. I don't think she will be able to say that about these. Have you always put photos like these on your eBay shop?\"\n\nColette laughed. \"Not to begin with, but I think my buyers like them. In the early days I had a couple of requests for more 'intimate' photos to send with the sweater they'd just bought, so I thought that maybe this is what most of the people who bought them wanted. What was most surprising was that I had requests from a couple of women who bought a sweater. I like the idea that people buy my sweaters based on pictures of me as well as the sweater. Perhaps I am a bit of a show off?\"\n\n\"Well, if you don't mind me saying, you do look good in the photos. I must look at your back catalogue.\"\n\nShe smirked at him.\n\n\"Please do. Some may surprise you.\"\n\n\"I will definitely have to take a look then.\"\n\nRebecca wasn't in the apartment when Adam got back there later so he presumed she was still working. They were going out to the cinema and dinner that evening so, while he waited for her, he thought he would take a look at Colette's eBay shop. It appeared to Adam that Colette only knitted two sweaters a month so when they were up for auction she was knitting the next two. The vast majority were long thick turtleneck sweaters in a variety of colours but, occasionally, there were shorter cowl neck and round neck ones. Colette was the model in the vast majority of photographs but, to Adam's surprise and pleasure, Rebecca modelled a couple.\n\nHe was even more pleased when he saw her modelling the gold coloured short sleeved sweater, which he had come to love her wearing, as well as a thick cream cardigan with a large collar. The photographs of the cream cardigan showed it partially open and she appeared to be completely naked underneath. He could see the cleavage of her firm breasts and in one of the photos he was sure that here nipples were extended and pushing out. Adam downloaded a couple of the images that were his favourites, made the one of her wearing the gold sweater as his wallpaper and the rest he saved to a folder and set them to display as his screen saver.\n\nThe week before Christmas the refurbishment of the basement was complete and Adam stood in the middle of the floor admiring his hard work. He had impressed himself that he had been able to do a lot of the work himself, with the exception of the plastering and electrical work, but he had laid the cables in advance of the electrician coming in to complete it. He had torn down the internal walls and built new ones in the locations that Colette had planned, had laid new flooring and completed all of the decorating. Colette had invited Rebecca over for dinner that evening, so that she could be there for the grand opening, and as it was a Friday they had been invited to stay for the weekend. Neither Colette nor Rebecca had seen the finished room, although Colette had seen the progress on a daily basis.\n\nAfter a fantastic dinner and a couple of bottles of wine they all trooped down the stairs to the basement and, as Colette cut the ribbon that Adam had strung up across the doorway before dinner, he switched on the lights. Both women gasped when they saw the results of his hard work.\n\n\"It looks absolutely fantastic Adam,\" said Colette, walking around and then sitting on the stool at the high desk that Adam had built.\n\nHer iMac was on the desk ready for her to use when editing her photographs. In the opposite corner was the sofa that she had bought for her to sit and knit on and behind the partition was the studio area where she would take her photographs. Adam had set up the lighting, her tripod and a cloth backdrop that was rolled out over the floor. Sat on the cloth backdrop was a chaise longue that Adam had spotted in a second hand furniture store and thought would be perfect for her.\n\nRebecca came up to him, hugged him, planted a big kiss on his cheek and whispered in his ear.\n\n\"You are a star. I will have to reward you when we get home.\"\n\nA few days later while Adam was finishing off the last few things he had to do at Colette's house he received a text message from Rebecca.\n\n\"I am cooking a special dinner for you tonight as a thank you for everything you have done for mom. Be back at exactly at 7pm. Not a minute before or a minute later or you will spoil the surprise I have planned for you. Xx\"\n\nShe is so demanding that woman, Adam thought to himself, and wondered what the surprise would be. So at exactly 7pm he opened the door to the apartment and closed it noisily behind him in order to alert her that he was back.\n\n\"I'm in the kitchen!\" she shouted.\n\nHe dumped his rucksack at the door to the bedroom, walked down the hallway and into the kitchen. His eyes nearly popped out of his head. She was standing at the stove with her back to him wearing a baby pink cowl neck mohair sweater, pink silk French knickers, pink fishnet holdups and five inch white stiletto shoes. The sweater hugged her body showing off the curves of her gorgeous breasts.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" she asked without turning around.\n\n\"Absolutely ravenous\" he said as he walked up behind her and wrapped his arms around her, cupping her fluffy covered breasts in each hand.\n\nAs he planted light kisses on the back of her neck her nipples started to become erect and he rubbed his hands lightly over them feeling them rise as well as feeling the fluffiness of the mohair. While continuing to kiss her neck he slowly moved his right hand down, across her stomach and down to the elasticated waistband of her pink silk French knickers. Rebecca pulled her stomach in almost inviting him to push his hand inside, which he duly did very slowly feeling her tense as his hand moved slowly down towards her fanny. As he reached it he could feel the warmth and moistness oozing from her. He moved his middle finger down her slit and then inserted it up to his second knuckle and then pulled out searching for the nub of her clit.\n\n\"Not too fast biker boy\", she gasped and then turned around, wrapped her arms around his neck and began to kiss him passionately. Their tongues became entwined and he ran his right hand up her neck and through her thick hair while his left hand stroked her lower back. He manoeuvred her against the kitchen island and then hoisted her onto it. She wrapped her legs around his hips and pulled him into her whilst shuffling her bottom forward so that her groin was over the edge. While their kissing became more intense he undid the belt to his jeans and undid the fly buttons, allowing them to drop to the floor. As he pulled his shorts down his swollen cock was released and fell against the silk panties immediately outside the entrance to her fanny. She instinctively wrapped the finger and thumb of one hand an inch or so from the top of his cock, pulled the panties away from her fanny and then directed him into her.\n\nHe slowly pushed his cock in and heard her gasp as her swollen lips opened to allow him access. He wrapped his arms around her, pulled her into him and pushed his cock in right up to the hilt. She placed both hands on the cheeks of his face, stared into his eyes and gave him a broad smile. He stared into her eyes and returned the smile.",
        "\"So do you like your surprise?\" she asked in a deep husky voice while using her vaginal muscles to grasp his cock in a vice like grip.\n\n\"Oh my god\", he gasped. \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"I think that my biker boy is going to gun up the revs and then fuck the living daylights out of me. Is that what he's going to do?\"\n\nWithout replying he pulled her head to him, latched his open mouth onto hers and began to fuck her. She was right about him fucking the living daylights out of her and, as he exploded into her, he grasped the back of her sweater which pulled her backwards and he leaned forward to bury his face into the mohair covering her breasts. She used her legs to pull him harder into her and let out a high pitched scream as her orgasm shot through her. Without withdrawing from her Adam lifted her and, with her legs wrapped around his waist, carried her through to the bedroom where he laid her gently on the bed. They laid there together with Rebecca nestling into him, totally expended from their exertions in the kitchen.\n\n\"Do you love me?\" she asked out of the blue.\n\n\"Of course I do\", he replied.\n\n\"Are you in love with me?\"\n\n\"More than you will ever know.\"\n\n\"Do you like my mom?\"\n\n\"You know I do. She is a really lovely person.\"\n\n\"Do you find her attractive?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's a very attractive woman. Not as attractive as you, of course.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have a problem if you wanted to sleep with her.\"\n\n\"WHAT!!! Are you mad? What would your mom think or say if she knew what you had just said?\"\n\nRebecca moved away from him and knelt on the bed looking at him. Her expression was serious.\n\n\"Look, I love my mom to bits and all I want is for her to be happy. She may be in her fifties but, you know as well as I do that, she is much younger physically and in outlook. So all I'm saying is that, if you both wanted to have sex with each other, I wouldn't have a problem with it.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that your mom has told you that she wants to have sex with me?\"\n\n\"No I've never discussed it with her but I know that she really likes you. She did say that you were really handsome and that you reminded her of my dad.\"\n\n\"I'm very flattered that your mom finds me handsome and I do find her attractive but I am totally smitten with you and I'm certainly not looking to have sex with anyone else. And anyway, even if I was looking, I don't think that it would be appropriate to have sex with your mom.\"\n\nRebecca smiled, leaned forward and lovingly stroked his cheek.\n\n\"I won't say any more, as it's clearly upsetting or confusing you, other than to repeat that, if you were to find yourself wanting to have sex with my mom, then I wouldn't have a problem with it.\"\n\nHe looked into her eyes, pulled her into him, kissed her tenderly and then held her at arm's length.\n\n\"I love you so much biker girl, and I am so glad that you came into my world, but I have to admit that you never cease to amaze me.\"\n\n\"And I love you with all of my heart biker boy. Now come here and show me how much you love me.\"\n\nIn the following weeks Adam was kept busy finding an architect for the new house and he and Rebecca interviewed several who had experience of designing beach houses. They finally selected a young firm, who were local to the area and full of ideas that appealed to both of them. Encouraged by Rebecca, and while he waited for the design and drawings to be completed, Adam enrolled on a photography and video course at the college close to Rebecca's apartment. Colette was so impressed with his course work that he had shown to her and Rebecca that she asked him if he would continue to take the photos of her sweaters as and when she had new ones ready for sale.\n\nLate in January, and with the design and drawings of the house completed and building permissions granted, Adam engaged the local tradespeople he had selected to do the actual build and everything was planned to begin in early spring. As he had time on his hands for a couple of weeks and, as he now had some idea of how to take interesting videos, Colette asked him if he would be interested in making a video of her wearing each of her sweaters that she could put onto YouTube so that she could communicate on a more personal level with her customers. They discussed her ideas over the weekly dinner that Colette cooked for him and Rebecca each Friday and on their way back to Rebecca's apartment she joked that perhaps they could practice with some videos of their exploits in the bedroom. Unsurprisingly, Adam became very interested at that point and the rest of their journey was taken up with discussing ideas.\n\nOn the following Monday morning Adam was back at Colette's with all of his video recording equipment and he and Colette sat down and thrashed out ideas and formats. For the next couple of days they shot a mountain of video of her wearing different sweaters in the studio, the garden, the pool area and the woods behind the house. There was still a lot of snow on the ground and Adam used it as backdrops whenever he could. The editing of the video took twice as long as the actual recording, as did the voice overlay that Colette wanted to accompany the video. She wasn't happy with the way her voice sounded and so they roped Rebecca in to give them a comparison. Rebecca didn't like the sound of her voice either and so it was left to Adam to cast the deciding vote on whose voice to use. He voted for Colette as he felt that her voice was slightly deeper.\n\n\"So you don't like my voice?\" asked Rebecca as they drove home.\n\n\"Of course I do. I just think your mom's is more suited. And anyway you sound like a lawyer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"You sound like you are negotiating for one of your client's opposite other lawyers; very forceful, like you are not a person to be messed with. Your mom's voice sounds richer and deeper. Maybe it is down to her French heritage.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"It's funny you should mention negotiating across a table. I have to do exactly that in Chicago next week. You know that big case we have been working on for the last couple of months? Well it seems like the complainant is pulling out the big boys and we have agreed to meet with them. I'll probably be away for most of the week.\"\n\nThen, in a squeaky little girl voice she said \"Will you miss your little fluffy bunny while she's away?\"\n\n\"Fluffy bunny!!! That's a new one. Of course I'll miss you\" he said laughing. \"Just you be careful of those big boys and don't let them take advantage of you.\"\n\n\"The only person I want taking advantage of me is you. So put your foot down and get us home as quickly as you can. Fluffy bunny wants her biker boy to fuck her brains out.\"\n\n\"Your wish is my command\", he replied and put his foot down on the gas.\n\nPart three\n\nThe following Monday Rebecca flew out to Chicago. Adam worked on editing some of the video files until early afternoon when he got to a point where he needed some direction from Colette so he phoned her. After they had agreed on what needed doing she asked him what he had planned for the evening.\n\n\"Oh I'll probably get a take-out and chill in front of the TV.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come over for dinner and stay the night? It's been a while since you have been on your own overnight and I wouldn't want you to get lonely.\"\n\n\"Did Rebecca put you up to that? She mentioned to me that I should go and stay at your place while she was away.\"\n\nColette hesitated. \"Well she may have put the idea in my head. You know what she's like.\"\n\nAdam laughed. \"I do indeed know what she is like. Are you sure, as I wouldn't want to put you out?\"\n\n\"It won't be any trouble at all. The guest room is all made up and I can rustle up dinner while you are driving over. See you later.\"\n\nAdam finished what he was doing, packed up all of his equipment up, threw some clothes into a bag, sent a text message to Rebecca telling her that he was going to her mom's and drove out of the city. Half way to Colette's he received a text back from Rebecca saying that she was pleased that he wasn't going to be on his own and that she would call him later. He stopped at a liquor store not far from Colette's and bought a couple of nice bottles of wine and some flowers from the store next door. When he arrived he let himself into the house using the keys that Colette had given him some months back and found her in the kitchen sitting at the breakfast bar drinking a glass of dark red wine. There was another glass beside hers already filled.\n\n\"Hi Adam. I took the liberty of pouring you a glass to let it breathe. I hope that was okay?\"\n\nHe dumped all of his bags onto the floor, sat down next to her and took a sip of the wine.\n\n\"Excellent. Argentinian Malbec?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course. I know that's your favourite so I got a case in a while back. Dinner will be ready in half an hour or so.\"\n\nThey chatted while Colette finished making dinner and, as they sat down at the table to eat, Adam noticed that they had already drunk nearly two bottles of wine and another was on the table waiting. During dinner they finished the other one and by the time they sat down on the sofa to drink coffee he was feeling rather pissed.\n\n\"Can I get you a cognac to have with your coffee?\" Colette asked.\n\n\"That would be really nice but only if you join me.\"\n\nShe brought a full bottle of French cognac over with two glasses, put the bottle on the coffee table and poured them both a good measure.\n\n\"Are you trying to get me pissed Colette?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly not\", she replied indignantly but then started to giggle. \"But then I'm feeling rather pissed myself as I've been drinking wine since I started cooking. I haven't been drunk for years so you may have to forgive me if I fall flat on my face when I stand up.\"\n\n\"Well if you do then I'll have to pick you up and carry you upstairs.\"\n\n\"No man has carried me up the stairs for years so I may have to drink a little more just so you can and I can remember what it was like.\"\n\nShe picked up her cognac glass and held it up. He did the same and they clinked their glasses together.\n\n\"Here's to us as friends and neighbours and to the future\" she said.\n\nNeither of them spoke as they sat there staring at the fireplace and slowly sipping their cognac. The silence was suddenly interrupted by Adam's cell phone ringing in his trouser pocket. He pulled it out and saw that it was Rebecca calling. He stood up, staggered and gesticulated to Colette that he was going to take the call upstairs. As he walked into the hallway he went to answer the call and hit the 'Ignore' button by mistake. \"Oops\" he said to himself. When he finally got to the top of the stairs and found his way to the guest room he called her back.\n\n\"Hi there\", she said. \"Did you cut me off?\"\n\n\"Yes, but by accident. Not intentionally.\"\n\n\"You sound pissed. Has my mother been forcing wine down your throat?\"\n\n\"Well she has been doing her hardest to get us both pissed with bottles of Malbec and gigantic measures of cognac.\"\n\n\"I shall have to have words with her when I get back. So I take it that you have arrived at mom's?\"\n\n\"Yep. Packed my bags and got here a couple of hours ago. Had a lovely dinner and I think that we were both about to fall asleep on the sofa. How is it all going in Chicago?\"\n\n\"My plane was delayed so I didn't get here until late morning. This afternoon's session was pretty intense and we have only just finished for the day. I have got so much writing up and prep to do before tomorrow morning that I think that I'm going to be up all night.\"\n\n\"Make sure that you get something to eat before you carry on working.\"\n\n\"I will. I'm going to get room service and then crack on. I wish I was with you. Do you miss me?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. Thank you for getting your mom to invite me over. I wasn't really looking forward to staying in the apartment on my own.\"\n\n\"I know. Be a good boy and don't let her get you too pissed. And remember what we spoke about the other week. Love you and miss you.\"\n\n\"And I love and miss you fluffy bunny. Speak to you tomorrow.\"\n\nHe put the phone down. He was feeling rather pissed; not in a room spinning way but a floating light headed way so he lay down on the bed and stared at the ceiling. He wished that Rebecca was lying beside him as he was starting to feel horny, just as he had been every night since they had got together. She was insatiable and they had sex at least once, if not twice a night. He closed his eyes and started to rub his hand over his groin. He could feel his cock starting to become erect so he undid his belt and trousers, raised his hips, arse and knees and pulled his trousers off. He pushed his hand down into his shorts, down the length of his now fully engorged cock and started to rub himself.\n\nHis mind was floating and dreaming of Rebecca knelt naked in front of him and starting to take him in her mouth. He could almost sense her tongue licking the head of his cock and then her warm soft lips slowly moving up and down his shaft. Up and down and up and down; her tongue swirling around the head at the end of each movement. God, he thought to himself, I am literally feeling this and not just thinking of it. He opened his eyes to see the top of Colette's head in front of him. Her thick copper coloured hair bobbing up and down and her hands were grasping the base of his cock. She was naked and he could see her arse up in the air above her head.\n\nHe was about to shout \"what the fuck are you doing\", but he was lost in the moment of her mouth fucking him for all she was worth. He just lay there enjoying every nanosecond of the experience. Her fingers were lightly stroking his balls as her mouth continued up and down his shaft and he could feel himself at the edge not able to hold back any longer. With a huge \"Oh my god!!!\" he exploded into her mouth and grabbed hold of her hair holding her where she was. Ribbon after ribbon of cum hit the back of her mouth but her lips stayed fastened around his cock as she sucked all of them down her throat. She was almost sucking him dry and, as his cock started to go flaccid, her tongue swirled around the head of his cock wiping it clean before she raised her head.\n\nAs he lay back on the bed getting his breath back she raised her head. She was kneeling in between his legs with her arms holding her up. She looked him in the eye, licked her lips and smiled.\n\n\"God that feels so good to taste a man's cum again,\" she whispered. \"I have missed that and having a huge cock in my mouth. Thank you.\"\n\nHe looked into her eyes. \"You're thanking me!!! I should be thanking you for giving me the best blow job I have ever had.\"\n\nShe crawled up his body allowing her breasts to flow over his cock and stomach until her face was opposite his and then leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips.\n\n\"Well if you must thank me, you can fuck me with the gorgeous cock of yours. I have also really missed having a huge cock inside me.\"\n\nHe raised his head and brought his lips to hers. Her mouth responded and opened slowly allowing his tongue to enter. He pulled her into him and their mouths became locked and the kissing became more passionate, their tongues meeting in her mouth. He pushed her backwards and raised himself up allowing her to straddle him and their arms to wrap around each other tightly. While not releasing their kissing he ran his hands through her thick hair and up and down her back.\n\nThe passionate kissing, the feel of her hair and the scent of her perfume resulted in his cock quickly becoming erect. She felt it harden against her and moved herself so that it was at the opening of her fanny which was already moist. Using one hand she took hold of his cock and guided it in, feeling it slide gently into her. As she had imagined, it was thick and hard and it pushed the outer and inner walls of her fanny wide to accommodate it. When she felt that it was all the way in she used her vaginal muscles to clamp it and hold it there, savouring the feeling of being full of cock once again. When she had had her fill of being full she began to slowly rise up almost to the top of his shaft before going back deeply until their groins touched.\n\nAdam grasped hold of her hips and pushed his face into her breasts licking and flicking her engorged nipples, enjoying every second of her movement up and down. She continued in this mode for what seemed like hours until she sensed that he was about to come, whereupon she used the fingers of one hand to stroke her clitoris trying to ensure that she came at the same time. As her orgasm began she leaned right back, suspending herself on one arm, while continuing to tweak her clit, feeling his cock slide against the walls of her fanny. He came with a huge groan and she could feel the ribbons of cum explode into her. With one last stroke and a massive clench of her muscles she forced herself to come; first once, then twice and then three times.\n\nAdam slumped back and lay on the bed, his eyes closed and panting for breath, while wallowing in the euphoria of his second orgasm of the night. Colette righted herself and continued to keep his withering cock inside of her while looking down at him. He looked up and extended his arm out inviting her to come and nestle into the crook of his arm. As they both lay together in silence she slowly stroked her hand over his chest watching his breathing subside. She could tell from the sound of his breathing that he had fallen asleep. She smiled to herself and whispered \"I love you\" before closing her eyes and falling asleep.\n\n----\n\nWhen Colette woke the next morning she was on her side facing the window. She ran the tips of her fingers over her fanny which was still warm and had a crust of her juices with the last vestiges of his semen still dripping down her leg. She smiled to herself remembering the feeling of his magnificent cock totally filling her. The last time she had had sex was with her husband, Daniel, over seven years ago just before he became ill. Her husband had been the love of her life and had taught her everything about sex. He had taught her to be adventurous and daring; trying most things at least once, but he was also a selfless lover and always ensured that she came before he did. Like Adam he was well endowed but he also had a firm yet flexible tongue and they both enjoyed him going down on her. Using his tongue he could make her cum over and over again until she felt light headed and had to beg him to stop. Her memories started to make her feel horny so she turned over with the idea of getting her fanny filled with Adam's cock once again.\n\nShe expected to see Adam still lying there asleep but his side of the bed was empty. Colette placed her hand on the indentation of where he had slept. It was cold. Slipping out of bed she walked down the hallway to her bedroom and she sat at her dressing table to brush her hair, put some more lip gloss on and pinched her cheeks to give them some colour. She threw on her sexiest pink lacy negligee which was almost see through, walked down the wooden staircase silently in her bare feet and along the hallway to the kitchen. No smell of fresh coffee being brewed so she wasn't surprised when she found it empty. Sitting lonely in the middle of the kitchen table was a note. She picked it up but decided not to read it until she had had some coffee and aspirin as her head was beginning to throb.\n\nAfter a few sips of strong, black, piping hot coffee and with the aspirin taking effect she sat down at the breakfast bar and opened the note.\n\n\"Dearest Colette. Forgive me for slipping out while you were still asleep. Last night was beautiful and something I will never forget. I woke up not long after falling asleep (sorry about that!!) and spent most of the night looking at you asleep and thinking about what we had just done. Ashamed -- NO NEVER! Guilty -- FUCK YES! I know that I must tell Rebecca. Confused -- TOTALLY &amp; ABSOLUTELY! This is where the confusion lays. I am passionately in love with Rebecca and have just made love to her mother. How can a man have sex with both a mother and a daughter, even though he cares deeply for both of them? It is not right or proper. I know that I should have stayed and told you in person but I am sure you will understand that I have to tell Rebecca face to face and so I am going to fly to Chicago on the first flight I can get this morning. Love Adam XX\"",
        "Colette stared at the note and read it twice more before sitting back and taking another sip of coffee.\n\n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck. I need to speak to Rebecca before Adam gets there.\"\n\nShe looked at the clock. It was just after 7am. Knowing that Rebecca would be up and probably already working she picked up the phone and called her.\n\n\"Hi mom. Bit early for a call. Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"Hi baby. No not really. Adam is on his way to Chicago to see you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nColette hesitated and then blurted it out.\n\n\"We both got drunk last night and I took advantage of him and we had sex. I'm so sorry baby. I have betrayed you with the man you are in love with. He's now feeling guilty and wants to tell you face to face.\"\n\nRebecca was silent on the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Did you enjoy the sex?\"\n\n\"Well of course I did but that's not the point. I had sex with your boyfriend.\"\n\n\"But how did you feel this morning when you woke up?\"\n\nColette thought for a moment before replying.\n\n\"I felt totally refreshed, satisfied and alive for the first time in seven years. It's like a fire has started in my soul.\"\n\n\"Well there you are. I love you to bits and I don't have a problem with you sleeping with Adam. I told him a couple of weeks ago that it would be okay with me if you two had sex.\"\n\n\"You did what!!!\"\n\n\"I have known since the day I introduced him to you that you fancied him. He reminds you of dad, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes he does but that's not the point here Rebecca.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. I don't have a 'daddy complex' but Adam does remind me of dad in so many ways and they do say that young women are drawn to men who remind them of their fathers. I know that you were so in love with dad for all of your life together and thought, until recently, that he could never be replaced by any man, nor could you ever love any other man. But I've seen the way you look and interact with Adam and got the feeling that, if there was ever to be any man in your life again, it was going to be him.\"\n\n\"But Rebecca, he's your boyfriend, your partner, the man you have dreamed of ever since you met him. I was so happy when you finally got together with the man of your dreams, the man you thought that you would never have, the man you waited for and hoped for and now I have ruined it by taking advantage of the situation.\"\n\nRebecca could hear Colette begin to cry at the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Mom. Please don't cry. Adam is the love of my life and I have never been happier, but I am also so happy that he makes you happy, if that makes sense. I have never seen you so happy around someone since dad passed.\"\n\n\"But I have gone and ruined it for all of us. I should have just kept dreaming rather than taking advantage of the situation. What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Would you like to have a loving relationship with Adam?\"\n\n\"Yes but how can I possibly do that when you, my one and only daughter that I love so dearly, and Adam are so in love?\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence at the other end.\n\n\"We could share him.\"\n\n\"What!!!\"\n\n\"Share him. It's a little unusual but I think that it can work. In fact I am sure it can work for all of us. I love him and he loves me. You love him and I know that he loves you, even if he hasn't admitted it to himself yet. So why can't we all love each other. I mean I don't want us to all live together in one house but, as we will be living next door to each other pretty soon, Adam can split his time between us.\"\n\n\"Are you fucking serious!!!\"\n\n\"I am completely serious. I have been thinking about it for several months. I have weighed the pros and cons and I think that it is an ideal solution for all of our happiness. He makes me totally happy and fulfilled. I know that he makes you happy and I am sure he can fulfil your life as well. I want all three of us to be happy.\"\n\n\"Rebecca, I know that your logical mind is one of your greatest assets but how can you be sure that it will work.\"\n\n\"Will it work for you?\"\n\n\"Well yes but, as you say, it is unusual. Not a little unusual but seriously fucking weird unusual. What will our friends and neighbours say? And even if we can accept it what is Adam going to say?\"\n\n\"As regards our friends and neighbours they need never know. Your physical relationship with Adam will stay in your house. If you are seen outside then it is going to be when you are playing golf together and, if he accompanies you to a social occasion, he will be seen as your daughter's partner and your plus one for the evening. As regards Adam leave him to me. I have laid the seeds in his mind and will direct him in the right path to take.\"\n\n\"You are such a conniving young woman. Do you know that?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's what makes me a brilliant lawyer. And a brilliant daughter.\"\n\n\"I know that you're both and I have always been so proud of you. Seriously, if you are okay with your idea and believe it can work then so do I. I never thought in a million years that I would be agreeing to share my daughter's lover. I love you so much for wanting to make me happy again.\"\n\n\"I would do anything for you mom. You know that. Anyway, I must go now as I am due in my meeting at 8am. Leave Adam to me. I will let you know when he gets here. Love you.\"\n\n\"I love you too baby girl. Speak to you soon.\"\n\nFuck. What have I just signed up for, thought Colette.\n\nAdam had thrown his clothes into his travel bag and driven straight to the airport arriving just before 7am. The next available direct flight wasn't until 10:15 and so he sat in a restaurant in the departure lounge having breakfast and multiple cups of coffee to soak up the alcohol and clear his throbbing head. He kept going over last night in his head. It had been absolutely wonderful sex and Colette was certainly a very skilful lover. He had only ever had sex with Amy and Rebecca before last night and had always seen it as making passionate and mind blowing love. It was deep and meaningful love with both women. He questioned whether the sex with Colette was equally as meaningful. He had certainly come to love her but he had assumed that it was because she was Rebecca's mother. Now he had to ask himself whether it was more than that. She was a beautiful woman, both inside and outside. He enjoyed her company, her sense of humour, the way that she rationalised everything and, most of all, the outward showing of her love for her daughter. He had noticed the way that she touched him but hadn't thought anything of it until now. It wasn't a come on so was it a sign of her loving him and wanting him?\n\n\"Holy fuck\", he thought to himself. \"Am I falling in love with her? I definitely need to talk this through with Rebecca.\"\n\nAdam arrived at Rebecca's hotel shortly after 1pm. The on duty receptionist wouldn't confirm whether she was staying there or not due to security reasons. He didn't want to send her a message to say that he was there as he didn't want to interrupt her meeting and worry her. He guessed that she wouldn't get back to the hotel until after 6pm at the earliest, so he decided to wander around the city for the afternoon and get back to the hotel around then and wait in the foyer if she wasn't back. It was a lovely sunny day, if somewhat cold, so after looking through the local attractions flyers on display in the foyer he decided to go on the Chicago Architectural River Cruise.\n\nIn her very professional way Rebecca put all thoughts of Adam and her mom to one side while she was in her all day meeting. As normal, she was well prepared for everything that came her way and the meeting finished for the day with her clients congratulating her on the progress that had been made and inviting her to join them for dinner. The meeting was expected to be finished tomorrow so she declined and suggested that they go out the following evening instead so that they could review everything and plan the next steps. She hadn't heard anything from either Adam or her mom during the day so she worked on the premise that he was waiting for her at her hotel. She caught a cab back to her hotel and arrived just before 7pm to find him waiting in the foyer. Feigning surprise she rushed up to him, threw her arms around him, kissed him fully on the lips and whispered in his ear.\n\n\"Did you miss your fluffy bunny so much that you had to come and see her?\"\n\n\"Well naturally I missed you but something happened and I really need to discuss it with you in person.\"\n\n\"God has something happened to mom?\" she exclaimed, knowing that nothing had.\n\n\"No. No. She was fine when I left her. Can we go to your room?\"\n\n\"Of course we can. If you didn't look so worried I would have thought that you just wanted to drag me upstairs and get into my panties. Would you like to get into my panties? I know that I would like you to.\"\n\nHe didn't answer just grabbed her hand and walked swiftly towards the bank of elevators. Once they were in her room she put her briefcase away, took her jacket off and hung it up in the closet and then sat down on the bed, leaving him looking out of the window.\n\n\"So what was so urgent and important that you had to fly to Chicago to tell me Adam?\"\n\nHe walked over to the bed, sat next to her and took her hand.\n\n\"You do know that I am madly in love with you don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes of course I do, and I am with you. So what is this all about?\"\n\n\"Well you know when you said that I sounded drunk last night, well I was. After I put the phone down I laid down on the bed started to get horny thinking about you. So I took my trousers off and started to rub myself and dream about you kneeling naked in front of me and you taking me in your mouth.\"\n\n\"That sounds exciting. Would you like me to do that now?\"\n\n\"Yes but I need to finish what I want to say first.\"\n\n\"Well go on then.\"\n\n\"Anyway I was so drunk that I thought I was literally feeling you doing it and not just thinking of it. It was so good that I opened my eyes and saw the top of your mom's head in front of me. Her hair was bobbing up and down and her hands were grasping the base of my cock. I was about to shout 'what the fuck are you doing' but I was completely lost in the moment of her mouth sucking my cock for all she was worth.\"\n\n\"Oh Adam. Did you come?\"\n\n\"In bucket loads. I am so sorry.\"\n\n\"Did you do anything else or was that it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What else did you do?\"\n\n\"She straddled me and we, umm, you know.\"\n\n\"No I don't know Adam. What did you do?\"\n\n\"We had sex.\"\n\n\"You mean you fucked?\"\n\n\"There's no need to be so crude but yes we did.\"\n\n\"And did you come again?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And did my mother come?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you both enjoyed it then?\"\n\nAdam didn't respond.\n\nIn a sterner voice Rebecca asked the question again, but in a different way.\n\n\"Did you both enjoy it? Did you feel good fucking my mom and do you think that she felt good fucking you? Did you fuck her, or did she fuck you, or did you fuck each other?\"\n\nIn a reticent voice, which was not Adam at all, he replied.\n\n\"I think we both fucked each other and we both enjoyed it. I am so sorry. I don't want you to blame your mom. I got carried away. It was all my doing and I should have stopped her before it went too far.\"\n\nRebecca waited and couldn't resist letting him squirm before saying anything.\n\n\"Well that's not what my mother said when she spoke to me this morning.\"\n\n\"You've spoken to her!!\"\n\n\"Yes she phoned me first thing to tell me all about it and let me know that you were on your way here.\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"She told me that it was all her doing and that she had taken advantage of you being drunk to have her wicked way with you.\"\n\n\"Well I wouldn't call it that.\"\n\n\"What would you call it then Adam?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. I am totally fucking confused Rebecca. I know you said that it was okay if I wanted to have sex with your mother but I never thought that it would happen.\"\n\n\"And how do you feel about it now?\"\n\n\"As I said, I feel confused. It wasn't like just having sex and fucking someone; not that I have ever done that as you know.\"\n\nHe hesitated before carrying on.\n\n\"It didn't feel wrong and I'm not ashamed that it happened. Guilty definitely, but not ashamed. It felt more than that. When we have sex, which is totally awesome every time by the way, I feel that it is the physical showing of our love for each other. I've done nothing else today apart from trying to understand what exactly it was when your mom and I had sex last night. It wasn't just sex it was passionate and meaningful.\"\n\n\"So are you saying it wasn't just sex but you were making love to my mom?\"\n\n\"Yes I think I am and that is what is totally fucking confusing me. How can I be so in love with you and yet love your mom at the same time? Not just love in a friendship way but a more spiritual and physical way.\"\n\n\"Do you think that it could turn into a love like what we have? Being in love as well as loving someone?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think if it continued it would turn out to be like that.\"\n\n\"And are you worried that it may affect our relationship and the love that we have?\"\n\n\"Yes I am. I do not want anything to affect what we have. I love you with all my heart.\"\n\n\"What if I told you that it wouldn't actually have a negative affect but an actual positive one?\"\n\n\"How could that possibly be?\"\n\n\"I told you that I love my mom to bits and would do anything to make her happy. If your loving her and her loving you makes her happy again then it would make me happier than you could ever know. I love both of you so much and cannot think of a world without both of you.\"\n\n\"So you could accept your mom and I being in love as well as you and I being in love? You do realise that the physical side also comes with that?\"\n\n\"Well it has already hasn't it? Provided it stays inside her house and no expression of it is seen by the outside world then I can live with that. Mom and I can share our love of you as you can of us. To the outside world you and I are a loving couple. You can do things with my mom such as play golf and take her to parties and such like as her escort for the night. Her plus one? Her son-in-law maybe? We can live next door to her and you can share your love with her when I am not around.\"\n\n\"You have really thought about this whole thing, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes I have. It will be an unusual relationship but I really believe that it could work and that we would all be so happy and fulfilled.\"\n\nShe took his face in her hands and stared into his eyes.\n\n\"If you love me as much as you say you do then you will make it work for all three of us. Will you make it work Adam?\"\n\nHe leaned forward and kissed her gently on the lips.\n\n\"I believe in you totally. I trust you implicitly. I love you so deeply. If you truly feel that it will work for the benefit of all of us then I will make it work.\"\n\n\"Good. I will talk to mom when I get back. Now get your clothes off. I want to feel that huge thick cock of yours in my mouth and then inside my cunt.\"\n\n\"I love it when you talk dirty to me. Not so fluffy bunny now, are we? More a dirty little cock sucking slut of a lawyer.\"\n\nShe didn't reply as her mouth was already full of his cock, sucking and slurping as he quickly became erect. She sucked him to the point of near orgasm and then stripped off and straddled him as he lay prostrate on the bed.\n\n\"Anything my mother can do I can do better\", she gasped as she lowered herself onto him, directing his huge purple headed cock into her dripping fanny. \"Now I am going to fuck you like you have never been fucked before!!\"\n\nAdam lay there watching her move up and down while feeling her fanny muscles clasp and unclasp his cock at the end of every stroke.\n\n\"If this is going to be a competition between them,\" he thought to himself, \"I am going to win every time but be fucking exhausted. Bring it on!!!\"\n\nRather than fly back on his own Adam decided to stay in Chicago and fly back with her on Thursday morning. She invited him out to dinner with her clients and so he went out during the day while Rebecca was in her meeting and bought a suit, shirt and tie. Rebecca and her clients went straight to the restaurant after their meeting and he caught a cab and joined them there, allowing them time to have their debriefing session first. Adam knew that she was an excellent lawyer but he was full of admiration for the way she interacted with her clients and the way that they spoke of her in such glowing terms. She had proudly introduced him to them as her partner, the man who had ridden across the country and whom she had joined for part of it. They were full of admiration about his travels and asked him lots of questions showing real interest. He admitted to Rebecca when they were back in their hotel room that, for the first time since Amy had passed away, he missed interacting with professional business people.\n\nThey flew back the following morning and Adam went back to the apartment while Rebecca went straight back to her office. Rebecca spoke to her mom on the phone later that afternoon and told her everything she had discussed and agreed with Adam. They agreed that it would be best if they all sat down together to discuss how it would all work and so Rebecca suggested that she and Adam come to dinner at Colette's on Friday evening. On the drive over to Colette's house Rebecca could see that Adam was nervous; he was very quiet and only offered mono syllabic answers when she asked him questions. As they pulled onto Colette's driveway and stopped the car Adam turned to Rebecca.\n\n\"Are you really sure that this is a good idea? I don't want to ever lose you or upset you or do anything that will make you unhappy.\"\n\nShe leaned across and touched him tenderly on the cheek before kissing him lightly on the lips. She gave him a broad smile which lit up her face.\n\n\"Adam darling, I have thought this through so many times and I can't see anything but happiness for all three of us. I love you and mom, she loves you and me, and you love the both of us. Having a man back in her life, someone who will make her happy and fulfilled, will give me so much pleasure. And you are the only man for both of us. Just let it happen and, I promise you, we will all have wonderful lives together.\"\n\n\"Well if you are sure then let's go for it. I'm not sure how I can split my time between the two of you but I'm sure you've already worked that one out. Have you?\"\n\n\"Of course I have. Let's go in and have a lovely evening and I will share my thoughts and ideas over a glass or two of wine.\"\n\nRebecca let herself into the house and strode purposefully along the hallway and into the kitchen where Colette was sat in her usual place at the breakfast bar, wine glass in hand. She got up and wrapped her arms around Rebecca and planted a big kiss on her cheeks. Adam hung back a little and as Colette finished hugging and kissing Rebecca she looked him in the eye, smiled, stepped forward and did the same to him, as if everything was as it had been before last Monday.\n\n\"I bet you're both gasping for a glass of wine, aren't you? Malbec for both of you? Who's driving this evening or would you like to stay over tonight?\"\n\n\"I'm driving Mom so I'll have a coffee. I'm sure that Adam will have a glass of Malbec, won't you darling?\" Rebecca replied with a smirk.\n\n\"Yes but not too large\", he said in a quiet voice. \"You know what I'm like after a glass or two.\"\n\n\"I certainly do Adam\", Colette laughed as she poured him a glass and then put some coffee on for Rebecca.\n\nRebecca smiled at Adam and blew him a kiss. \"Thank you\" she mouthed.\n\nThe ice was broken and their conversation before and over dinner was as normal as it had always been. Adam sat at the head of the table with Rebecca and Colette on either side of him and he got the distinct impression that he was being made to feel like the man of the house. Their man. The man they were going to share their love and lives with. Over coffee Rebecca pulled out a sheet of paper from her purse, unfolded it and laid it flat on the table. The other two looked at her and waited for her to speak with anticipation and a little nervousness.",
        "\"So I have been giving our future together a lot of thought, as I'm sure you both knew I would, and I have come up with some ground rules. They're open for discussion and for either of you to add anything. Is that okay?\"\n\nColette and Adam both nodded and felt like children sitting in front of their teacher.\n\n\"Firstly, I think that we should discuss how many nights per week that Adam should stay here and at my place. When our house has been completed we can review things but, while Adam is managing the project on site, I think that he should stay here Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights and be with me on Wednesday night and over the weekend. That will mean that he won't have to commute every day. I did think about him staying here Monday through Friday but I don't think that I can do without him for four nights so that's why I thought that he could come back to mine on Wednesday. What do you think?\"\n\n\"I think that is an excellent idea Rebecca\", said Colette. \"What do you think Adam?\"\n\n\"Yep, sounds good to me.\"\n\n\"I mean I'm not saying that Adam has to work every day on the house during the week. You two can manage your time as and how you wish. If you want to play golf, or go out for the day then that's up to you. I have been thinking that Mom and I should have some extended time with Adam for at least two weeks a year so we should agree that this can be two one week holidays or just one two week holiday. Maybe Mom and I can also go away together and Adam can do whatever he wants. This will give us solid quality time to engage as a couple so the person left alone should not contact the other two unless it is an emergency. In fact, when Adam is living here I won't contact him unless it is to do with the house build and Mom you should do the same when he is living in my place. This applies to you Adam as well. What do you both say?\"\n\nColette and Adam both nodded and let Rebecca continue.\n\n\"Now, Mom and Adam can go out on social occasions with Adam where people know us, but these are to be when Mom needs a plus one. To the outside world it should appear as though Adam is there to accompany Mom in his capacity as my partner, so no staying over together anywhere we are likely to be known. Holidays should be in discreet locations, in places where our friends and neighbours are never likely to go. We certainly don't want anyone to know our business. Is that agreed?\"\n\n\"Definitely my dear\", said Colette formally and Adam nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Now the most important points and I'm sure that you will both agree with me on these. Firstly, when all three of us are together for dinner or whatever there shouldn't be any overt signs of affection between just two of us which would mean that the other person is left out. A kiss on the cheek or a quick hug is fine but nothing else. And secondly, activities in the bedroom are sacrosanct and are to be kept there. Everything else is to be open. Agreed?\"\n\nThey both quickly agreed to that and Rebecca moved on.\n\n\"Do either of you want to add to these points?\"\n\nColette looked deep in thought and then shook her head. \"No I don't think so my darling. It all sounds absolutely great from my point of view and I am so grateful to both of you for all of this. Adam, what about you?\"\n\n\"It all sounds well thought through, as I would expect from Rebecca. I take it the next steps are that Rebecca will write up her notes and then draw up a contract for all of us to sign?\"\n\n\"You cheeky bastard\", Rebecca said and they all laughed.\n\n\"So when does everything start?\" asked Adam.\n\n\"How about next Monday\", replied Rebecca. \"Are you both okay with that?\"\n\nColette and Adam looked at each other and both nodded.\n\n\"Good. Adam could you please pour me a glass of wine as I think we should have a toast to our future happiness, don't you?\"\n\nThey all stood up, raised their glasses and toasted their new relationships.\n\nChapter Five\n\nOn Monday morning Rebecca gave Adam a big and long sloppy kiss as she left for work.\n\n\"Are you nervous?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Well it is a completely new chapter in my life. In fact, it is a whole new world for all of us. So yes, I am a little nervous.\"\n\n\"Don't be. Just enjoy your life with us. I can't wait until you are back with me on Wednesday evening. We should always plan to do something special on Wednesdays. I will think of something this week and then we can alternate.\"\n\n\"That sounds good. I am going to miss you fluffy bunny.\"\n\n\"And I'm going to miss you biker boy. I love you so much for everything. I'll see you on Wednesday evening. Now kiss me and let me get to work.\"\n\nAdam gave her a lingering kiss and she left. He packed his bags, reminded himself that he should get some more toiletries as he would need a set of everything for both places, and drove to Colette's. He went to Amy's grave on the way to lay some fresh flowers and arrived just before noon. He let himself in and walked into the kitchen expecting her to be sat there at the breakfast bar, but she wasn't. He called her name and she shouted back that she was in the studio in the basement so he grabbed a coffee and wandered downstairs. Colette was sitting on her couch knitting. He went straight over to her, held up her jaw and then kissed her lightly on the lips.\n\n\"Ummm that was nice. It's a long time since anyone has done that.\"\n\nHe plonked himself down next to her on the couch.\n\n\"I've always said that you should start as you mean to go on. So what are your plans for the rest of the day?\"\n\n\"I do have to finish this special order that I'm knitting today as I have promised the buyer that I will send it this week. What about you?\"\n\n\"Well I do have to go to the mall to buy some toiletries. How would you like me to cook you dinner tonight?\"\n\n\"That sounds marvellous. You know that I eat anything so I will let you choose what to cook. Perhaps we can sit down together and watch a movie after dinner.\"\n\n\"That sounds an excellent plan. I'll shoot off and go to the shops. Is there anything you need?\"\n\n\"Only you Adam, and I can wait until tonight for that\", she said in a quiet voice.\n\nWith that she leaned over, opened her mouth and kissed him hard. Her tongue slipped into his mouth and lingered. He kissed her back and ran his hands through her hair. He could have made love to her there and then but he wanted it to be special for her on their real first night together so he pulled back.\n\n\"You are one sexy kisser. I can't wait for this evening. See you later.\"\n\nWith that he left her and drove to the mall. With all of his shopping completed he stopped at the flower stall on his way back and bought a huge bouquet for her. He also stopped at the liquor store and bought a bottle of vintage champagne. She was overwhelmed when he gave the bouquet to her and started to cry. Like the gentleman that he was, he pulled his handkerchief from his pocket to wipe her tears away and then opened his arms to hug her. She wrapped her arms around him and held him tight, not wanting to let go, enjoying the closeness that she had not felt for years.\n\n\"Why don't you go and have a nice relaxing bath and pamper yourself while I cook dinner. Would you like me to bring you up a glass of champagne?\"\n\n\"Now that sounds absolutely divine. Just come on up when you are ready.\"\n\nThe champagne had been in the chiller at the liquor store and he popped it into the freezer just to finish it off. He unpacked his shopping and put everything away and then prepared the salad. He wasn't a brilliant cook but both Amy and Rebecca had told him that he cooked a mean steak, so he had bought two large fillets and a readymade peppercorn sauce to go with it. He uncorked the champagne, poured her a glass and took it upstairs. He knocked on the door to her bathroom and walked in without waiting for her to answer. She was lying in a sea of bubbles in an enormous bath with her eyes closed and she opened them as he entered. Her long copper hair was wet and floating around her shoulders while her firm breasts were just showing through the bubbles. He knelt down by the side of the bath, handed her the glass of champagne and leaned over to kiss her.\n\n\"Would you like me to wash your back for you?\"\n\n\"That would be nice. Thank you. Of course, you could join me if you fancied?\"\n\nHe stripped off in front of her and, for the first time, she could see his naked body in an upright position. As Rebecca had told her, he was slim and muscular with a firm stomach and good shaped legs. His thick cock hung between his legs and she could see that he kept his pubic hair nice and short.\n\n\"If I get in behind you I can wash your back more easily.\"\n\nShe sat up and he stepped in behind her, putting his legs on either side of her. He picked up the bath sponge and soap and proceeded to gently wash her back. When he had finished rinsing her back he began to lather her breasts slowly going over one breast and then other. In order to rinse them off he held the sponge above her chest and let the hot water drop from a height so that it splashed down and cascaded over her hardening nipples. Once her breasts had been rinsed he leaned back and pulled her back into him. She closed her eyes and relaxed in the hot soapy water, nestled against the chest of a strong handsome man; something she thought she would never experience again in her life. They stayed locked together until the water began to cool.\n\n\"I suppose we should get out before we get cold\", he murmured, not really wanting to move but feeling that they ought to.\n\n\"I don't want to move\", she replied \"but I do need to wash my hair.\"\n\n\"Would you like me to do it for you? We can then rinse it off properly in the shower after.\"\n\n\"Now that really would be pampering me. Would you do that for me?\"\n\n\"Of course I would.\"\n\nShe slid down the bath to wet her hair again while he leaned across and grabbed a bottle of shampoo from the side. With her hair fully wet he poured shampoo over it and began to work his fingers into her scalp and then down the full length, gently cupping it into his hands before washing it.\n\n\"That is absolutely divine\", she cooed. \"I love my head being massaged.\"\n\nWith her hair washed he stepped out of the bath, walked across to the walk-in shower and turned the water on. After testing that it was the right temperature he came back to the bath, helped her out and they went into the shower together. He stood behind her, pulled out the attached shower head and began to rinse off the shampoo. When all the shampoo had gone he picked up a bottle of conditioner and massaged it into her hair before rinsing it for the final time. They stood facing each other in the shower with the water falling down on both of them. He pulled her body into his and began to kiss her mouth; slowly at first before she opened her lips fully and allowed him to push his tongue in. She sucked on it hungrily while moving her hands down towards his now fully erect cock that was pressing against her stomach. He turned her round and manoeuvred her against the wall where she cocked one leg and pulled his cock into the entrance of her soaking wet fanny. He pushed in right up to the hilt, bent down and lifted her allowing her to wrap her legs around his waist.\n\nTheir mouths were still crashing together and he stayed fully inside her, pushing his groin into hers. He held her under her arse and then turned around, switched off the shower and walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom. At the side of her bed he bent his knees and lowered her down onto it, moving with her as if they were conjoined. With her legs dangling over the side he began to move in and out slowly watching her face intently. Her eyes were closed and the tip of her tongue was wetting her lips before she pursed them together and ground herself into him with each of his inward strokes. It didn't take long for both of them to reach seismic orgasms and they came at practically the same time. He fell onto her and pumped as hard as he could into her while she clenched and released her vaginal muscles drawing every drop of his cum into her.\n\nWhen his cock had withered he drew himself out of her and they both crawled up to the top of the bed, pulled the quilt over them and lay wrapped in each other's arms. They must have both fallen asleep as when he woke up it was dark outside. The only light in the bedroom was coming from the bathroom. There was total silence apart from Colette's shallow breathing. He kissed her on the forehead and she stirred and nuzzled further into his chest.\n\n\"Do we have to get up?\" she asked quietly. \"I could stay here like this forever.\"\n\n\"So could I but your hair is still wet and I wouldn't want you to catch a chill. Would you like me to dry and brush it for you?\"\n\n\"Ummm. I would love that.\"\n\nShe crawled out of his arms and off the bed, put on a silk dressing gown, sat in front of her dressing table and picked up the hairdryer. He sat behind her on the bed and ran the brush that she had passed to him through her hair before turning on the hairdryer. Her hair was so thick that it took ages to dry it and, when he had finished, he spent ages just running the brush through it from the top of her head right the way down to the ends. She almost cooed with every brush stroke and he could see in the mirror that her eyes were closed as if in a trance. He stopped brushing after ten minutes and kissed her on the top of her head, smelling her freshly washed copper coloured hair.\n\n\"Shall I go and cook our steaks? I don't know about you but I am absolutely starving.\"\n\n\"Okay. I'll be down in a few minutes. Just need to freshen up my make-up and lip gloss that you have smudged.\"\n\nHe gathered up his clothes from the bathroom, put on his shorts, threw on his tee shirt and went downstairs. In the kitchen he found Colette's stash of Malbec wine, opened a bottle, poured a glass and took a big mouthful, rolling it around inside his mouth. \"Yummy\", he said to himself. He heated up the griddle, and then seasoned and put the steaks on before laying the table and putting the salad out. He took the bottle of champagne out from the fridge and put it in an ice bucket on the table alongside the bottle of Malbec. He turned the steaks, left them to cook for another two minutes and then took them off to rest. Colette still hadn't appeared downstairs so he went out into the hallway and shouted up that dinner would be five minutes.\n\nAs he was putting the steaks onto the plates he heard her come down the stairs.\n\n\"I hope you're hungry\", he said before turning round. \"Wow\", was all he could say when he saw her.\n\nShe was wearing a black and red silk basque with red ties down the front, a matching thong, black seam stockings, along with patent black stiletto open toe shoes. Covering her was a matching black lace robe with a red tie that was open, allowing him to see the whole ensemble. She twirled around to show him the back. Her hair seemed more copper in colour and fuller, her eye makeup was dark and her lip gloss was bright red.\n\nHis tongue was obviously hanging out as she laughed and said \"I get the distinct impression that you like what you see?\"\n\n\"Wow\", he said again. \"You look absolutely stunning.\"\n\n\"Well thank you kind sir\", she said as she sashayed across to the table and waited for him to pull her chair out so that she could sit down.\n\nHe ran to pull her chair out, took her hand before she sat and kissed the back of it. She sat down and he poured her a glass of champagne and refilled his own glass of wine. He then brought their steaks over and sat down himself before raising his glass.\n\n\"To us.\"\n\nShe raised her glass, clinked it against his.\n\n\"To us indeed, my darling. Thank you so much for this afternoon. You will never know how good I feel this evening. I am almost floating.\"\n\nHe blew her a kiss. \"It was my pleasure. And thank you.\"\n\nThey chatted casually over dinner, discussing his plans for the house and places they would like to travel to. After they had finished eating he served coffee and poured them both a glass of cognac.\n\n\"You remember what happened last time we drank cognac?\" she said with a big smirk.\n\n\"I do remember and I would like to repeat it. Only this time I promise that I will be lying next to you when you wake up.\"\n\n\"So, shall we finish our drinks and go to bed?\" she asked.\n\n\"I would love nothing better\", he replied drinking his remaining cognac.\n\nHe took her hand and led her up the stairs and into her bedroom. She had left the bedside lamps on and turned down the bed before going downstairs. He could see and smell a lightly scented candle burning on her dressing table. She took off the lacy robe and dropped it on the floor and laid down on the bed. He walked round to the other side, took off his tee shirt and shorts and got in, lying on his side next to her. She raised her hand and stroked his face and he leaned in and kissed her. The smell and taste of her bright red lip gloss was divine and the scent of her perfume was intoxicating. Slowly, he pulled the red silk bows that held her basque together slowly apart until they were all undone, pulled it aside and gazed at her firm round breasts.\n\n\"God. You have such beautiful breasts\", he breathed.\n\nHer aureoles were pink and the size of a silver dollar. Her nipples were a lighter pink and the size of a penny. As he lightly rubbed her breasts with the palm of his hand and then his lips her nipples became fully erect. He took one in his mouth, sucked on it and then stretched it with his teeth. He heard her gasp so he did the same with the other one and then moved his lips from her breasts and up to her neck. He planted light kisses from one ear down under her chin and up to her other ear. Whilst he kissed she ran her hands over his shoulders, up the back of his neck and through his hair. From her neck he ran his tongue back down to her breasts, around each nipple, under each breast, down her stomach and around her belly button.\n\nHe moved from her side to between her legs and ran his tongue up and down each leg, finishing at her groin each time. His used his finger and thumb to pull open her outer lips and slowly ran his tongue from the bottom to the top and then down the side of each lip. Her hand was grasping his hair and she ground her arse into the mattress pushing her fanny into his tongue which was beginning to fuck her. She spread and raised her legs to widen her opening allowing him fuller access. His tongue wound its way further in each time until his lips met hers where he sucked at her greedily. His tongue went in and out and then up and down until it hit her swollen clit. He flicked it and then sucked it; flicked and sucked, flicked and sucked. He could hear her breathing getting harder and deeper. She arched her back and came; grasping hold of the sheets tightly with one hand she used the other to push down on his head, not wanting him to move while she came again and again.\n\nNot able to move his head because of her hand pushing it down, he sucked and lapped her juices until she released him. He knelt up. She had her eyes closed and he could tell that she was still having small orgasms as her body twitched and both her hands were still grasping the sheets. He watched her until she finally lay still and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Was that okay?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"What do you think? I have never come like that before. I thought that Daniel was good at oral but he was nothing compared to you. Make love to me. I want to feel your gorgeous cock inside me.\"\n\nHe leaned down and guided his cock into her. She was totally wet but she still gasped as he entered her, feeling his girth push her lips to the side and his head work its way in. He moved slowly in and out and she wrapped her legs around him, almost pulling him in as far as he could go, not letting him escape. She pulled his head down to hers and their mouths latched together, tongues swirling against each other. He was a skilful lover and was able to control his speed and movement, bringing himself and her close to climax a number of times before they both finally came. His cum shot out into her and her legs and arms pulled him in as close as they could while her orgasms exploded through her whole body.",
        "As he had promised she woke the next morning to find herself still in his arms. They were on their sides locked together, one of his arms wrapped around her waist and his head against hers. She could feel his warm breath on the back of her neck. She lay there not moving, not wanting to wake him, savouring the feeling of waking up next to a man she loved once again. She felt him move and then felt kisses on the back of her neck.\n\n\"Good morning\", he whispered.\n\n\"Good morning to you\", she replied.\n\n\"Did you sleep well?\" he asked.\n\n\"The best sleep I have had for years and years. Mind you, I was pretty exhausted.\"\n\nHe nuzzled her ear. \"Well we'll have to get your stamina levels up with lots of practice, won't we?\"\n\nShe rolled out from his arms and lay on her side facing him.\n\n\"I do like the sound of lots of practice. However, I have to finish what I was doing yesterday so can we schedule in practice for later?\"\n\n\"Your wish is my command. I'll go and make some coffee and breakfast. See you downstairs.\"\n\nColette spent the morning sewing together the custom ordered sweater while Adam tidied the kitchen and the bedroom. Her customer had asked for some photographs of her wearing the sweater and the thigh high white leather stiletto boots that she had worn in some other photos. The sweater, which was actually more of a short dress than a sweater, was knitted in long white mohair with short sleeves and a tight short roll neck. She changed into it along with the boots, tied her hair back into a ponytail and applied some heavier makeup and lip gloss. Adam had setup the camera and lighting and decided to take some video of her while she was getting changed. She played up to the camera and did everything slowly and, Adam thought, quite erotically, continually looking into the lens and smiling. He zoomed in while she pulled the boots on and then zoomed back out to show her smoothing the dress down over her hips and arse. She wasn't wearing anything under the dress and he could distinctly see the curved shape of her breasts underneath the dress.\n\n\"You videoing me has reminded me that, with everything that has gone on recently, we have completely forgotten about finishing the videos that we started the other week\", she said. \"Maybe we should think about putting this one up on YouTube?\"\n\n\"Maybe we could make them even more erotic and then charge people to view them?\" he said tongue in cheek.\n\n\"Now that is an excellent idea.\"\n\n\"I was only joking. Do you want to be seen as a porn star and what would Rebecca say about it?\"\n\n\"We could always wear disguises like wigs and heavier makeup. I am getting quite turned on just thinking about it.\"\n\nWith that she started to massage her breasts and Adam could see her nipples start to enlarge. He grabbed the video camera and started to film as she left one hand stroking her breasts and the other hand slowly moving down and across her stomach until she got to the hem of the sweater whereupon she lifted it and began to rub her hand over her fanny. Adam zoomed in so that he could see her begin to insert one and then two fingers in. She had pulled the sweater down and held in between her thumb and index finger so that the fluffy mohair was in the same shot. She then pulled it down further and rubbed it over her fanny. The idea and the sensation must have been quite a turn on for Colette as it didn't take long for her to climax. Adam panned out to get a full view of her standing there climaxing and then zoomed in to video her face showing the ecstasy. She had thrown her head back, her eyes were closed and her tongue was writhing around her lips. After a minute or so she stood upright, ran her hands through her hair and smiled at the camera.\n\n\"Is that the sort of thing that would sell?\" she asked.\n\n\"I should think so. I have a fucking huge hard on. Mind you, the first time I really admitted to myself that I fancied you was when I saw you wearing a turquoise sweater and long black boots. You were standing in front of the full length mirror in your bedroom and I spied you from the bathroom. You did exactly what you did earlier and ran your hands down over your hips and arse. I got such a hard on then.\"\n\n\"I know that you were watching me you know. I started to tease you, hoping that you would come and take me, but you didn't. If you knew then what you know now, would you have fucked me there and then?\"\n\n\"Good god yes.\"\n\n\"Would you like to fuck me now wearing this dress and the boots?\"\n\n\"You fucking bet I would.\"\n\nShe turned around and walked over to the chaise longue where she laid down, pulled the dress up and opened her legs.\n\n\"Well come on over here and fuck me then.\"\n\nHe didn't need any further invitation. He practically ran over while pulling his clothes off and dived between her legs. His cock was still fully erect and he found her fanny already moist and welcoming as he drove into her. This was not gentle love making but raw, unadulterated, animalistic sex. He ground into her hard and fast while she wrapped her legs around him and raked her long finger nails down his back and into the cheeks of his arse, pulling him into her, wanting to feel every inch of his engorged cock. As they described it to each other later; they fucked and they fucked hard and long enjoying every second of it. Their guttural moans and groans of ecstasy were eclipsed with screams of pleasure as they both came; he first followed shortly after by her.\n\nThe lay wrapped together on the chaise longue, his head buried into her chest feeling the softness and fuzziness of the mohair on his cheek and his lips; Colette running her fingers slowly through his hair. They were both exhausted. Her fanny was sore and she felt well and truly fucked. His cock felt like it had been stretched and pulled every which way and his back and arse were as sore as hell from her fingernails digging into them. Their panting had died down but their hearts were still beating fast.\n\n\"That was\", she said and paused looking for the most descriptive word she could think of.\n\n\"Raw passion?\" he said finishing off her words for her.\n\n\"Yes I think that's a good description. I don't think that I have ever been fucked like that before.\"\n\n\"Nor have I\", he said. \"Not that I am complaining. Far from it.\"\n\nThey must have drifted off to sleep as, when she woke up, she looked at the clock on the wall and it was after 7pm. She shook his shoulder to wake him and he bolted upright. His hair was all over the place and the right side of his face was red and marked where he had laid on her chest. She laughed.\n\n\"I hope you haven't drooled on or got cum on this sweater. I was intending to mail it to the customer today but it's now too late and I am going to have to check it thoroughly before I box it up and send it tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Well if you have, you'll have to knit another one and keep this one. Seeing you dressed like that certainly had an effect on me.\"\n\nShe smirked. \"Well maybe I will have to knit something else that you'll like and get you all fired up again.\"\n\n\"Maybe we should christen every sweater before you send them to the customer? I bet most people buying them would appreciate the gesture.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I don't think that every one of my customers has a mohair fetish. Maybe just a large percentage. Anyway, everyone to their own. I don't suppose you imagined being turned on by a woman wearing a fluffy mohair sweater or cardigan a year ago did you?\"\n\n\"No I didn't but I have to admit there is something very erotic about the right sweater on a beautiful woman. Luckily for me I have two beautiful women who like to wear them.\"\n\nColette cooked them dinner and, after eating, they laid on the sofa in the lounge watching a movie until it was time for bed. Neither of them was up for making love so they cuddled together and fell asleep. The following morning they woke up late, made love, showered together and then went downstairs to make coffee and brunch. Adam left around 2pm as he had an appointment at his house with a realtor who was going to market it for sale. Just before he stepped out of Colette's front door she grabbed hold of him, pushed him against the door and kissed him passionately.\n\n\"I can't wait to see you tomorrow. I love you so much\", she said as she let go of him and he gasped for air.\n\n\"I love you as well my sexy little knitter. I'll see you tomorrow morning.\"\n\nColette had boxed up the sweater for her customer and so, on his way to meet the realtor, he stopped at the post office to mail it. He photographed the international tracking slip and texted it to her so that she could let her customer know that the order was on its way. He received a text back almost instantaneously thanking him and telling him how much she loved him.\n\nThe realtor told him not to make any changes to the house as potential buyers would have their own ideas and anything he did before it was sold would have no added value. The realtor believed that it would sell quickly at her recommended price so Adam signed the necessary paperwork there and then. Amy had loved the house and it was their home when she was alive and Adam had thought long and hard about selling it, but knew that it was time to do so and was necessary to finance the building of his and Rebecca's house. Amy had always been a pragmatic person and would have agreed with his rationale for selling and, knowing that he would always have the memories of their life together in their home, that it was the right thing to do. The house had been his world with his beautiful and wonderful Amy before she had died. She was gone from this world but would remain in his heart for ever. He now had two beautiful and wonderful women who were making a new world and life for him and whom he loved passionately.\n\nJust before he headed off back to the city he texted Rebecca to tell her that he was on his way home and received one back almost immediately, like she had been waiting for him to contact her. Her text was short and simple.\n\n\"Your fluffy bunny can't wait to see you biker boy. I love you so much. XXXXXX\".\n\nHe knew that she was going to make their evening very memorable and so replied to her.\n\n\"I love you so much as well fluffy bunny and can't wait to see you. XX\".\n\nHe smiled to himself. Adam loved his new life and his new world.\n\nTHE END"
