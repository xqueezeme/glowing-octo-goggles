        "Author's Note: I apologize for the lengthy delay in this chapter. My schedule has been packed lately and it's been hard to devote time to writing, but, rest assured, I have no intentions of abandoning this story. I thank you all for your patience. \n\n***\n\nAt lunch the next day, Janice stood by herself in the cafeteria, waiting in line for her plate to be served. She distractedly stared at the flecks of dandruff on the shoulder of the man's suit jacket standing in front of her. Her mind was far away, still in bed with Matt, feeling his enormous cock filling her beyond capacity. She could feel warmth spreading to her loins as memories of Matt's body against hers repeated on a mental loop, interrupted in intervals by the image of Bobby's smiling face, which was accompanied by a wave of sickening guilt. \n\nThe line moved forward. Every shift of weight on her legs reminded her of the tender soreness of her pussy. She bit her lip, coming to relish the pain, despite her remorse. \n\nJust then, Kendra approached Janice, who was standing in front of the server station with her back turned. \n\n\"Damn, girl!\" exclaimed Kendra, admiring Janice's posterior. \"I can already see all those stairs doin' your booty good! Look at that bubble butt!\"\n\nKendra playfully swatted Janice's backside lightly as she sidled close beside her. Janice let out a pained \"Yip!\" sound when she felt the amplified soreness blossoming from the love pat. \n\nKendra's eyes looked concerned at Janice. \"Whoa! You ok?\"\n\n\"Yep!\" Janice said a little too quickly and a little too loudly. \n\n\"No you aren't!\" Kendra retorted. \"What's gotten... into you...?\" Her eyes grew wide looking up at Janice's reddening face. \n\n\"No, you didn't!\" Kendra gasped in joy. She grabbed Janice's arm, hugging it tightly. \"Oh shit! YOU DID!!\"\n\n\"Sssshh!\" exclaimed Janice to Kendra, looking bashfully up at the attendant who was placing a serving on her lunch tray.\n\nKendra hurried Janice to the end of the line and then practically chased her to a table in the corner.\n\nKendra bent forward once she had been seated. \"Oh my god! You total slut!!\" she whispered to Janice, who was lowering herself gingerly to the hard surfaced chair. \n\n\"Gee... thanks for reminding me.\" Janice grumbled. \n\nKendra grinned. \"Anytime! Oh! By the way... Sit on a bag of frozen peas for awhile and your pussy'll feel a lot better.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" said Janice toying with her food, distracted. \n\n\"So!? He's fucking great, right?\" Kendra said, excitedly. \n\nJanice nodded. \"Matt was better than great! He was... a revelation, really.\" she said, calmly. \n\nKendra watched her friend continue to flick her food around on her plate for several silent moments. She furrowed her brow. \"Really!?\" Kendra admonished.\n\n\"What?\" said Janice, blinking. \n\n\"You're feeling some kind of way over there.\" Kendra said raising an open palm, pretending to sense Janice's aura. \"You worried about your lawyer boo, ain't you?\"\n\nJanice pouted. \"I... I don't know. Yes... but... it's also me! I'm officially a cheater now.\"\n\n\"Uhhh... to be honest, girl... you crossed that line a LONG time ago.\" Kendra chuckled. \n\nJanice sighed, her eyes cast downward to her plate. Kendra paused and sympathetically reached over to take Janice's hand. \"You know... people cheat for pretty much the same reason every time: they feel unfulfilled with what they got. So, it's no wonder you strayed, really. From what I've seen, your guy's 'boyfriend game' has been slacking for so long, that it just became his new 'normal'. You don't deserve that! You need something more!\"\n\n\"You know... he'd leave me if he ever found out.\" Janice said, quietly attempting to prevent her voice from shaking. \n\n\"So what if he did? What are you losing?\"\n\nJanice looked up into her friend's eyes. A mix of confusion and fear swam through Janice's mind. \"I... Bobby is... \" she stuttered. \" He hasn't always been like he is now. He used to be wonderful. I actually fell in love with him in the beginning. He used to be so charming... he used to be proud that I was his...\"\n\n\"'Used to be'... 'used to be'\" Kendra parroted. \"What about now?\"\n\n\"Now?\" Janice fell silent. \"Well... he's all I've really ever known. It's scary to picture my life without him. He says he's gonna protect me. He says that I'm 'not equipped' to handle the real world without him.\"\n\n\"Psshh!\" Kendra exclaimed, rearing back in her seat. \"Besides that being the biggest pile of BULLSHIT ever... Have you seen how much our new jobs will be paying us?!\"\n\nJanice shook her head, slowly. \n\nKendra quickly took out a pen and scrawled a four digit number on a nearby napkin and slid it across the table. \n\nJanice peered over to look. \"What? Is this every month?\"\n\n\"Every week!\" Kendra grinned. \n\nJanice gasped. \"Are you fucking serious!?\"\n\n\"Yes, girl!\" Kendra giggled. \"So... you see: you can be just fine on your own.\" \n\nJanice easily calculated the amount scrawled on the napkin could not only cover her entire month's rent, but Matt's portion as well.\n\n\"Well, that's... something!\" Janice blinked, feeling like her breath had been pushed out of her. \n\n\"Indeed it fucking is!\" smiled Kendra, stabbing a lettuce leaf in her salad bowl. \n\nShe winked. \"You know... you and your fine ass, up n' 'cumming' fuck buddy could be a sexy lil' power couple... if you two made it official. I mean, you gotta admit, y'all are perfect for each other. Y'all been living this whole time in some peaceful-ass harmony shit! I bet you and him ain't even had an argument, for jeeb's sake!\"\n\nJanice blinked, thinking back. \".No...not even a disagreement.\"\n\n\"SEE!?\" Kendra exclaimed. \n\nJanice felt flustered. \"I... I don't know. Matthew is perfect, but... his job... three months from home! Really!?\" she cried. \"I mean, is this gonna be a normal thing? Is he going to be gone all the time? Am I going to only be able to see him for a few months out of the year? I don't want that!\"\n\n\"It's just a job!\" Kendra scoffed. \"Besides... he could always just quit and become a pornstar!\" \n\nJanice didn't join in Kendra's loud laughter at the table. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter lunch, Janice sauntered back to her small office cubicle. A picture of Bobby's smiling face that had been pinned to her wall greeted her when she took a seat. \n\nJanice couldn't bring herself to meet his eyes, even in a photograph. She quickly peeled a blank Post-It note off its stack and stuck the paper over Bobby's naive grin. \n\n\"You've got to do something, girl.\" Janice whispered to herself. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJanice soon found herself walking up the stairs towards her apartment. Turning the corner of the second flight, she paused to sniff the aroma wafting through the air. \n\n\"That smells delicious! Wherever it's coming from.\" Janice mused. Her belly grumbled in agreement. She had been too distracted to eat but only a few bites of her lunch today with Kendra. \n\nTrudging up the final flight towards her door, the aroma only intensified. Janice's mouth was watering in anticipation. She unlocked the front door and walked into the dining room, greeted by the obvious source of the aroma, as well as sounds of light jazz music from the stereo beneath bubbling of pots and the sight of a beautiful bouquet of flowers arranged in a vase on the table. Candles were lit in various places all over the dining room and living room. \n\n\"Oh my...\" exclaimed Janice, amazed. \n\nMatt's head popped up from behind the open refrigerator door. \"Oh! Hi! You're home! Hope you're hungry.\"\n\nJanice's mouth hung open as she inspected the stove. \"You... you're making homemade clam chowder!\"\n\n\"Yep! The lobster tails and asparagus are almost done.\"\n\nJanice's eyes went wide. \"That's... my favorite meal! How... how did you know?\"\n\nMatt's eyes sheepishly met hers. \"I texted your Mom... I hope you don't mind.\"\n\nJanice laughed lightly. \"Of course not!\" She spun around, talking in the peaceful, romantic mood of the apartment. \"Oh, Matt! Everything is so beautiful! Why... what inspired you to do this?\"\n\nMatt smiled, walking towards her. \"I just couldn't stop thinking...\" His hands reached out and held hers gently. \"Last night was... it was... \"\n\n\"Incredible...\" they both said, simultaneously.\n\nThey smiled into each other's eyes. Janice stepped forward into his arms. \"You didn't have to go through all this trouble just to get laid again, you know?\" she winked at him before placing a peck on his lips. \"... it just probably won't be tonight... I'm still kinda sore.\"\n\nMatt blinked. \"Oh... sorry about that... but, I wasn't expecting anything in return from any of this.\" \n\nA timer on his phone sounded out. Matt quickly stepped towards the oven, donning his thick oven mitts. Opening the door, he retrieved a pan holding two, perfectly done lobster tails. \n\nThe savory aroma filled the room. \"I just felt that you deserved some appreciation for... well, just being you... and this is how I show it, I guess.\" Matt said, fidgeting with his mitts. \n\nJanice blushed, feeling her heart flutter for a moment. She didn't have words to properly respond. \"I... uh...\"\n\nJust then, her phone rang in her purse. Inspecting the screen, she saw it was Bobby again. Janice blanched, her throat suddenly feeling dry. \n\n\"I'm sorry, Matt.\" Janice croaked, walking hurriedly past him to her bedroom. \"I'll try to make this quick.\"\n\nWith her door shut, Janice took a deep breath and answered the call. \n\n\"He... hello?\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Bobby? Are... you there?\"\n\n\"Just tell me the truth...\" Bobby said, softly. \n\nJanice gulped. \"The truth...?\"\n\n\"You forgot the fucking 'Thank You' cards again! RIGHT!?\" he barked. \n\nJanice had indeed forgotten all about them. She knew the ensuing tirade was imminent and that she absolutely could not deal with it at that moment. Without even a forethought, Janice suddenly found herself shouting into the phone. \n\n\"I WANT A BREAK FROM YOU!!\"\n\nShe heard nothing in response. Seconds ticked by. Then a soft voice. \"A- a break? R-really?\"\n\nJanice sighed. \"I... I just need-\"\n\n\"How much further apart do we have to be!?\" Bobby chuckled. \n\n\"Bobby, I-\"\n\n\"Wow... you have no idea how hard you are fucking up right now, do you?\" his mocking laughter rang out, his voice increasing in volume. \"I swear, I should just let you do this... just so I can watch you fall flat on your helpless face...if that's even possible with your ridiculous tits.\" Bobby's voice was now shouting through the speaker. \"Go on! But let me tell you: your mom had it easy compared where you'll be ending up! See you when you come crawling back, bitch!\"\n\nA click and then silence. \n\nJanice stood alone in the middle of her room. She was scared that the weightless feeling she was experiencing might actually be a metaphysical free fall; now that her proverbial magic carpet had suddenly been whisked from beneath her feet for the first time since she could remember. Or... it could be the inexplicable feeling of elation that had attached to her sense of newfound freedom. \n\nJanice's feet barely felt like they were touching the floor as she slowly stepped back in to the dining room. Matt had two delicious, steaming plates placed before a beautiful setting. He stood near the table smiling with a wine glass in each hand. \n\nMatt stepped forward, extending a glass of white wine towards her. Janice eagerly walked towards him, grasping the glass and before Matt could offer a toast, he watched Janice down the entire glass in one go. \n\nMatt blinked, somewhat amazed. He silently reached over to the wine bottle to pour her another. \n\n\"Sorry...\" Janice said, wiping her mouth with her arm. She held out her glass beneath the bottle until it was nearly full. \n\nMatt replaced the bottle and cleared his throat. \"It's ok. These walls are kinda thin... so I couldn't help hearing you shout in there. Are you ok?\"\n\nJanice took a deep breath. \"Yeah... Bobby and I are... taking a little break from each other.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Matt said as he blinked. \"I... I'm sorry.\"\n\nJanice had a serene smile as she looked up, meeting Matt's eyes. \"It's ok. Everything is going to be just fine.\"\n\nShe leaned forward and gave Matt a soft kiss on his lips. \n\n\"By the way...\" said Janice. \"Do we have any frozen peas?\" \n\n\"Y- yeah... we do.\" Matt said, confused, then his eyes grew wide. \"Oh, no! You didn't want asparagus, did you? It's ok! I'll make you peas really quick!\" he said, rushing to the freezer to retrieve a bag. \n\n\"No! No! Everything is perfect, Matty!\" Janice exclaimed. \"I want to sit on them.\"\n\nMatt's brow furrowed, still confused. \"We... have cushions.\"\n\nJanice had to laugh. \"It's to cool down my poor pussy that you beat up with that huge dick of yours!\"\n\nMatt slapped his forehead. \"Oh! Duh! Sorry.\"\n\nHe handed her the cold bag and sat down across from her. Janice winced slightly at the sudden chill when her tender crotch lowered onto the bag. Soon, the relieving cool was relaxing her inflamed vagina, pleasantly. \n\n\"Dig in!\" said Matt, grabbing his fork. \n\n\"Wait!...\" Janice exclaimed. She raised her glass to toast with Matt. He smiled, raising his glass in response. \n\n\"To you, Matty...\" she said, gazing lovingly in to his widening eyes. \"Thank you...\"\n\nMatt chuckled as their glasses clinked together. \"It's nothing.\" he said, blushing. He felt Janice's hand grasp his suddenly from across the table. He looked up to see her eyes filling with tears through her smile. \n\n\"It's everything!\" her shaking voice answered. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDinner was delicious. Janice was delighted by the nostalgia she experienced with every bite. \n\n\"This was a huge favorite of mine when I was a LITTLE little kid!\" she said, relishing the aroma of the thick chowder. \"We... uhh, didn't see much of it after my dad...\" Janice's words hesitated to silence. \n\nMatt quietly spoke. \"When your Mom came to visit she told me about what happened... I'm very sorry for you loss, Janice.\"\n\nShe cast her eyes up to his sympathetic expression. \"Thank you, Matty. After... that, Mom, Tracy and I went from not having a want for anything... to only owning the clothes on our back... in the span of a weekend!\"\n\nMatt took a sharp intake of breath, imaging the sea change Janice must have endured at such an impressionable age. \n\n\"Needless to say...\" Janice continued. \"The times I was able to see this dish again since then have TRULY been special occasions... and that's including this one.\" \n\nTheir eyes held each other in a loving gaze. Janice shifted her weight in her chair. This time the pain between her legs was overtaken by the stimulated tingling of desire. Her panties were soaked, of course, both from the thawing freezer bag she was perched upon and from her soaking wet vagina. \n\n\"Hope you left room for dessert!\" said Matt, winking. \n\n\"Dessert?! Did my Mom tell you that too?\"\n\nMatt nodded his head, excitedly. \n\nJanice's eyes grew wider than Matt had ever seen. \"Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake!?\"\n\n\"...and Rocky Road ice cream.\" Matt smiled, excitedly. \n\nJanice gasped, playfully fainting in her chair. She flailed her limbs, moaning loudly, pretending to have an orgasm. \n\n\"Oh, geeze...\" she exclaimed, lifting her self back upright into her seat. \"Yeah... you're getting laid tonight.\"\n\n\"Seriously...\" Matt held up his hands. \"You aren't obligated to do anything. Plus, I don't want to hurt you if you're not ready.\"\n\nJanice laughed, reaching for the bag beneath her. \"This bag knows I'm ready! These peas aren't just thawed out... they're cooked!\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJanice moaned, loudly. \"Holy fuck, baby!\" she couldn't help herself from exuberant exclamation. \"This... might actually be better than sex!\"\n\nJanice scraped up every morsel of cheesecake with her fork, leaving no trace on her plate. \n\nThe two slouched back in their chairs, feeling satisfied. Janice's outstretched leg rubbed softly against Matt's thigh underneath the table. \n\n\"You've outdone yourself, Matty.\" Janice sighed. \"That was wonderful!\"\n\n\"My pleasure, beautiful.\"\n\nJanice looked down and noticed she was still wearing her work attire. She smiled to herself. \n\n\"So... Want to keep me company while I take a shower?\"\n\nA grin quickly spread across Matt's face. He nodded, eagerly. \n\nJanice smiled, standing to her feet. Matt noted for the first time this evening how sharp and professional she looked in her dark, button down dress blouse and modest, grey business skirt. \n\n\"I'm too full to undress myself!\" Janice moaned, through a playful pout. \n\n\"Allow me!\" Matt exclaimed, practically leaping to his feet. \n\nJanice giggled, embracing his body against hers. They kissed, slow and sincere. \n\nJanice felt her top button loosen, then her second, then third. She placed her hands on Matt's shoulders and lowered him down to the chair, so he could finish the task at eye level with her astoundingly large breasts. \n\nMatt reached up and continued unbuttoning Janice's blouse, allowing a line of deep cleavage to appear in view, encased in a beige brassiere. The final button was undone. Janice arched her back, pushing her enormous tits forward, creating a surging bulge of breast meat over the top edge of the struggling bra cups. \n\n\"Isn't this the same bra she just got a couple months ago?\" Matt thought to himself. \"Wow! She's already bursting out of it!\" he gasped, watching the bottoms of Janice's huge tits begin to spill out of the lower hem. \n\n\"Get me out of this thing... please, baby.\" breathed Janice, seductively. \n\nMatt grasped her hips and gently moved her closer to him. Her breasts crowded his face as he reached behind her back and released the hook clamps of her bra. \n\nJanice grinned as she reached up and held the large beige cups against her soft, jiggling globes. Matt watched her lift the bra, along with her huge breasts slowly above his head. His eager eyes watched her giant tits ooze, deliciously out of her brassiere, then fall, like an avalanche of breast meat tumbling across his ginning face. \n\nMatt relished the feeling of her gorgeous softness billowing against mouth and cheeks. His hands massaged the unending field of smooth skin, kissing along the pink lines of irritation created from her restrictive undergarment. Janice bit her lip, her senses heightened from his passionate adoration of her body. \n\nShe reached behind her and unzipped her skirt. The garment slid, with brief difficulty, over her butt and fell to the floor. Matt's hands glided down her torso to her hips, where his fingers dove beneath the hem of her black panties. Matt continued to sensually kiss Janice's areola as he guided her panties down her legs to the floor. \n\nJanice stepped out of the pile of clothes at her feet and stood back from Matt. \"Follow me, baby.\"\n\nJanice led Matt by the hand to her bathroom, where she activated the hot water in the glass shower stall. She gently nudged Matt down to a seated position on the closed toilet lid across from the glass shower. \n\nStepping inside the stall, Janice began rinsing her naked body in the streaming warm water. Matt's eyes glazed over in a trance watching rivulets of water glide down Janice's sumptuous curves. \n\nMatt's dick was stiff with aroused appreciation. He held his breath, watching Janice pour liquid body wash from a bottle onto her gathered tits. She licked her lips, seductively for Matt as she began rubbing the soapy wash all over her gigantic, cream colored mounds. \n\nJanice then leaned forward, pressing her wet breasts against the glass wall. Matt gasped in amazement as her massive volume spread across glass surface, blooming in all directions with spectacular roundness. Matt had to stop himself from getting up from his seat and licking the glass where her perfect areolas were pressed. \n\n\"Jesus! You are so fucking hot, baby!\" Matt breathed, fidgeting in his seat. \n\nJanice giggled. \"I can see that you like this A LOT!\" Her hands massaged the outer edges of her expanded breast mass. ",
        "She quietly continued to rub the sudsy liquid over her entire body. When her hands dipped between her legs, Janice cast her eyes up at Matt. A naughty smile crept across her face as her knee turned outward and her leg swung wide, exposing her pink pussy lips. With both her hands, one from the front and the other reaching from behind, Janice rubbed her vagina, gently and sensually. Matt had a hard time swallowing, watching her delicate fingers dancing with her delicious clitoris. \n\n\"Does it look like I'm ready, baby?\" Janice cooed. \"Does my little pussy look ready for your big, hard cock again, baby?\"\n\n\"It looks ready!\" said Matt. \"...but, I think I should kiss it for good measure.\"\n\n\"Oh! Most definitely! I'll never say 'no' to one of your special kisses.\" Janice said, stroking her labia. \"Why don't you get undressed and I'll meet you in my bed after I dry off in here.\"\n\nMatt grinned to himself in eager anticipation, leaving the bathroom and making the rounds through the dining and living room, quickly, seeing to extinguishing the lit candles. \n\nMatt then returned to the bedroom and undressed. Bubsy cat was mildly annoyed to be roused from his slumber upon Janice's blanketed bed as Matt took a seat beside him. He pet the stretching feline who responded by quickly hopping from the bed towards his litter box. \n\nMatt heard the water from the shower cease as he climbed, naked beneath Janice's bedsheets. \n\n\"I'm feeling SO much better now than I did earlier today.\" Janice called out from the bathroom. From the bed, Matt could see a shadow cast from the bathroom light revealing a female form rubbing a large towel over her enticing curves. \"I sure hope you're ready!\"\n\nMatt chuckled, regarding the tented bedsheet at his midsection. \"Oh, don't worry, baby! I'm always ready for you!\"\n\nJanice stepped out the bathroom, naked. She flicked off the bathroom and bedroom lights, leaving only the soft, amber glow of her rock salt lamp. \n\nMatt turned down the bedsheets to allow her entrance beside him. As Janice approached, she suddenly realized that the waves of guilt over Bobby had ceased, long ago. Her nipples stiffened in arousal, looking at Matt's enormous dick peeking out from beneath the fold of her bed covers. A smile spread across her lips as she practically leapt into bed on top of Matt. \n\nMatt barely had time to gasp before he found his head swimming in soft, heavy breast flesh. He felt Janice's wet pussy sliding against the solid shaft of his erection. \n\nMatt's arms wrapped around her body, pulling himself deeper into her bountiful cleavage. \n\nJanice squealed with delight feeling her body being pressed against him. \n\n\"Kiss me, baby!\" she breathed. \"Give me that special kiss I love so much!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" Matt attempted to say with his lips stretched across Janice's areola, which ended up sounding more like a drowning cry for help. \n\nJanice flipped on to her back and spread her legs, eagerly. Matt repositioned himself on all fours, his head close to her glistening pussy. \"Do you like a little teasing down here?\" Matt smiled, placing kisses gently around the inside of her thighs. \n\nJanice looked down at him from between her piled breasts. \"You do everything I want, baby! I swear, it's like you're reading my mind!\"\n\nMatt's confidence level swelled inside as he continued to kiss her vagina tenderly, gradually increasing pressure and duration. When his tongue joined the fray in massaging Janice's most sensitive flower, she began moaning loudly. \n\n\"Oh my god! You're so good, baby!\" she cried. \n\nMatt occupied his hands by reaching up and massaging Janice's enormous, soft breasts. Her nipples went rigid in between his fingers the same time her clitoris went rigid in his mouth as an orgasm flooded her senses. \n\nMatt continued to suck and lick Janice's pussy long enough for several more orgasms to tear through her. She was gasping for air when Matt finally raised himself up, wiping his chin. \n\n\"Oh my god, I'm ready to fuck you right now!\" Janice growled, catching her breath. \n\nHe felt her hand grab his shaft and guide his wide mushroom head between the folds of her labia. Janice bit her lip as he bore down, sliding his thick cock into her vagina. \n\n\"Oh... fuck!!\" she exclaimed, breathing hard, after a few inches had entered her. \n\n\"Are you ok?\" Matt asked, ceasing his forward motion. \n\n\"Yes!\" Janice cried. \"Keep going! All the way!\" \n\nMatt tilted his hips forward and slid his cock all the way into Janice's vagina. \n\nShe gasped, feeling her cervix being nudged and her entire vaginal cavity completely stuffed. \n\n\"Don't be afraid to fuck me good, baby!\" Janice breathed, her eyes fixed on Matt's. \"I want you, Matty!\"\n\n\"Oh, Janice!\" Matt cried, burying his face in her neck as he began thrusting his cock back and forth into her. \n\nJanice screamed in ecstatic elation feeling the rushing blasts of her orgasms wracking her body. Matt exhibited enough willpower to avoid cumming too quickly, but when he began staring, hypnotized at Janice's undulating tits sloshing back and forth in tandem with his hips, he couldn't stop his balls from producing that familiar tingle; the preamble to an orgasm. \n\n\"Oh god...\" Matt croaked. \n\n\"Cum inside me!\" Janice cried. \"Please! Give it all to me!\"\n\nMatt's legs began shaking as he felt the release of his seed shoot forth into Janice's wet snatch. \n\nJanice could feel his warmth pulsating inside her, triggering an instant orgasm of her own. \n\nThe two loudly moaned in ecstasy together. Matt stayed inside her while they caught their breath. After a few moments, he gingerly removed himself from her. Janice gasped, feeling the vacancy inside. \n\n\"Wow! I guess I'm feeling much better!\" exclaimed Janice as Matt slumped onto his back beside her. \"I'm ready for more! ...Is that bad?\"\n\n\"That's not bad at all!\" answered Matt with a chuckle. \"I just need a minute for the ol' batteries to recharge.\" \n\n\"Take your time, honey.\" Janice cooed, rolling over towards him, splaying her giant tits across his chest. \"We're gonna have fun all night!\""
