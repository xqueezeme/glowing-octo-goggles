        "Chapter 4 The Conclusion.\n\nBy woodmanone  copyright August 2010\n\n***********************\n\nDillon faded in and out of consciousness. One time he felt he was lying on a hard surface but could feel it moving. The next time he was on something soft and felt someone applying a cool wet cloth to his forehead. \n\nFinally he fought his way back from the darkness; he was on a big bed in a room that he didn't recognize. He tried to sit up and was rewarded with a shooting pain in his neck. Dillon fell back and moaned. Damn that hurts, he thought.\n\nThe door opened and he saw Oso entering the bedroom. \"How are you amigo? You look better than when we brought you here.\"\n\n\"Hola,\" Dillon replied and then asked, \"Where am I and who brought me here? \"\n\nOso smiled, \"You're at the Triple E ranch outside Prescott. Senorita Elizabeth insisted that you be brought here until you recover.\"\n\nThe door opened again and an older woman entered. \"I see you've rejoined the living Mr. Gallagher. How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Aside from a sore neck and a small headache I'm well ma'am.\"\n\nAt the questioning look from Dillon she added, \"Where are my manners? I'm Eleanor Edwards and this is our home.\" She walked over to him. \"Let me have a look,\" Mrs. Edwards said helping Dillon to sit up. She inspected the back of his head and added, \"The swelling has gone down and the bleeding has stopped. I think you'll be just fine Mr. Gallagher.\"\n\nDillon leaned his back against the headboard and his head began to clear. He looked at Mrs. Edwards and could see where Elizabeth got her eye color and the shape of her face. Her hair was dark brown worn in a French bun. Mrs. Edwards was about 5' 6 and more solidly built than her daughter but still trim. \n\nDillon knew she had to be close to forty to have a daughter as old as Elizabeth but Mrs. Edwards looked to be in her early thirties at most. Her confidence and manner reminded him of Emma in some ways.\n\nThe door burst open and Ethan charged into the room. \"Hi ya Dillon, glad you're awake,\" the boy said in a loud voice. Ethan was typical of most twelve year olds. He was full of energy and had a difficult time standing still. But there was a sadness around the eyes that surprised Dillon. \n\nEthan had the same auburn hair as his sister; his eyes were brown and lively. He was tall for his age with large hands; must take after his father Dillon thought. Ethan will be taller than me when he gets his full growth.\n\nFollowing at a slower pace, Elizabeth joined the group. She gave Dillon a little smile. \"Thank you for helping Oso Mr. Gallagher. It could have gotten very ugly.\" \n\nDillon returned her smile but before he could respond Mrs. Edwards remarked, \"It seems you're making a habit of coming to our families rescue Mr. Gallagher.\" Eleanor's manner of speaking showed that she was an educated woman. \"Our own personal Sir Galahad. I understand that you also quote poetry,\" she said with a grin. \"Lord Byron I believe it was.\"\n\nReturning her grin with a sheepish smile Dillon replied, \"It's a nasty habit I picked up in school. Sometimes I can't help myself.\"\n\n\"Oso said you quoted a verse and told him it was a poem. All he could remember was 'She walks in beauty like the night', Elizabeth said.\n\nEmbarrassed Dillon looked at Oso with a little frown. \"I didn't realize that I spoke aloud. I'm sorry if it offended you Miss Edwards.\"\n\nElizabeth blushed a little and replied, \"Not at all Mr. Gallagher. With Mother's help I looked up the poem; it's very flattering. Thank you.\"\n\nDillon smiled at Elizabeth's blush and turned to Mrs. Edwards. \"Ma'am you said that I was a knight, might this knight request a boon from Milady?\" Eleanor smiled and nodded. \"Could y'all call me Dillon? This Mr. Gallagher stuff makes me feel old.\"\n\n\"My son is already using your given name; I suppose it would be all right for the rest of us too. But you must return the favor, Sir Knight.... Dillon,\" Eleanor smiled and replied. \"Now if you're up to it, get dressed and I'll feed you a ranch breakfast.\"\n\nFor the first time Dillon realized he was wearing a night shirt and not his normal clothes. Now it was his turn to blush. He nodded and the ladies and Ethan left the room; Oso waited to see if Dillon needed help.\n\n\"Who undressed me Oso?\"\n\nOso had a grin on his face and said, \"Well, Senorita Elizabeth....\" He stopped and his grin got bigger at the look on Dillon's face. \"Ni\u00f1a told me to put you in one of her father's nightshirts. I undressed you amigo.\"\n\n\"Very funny Oso, very funny,\" Dillon replied pretending to be upset with the big man. Then a grin spread across his face and gave him away. \"How long have I been here?\"\n\n\"Our adventure was on Saturday and today is Tuesday my friend. You've been fading in and out of it for three days.\" Oso looked at Dillon for about five seconds, his face grew more serious and said, \"Now I have a question for you. Why did you help me? I'm glad that you did, but why?\"\n\nDillon scratched his head and continued to get dressed. As he pulled on his boots he answered, \"I guess I've always had a soft spot for an underdog.\" Looking at Oso he laughed, \"I know as big as you are it's hard to say you're an underdog, but you were outnumbered four to one and they had guns.\"\n\n\"Whatever your reasons, thank you amigo. Let's eat. Senora Eleanor makes the best gravy in the county.\"\n\nSitting on the front porch with a cup of coffee after breakfast, Dillon got his first look at the Triple E; he'd been unconscious when the Edward's brought him to their home. He got up and gingerly stepped out into the yard. Dillon was sore but mostly because of lying in bed for three days and not a result of his injury. \n\nThe ranch house was a rambling one level building. On the left as you faced the house was the main living space. It consisted of two very large rooms; a kitchen and large dining area and separated by a low wall the living room and sitting area. To one side of the living room was a roll topped desk where the ranch business was taken care of.\n\nOn the right were the sleeping quarters; five bedrooms joined to the living area with a covered breezeway. There was a big barn and a bunk house about a hundred feet to the west of the house. Dillon remembered that Creed Taylor's place in Texas had been very similar. The house and barn fits in well with the land, Dillon thought. \n\nThe surrounding area was gently rolling hills mostly covered with trees. In between the hills were meadows and grass lands. If the rest of the Triple E is like this, it's a good place to raise stock, Dillon said to himself. Oso joined him in front of the house.\n\n\"What happened after I went down? I seem to remember someone telling everyone to stop,\" Dillon questioned.\n\n\"That was Sheriff Jackson,\" Oso answered. \"He stopped the fight and made Cassidy's men leave town. They picked up Miles and the other one and carried them off. Jackson told me after they left that he didn't believe their version of what happened. Then he got Doctor Reynolds to tend to you; the doc treated me also. Senorita Elizabeth arrived about the same time as the doctor.\"\n\nDillon hadn't noticed before but Oso had a large cut on the side of his head. Oso continued, \"Doc Reynolds said he thought you'd be okay but someone should sit with you for a few days. That's when the senorita told me to get the wagon and that we'd bring you out here to the Triple E.\"\n\n\"Strange name for a ranch.\"\n\n\"Senor Edwards named the place. He said it was for the three treasures in his life; Eleanor, Elizabeth, and Ethan. That's why he called it the Triple E; we brand our stock with three Es.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Mr. Edwards, I haven't met him yet. Is he around or is he away on business?\" \n\nOso hung his head for a minute. \"Senor Edwards was killed four months ago. That cabr\u00f3n Cassidy had him killed. But we can't prove it. I started to go after Cassidy but Senora Eleanor made me promise not to. She said she didn't want me killed or put in jail.\"\n\n\"Couldn't Sheriff Jackson do anything?\" Dillon asked and Oso shook his head no. \"Why would Cassidy kill Mr. Edwards?\"\n\n\"The Sheriff questioned Cassidy but couldn't find any proof. Cassidy wants the Triple E but Senor Edwards wouldn't sell and when he wouldn't, Cassidy had his men kill him.\"\n\nThat explains the sadness in these people, Dillon thought. He stopped questioning Oso to let him compose himself. Then to lighten things up a bit said, \"Are you called bear because of you size amigo?\"\n\nOso smiled and replied, \"I didn't know you spoke Spanish. No, everybody thinks that but the name was given to me when I was little; my real name is Roberto Rios. My father married a Cheyenne woman; he didn't take her as a squaw, he married her in the Church. We were visiting my mother's people one summer and I wandered away from the camp. I was five at the time.\" Oso stopped for a bit and smiled remembering happier times.\n\n\"My mother and father found me in a clearing playing with two bear cubs. The mother bear was lying nearby watching us. When my parents came into the clearing, she called to her cubs and led them into the forest. My father couldn't believe that the bear had let me play with her cubs. My mother said I was protected by the bear totem. From then on, everyone called me Oso.\"\n\nDillon chuckled at the story. \"Do your folks live nearby?\"\n\nAgain Oso hung his head before answering. \"My parents were killed in a raid by the Apache on our small ranch. That's when I got this,\" he said pointing to the scar on his face. \"Senor Edwards was riding by the ranch and saw the smoke from the burning house. When he rode into our yard, he found me digging graves for my mother and father. I was ten.\"\n\nDillon waited while Oso stared at the skyline. \"Senor Edwards gave me a canteen, made me sit in the shade, and he finished the digging. After he buried my folks, he made some crosses out of pieces of fencing. He let me pound them into the ground at the head of each grave and said a prayer over them.\"\n\nFor the first time since Oso began his tale he smiled. \"Senor Edwards asked me if I had family he could take me to. I said I had no one so he pulled me up behind him on his horse. That was almost twenty five years ago; I've lived with the Edwards family ever since.\"\n\nDillon nodded as Oso finished his tale. \"That's why you so attached to the Triple E and its owners. I guess maybe I've become attached to them too.\"\n\nOso looked at him and smiled. \"Would you like to ride around the ranch? I brought your horses from town and put them in our barn.\n\nAfter thinking for a minute Dillon said, \"Maybe I'd better wait until tomorrow; I'm still a little unsteady.\" \n\n********************\n\nThree days later Dillon had fully recovered. Oso, Elizabeth, and Dillon rode around the ranch. \"How big is the Triple E?\" Dillon asked. \"I don't remember much about that trip from town. Seems like a nice spread.\"\n\nElizabeth smiled and said, \"Sometimes it's almost too much. We've got almost 800 acres with grazing rights for another 400; it takes a lot to keep it going.\"\n\n\"Reckon it would take a lot of work,\" Dillon agreed. \"How far is Prescott from here?\"\n\n\"It's about 10 miles as the crow flies, but we're not crows,\" Oso answered. \"Closer to 13 miles by the trail. There's an old trail through the hills and along a dry river bed that cuts off 3 or 4 miles but it's a hard ride and tough on horses.\"\n\nDillon, Oso, and the Edwards spent the evenings after supper on the front porch talking. Dillon had told them about Cassidy poisoning the other ranchers against him.\n\n\"I guess I'm going to have to find something else to do,\" He said.\n\n\"We can offer you work on the Triple E, if you've a mind too,\" Eleanor offered. \"But you must understand that Mr. Cassidy won't back off. He's already run off all the hands except for Oso. If you go to work for us, you'll probably have to deal with that unpleasantness.\"\n\nDillon hung his head and then smiled. Looking at Eleanor he said, \"I'd be proud to work for you ma'am.\" He paused for a little and continued, \"Why is Cassidy so set on getting the Triple E? Is there something special about it? Water or mineral deposits maybe?\"\n\n\"We have good water on the ranch but nothing extraordinary and nothing of value except grazing land. I asked Cassidy why he wanted our place the third time he made an offer,\" Eleanor replied. \"He said he was building a cattle empire to rival the King Ranch in Texas and we were in his way. He owns most of the ranches on either side of us you know. Maybe he has delusions of grandeur.\" \n\nDillon shook his head; he'd heard and read about many men that talked about building an empire. He offered, \"The problem with building an empire is that most empire builders don't last long.\"\n\nHe thought for a moment and then quoted:\n\n\"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\n  Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\"\n  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\n Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n The lone and level sands stretch far away.'\n\nEleanor smiled and then chuckled. \"You may be right Dillon.\"\n\n\"What?\" Oso asked, clearly not understanding the quote. When Dillon explained it to him, he nodded and smiled. \"Maybe we can be the ones to destroy that statue.\"\n\nThe next morning Dillon rode back to Prescott; he had several errands to take care of. He wanted to settle his accounts at the stable and the boarding house and get the rest of his gear to transfer it to the Triple E. Dillon also wanted to see if there were more letters from his mother. He told the Edwards that he would return the next day.\n\nOso wanted to go with him but Dillon talked him out of it. \"Cassidy's men won't bother me; they don't know that I'm working for Mrs. Edwards. But they sure know who you are.\"\n\nShortly after arriving in town, Dillon had completed his errands. He stopped by to talk to Sheriff Jackson and explained his part in the fight behind the stable. \n\n\"I know that Cassidy's men started things, but I couldn't prove it so I had to let them leave,\" Jackson said. \"Keeping someone from being killed was about the best I could do. You know you knocked out two of Miles' teeth.\" He paused and added, \"Don't go trying to even the score. Let the law handle it.\"\n\nDillon nodded his understanding. \"I won't go looking for those men or Cassidy.\" He looked the Sheriff in the eye, \"You once said I didn't look like a man that wouldn't turn the other cheek; I'll do it this time. But make no mistake, I won't do it again.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Sheriff's office he went back to the hotel and got a room for one night. He had supper in a cafe next door to the West Branch saloon. Dillon knew that after he went to work on the Triple E there wouldn't be many chances for a beer and a little poker. One last fling, Dillon said to himself laughing.\n\nHe entered the saloon; after getting a beer he leaned against the end of the bar with a wall at his back. Dillon was watching the two poker games that were going on; wondering if he should sit in or go back to the hotel. He decided to finish his beer and go back to his room so he could get an early start back to the Triple E.\n\nDillon drained his beer and turned to leave. Both of the swinging doors were pushed opened as Cassidy and three of his men stomped into the saloon. The three hands followed Cassidy toward the bar. Before they got there, Cassidy saw Dillon and came to a halt; he stopped so suddenly that two of his men bumped into him. He turned toward Dillon and started his way.\n\nHe saw Cassidy coming toward him and pushed off the bar to face him and his men. The weather had started to cool down as it was late fall and Dillon had started wearing a duster. Very slowly he moved the long coat and uncovered his holstered piston making it seem like a natural motion. He wasn't about to be caught at a disadvantage.\n\nCassidy came to a stop about five feet from Dillon. \"I understand that you're spending time on the Triple E Gallagher. I'm going to own that place soon. Take my advice and leave before I take over. In fact it might be a good idea for you to leave Prescott.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your concern Mr. Cassidy. But I sorta like this area and the Edwards family. Think I'll hang around and see if I can be of any help to them,\" Dillon replied. \"After all they're the ones that took care of me when one of your men hit me with a club from behind.\"\n\nBefore the rancher could reply Dillon notice that Miles was one of the men with Cassidy. \"How's your teeth Miles? I understand you lost a few recently,\" Dillon said and laughed.\n\nMiles went pale and started for his gun but Cassidy grabbed his arm. \"You damn fool, can't you see he's ready for you. Go outside and wait with the horses.\" Turning back to Dillon he said, \"You're making a mistake throwin in with the Edwards. I suggest you ride on Gallagher.\"\n\n\"And I suggest you mind your own business Mr. Cassidy,\" Dillon replied with steel in his voice. He looked at the man with cold eyes. \"Let's make it clear Cassidy, if you continue to harass the folks from the Triple E you'll have me to deal with.'\n\n\"Is that a threat?\" Cassidy asked bristling with anger.\n\n\"No sir Mr. Cassidy. That's just what will happen if you don't leave those folks alone.\"\n\nCassidy laughed. \"There's just you and that big greaser to protect those woman. If it comes to trouble, you're outgunned.\"\n\n\"Maybe so, but most of your boys are just cowhands with guns; I'm a mite better than that. If you try to run Miss Eleanor and her children off, you might just find that we don't run too easy. You might find out that the price you have to pay for the Triple E is very high.\" Dillon's voice and cold manner made Cassidy stop for a moment.\n\n\"I'm leaving now. Appreciate it if you or your men don't follow me out the door,\" he told Cassidy. \n\nDillon left the saloon but never completely turned his back on Cassidy and his men. As he stepped through the swinging doors, Miles was leaning against the hitching rail and stood up. Dillon fixed the man with a cold stare and shook his head. Miles slumped back and Dillon walked past him.\n\nIt might be a good idea if I went back to the Triple E tonight, Dillon told himself. I don't think Cassidy will do anything tonight but why take the chance. Dillon got his gear from the hotel, saddled Buck, and rode back to the ranch. He stabled his horse and slipped into the bunkhouse trying to be quiet.\n\nOso turned up the wick on the coal oil lamp as Dillon closed the door. \"I thought you were going to stay in town until tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sorry to wake you amigo; I'll tell you about it in the morning,\" Dillon replied and smiled at his friend. \"Right now I need to get some sleep and so do you. We've got a full day tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping until somebody came stomping in to the bunkhouse,\" Oso grumbled.\n\nThe next morning after breakfast the men rode out to round up some of the cattle. Eleanor had agreed with Dillon's suggestion that the stock be kept closer in. She said it was time to bring them down from the high country grazing anyway. As they drove the cattle back toward the meadow just to the east of the main house, Dillon told Oso about running into Cassidy.\n\n\"I don't think Mr. Cassidy likes the fact that I'm working on the Triple E. In fact I don't think Cassidy likes me very much.\"\n\nOso laughed for a bit then sobered and said, \"You know it could get nasty Dillon; you don't owe us anything. Are you sure you want to get involved?\"\n\nThe cattle had reached the meadow and Dillon stopped Buck. Turning to Oso he said, \"I'm already a part of this my friend. I got involved when I saw Cassidy's men rough up Ethan, I got involved when those four jumped you, and I got involved when Elizabeth decided to take care of me.\"\n\n\"But that was mostly you helping us. Why should you face the storm that's coming?\"\n\nDillon got a faraway look in his eyes and he stared at the cattle as they settled down. \"I did things in the war that I'm not proud of; they were necessary but I'm still not proud of them. I regret having to kill the men that I have, both during the war and afterwards.\" He stopped for a minute remembering.",
        "\"But I've always done what had to be done. Helping the Edwards is something that has to be done; at least in my mind. I can't let that Yankee carpetbagger hurt these folks; he did enough of that back in Virginia.\" Dillon's voice had become hard and his eyes looked like blue steel. \n\n\"I'm sorry amigo, I don't understand, what was it you said...Yankee carpetbagger?\" Oso said. Dillon explained the term and Cassidy's history. \n\nOso waited for a little as Dillon continued to study the skyline and then suggested they head back. \"It's about lunch time.\"\n\n\"Don't you ever think about anything but food, you big bear?\" Dillon laughed as he shook off his somber mood and turned Buck toward the ranch house.\n\nAfter lunch Dillon told Eleanor that they should have a discussion after supper concerning the troubles with Cassidy. The rest of the afternoon the whole group worked around the house and barn. There's always something that needs doing around a ranch, Dillon thought as he mended the corral attached to the barn.\n\nSupper was over, the after the meal coffee was poured, and everyone gathered around the big table for a talk about the future. Eleanor, Elizabeth, Ethan, and Oso waited for Dillon to start the discussion; after all he was the one that had suggested the powwow.\n\n\"Miss Eleanor it's time you knew more about me; before this trouble with Cassidy gets any worse,\" Dillon started. He went on to tell about his service in the First Virginia Cavalry, his decision not to return home after the war and why, and his hatred of what the North forced on the southern states.\n\n\"My reasons for opposing Cassidy run deeper than not wanting to see a nice family run off their place. If I stay Cassidy may come down on you all the harder because I'm here. He was a Northern regulator in Virginia which gives me all the more reason to hate him. Cassidy knows how I feel about him and his kind.\" Dillon paused looking at Eleanor and the rest of them and added, \"If you want me to leave, I'll understand. Things are apt to get real nasty around here.\"\n\n\"I know most of your history Dillon,\" Eleanor replied. \"Charley Jackson told me after he got that telegram from Marshal Ryan.\" \n\nDillon was surprise and a little angry that Jackson would talk about him behind his back. Before he could say anything Eleanor continued.\n\n\"Oh, don't blame Charley too much Dillon. He hardly knows you; my husband John and I have been close friends with Charley for years. He wasn't gossiping about you son, he was warning me what kind of man I was hiring. Understand?\"\n\nDillon nodded and relaxed. Eleanor added, \"As you said, this situation could get very bad. But I won't be forced off this damned ranch by Cassidy or anyone else.\" She looked Dillon in the eye and said, \"We, my family and I are prepared to fight to the end if necessary. Are you sure you want to commit to what amounts to a war?\"\n\nHe returned Eleanor's look, paused for a few seconds and said, \"You said this damned ranch. I don't understand that.\"\n\nEleanor gave him a sad smile and replied, \"I don't really care for the life of a rancher Dillon, I wanted to live closer to town and teach school again.\" At his surprised look she continued, \"I stayed because John worked hard to build a life for us here and a wife's place is at her husband' side. I won't let someone walk all over his legacy.\" Now Eleanor paused for a few seconds.\n\n\"Even if Cassidy had made us a reasonable offer, I wouldn't have sold the Triple E to him after what happened to John. He killed my husband and then tried scaring us off the place. His next offer was not much more than traveling money. As I said, we won't be forced off our place by Cassidy.\"\n\nElizabeth, Ethan, and Oso all nodded in agreement. Dillon had a smile of his own that didn't extend to his eyes. \"Looks like Mr. Carpetbagger Cassidy has a fight on his hands don't it?\"\n\nHe and Oso started toward the bunkhouse. Dillon decided to check on his horses, especially his pack horse. Buddy hadn't received much attention for the last few days. As he led the gentle horse from his stall and currycombed him, he saw Elizabeth entering the barn.\n\nDillon nodded at her and she came over and stroked and rubbed Buddy's face. \"You're an educated man aren't you Dillon? I mean with the poetry quotes and all, I'm sure you had more schooling than most.\"\n\n\"I guess you could call me educated. VMI did teach more than just battle tactics.\" He smiled and admitted, \"I developed a fondness for poetry. It's sort of a strange way of relaxing for a young man planning on being a cavalry officer.\" Dillon looked at Elizabeth in the lamp light and again felt his interest in the young woman.\n\n\"Momma taught us at home you know, I guess once a school teacher always a school teacher. She can't get Ethan interested in more than just learning to read and write and a little arithmetic. Momma could tell that I wanted more so she introduced me to several subjects.\"\n\n\n\"Like what?\" Dillon asked more to keep her talking than anything; he was enjoying her company.\n\n\"I've read some philosophy, and ancient history,\" Elizabeth answered. Then with a chuckle she added, \"I've even read some poetry. Mostly Elizabeth Barrett Browning. You know 'How do I love thee',\" she said blushing.\n\n\"I'm impressed Elizabeth. My favorites are Shelley and Byron.\" \n\nOso stuck his head inside the door. \"I'm gonna take a walk around and then turn in. See you later Dillon,\" he said pointedly looking at Elizabeth.\n\nShe chuckled, \"Oso is always trying to protect me.\" Then softly to herself she said, \"Sometimes I wished he'd mind his own business.\"\n\nNow Dillon chuckled and said, \"He's right. You're much too lovely to be alone with a man in a barn. For some, the temptation would be too great.\"\n\n\"I'm 21 and full grown Dillon. I can go and do what I want and take care of myself thank you, she said with a smile. Dillon continued brushing Buddy and after a minute Elizabeth softly asked, \"\"Are you such a gentleman that you can resist temptation Dillon?\"\n\nHe stopped working on his horse and looked at her. Sighing Dillon said, \"Elizabeth, I'm not a good prospect, if that's what you thinking. I've got a price on my head in San Antonio and in Laredo. Men have challenged me and died for it. I'm not a nice person Elizabeth. You deserve some young man who doesn't have to look over his shoulder.\"\n\n\"Ha, the boys and men around here think I'm too much of a tom boy to be interested,\" she replied. \"They all want a woman that will sit at home waiting for them and jump at their beck and call. I won't be a simpering fool for any man. When I marry I plan on being a full partner with my husband.\"\n\nDillon had to smile at the passion in her voice. She certainly would be a handful, he thought. But she would be damn well worth the trouble. Stop it, he told himself. I might not live through what's coming and if I do she deserves better than me.\n\nElizabeth stepped around Buddy and faced Dillon. \"As far as what you said about yourself, I disagree. I think you are a good person. I saw it when you protected Ethan and again when you helped Oso. Besides, it's not your decision Mr. Gallagher. It's mine.\" With that she put her arms around Dillon's neck, pulled his head down, and kissed him.\n\nBefore he could react she stepped back and walked toward the door. \"Temptation can be very hard to resist, can't it Dillon.\" Elizabeth left laughing at the look on Dillon's face.\n\n\"Guess that's plain enough,\" Dillon said out loud. \"Buddy have you even seen such a woman?\" The horse shook his head as if to agree that Elizabeth was something special. Dillon put Buddy back in his stall and walked over to the bunkhouse. That sure puts a different twist to things, he said to himself. As he entered Oso sat up in bed.\n\n\"I don't want to see Elizabeth hurt Dillon,\" the big man said.\n\n\"Neither do I amigo, but I don't think what you and I want plays into it,\" Dillon replied chuckling. \"Elizabeth is pretty much her own person. All we can do is keep our heads down and hope we don't get in her way.\" Dillon got serious and continued, \"I won't hurt her Oso; I promise.\" \n\nThe next day Dillon, Oso and Elizabeth inspected the land surrounding the ranch house and out buildings. Dillon planned on developing several defensive positions in case Cassidy and his men made a raid on the ranch. \n\nAs they ate lunch Dillon suggested several things. \"It's getting on to winter and I don't think Cassidy will try anything out here before spring. Town's a different matter though. From now on I think we should go to town together.\" He saw nods of understanding from everyone. \n\nDillon looked at Eleanor. \"I don't mean to take over but I've got some experience in this area.\" She nodded and he continued, \"Before spring I'd like all of you to be able to handle a gun, if you don't already. You too Ethan.\"\n\nEleanor spoke up, \"If it looks like trouble is coming, I'll send Ethan to stay with Sheriff Jackson and his wife. I've already talked to Charley about it. I'd like for Elizabeth to go too but I don't think there's much chance of getting her to behave like a lady.\" Eleanor smiled at her daughter. Looking at Oso she added, \"I know I can't get my oldest boy to leave either.\"\n\nOso beamed at Eleanor's words. He knew that he'd been adopted by the Edwards, if not legally at least in their hearts and minds but it was nice to hear anyway.\n\nDillon nodded his understanding but warned, \"There may not be time to send Ethan into town; he should be able to protect himself just in case. There are some other things we can do over the winter; we can talk about them later.\"\n\n\"How long will we have to live like this, waiting for Cassidy to do something?\" Elizabeth asked. \"It's like being under siege.\"\n\n\"Cassidy won't do any more than try to rough us in town. If he does something illegal and out in the open we can get the Territorial Marshal involved,\" Dillon answered. \"If trouble comes it will probably be out here on the ranch away from witnesses. I don't know if he's prepared to kill but we'll just have to defend ourselves and hold out.\" He grinned adding, \"Of course he could change his mind about getting hold of the Triple E.\"\n\nThe short laughs, snorts, and chuckles showed that no one believed Cassidy would give up trying to get the ranch.\n\n******************\n\nBy mid April as spring pushed the winter away, there had been several changes at the ranch and in their lives. The winters in Prescott were not severe. It seldom got below 20 degrees and there wasn't a lot of snow. In January there was a sort of blizzard out of the north, leaving a foot of snow on the ground. Two days after the storm the weather was warm and sunny; most of the snow melted.\n\nDuring those five months, they had dug a short tunnel under the back wall of the bunkhouse. It had only one door and the tunnel would allow anyone trapped in the bunkhouse to get out. They cut a trap door in the wooden floor, setting a rug and a table over the escape route. \n\n\"Like a rabbit always has two or three ways out of his tunnel,\" Ethan observed.\n\nJust like that,\" Dillon replied. \"We can cover the holes with brush to hide them.\"\n\nUp at the main house there was already a trap door that led to a root cellar. They cut through the wall of the cellar to provide another escape route. Dillon had a local carpenter make some four inch thick shutters for the ranch house windows. They had a cross shaped firing ports cut in them. If they got pinned down in the house they would be able to defend themselves by using the ports to shoot through.\n\nDillon hid rifles wrapped in oil skin in several places around the main house and out buildings. If they got caught outside of the house or the bunkhouse they wouldn't be without weapons.\n\nOn one of the supply runs Dillon bought two Winchester rifles, three Remington New Model Army pistols and two Greener 10 gauge coach guns. He also bought several boxes of cartridges for each to add to the arsenal at the ranch. There were two cowhands in the gun smith's who Dillon thought were Cassidy's men. He made it a point to tell the gun smith in a loud voice that the weapons were for the Triple E.\n\nEleanor questioned him about letting Cassidy's men know that the Triple E was well armed. \"I want Cassidy to know what he'll be facing if he comes after us,\" Dillon explained with a grim smile. \"Now he knows he's not facing just one rifle; it might cause him to rethink any plans of raiding the ranch.\"\n\nOne morning Dillon asked Ethan to take a walk with him. As they got to the back of the house Dillon stopped. \"Ethan, I'm going to give you a job. Early every morning I want you to tie a saddled horse here at the entrance to the root cellar. If we get raided your job will be to get to that horse and ride for town to get Sheriff Jackson.\"\n\nDillon could see that the youngster wasn't sure about leaving his family during a raid. \"You can ride the ten miles or so into town faster than your mother or sister and Oso and I have to stay here. You're the best one for the job Ethan. Understand?\"\n\nEthan nodded and then felt proud that he'd been chosen for this important mission. As he went toward the barn, Eleanor stepped around the side of the house.\n\n\"That was a nice thing to do Dillon,\" she said.\n\n\"I doubt that we'll know a raid is coming until it happens so this seemed to be the best way to get the boy out of harm's way. Do you think I could get you and Elizabeth to go with him?\" When Eleanor shook her head no he added, \"I didn't think so.\"\n\nNormally a trip to town to get supplies was done on a Saturday; Dillon changed the supply run to a different day of the week. Less chance of running into Cassidy's men during the week, Dillon thought. Dillon, Oso, and the Edwards did all the shopping and errands together. From getting supplies from various stores, picking up and sending mail, and having the horses reshod was done as a group. Even going to church twice a month was done together.\n\nOn one trip the whole crew was in the mercantile and Eleanor and Elizabeth bought some ladies undergarments. Following Dillon's advice they were all together and the two men were embarrassed as the ladies discussed the merits and sizes of the items. Ethan was looking at the case holding candy and wasn't involved. The ladies teased the men about their red faces for days afterwards.\n\nDuring the winter months and into spring, Elizabeth continued to flirt and tease Dillon. I don't know how much more of this I can take, Dillon said to himself. One morning he spoke to Eleanor about the problem.\n\nExplaining what Elizabeth had been doing he said, \"I don't want to cause any more problems than you already have but do you think you could talk to her and get her to leave me alone?\" Eleanor laughed and smiled at the pleading tone Dillon used.\n\n\"I could speak to her but it wouldn't do any good Dillon. As you've noticed Elizabeth is a very independent young woman.\" Eleanor paused, looking at him for a moment. \"The only way to make her stop is for you to tell her you're not interested. Don't tell her you're not good for her like you did before; it only makes her want you more. Tell her flat out that you don't want her.\"\n\nDillon stood looking at Eleanor for a bit and with a sad smile replied, \"I try not to lie if I can help it....... No, I couldn't rightly tell her that. Guess I'll just have to put up with her, for awhile anyway.\" He turned and went back to the barn.\n\nEleanor smiled at his back as he walked away. That poor young man doesn't even know he's been roped yet, she thought. He'll make a fine addition to the family; if we make it through this trouble.\n\nSetting up defensive positions wasn't the only thing that had to be done. The Triple E was a cattle ranch and the stock still had to be tended. The cattle had already been brought down from the summer grazing in the high country and were closer to the house. Every couple of days they had to be checked in case any problems arose.\n\nDillon and Elizabeth were checking on the cattle and the spring calves in the meadow farthest from the house. They had separated riding around the small herd when Elizabeth whistled shrilly getting Dillon's attention on the other side of the meadow; she motioned for him to join her. He rode around the herd to Elizabeth and she pointed at some tracks in the soft earth.\n\n\"Looks like three horses and about twenty head of cattle moved off toward the pass there,\" Dillon said pointing to a low area between two large hills. \"I think someone's helping themselves to Triple E cattle.\"\n\nElizabeth nodded and said, \"Let's follow them. Maybe we can catch them before they get off the ranch.\"\n\n\"I'll follow them, you ride back and tell Oso where I'm headed,\" Dillon ordered.\n\n\"Mr. Gallagher, you forget yourself. You work for us, remember?\" She asked with a little grin. \"If you want Oso's help, you go for him. I'm going to follow these tracks and see who's taking our cattle.\" With that Elizabeth kicked her horse into a lope and followed the trail.\n\nAs she rode away, Dillon shook his head. Like I said he thought, she's a handful. Smiling he turned Buck in the same direction and quickly caught up to Elizabeth. \"Okay Miss Edwards, you're the boss. But if it looks like things are going to get rough you have to head back.\"\n\n\"But......\" Elizabeth started. Dillon interrupted her.\n\n\"It's either that way or I'll tie you across your saddle and lead you back myself,\" he said very seriously. \"I won't let you get yourself shot over a few head of cattle. Your choice Miss Edwards.\"\n\nElizabeth stared at him for about ten seconds and asked, \"You'd really do that wouldn't you?\" When Dillon nodded she sighed and said, \"Okay, I promise I'll behave. She smiled and added softly, \"This time anyway.\"\n\nFollowing the tracks it was evident that the riders were pushing the cattle toward the pass. Motioning for Elizabeth to follow him, Dillon rode around the slow moving cattle keeping out of sight. They arrived at the pass about twenty minutes before the stolen cattle did.\n\n\"No more games Elizabeth. You stay on your horse just over the crest of the pass and if shooting starts you use your spurs and get back to the ranch. Tell Oso where I am and what's happening but you stay at the ranch. Understand?\"\n\n\"Dillon I think I can.......\"\n\n\"No arguments girl. This isn't a game. These rustlers won't care that you're a woman; they'll just want to get away. I won't be responsible for you getting shot. It would hurt Eleanor too much,\" Dillon said. And me too, he added to himself.\n\nShe nodded and moved her horse below the pass. Dillon left Buck ground tied, pulled his rifle out of the scabbard and went back to the crest of the trail. As the three men and the cattle got closer Dillon could pick out the Triple E branded on the cattle's rumps. One man was on each side of the herd with the third riding drag to push the cattle along.\n\nWhen the men got with a hundred feet Dillon stood in the middle of the pass. \"Stop right there,\" he shouted. \"Those are Triple E cattle and you're guilty of rustling. I'll give you five seconds to drop your guns and dismount.\"\n\nThe men stopped seeing Dillon with a rifle aimed in their direction. \"There's only one of you Mister and three of us. You might get one of us but not all three,\" one of the men yelled back. He started to say more but stopped as another figure with a rifle came to stand on the other side of the pass.\n\nDillon sensed the movement and knew it had to be Elizabeth. He quickly glanced her way and saw she had put her hair up under her hat. At that distance from the three rustlers they couldn't tell that it was a young woman. All they saw was their chances of getting away go downhill.\n\nThe man on Dillon's right said, \"Aw hell\" and pulled his pistol. He took a shot at Dillon and the other 'man' standing in the pass. Before he could turn his horse Dillon's rifle shot rang out and the rustler was knocked out of the saddle.",
        "He turned toward the other two but they were riding like hell and were quickly out of range. Dillon mounted Buck and went to examine the downed man. The bullet had hit the man in the head; there was no doubt that he was dead. As he stood up, Elizabeth rode up and dismounted.\n\nDillon was still keyed up from the short gun battle and grabbed Elizabeth by both shoulders. \"I told you to stay mounted and out of sight,\" he said shaking her. \"You could have been killed.\"\n\nWhen he stopped shaking her Elizabeth slowly raised one hand and touched his cheek. \"Would it have mattered to you so much if I had been Dillon?\" She looked up at him as she asked the question.\n\nHell, Dillon said to himself. He pulled her into his arms, leaned down, and kissed her. Elizabeth put her arms around his neck and kissed him back. They kissed for what seemed forever to them but was actually only a couple of minutes.\n\nThey stepped away from each other, but not very far and Dillon slid his hands back to Elizabeth's shoulders. \"I wasn't sure that you did,\" she said.\n\n\"Did what?\"\n\n\"Love me. You haven't given any indication that you did until just now.\"\n\nDillon looked at her for a few seconds, shook his head, and smiled. \"Ya I do. In spite of trying not to, I do love you.\"\n\nThis time it was Elizabeth that pulled Dillon to her. After another long kiss Dillon stepped back and said, \"C'mon we need to get the cattle back.\" When she frowned Dillon kissed her on the nose. \"I'll put him,\" he said pointing to the dead man, \"on his horse. You can take him to the ranch, I'm going to trail the other two and make sure they don't double back.\"\n\nElizabeth held the horse as Dillon tied the man across his saddle. \"What about the cattle?\" She asked.\n\n\"You head them back to the ranch; once you get them started they'll wander toward the rest of the herd. We're not that far away. When I get back, we'll all make a trip into town and turn that one over to the Sheriff.\" Dillon kissed Elizabeth again just before she mounted. \"Get going now,\" he ordered smiling at her.\n\n\"Yes sir, Mr. Gallagher, sir,\" she replied with a smile of her own.\n\nDillon watched her until a turn in the trail took her out of sight. Mounting Buck he headed north following the trail of the two remaining rustlers. After thirty minutes he lost the trail in some rocky shale. I can't be sure but I think their headed for Cassidy's spread, he thought.\n\nIt took a little over an hour for Dillon to get back to the ranch house. When he rode in he saw the horse with the dead man draped across the saddle tied to the corral fence. Everyone came out to meet him; when he dismounted Elizabeth ran over and put her arms around his waist. Well that pretty well lets the cat out of the bag Dillon thought and then smiled at her. \n\nAfter a later breakfast the riders of the Triple E rode into town, leading the horse with a dead man across the saddle. They found Sheriff Jackson as he came out of his office. Dillon turned the man over to Jackson and explained what happened. \n\n\"Isn't that one of Cassidy's men?\" Dillon asked with a cold tone.\n\n\"Believe he is or was I should say. Think I'll ride out and have a talk with Mr. Cassidy,\" Jackson replied. \"I'll take him to the undertakers and ride out to the Circle C tomorrow morning.\"\n\nEleanor suggested that they pick up their supplies that day. She also said they should stay the night at the hotel because they'd got such a late start for town. Smiling she added, \"We can have supper at the caf\u00e9. It'll be nice to let someone else do the cooking for a change.\"\n\nThe next morning at 9 they met in the lobby of the hotel. Everyone was there except Elizabeth. \"Where's Elizabeth?\" Dillon asked. \"Is she still getting dressed?\"\n\nThe desk clerk spoke up saying, \"Miss Edwards said to tell you she was over to the general store if you came down before she got back. She said she forgot something yesterday?\"\n\n\"I'll go meet her,\" Dillon said to Eleanor. \"Y'all get the horses and meet us at the mercantile.\" He quickly walked out of the hotel and toward the store. Dillon wasn't running but was walking much faster than normal. He had a bad feeling about Elizabeth being alone. \n\nJust before he got to the mercantile he passed a gangway between two buildings and heard an angry shout and a woman's muffled outcry. He hurried down the gangway until it ended in a small space bordered by two buildings and a fence.\n\nElizabeth was being held from behind by a man who was struggling to keep her under control. Facing her was another man that Dillon recognized as one of Cassidy's riders; a man named Riley. The men hadn't noticed Dillon yet.\n\n\"We gonna rough you up a bit girl,\" Riley said. \"And you can tell Gallagher he's next.\"\n\n\"Tell me yourself Riley. I'm right here,\" Dillon said with steel in his voice.\n\nRiley spotted Dillon for the first time and the man holding Elizabeth turned his head toward Dillon. As he turned, Elizabeth stomped down on his right foot with her boot heel. He released the girl and bent over to grab his foot. When he bent over, Elizabeth kneed the man in the face. He went down with blood spurting from his nose.\n\nShe reached down and pulled a knife from her boot and turned to face Riley. As she turned, he backhanded her across her face knocking her to the ground. Before Riley could get set, Dillon was on him. With a roar, he picked the man up and threw him into a wall and as Riley bounced off Dillon met him with a left uppercut and then a short right hand. Riley fell to the ground.\n\nDillon turned as the first man got to his knees and began to stand up. Two quick steps brought Dillon close enough to kick him in the head. The man went down again and stayed there. Dillon turned back to Riley as he stood and knocked him back into the wall again. When Riley hit the wall he drew his pistol but before he could get it up Dillon pulled his own pistol and brought the barrel down across the man's forearm. \n\nThe blow broke Riley's arm and he dropped his gun. Dillon holstered his weapon and hit Riley with another right hand. As the man fell back against the wall Dillon followed him in and began to hit him with both hands. Every time Riley started fall or sag Dillon would pull him upright, prop him against the wall, and hit him again and again.\n\nOso came running down the gangway and shouted at Dillon. \"You're going to kill him Dillon.\"\n\nDillon was in a battle rage and didn't hear his friend. He had been cold and collected when he saw the two men holding Elizabeth. But when Riley hit her, Dillon's only thought was to make the man pay dearly for hurting her. \n\nOso was afraid that Dillon was going to beat the man to death so he stepped over and grabbed Dillon in his big arms and held him. He didn't care about Riley but he didn't want Dillon to go to jail for murder. Oso picked Dillon up off his feet and started walking backwards away from Riley. As soon as Oso stopped Dillon, Riley fell to the ground; his face was a bloody mess.\n\nDillon was so far into his rage that he didn't realize it was Oso holding him. He slipped his hand down and started to draw his pistol. Elizabeth had regained her feet and stepped in front of Dillon.\n\n\"I'm okay Dillon, I'm okay,\" she said as she put her hand on his to stop him from drawing his gun. \"That's Oso holding you. It's okay you can stop fighting now. I'm okay Dillon.\"\n\nElizabeth's voice and her hand on his got through to Dillon and he stopped struggling. His eyes came back into focus and he saw Elizabeth in front of him. Dillon shook his head to clear it and as he relaxed Oso let him go. Dillon slumped and almost fell before catching himself.\n\nHe put his hand on the side of Elizabeth's face, frowning at the cut on her cheek. Dillon looked at the two men on the ground and sighed. \"Better send for the Sheriff,\" he said to Oso. \n\nThe big man examined both the downed men. \"They're not a pretty sight but they're still breathing.\" He patted Dillon on the back and left to fetch Jackson.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Elizabeth asked as she stepped into Dillon looking him in his eyes as she put her arms around his waist.\n\nDillon nodded his head slowly and looked at the two men. \"I've never felt like that before.\" He took a deep breath and looked down at Elizabeth. \"I was ready for trouble when I came back here. But when Riley hit you I lost all control. All I wanted to do was kill them with my bare hands.\"\n\nElizabeth leaned up and kissed him. \"Thank you Sir Knight for saving me,\" she said with a smile.\n\nBefore Dillon could respond, Eleanor and Ethan came to join them. Both were carrying a shotgun held at the ready. Eleanor took in the situation asked, \"Are you two okay? Where's Oso?\"\n\n\"I'm right here Senora,\" Oso answered as he walked down the gangway. Sheriff Jackson was with him.\n\nJackson saw the two men on the ground and examined them to see if they were alive. He came back to Dillon and Elizabeth and asked if they were okay. Before they could answer he yelled at one of the people standing at the entrance to the gangway to fetch Doc Reynolds. Turning back he handed Dillon a hip flask.\n\n\"Medicinal whiskey,\" Jackson said. \"Looks like you both could use a dose.\" At the surprised looks from them, he smiled saying, \"I always carry a little taste; you never know when you'll need it.\" \n\nDillon returned the smile and handed the flask to Elizabeth. She took a healthy dose of the medicine and Dillon did the same. Jackson motioned to Oso and the big man decided he needed the medicine too and took a drink. Oso handed the flask back to the Sheriff.\n\nJackson said, \"Sometimes I feel the need for a dose too.\" He took a drink from the flask and put it away. \"Now, y'all care to tell me what happened here?\"\n\n\"These two grabbed me as I was coming out of the mercantile and pulled back here,\" Elizabeth said. \"They said they were going to rough me up to persuade us to leave. That's when Dillon showed up.\" As she talked she took several steps back toward the man that had been holding her and squatted down near him.\n\nDillon thought she was going to be sick or was hurt more than they thought and took two steps toward her. Eleanor came toward her also. Elizabeth held up her hand stopping them and stood up. She held up her knife to Dillon and smiled. Wiping the knife on her riding skirt she put in back into her boot.\n\n\"Didn't want to forget that,\" she said. Continuing her story she explained that Dillon distracting the men allowed her to get away from the one holding her. \"The other one tried to draw his gun and Dillon was forced to stop him. That's about it Mr. Jackson.\"\n\n\"That right Dillon? Riley drew on you.\"\n\nBefore Dillon could answer Doctor Reynolds came hurrying down the gangway with the coat tails of his frock coat streaming out behind him. Doctor Reynolds was 5' 6, squat, and grizzled. He was close to 60 years old with a flowing grey mustache and sideburns. He looks more like a banker or store keeper, Dillon thought. He had to smile at the picture. Doc Reynolds' assistant trailed behind him. \n\nHe motioned to his assistant and they each looked at one of the men on the ground. After a short examination the doctor came back to Elizabeth and looked at her.\n\n\"Hello Elizabeth my dear. Been playing a little rough have we?\" He smiled and looked up at her; she was almost three inches taller than the doctor. His smile faded when he saw her face. Elizabeth had a cut on her cheek, a split lip, and the whole side of her face was red and beginning to swell where Riley hit her.\n\n\"Don't worry little one, you'll be fine,\" Reynolds said reassuring her, Eleanor, and mostly Dillon. \"You'll have a hell of a bruise, excuse my language, on the side of your face. We need to get a cool wet rag on that cheek. The cuts will heal up just fine without leaving a scar.\" He turned to Eleanor. \"Make sure you treat those cuts with coal oil Eleanor,\" he ordered. \"Now Mr. Gallagher let's have a look at you.\"\n\n\"I'm okay Doc,\" Dillon objected.\n\n\"Do you normally walk around with blood on your hands young man?\" Reynolds said pointing.\n\nDillon held his hands up and saw several cuts oozing blood. His hands were also beginning to swell. \"I never noticed them,\" he said to the doctor.\n\nReynolds turned to Jackson and said, \"Give me that flask you always carry Charley.\" He shook the flask to see how much was in it, took a big drink, and poured the rest of it on Dillon's hands. Dillon gasped and winced at the sting of the whiskey. \n\n\"Same for his hands Eleanor. Treat them with coal oil a couple of times a day. It'll stop infection and help them heal,\" he ordered. \"Jacob get someone to help you get these two over to my office,\" he ordered his assistant. \"Good bye all,\" he said and walked away.\n\nSheriff Jackson shook his empty flask and watched the doctor scurry away. Turning to Dillon he said, \"As you know the Edwards and I are good friends, have been for years. Thank you for helping them; that makes you a friend also. My given name is Charley.\"\n\n\"Yes sir, I know. And I'd be happy to consider you as a friend.\"\n\n\"Good. I have a question for you, not as the Sheriff but as your friend.\" Dillon nodded and Charley asked, \"Did you have to beat them so bad?\" \n\n\"Between friends Charley?\" This time Charley nodded and Dillon added, \"When I saw Riley hit Elizabeth, I got crazy mad. I lost control and if Oso hadn't pulled me off, I would have killed him.\"\n\nCharley looked at Elizabeth and Dillon and saw that they were never separated by more than arms length. When they looked at each other, their eyes told the whole story. He said with a grin, \"Remind me not to get you that riled up.\"\n\nDillon returned the grin and said, \"Now I've got a question for you. Riley and probably this other one works for Cassidy. So did the rustler I shot. Have you talked to Cassidy?\"\n\nCharley bristled for a second and then realized that Dillon wasn't criticizing him, he just wanted information. \"I did talk to him. Cassidy said that he'd fired that rustler and two others a couple of weeks before. And I bet when I talk to him about Riley and Marsh, he'll either say he fired them or that they acted on their own. Our Mr. Cassidy is very slippery.\"\n\nDillon's eyes blazed for a second and Charley added \"Don't go off half cocked Dillon. If you do something outside the law I'd have to come after you. I wouldn't want to have to do that. Besides you've got a reason not to hit the outlaw trail now.\" Charley pointed at Elizabeth. \n\n\"Y'all get out of here now I've got things to do. As soon as Doc tends to them I've got two prisoners to jail. The circuit judge will be here in two weeks. I think those boys will be guests at the Territorial Prison for quite a spell. \"\n\nOso mumbled something to himself about letting the men go so he could deal with them. \"I'll give you the same advice I gave Dillon, Oso. Don't do anything outside the law,\" Jackson said.\n\nEthan brought up the horses and they started back to the ranch. On the ride home the only way Elizabeth and Dillon couldn't have been any closer is if they'd been on the same horse. They rode side by side and talked quietly for most of the ten miles back to the Triple E.\n\nThat evening after supper they had their almost daily meeting to discuss their plans and the situation. Dillon had thought of something on the way back from town. \n\n\"Cassidy must be getting impatient, he's pushing harder to get you to sell out, Eleanor.\" Dillon paused and then asked, \"There's five bedrooms in the house, right Eleanor?\" She nodded and Dillon said, \"I think Oso should bunk in the house. If a raid comes both he and I could get cornered in the bunkhouse which leaves you all alone. Oso and I can take turns standing four hour watches at night.\"\n\nOso went to the bunkhouse to get some of his things. Dillon said good night to Eleanor and Ethan. Elizabeth walked with him to the end of the breezeway and kissed him good night. Dillon passed Oso on his way to the bunkhouse and said, \"Hang a shirt or something out of the window so I'll know which bedroom is yours. I can knock on the window when it's your watch.\"\n\n\"Want me to take the first watch, amigo?\"\n\n\"No, I'm still worked up over what went on in town. I don't think I could sleep anyway so I'll take the first watch and wake you when I get tired. Okay?\" Oso nodded and continued on to the ranch house.\n\nDillon had a lot to think about as he walked around the bunkhouse, barn, and main house during his watch. He was concerned about his loss of control in town. I almost killed Riley and didn't realize it, he thought. His thoughts went from the fight to Elizabeth. I love her he told himself with a little smile. Emma and I had something special but I never felt this way about her. I knew that someday we'd go our own way but I can't picture not being with Elizabeth.\n\nFor four hours Dillon prowled around the area. He was still keyed up so he let Oso sleep and continued on watch. Dillon finally put his mind at ease and calmed down around 3 AM; he been on watch for seven hours. He knocked on Oso's window and joined the big man as he came out of the house.\n\n\"Why didn't you wake me sooner?\" Oso asked.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep. No need for both of us to miss our beauty sleep,\" Dillon replied. \"And in your case you need as much beauty sleep as you can get.\"\n\nOso pretended to be hurt, laughed and asked, \"What time do you want me to wake you?\"\n\n\"Let me sleep until 7 or so. I don't want to miss out on one of Eleanor's breakfast. Tonight you can have the first watch.\"\n\nThat evening after supper, Dillon was stuffed with Eleanor's good cooking and he had trouble staying awake. He laughed at himself thinking, I can't run all night every night anymore. Must be getting old. Dillon said good night around 8 and went to the bunkhouse leaving Oso to stand the first watch. He could see the path to the bunkhouse very easily because of the full moon. \n\nComanche Moon is what the folks in Texas call it Dillon remembered. The Comanche like to attack by the light. If Cassidy raids the ranch I hope he does it under a full moon; it makes it easier to see them. He undressed and climbed into his bed. Won't have any trouble sleeping tonight, he thought just before he closed his eyes.\n\nA couple of hours later Dillon heard the door to the bunkhouse open; it had one squeaky hinge. He reached down slowly and picked up the pistol that he had laid on the floor next to his bed. Dillon could see a figure in the doorway backlit by the light from the full moon.\n\n\"Stand where you are. I've got the drop on you,\" he said cocking his pistol. He reached over to the lamp and turned up the wick. The light from the lamp allowed him to see the intruder. It was Elizabeth that stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Damn girl, I almost shot you,\" he greeted her.\n\n\"I didn't get to spend much time with you tonight so I thought I'd come down here,\" she said with a nervous smile. \n\n\"Elizabeth,\" Dillon replied in sort of a scolding way. \"You don't need to be here. It wouldn't look right.\"\n\n\"I don't care what it looks like. We're going to be married so what difference does it make?\"\n\n\"We are?\" Dillon asked in surprise.\n\n\"Of course we are. You don't think I let just any old cowboy that rides through take liberties with me, do you?\" She said teasing him; then in a more serious tone said, \"Please can I stay?\"\n\nElizabeth was wearing a thick robe which she untied and dropped to the floor. She had on a night gown that came down below her knees; it did nothing to hide her charms. She also wore her boots. Dillon had to smile at the boots.\n\n\"Does Eleanor know you're here?\" He asked.\n\n\"Momma's the one that told me to put on my boots. She said the ground would be cold,\" Elizabeth answered with a chuckle.\n\nMaybe some gentleman could resist her, but that ain't me, Dillon thought. He pulled back the covers inviting her into the bed. She quickly took off her boots and joined him.",
        "About 2 AM, Oso quietly opened the door of the bunkhouse; he was going to wake Dillon for his watch. Oso knew that Dillon slept with a pistol close at hand and didn't want to spook his friend. He noticed the lamp was still giving out a lot of light and looked at the bed. When he saw Elizabeth and Dillon sleeping, he smiled, shook his head and went back outside. I guess I can spend one sleepless night for those two, he said to himself.\n\nDillon woke about 6 AM, Elizabeth had already gone. He smiled as he shaved and cleaned up. Guess last night pretty well tells me my future, he thought. Dillon joined the rest of the crew at the breakfast table. After eating he asked Ethan to feed and water the horses and asked Oso to give him a hand. That left Eleanor, Elizabeth, and Dillon at the table.\n\nHe took a deep breath and with a nervous tone in his voice said, \"Eleanor I'd, I mean we'd, like your blessing to get married. I respect and admire Elizabeth but mostly I love her. Don't want you to think I'm a penniless drifter, I've got about two thousand in at the bank in town.\" Dillon stopped not knowing what else to say.\n\nEleanor had to smile at the nervous young man. Finally she replied, \"I wondered how long it would take for you realize that you two were meant to be together.\" She held open her arms as Elizabeth came to her and said, \"Of course you have my blessing. The sooner the better so Elizabeth doesn't have to sneak down to the bunkhouse in the cold.\"\n\nTwo days later, Eleanor, Elizabeth, and Dillon went to Prescott; Oso and Ethan stayed at the ranch. They would get some supplies and Dillon wanted to mail a letter to his mother telling her of his upcoming marriage. The main purpose of the trip was to talk to the pastor of the church about holding the wedding there.\n\nThe wedding was scheduled for the first Saturday of the next month; about three weeks away. After meeting the pastor the three went to the general store for the supplies. Dillon posted the letter to his mother and as they started to leave a clerk from the bank asked Dillon to come and see the manager. \n\nAs Dillon walked to the bank, Charley Jackson caught up with him. \"Thought you'd like to know, someone broke Riley and Marsh out of jail. I was over to the other side of the county investigating a rustling yesterday; when I got back those boys were gone. Can't prove it but I know Cassidy broke em out.\"\n\n\"Well at least that's two less I've got to worry about,\" Dillon responded.\n\nThe ladies stayed in the store looking and shopping as women will do while Dillon went to the bank. The bank manager greeted him and explained that he held a bank draft for Dillon from the First Mercantile Bank in Boston. \"I just need you signature and we can deposit the money into your account Mr. Gallagher,\" he said handing Dillon the bank draft.\n\nDillon's jaw almost dropped when he saw the amount of money his father had left him. \"Am I reading this right?\" He asked the manager. \"It says ten thousand dollars.\"\n\nThe manager assured him that it was right and Dillon signed the draft. Wait until I tell Elizabeth he thought as he left the bank. As he got to the store he saw Cassidy go into the saloon. He usually doesn't travel without several men Dillon said to himself. This might be a good time to talk to him.\n\nAs he turned to go to the saloon Elizabeth and Eleanor came out to meet him. \"Elizabeth go back into the store. I have to go see someone in the saloon,\" he ordered. The tone in his voice left no room for debate.\n\nElizabeth started to argue but Eleanor took her arm and led her back into the store. \"There are times to argue with your man and times to obey,\" she explained to her daughter. \"This is one of those times to obey.\"\n\nDillon entered the saloon and saw Cassidy standing near one end of the bar. He walked over to where the bar turned to join the wall and stood there waiting for Cassidy to notice him. Cassidy hadn't seen him as he was staring down into the whiskey glass in front of him. \n\nThe bartender came over and Dillon ordered a whiskey and motioned for him to give Cassidy another. When the drink was put in front of him, Cassidy looked up and saw Dillon. His face got pale and he looked around as if looking for some of his men.\n\nDillon walked down the bar to him. \"Cassidy I warned you once. You sent men to rustler our cattle and you had your men slap around a young woman. Leave the Edwards and the Triple E alone.\"\n\n\"I never ............\" Cassidy began but Dillon cut him off.\n\n\"You're a liar Cassidy. Those were your men following your orders. If the Sheriff could prove it you'd be in jail. I'll say it just one last time...leave us alone.\"\n\n\"Or what?\" Cassidy asked with false bravado.\n\n\"I'll kill you,\" Dillon answered. \"That's not a threat, that's a cold hard fact.\"\n\nCassidy heard the suppressed anger in the young man's voice and could see a death stare directed toward him.\n\n\"Make no mistake Mr. Carpetbagger, I won't warn you, I won't call you out, I'll just shoot you down like the mangy cur dog you are.\" Dillon turned his back and walked out of the saloon to rejoin Elizabeth and Eleanor. \n\n\"Who'd you go see?\" Elizabeth asked still a little upset at being ordered around.\n\n\"I had a talk with Cassidy and suggested he leave us alone, is all. C'mon let's get back home.\"\n\nOn the ride back to the ranch, first Elizabeth and then Eleanor tried to get Dillon to tell them exactly what he said to Cassidy. Finally Dillon said, \"I told him he couldn't run us off and to leave us alone. I also told him if he wanted to buy the ranch to make a decent offer for it. That's all. Now please, let it be.\"\n\nNeither of them believed Dillon's explanation. They believed there was more to the meeting with Cassidy than Dillon said but decided to stop questioning him about it. \n\nI'll get him to tell me later, Elizabeth thought with a little smile. Later that evening on the porch after supper, she leaned against Dillon and reach up to kiss him. Elizabeth tried to coax the truth of Dillon's meeting from him. He responded to her kiss and hug but refused to say anything more about Cassidy.\n\n\"You can be an exasperating man Mr. Gallagher,\" Elizabeth said as she held on to his arm.\n\n\"And you are a temptress Miss Edwards,\" he answered. \"But I've said all I'm going to say about that meeting.\"\n\n******************\n\nThe next three weeks were a whirlwind of activity for the Triple E and its crew. Eleanor and Elizabeth had to make several trips into Prescott for many errands pertaining to the wedding; either Oso or Dillon went with them every time. The plans were finalized with the pastor and invitations to a few friends were delivered. Elizabeth decided she would wear her mother's wedding dress but did buy a new veil. \n\nDillon's frock coat, collared shirts, and wool pants from when he was a deputy would do fine for his wedding day. Ethan wanted to dress in a frock coat like Dillon so Eleanor had the seamstress in town make one for him. She also had the lady make a collared dress shirt for Oso; it was next to impossible to buy readymade clothes for the big man.\n\nThe wedding was on a Saturday at 2 PM with a private reception at the hotel for a few close friends. Oso did double duty by walking Elizabeth down the aisle and standing as Dillon's best man. Ethan escorted his mother to her seat in the front of the church looking proud in his new clothes.\n\nDillon, Elizabeth, Eleanor, and Ethan were driven by Oso to the hotel in a surrey decorated for the occasion. As Dillon helped his bride down from the coach, Cassidy and five of his men were riding by. They stopped their horses and stared. Then Cassidy rode closer to Dillon, motioning for one of his men to follow him.\n\n\"Gallagher,\" Cassidy called loudly and when Dillon turned toward him he said. \"I had a friend of mine do some checking up on you. There's warrants on you from San Antonio and Laredo. He also said you were friends with Creed Taylor and John Wesley Hardin. You a gun fighter like Hardin?\"\n\nDillon fixed a cold eye on Cassidy but didn't say anything. He was very aware that he was unarmed. Cassidy had his hand on his gun butt. \n\n\"What'd you have to say about that gun fighter?\" Cassidy asked sarcastically.\n\n\"Could be, but I've never seen those warrants.\" Dillon continued to stare at Cassidy and then added, \"What'da want Cassidy?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to introduce you to Bill Wilson here, he's my new hand.\" Wilson slowly raised one hand and touched the brim of his hat toward Elizabeth.\n\n\"From over Abilene way?\" Dillon asked. Wilson nodded and Dillon said, \"I've heard of you.\"\n\nElizabeth saw the way Dillon's eyes turn cold and felt his body tense. She pulled gently on his arm trying to get him to come inside the hotel. He didn't turn his head but said, \"Elizabeth go inside please.\" She realized that this was another one of those times that she should do as he told her.\n\nWilson watched Elizabeth and Eleanor enter the hotel. \"Right nice little filly you got there,\" he said. \"Be a shame to make her a widow so soon after her wedding day.\" Wilson returned his attention to Dillon. \"What did you hear Gallagher? Did you hear how fast I am with this?\" He asked patting the pistol on his hip.\n\nDillon with a small grin replied, \"No that wasn't it. I heard Bill Hickok ran you out of Abilene about a year ago.\"\n\nWilson's hand went to his gun but before he could draw he heard a voice from slightly behind him. \"You pull that hog leg and I'll arrest you Mr. Wilson. You too Cassidy.\" The two men looked over their shoulders at Sheriff Jackson holding a scattergun pointed at them. \n\nCassidy said, \"Just serving some arrest warrants Sheriff.\"\n\n\"First of all Cassidy, you're not the law; you don't have the right to arrest anyone. And second, those Texas wants aren't any good here in Arizona.\" Jackson paused and then said, \"I suggest you go and attend to your business Cassidy.\"\n\nThe whole time he was talking, Jackson never lowered the shotgun, keeping it aimed at Cassidy and Wilson. Cassidy sawed at his reins, pulling his horse around and rode out of town. \n\nBefore he followed his boss, Wilson looked at Dillon and said, \"I'll see you again Reb.\"\n\nDillon nodded and replied, \"Be looking forward to it Blue Belly.\"\n\nWhen the men had ridden away Dillon turned to Jackson as he lowered his shotgun. \"Thanks Charley. It could have got right interesting if you hadn't come along.\n\n\"Didn't want to see a good party break up before it even got started,\" Charley said with a smile. \"Let's get a drink.\"\n\nDillon entered the hotel and Elizabeth ran to him as he held out his arms to her. \"Who is Wilson? You said you heard of him.\"\n\n\"Not today honey. This day is all about us,\" he replied.\n\nThe party was about four hours of good food, drinks, and jokes told at the newlywed's expense. Eleanor, Ethan, and Oso had arranged rooms at one of the boarding houses for the night. Elizabeth and Dillon stayed at the hotel; it was as close to a honeymoon as they were going to get.\n\nIt was after midday before the Triple E group could get started back to the ranch. The ride was slow as most everyone was still tired from the reception. Even Dillon was a little under the weather. It's been a lot of years since I've had that much to drink, he said to himself. Good thing I don't plan on getting married again; don't know if I could stand the party.\n\nElizabeth waited until they had turned off the main trail and started the last mile to the ranch house before asking, \"Okay Dillon, who is this Wilson?\"\n\n\"He's a hired gun. It doesn't matter to him what the job is; he'll work for whoever pays the most.\"\n\n\"What was that about Bill Hickok running him out of Abilene?\"\n\nDillon smiled a little. \"Wilson was in Abilene and put the word out that his gun was for hire. Hickok didn't like it and confronted Wilson in the saloon. Wild Bill told him to get out of town or go pay the undertaker for his upcoming funeral. Not many want to face Hickok so Wilson left town that afternoon.\" Dillon chuckled and added, \"I guess it's a sore spot with Wilson.\"\n\nAs they rode up to the ranch house, Dillon felt that something wasn't right. The after effects of the party the previous night dropped away. He told the ladies and Ethan to stay mounted. He got off his horse and drew his pistol and Oso climbed down holding his rifle. The two men scouted around trying to see what was wrong or out of place. After checking the house they went to the barn. \n\nThey saw their milk cow lying in the corral; her throat had been cut. The blood hadn't had time to dry so she'd been killed sometime that morning. Inside the barn someone had led Dillon's horse Buddy out of his stall and shot him in the head.\n\n\"Who could have done this?\" Elizabeth asked. She had tears running down her cheeks. Eleanor was shocked at the brutality to the animals. Ethan had a grim look on his face; a look much too old for a boy his age. He had raised the cow from a calf.\n\nDillon and Oso looked at each other knowing that Cassidy was involved. They used the two mules, which surprisingly hadn't been harmed, to drag the dead animals away. That night for the first time everyone slept in the big house. The next morning Dillon made sure that all the defenses were ready in case Cassidy or some of his men came back. \n\nOne of Cassidy's men rode up to the ranch house alone around 10 AM. \"Cassidy said to tell you he'll be waiting for you at the saloon. He said that he'll burn the house next if y'all don't leave.\" His message delivered, the man turned and rode back toward town.\n\nElizabeth watched as Dillon saddled Buck and got ready to return to Prescott. \"You're going to talk the Sheriff aren't you? Please let him handle this Dillon,\" she said. She was confident that Dillon could take care of himself but Cassidy had several hands working for him. Not to mention the hired gun, Bill Wilson.\n\n\"Cassidy will swear that all his men were working and weren't involved in killing our stock. The Sheriff can't do anything without proof,\" Dillon said. \"Cassidy's tired of waiting and won't stop until he's forced you off the Triple E. It's time to put an end to this.\"\n\n\"Momma, Oso, stop him. He can't face Cassidy by himself,\" Elizabeth pleaded.\n\n\"You don't have to do this Dillon,\" Eleanor said. \"I'll sell Cassidy the ranch and we can go someplace else.\" \n\nDillon smiled at his mother-in-law. \"What kind of man would I be if I let Cassidy force us out of our home, Eleanor?\"\n\nEleanor returned Dillon's smile and nodded. She turned to Elizabeth and said, \"He has to go. No man can back away from this type of trouble.\"\n\n\"Oso and I are coming with you then,\" Elizabeth said firmly.\n\n\"No. I know you can shoot as good as any man but if you're there I'll worry about you instead of what I need to do. About an hour after I leave, y'all get to Sheriff Jackson. If something happens to me he can protect you and help you get out of town,\" Dillon told them.\n\nDillon could see that Oso was planning on coming with him. \"Oso, I need you to stay with them.\" He started to argue but Dillon cut him off. \"Amigo, take care of my family for me.\"\n\nOso nodded and went to the corral to saddle the horses. Eleanor and Ethan went into the house to pack some clothes and personal things to take with them, leaving Elizabeth and Dillon alone on the porch.\n\nElizabeth put her arms around Dillon's waist, put her head on his chest, and just held on. She knew she couldn't stop him from facing Cassidy but she had to try. \"You could be killed, you know? Where would that leave me?\"\n\nDillon ran his hand over her hair and down her back. \"When I left Virginia the last time, my father asked me what I was looking for; I couldn't tell him. Now I know, because I've found it. A woman to love and be my partner, a family, and a home. I can't let some carpetbagger son of a bitch take it from me.\"\n\n\"But Momma and I don't even like this place. You heard what she said, she wanted to live in town and teach school. Do you want to die over a piece of land that we don't care about?\"\n\n\"I also heard her say that the Triple E is your father's legacy and she wouldn't be forced off this ranch. I won't be forced off either; it's my home too. When I stop Cassidy we can sell out and move on if you like; but not because he ran us off.\" Dillon kissed her and mounted Buck. He sat and looked down at Elizabeth for ten seconds or so and then turned and rode toward Prescott.\n\nElizabeth watched him ride away and then returned to the house. Eleanor handed her an envelope with Elizabeth's name on it. \"Dillon left this for you,\" her mother said.\n\nShe opened it and read the letter inside. After reading it the tears that she had held back while talking to Dillon flowed down her cheeks. \n\n\"What does it say child?\" Eleanor asked seeing the tears. She put her arm around her daughter.\n\n\"It says that if he doesn't come back for us to take the money in his account at the bank and find a new place to live,\" Elizabeth answered. \"Oh Momma,\" she said as she slumped down onto a chair.\n\nOso entered the kitchen and walked over to Elizabeth and handed her a Winchester. \"Ni\u00f1a, come we must hurry. I have the horses saddled.\"\n\nConfused, she looked up at the big man. \"But Dillon said to wait an hour and then go to Sheriff Jackson's.\"\n\nEleanor looked at Oso and nodded. \"Elizabeth I told you there are times that you have to obey your man. Well this is one of the times that you have to disobey. Ethan and I can make it to Charley's just fine. You and Oso go help Dillon.\"\n\nOso saw Elizabeth gather herself and stand up with a purpose. \"If we ride hard and take the old trail we can get to town before Dillon.\" She hugged her mother and Ethan and walked quickly to the horses. Elizabeth waited for Oso to mount up and then put the spurs to her horse.\n\n***************\n\nDillon was less than a mile from the outskirts of Prescott when he saw Cassidy's hired gun Wilson sitting on his horse in the middle of the trail.\n\nWhen Wilson saw him he sat up straighter in his saddle and waited for Dillon to get closer. \"Thought I'd meet you out here Gallagher, away from Cassidy and the others.\"\n\n\"Why's that Wilson?\" Dillon asked.\n\n\"I wanted you all for myself. You insulted me that day in front of the hotel. No man insults me and lives,\" Wilson explained. As he finished speaking he pulled his gun.\n\nWilson fired first but a split second later Dillon's shot rang out. The gun fighter dropped his pistol and looked down at his chest; surprised at the pain and the blood starting to seep out of the hole in his shirt. He looked in disbelief at Dillon and fell off his horse.\n\nDillon rode closer and looked down. \"Guess you weren't as fast as you thought Wilson,\" he said as the man on the ground shook once and laid still. Dillon continued into the town; ignoring for the moment the wound in his left side.\n\nAs he rode Dillon thought, maybe there's something to the poem and ledge. First I'm willing to sacrifice myself in a war that was lost the day it started for a cause I didn't believe in. Then in San Antonio and later in Laredo I was willing to sacrifice myself fighting the bastards that tried to kill me, instead of walking away. And now, I put myself between Cassidy and people I love even though I'm outnumbered. Maybe I am Winterborn.\n\nDillon was losing a lot of blood and almost passed out once. He pulled Buck up in front of the bank, slowly dismounted, and tied him to the rail. As he tied the horse he softly quoted to himself:\n\n \"And in the fury of this darkest hour\n I will be your light\n You've asked me for my sacrifice\n And I am Winterborn\"\n\nHe saw one of Cassidy's men leaning against the hitching rail in front of the saloon. When the man saw Dillon he hurried inside. As Dillon walked toward the saloon, Cassidy and two men stepped out to meet him. Cassidy looked around for a moment, confused.",
        "\"Wilson won't be joining us carpetbagger. I left him on the trail outside of town,\" Dillon said with steel in his voice. He was swaying on his feet a little but his mind was clear and sharp. He had entered into that cold mind set he always got before a battle.\n\nThe next time Dillon swayed the man on Cassidy's right drew his pistol; before he could aim at Dillon a rifle shot rang out. The man took two steps backwards and dropped to the ground. The cowhand on Cassidy's left never quite got his hand all the way to his gun before he was knocked down by another rifle shot.\n\nDillon didn't turn his head to see who had fired the rifles and continued to concentrate on Cassidy. \"Looks like that leaves just you and me Mr. Carpetbagger,\" Dillon said challenging Cassidy.\n\nCassidy took a step back. \"You're not running away from this like you did in Virginia Cassidy,\" Dillon said. The man could hear the hatred and anger in Dillon's voice. \"I told you I wouldn't call you out but that's what I'm doing. Draw your gun or be shot standing there,\" Dillon told him.\n\nHe reached for his piston and Dillon let him clear the holster before he pulled his Remington and put two bullets into Cassidy knocking him to the ground. Out of the corner of his eye Dillon saw Oso step out from behind a building on his left. Turning his head he saw Elizabeth emerge from a gangway on his right. Both of them carried rifles and hurried over to Dillon as he was unsteady on his feet.\n\n\"I told you to go to Sheriff Jackson and stay out of this,\" Dillon scolded Elizabeth with a smile.\n\n\"You really didn't mean it,\" she replied.\n\nHe swayed again, touched his bloody shirt, and crumpled. Before Dillon could hit the ground, Oso picked him up and started to the doctor's office at a run.\n\n*******************\n\nDillon thought he was dreaming but he couldn't wake up. He felt someone working on his side and the pain that went with it. Later he felt someone wiping his face with a cool wet cloth. He came back to the world and looked around. I'm on a bed someplace, he told himself. When he tried to sit up and move, pain shot through his side. He went back to sleep.\n\nThe next time he woke up he saw Elizabeth sitting on the bed holding his hand with her head and shoulders lying across his legs as she slept. Dillon pulled his hand free and caressed her face. When she opened her eyes at his touch he quoted \"She walks in beauty like the night.\"\n\n\"Dillon, you're awake,\" Elizabeth said with relief. She turned and yelled through the open bedroom door, \"Doc he's awake, he's awake.\"\n\n\"Alright my dear, take it easy or I'll have to take care of you too,\" Doc Reynolds said as he came into the room. \"And how are you feeling Dillon. Still a little foggy I guess.\" \n\n\"How bad did I get hit Doc?\"\n\n\"You were shot in the side; the bullet went through you without hitting any vital organs I'm happy to say.\" Reynolds pulled the bandage off of Dillon's side and examined the wound. \"Healing nicely, shouldn't give you a problem.\" Dillon tried to raise his head so he could look at his side but was too weak to do it.\n\nDoc Reynolds continued, \"From what I hear you were wounded before you got to town. I'm surprised that you didn't pass out from loss of blood.\"\n\nElizabeth took Dillon's hand again after the doctor finished. \"I saw you standing in the street with blood all down your left side,\" she said with tears in her eyes. \"I almost ran to you but Oso motioned for me to stay hidden.\"\n\n\"So you and Oso were there, I thought I was dreaming,\" Dillon replied. \"Where is the big guy?\"\n\n\"I'm right here amigo,\" Oso answered as he ducked his head and walked through the door way. \"I thought your Winterborn legend was going to take you from us this time.\"\n\nAt Dillon's surprised look, he added, \"You've been quoting that damn poem in your sleep. Senora Eleanor explained it to me.\" Oso looked at his friend and smiled. \"You read some strange things amigo.\"\n\n\"How long was I out?\"\n\n\"This is the fourth day. We were able to feed you a little soup but not much else,\" Elizabeth said.\n\n\"No wonder I'm so hungry,\" Dillon said. \"Can I get something to eat? A steak and some fried potatoes would do just fine.\"\n\nDoc Reynolds chuckled. \"You can have some thin stew and a little bread. When you get used to that we'll see about a steak.\" Turning to the others in the room he said, \"I think our boy will be fine.\"\n\nThat evening Sheriff Jackson came to visit Dillon. \"I didn't find out Cassidy was in town gunning for you until the shooting was all over. First I knew of it was when Eleanor and Ethan got to my place. By that time it was too late. Sorry I wasn't there to help you.\"\n\n\"Don't worry Charley, I had all the help I needed,\" Dillon said looking at Elizabeth and Oso. \"That was one time I'm glad they didn't follow orders.\" Pointing his finger at them he added, \"But don't make a habit of it.\" \n\nThe next day Dillon was able to sit up in bed and move without too much pain. He was still very sore but his wound was healing. Two days later he finally got the steak he'd asked for. Each day he gained strength and moved around more and more. Ten days after being shot he was back on his feet and ready to return to the Triple E.\n\nSheriff Jackson came to see Dillon again before he left for the ranch. \"Guess you won't have any more trouble out your way. It'll be good to go back to raising cattle and horses won't it?\"\n\nDillon smiled and nodded. Eleanor said, \"Charley I would have sold the place after John died but not to Cassidy. Now that he's gone, I guess we'll stay.\"\n\n\"But you fought Cassidy every step of the way. Why didn't you sell out to him?\"\n\n\"He tried to steal the place,\" Dillon said. \"Just like the carpetbagger he was back in Virginia. First he had John Edwards killed and then tried to scare Eleanor and Elizabeth into selling. His offer was less than half of what the Triple E is worth.\" He grinned at Eleanor and continued, \"There's nothing more stubborn than an Irish woman that thinks she's right.\"\n\nEleanor laughed and said, \"Unless it's an educated, poetry quoting, southern gentleman.\"\n\nWhen they got back to the ranch, Elizabeth insisted that Dillon take it easy for a few more days. He was regulated to cleaning weapons, oiling saddles, and a few times she allowed him to brush and curry the horses. Dillon even helped with the cooking a few nights.\n\nIt wasn't long and Dillon was back to full strength; although the area around the wound was still a little tender. They settled into a routine of the normal chores and working around the ranch.\n\nDillon and Elizabeth had moved some of the cattle to high country pastures and were returning home. They stopped on a hill overlooking the main house and buildings. \n\n\"Any quotes Dillon?\" Elizabeth asked laughing at her husband.\n\n \" So, we'll go no more a-roving \nSo late into the night, \nThough the heart be still as loving, \nAnd the moon be still as bright.\"\n\nDillon replied and then added, \"No need to wander like a tumble weed anymore. I've found a home.\"\n\nThe End"
