        "NOTE: This is book two in my Sergeant Mike's Miracle Tour series. The first, My Country Tis of Thee, is also posted in the Novels and Novellas section. While I suppose technically, you can read this story as a standalone, I believe it will be more poignant for those who have read My Country. \n\nAnd one more thing...a beta reader once said that reading this story made her feel as if she had PTSD right alongside Mike. That is perhaps the highest compliment I have ever received as a writer. It is also a trigger warning. Please be aware this story contains strong adult content (not of the usual kind found on Lit). \n\nOh, and this is NOT an erotic story. Just so you know that one and are not disappointed.\n\n***CHAPTER ONE***\n\nIt was after one in the morning when former Master Sergeant Michael Thomas O'Malley, United States Marine Corps, pulled his new Harley Davidson Road King into the dusty driveway. He was a man on a mission. Over fifteen hundred miles in two days, with only a brief stop to pitch a tent when he was too tired to continue. \n\nSergeant Mike seemed to be what the civilians called him. After over twenty years as a Marine that new nickname still rankled at moments, but what did they know of proper ways to address a non-commissioned officer.\n\nLowering the kickstand on his motorcycle that he had named Esther, he took off his red, white, and blue helmet. This far out of the city, the night sky was alight with stars and an almost full moon. They cast an eerie glow on the large, two-story white wood frame farmhouse in front of him. Mike smiled as he remembered the first time that he saw this place.\n\nHe had barely been eighteen when he met Billy Hall in basic training at Parris Island. The red-headed farm boy from Oklahoma and the smart-mouthed orphan from Boston had been an unlikely pair. But over those thirteen weeks of hell that was basic training, the two of them had become best of friends. The fresh-faced kid was a far cry from the tough types that had usually been Mike's friends, but Billy's natural smile and down-home friendliness had knocked the chip off Mike's shoulder. \n\nOf course, when graduation day came, Billy's parents had traveled from Oklahoma to South Carolina. The large, gruff man with the ruddy complexion and grey hair and the small red-headed woman had beamed proudly at their son, alongside his baby sister as well as an aunt and uncle from Georgia that Billy had stayed with after graduation. The uncle had been a Marine and encouraged the young man to enlist during that summer visit. \n\nWhat surprised Mike though was that on Family Day, they had all insisted he joined them in the tour of the Parris Island Museum. It touched something deep inside him that he had thought buried since that night when he was seven and had lost the only person that had ever or would ever love him. \n\nAfter the ceremony, he had hung back, uncomfortable with the hundreds of family and friends that celebrated this accomplishment with their sons and daughters, boyfriends, wives, and brothers. For Mike there was no one, there had not been since that night and he no longer cared. People and emotions were just messy complications that he did not need. \n\nBilly dragged his parents, Mister Clyde and Missus Lula, over where he stood alone and apart from the others. Mike smiled and made polite conversation. His friend was heading home for the ten-day leave before they were both off to infantry training at Camp Geiger. When they discovered that Mike had nowhere to go, Missus Lula insisted that he come with them. It had been the beginning. \n\nNearly a quarter of a century and this place looked almost the same as it had that day. Except that now the windows were boarded up and this once lively family farm was as barren as Mike's soul. \n\nHe shook his head and fought back the lump that rose in his throat at the memories of that day and the ones that followed. Staying in the spare room just down the hall from his friend, rising at dawn not to the shouts of their drill instructor but the sweet call of Missus Lulu, \"Breakfast is ready, boys.\"\n\nMike sighed as he dismounted the motorcycle and began to climb the few steps to the wrap-around porch. The old swing still hung from the roof that covered the porch. It creaked solemnly as it rocked gently in the breeze. Its song another eerie reminder of those few brief blessed days when Mike had glimpsed what others took for granted...family. \n\nHe dug deep into the pockets of his dusty jeans to retrieve the key they had given him back then. He could still see Missus Lulu's tears as she hugged both of them at the bus station. Mister Clyde had gripped his hand firmly as he passed the keyring to him. \"Consider this place your home now, son,\" the man said before gripping him about the shoulders in a bear hug that made Mike as uncomfortable as it had comforted.\n\nHe slid the key into the lock and turned it slowly. It stuck just a bit, a sign of disuse. How long had it been since anyone opened this door? Since they had placed Mister Clyde in the nursing home two years ago? He knew that Billy's little sister was busy with her own family in Chicago and he tried very hard not to judge the woman that had been only a little girl of eight or nine that first time he had visited. \n\nIt had been Labor Day weekend then too. He wondered if Honour, Oklahoma still had its annual county fair next weekend. Would there be fireworks? Then again, Mike had had enough of loud explosions and the smell of fresh gunpowder to last him a lifetime. Maybe the outsider would give it all a pass even if they did.\n\nMike did not bother trying to turn on the light. He knew that it wouldn't work, so he turned on the app on his phone that would suffice as a flashlight as he made his way past furniture covered in old white sheets and dust. \n\nSome people might think they resembled ghosts, but Mike lived with so many of those that he knew it was never as simple as white apparitions. No, ghosts were much more real than that. Dreams and memories that haunted not just your sleep but your waking moments as well. \n\nIt might have been a couple of years since that fateful leave when Mike and Billy's sister Becca closed up this place. They had come with one sole purpose: to put Mister Clyde into the assisted care facility, the new fancy term for a nursing home. Still, Mike had no trouble making his way through the dark house to the back porch off the kitchen. \n\nHow many nights had he and his men done patrols in utter darkness? Even without night goggles, his old eyes had acclimated themselves to the shadows. Though these at least were less likely to conceal enemies who could kill you with a single bullet, fired from a rooftop.\n\nHe sighed as he listened to the creak of metal on metal as he pulled open the rusty door to the circuit breaker box. He knew he was tired when his ghosts got the better of him like this; he thought as he flipped the switch. \n\nHe should probably head out to the back yard and prime the old pump that supplied the house with its water. But he was not up to it just then, besides there would probably be enough water left in the rusty pipes for a quick bath this night. He would handle the rest tomorrow after he checked in on Mister Clyde at the nursing home. But for right now, the order of business was a bath, even if it was cold and the water a bit brown. Then it was off to bed. \n\nHe was past lying to himself. He knew that as much as his body needed sleep, it was likely to come at a high price. The past week or so had been a rollercoaster ride, unlike any other. He had not fully comprehended just how much this retirement shit would eat at him. But the Corps was not just the only career he had ever known, but as this place and his time in East LA showed...it was family. The only family he had known since he was seven years old. \n\n\"Go to bed, old man,\" he spoke into the darkness as he made his way back through the living room and up the stairs. He was so tired he did not even bother to turn on the lights. He made his way down the hall to the guest room that had been his from that first visit. \n\nHe stopped and paused for a moment at the closed door next to it. He knew what it held. Everything would be just as Billy had left it that last Christmas they had spent here together. The old Polaroid picture of the two of them with Billy's girl. What was her name again? And his other best friend from high school? \n\nIt would still be stuck in the corner of the antique dresser, held in place almost magically across the decades between the cloudy mirror and the intricately carved wood. Suspended in time, just as his friend would forever be in his death. \n\nMike wondered whatever had become of them: Billy's friend and his girl. Missus Lulu said they had gotten married. That was the first time he heard that very un-Christian bitterness in the woman he had thought so gentle. She was upset at how quickly after Billy's funeral the couple had eloped. \"It just was not right, not decent,\" she had said on the phone when Mike spoke to them after returning from that first deployment with Desert Storm. \n\nToo often, he still thought about holding his friend as blood leaked from the corner of his mouth as Billy struggled to breathe. The tiny wound just beneath the name tag on his camouflage uniform did not look all that bad to Mike at first. There was only a small circle of blood around the entry wound. \n\nThat na\u00efve nineteen-year-old with more courage than good sense simply could not understand why his best friend could not breathe. It was not until their Corporal had torn Billy's lifeless body from Mike's arms that he had seen the gaping bloody hole that had once been his friend's shoulder. \n\nMike owed the man his life as he shook him from his dazed shock and reminded him of his duty. He still was not sure whether he owed Corporal Beaufort 'Chad' Wilson a debt of gratitude or a good beating for that one. Mike added another name to his mental list of old friends to check in on. It had been over fifteen years since he had heard from the man, just before he left the Corps. Mike still had his grandparents' number in his address book though.\n\nBut right now, he had other things on his mind. This final service to that laughing red-headed plow-boy and the family that had taken him into their home and their hearts. Even after they all lost the one thing that had held them together. \n\nRight now, he was here to offer what comfort he could to a dying man that most days did not remember his own name, let alone the son he had lost almost a quarter of a century before, or the orphaned best friend that they had accepted as one of their own.  \n\nHe pushed open the door to his room and fought back other memories as he tossed his motorcycle helmet and small backpack on the foot of the bed. He could smell the musty reminders that rose from the perfectly sewn multi-colored patchwork squares of another of Missus Lula's masterpieces. It was another reminder of the hundreds of minute details that this particular stop on his journey would entail. But those too would wait for the morning as he opened his bag, pulled a towel, and body wash from it. \n\nThe bathroom was just across the hall and with a simple pull on the cord, it glowed softly with light from the fluted wall sconce that hung next to the door. Most of the features of this house were as old as or older than he was, including the wiring as the light flickered for a moment before coming back on. He especially loved the large wrought iron and porcelain bear-claw bathtub that sat against the far wall beneath a tiny window that let light into the room without disturbing the privacy of bathers. \n\nHe turned the taps. It took a bit more effort because they were rusty from disuse. Mike quickly stripped out of his jacket, shirt, boots, jeans, and skivvies. There were only a couple inches of cold, muddy water at the bottom of the tub, but it was a far sight better than some places he had washed up. \n\nIt was every bit as cold as he had anticipated when his toe first touched it, but he had not planned on some spa experience. Just wash enough dirt and grime from his body to get a decent night's sleep. Not that that was likely, but he could try. He lathered his body and head. It had been only a couple of weeks since his last haircut, but already his high and tight was longer than he usually liked. \n\nHe chuckled as he thought about his friend Luke's long hippie locks that the man kept in a ponytail while he worked at his motorcycle shop where they had met. There was no reason now why he too could not grow his hair out. Though maybe not that long. \n\nHe had just been a green kid when his brown curls had joined the inches thick pile of hair on the barber's floor at Parris Island. Since then, it had never been long enough to curl. It certainly would not be brown anymore. No, at almost forty-one, his hair was more salt than pepper. \n\nMike pulled the plug and watched the water swirl around the plughole for a moment. How many young lives like Billy's had he seen needlessly spiraling down the drain of greed and power, controlled by men who had no real understanding of the realities of war? Even commanders like the Colonel, good Marines, got caught up in power struggles that cost good men their lives - and Sergeants on the front lines had even less control. Their only choice was to do the best they could to keep their men safe and bear the burdens when they failed.\n\nHe forced his tired, aching muscles to stand. This ride had been too far, too fast. But that was the story of his life. He reached for the towel and quickly dried himself. He wrapped it about his waist and gathered his clothes before stepping back across the hall to his room. \n\nHis actions were almost robotic as he hung his jacket on the hook on the back of the door and tossed the rest of his stuff into a pile in the corner. After he visited Mister Clyde tomorrow morning, he would get the well primed properly and do his laundry, even wash the bedding and hang it out to dry on the line out back. \n\n\"Damn, since when you got so domesticated, old man,\" he asked the stranger in the mirror. He stood for a long moment studying the road map of tiny lines across his forehead and around his eyes and mouth. They had not boarded up the windows on the second floor, so even in the soft moonlight filtering through the window, he could see them clearly. \n\nThey were just another reminder that he was getting older. Them, the aches, and pains in his knees and shoulders from too many long patrols and too many heavy packs over the years. His shoulders he could blame on too many kickbacks from gunfire in too many places. \n\nHe walked over to the window and lifted it, letting what little bit of breeze there was into the room, airing it out as Missus Lula would have called it. He sat on the bed and reached for his pack at the foot of it. Since he was all alone in the house, there was no reason to wear even his skivvies this night. But there was something in the pack he wanted. \n\nHe lifted the photo from the front pocket where he did his best to keep it safe from further fraying around the edges. It had come that way. When Tommy had pleaded with him to remove his Kevlar and reach into his pocket. Mike had known immediately what he wanted. The smoke from the IED had blurred his vision as he answered his friend's request, handing it to him. \n\nTommy had weakly shaken his head and pressed his bloody hand over Mike's, wrapping it about the photograph. If you looked closely, you could still see coopery brown stains on one corner - the young man's life's blood. \n\n\"Promise me, Mike, promise me...you'll take care of...her. Mama,\" he heard those words every fucking night as he closed his eyes. It was the one time in all their friendship that Tommy had called him by his name and not merely Master Sergeant or Top. Almost six fucking months since the damned IED had blown Tommy...\n\nHe stopped that line of thought, as much as he could anyway. He caressed the soft brown curls that hung about her light caramel face. She was smiling proudly in the picture. Of course, she was. It had been her only child's college graduation. Any mother would be proud, but especially a single one. \n\nHe bet she was not smiling much these days. And that was his fault. He always played these things over and over in his mind, like some fucking slow-mo on the big game. He spent hours, sometimes days looking for what he could have done differently. What more he should have done to save them. But it always came down to the same thing...nothing. \n\nAnd that hurt worst. Knowing that there was not a fucking thing he could have or should have done to save his friends. It was just one of 'those' things. Even as fucking unfair as it was. And it was unfair. He always came back to that one too. \n\nWhy them? Men like Billy with a loving family and a girl back home? Or Manny with his parents and sisters who had so many plans for him...and the son that would grow up never knowing what a good man his father truly was, how much he loved him? Or Tommy...the pain she must be going through now. He could not even imagine it. \n\n\"I'm sorry, Esther. If I could have taken his place, I would have. Would do anything to bring him back to you.\" \n\nMike felt them all. The loses of the men and women he had served with, who had died by his side and under his command. Desert Storm, Nairobi, Kosovo, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom or New Dawn or whatever the fucking bureaucrats behind the desks in Washington were calling it these days. \n\nWar. Death. Those were the only fucking names that mattered. The only ones that fit...no matter the location, the combatants, or the cause. War and death. \n\nHe looked at the fading photograph one more time. \"I would give anything to bring him back to you,\" he whispered as he brought it to his lips as he did most nights. \n\nThe fucking truth was that the death of her son bothered him the most. Because Mike had fallen in love with the woman. Through stories Tommy told of growing up, snippets of Skype calls that Mike had hidden in the shadows to overhear, and the couple of times that he had actually spoken to her himself. That last call would never leave him. \n\nHe remembered Luke's words about loving someone you knew you could never have. That was her. Esther. The only fucking time he had ever really fallen for a woman, and he could never have her. Because her only son's blood stained his hands, ...and his promise to the dying man to take care of his mother hung like a guillotine over his neck. \n\nYeah, that was another trip he would have to take. He knew that. Knew that no matter the pain of actually seeing her and knowing that she could never be his...he had a promise to keep. And Master Sergeant Michael Thomas O'Malley always kept his promise. Or hopefully, one day...died trying.\n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER TWO***\n\nDespite the late-night and less than peaceful sleep, Mike was up by 0600. Six in the morning, A.M., he reminded himself. Damn, adjusting to this civilian shit was harder than he had thought, when even the way you told time was different. He had tried lying in bed for a bit, but that only invited his demons to play in his still tired brain. \n\nSo, instead he got up and went out to prime the old well. It took him longer than he had thought it would, but then again, he had always been a 'city boy.' By the time he finished, he needed a real bath. For that he had to ignite the pilot light in the water heater and then wait half an hour for it to warm up. He used that time to drain the air and rusty water through the pipes. \n\nWhen he stepped fresh and clean from the tub, it was almost eight o'clock. That was better, he thought. He dressed and made a quick call to Maude Landon at Prairie View nursing home. The woman was busy and suggested that Mike wait until after ten to visit, once the staff had the chance to serve breakfast and get the patients settled. He was less than pleased with the delay but reluctantly agreed.",
        "That left him with an empty stomach and almost two hours to fill. Of course, there was absolutely nothing, not even instant coffee, in the kitchen. He added a trip to a grocery store to his list of errands for the day, but until then a few cups of hot coffee and a nice 'greasy spoon' diner breakfast sounded like a decent way to kill a couple of hours. \n\nHe stepped out onto the front porch, and the morning sun almost blinded him. In the light of day, he could see the gentle decay of a lifetime as dying dreams blew slowly away. He could see half-finished homes where once there had been rolling fields of grass, cattle, and horses. \n\nThey had sold all but a few acres of the homestead that had been in the family for over a hundred and fifty years to pay for the nursing home during Mister Clyde's final days. But it was sobering seeing the dry, red-beige dirt of the construction site that would soon be nothing more than another rambling sub-division to feed the urban sprawl of Tulsa, almost an hour away. \n\nHe shook his head at another symbol of the greed and hubris of the nation; he had sacrificed a lifetime serving. Greed and hubris that had been purchased with the blood of good men and women like Billy, Manny, and Tommy. He knew it was going to be a bad day when all he could think, 'was it worth it?' \n\nHe started towards the steps and heard the creaking of one of the floorboards. He tested it to see if it would hold his weight. Just barely. He shook his head, should he bother replacing the damned thing? In all probability, this place would soon be swallowed up in that urban sprawl too. The moment that Mister Clyde was gone he was sure that Billy's little sister would swoop down from Chicago to sell it off. It seemed such a waste.\n\nThat only brought him back to where he started...was it worth it? If it had been him that had taken that bullet all those years ago instead of Billy. His friend would have come home from Desert Storm, married that girl, and raised babies that would have ensured the continuation of the family dynasty for at least another two generations. But he had not, so it was up to Mike to stand in during the final days and hours of his father's life...and witness the demise of the American dream. Or one family's dreams. \n\n\"Damn it; I'll stop by the lumber yard too. Not much else to do around here than a few senseless repairs,\" he said as he looked at the old porch swing where Missus Lula had taught the city boy how to string beans properly, and Billy had impressed him with his knife skills by peeling a whole apple in one long strand. \"Some paint too.\"\n\nHe put the house keys in his pocket and pulled out the ones to his bike. In less than a minute he sat at the end of the long circular driveway. He knew that turning right it was a good ten miles or more to the next small town, and he could not even remember seeing a diner when he had passed through last night. Of course, it was late, so maybe without a lit sign he had missed it. But better to turn left towards Tulsa, he was almost guaranteed to find something that way. Besides, that was in the direction of the nursing home anyway.\n\nSure enough, it was only a couple of miles until he ran upon what in these parts passed for a town. A post office, small service station with a convenience store, a feed and seed and a half dozen houses tightly packed around major crossroads. \n\nMost important though was the ugly, light blue cinderblock building nestled between the gasoline pumps and the post office. Its fading white sign boasted 'Real Country Vittles' alongside the name Mom and Pop's Hole in the Wall. It sounded just about perfect as Mike pulled his motorcycle into the already packed small parking lot between a brand new SUV and a rusty old pickup truck.\n\nHe stored his helmet in its compartment and walked towards the glass door that mirrored the words on the sign. Stepping through that door was like stepping back in time to the 1950s - down to the red plastic-covered seats of the booths and the gingham checks of the tablecloths. The black and white photographs of the area and various local events just provided the finishing touch. \n\nThe blonde woman behind the register, who was serving customers, looked up and smiled. Then oddly, her brows furrowed. She looked vaguely familiar to Mike, but he could not place her. He had met a couple dozen people in town over the years when he visited the Halls, so that was more than possible. \n\nHer face looked a bit tighter as she forced another smile, \"Take a seat anywhere. I'll bring over some coffee as soon as I'm done ringing up these folks, sugar.\"\n\nMike nodded and found one of the smaller vacant booths not too far from the register. He studied the woman for a long moment trying to place her. He had dutifully gone to the local Baptist church with the Halls on a couple of occasions, especially the Memorial Day services when they read the names of all the local men killed in action going back to the founding of the town just after the Civil War. \n\nHad he seen the woman in church, maybe? He doubted though that he would remember any of the hundred or more random faces. The woman was not ugly, but neither was she especially pretty. So, why would he remember her face, but not a name or how he knew her? \n\nHe watched her as she smiled tightly as the last customer at the counter walked out the door. She turned and looked directly at him with an almost pained expression on her face. So, it was not his imagination. The woman knew him too. But from where? \n\nShe picked up the clear glass coffee pot behind the counter and walked towards the table where he sat. She half-smiled as she turned over the cup that sat on the saucer in front of him. That was when it all fell into place as she poured the aromatic liquid into it.\n\nHer once dirty blonde hair was streaked liberally with grey now, and there were lines about her mouth, crow's feet around her blue eyes that he thought was misting over with unshed tears at the moment. There were even a couple of deeper furrows on her brows as if she had spent too much time frowning over the past twenty-plus years. But still he could not remember her name.\n\n\"Brenda,\" she said as she took the seat across the booth from him. \"My name was Brenda Jo Sanders back then, but I'm not surprised you don't remember that after all these years.\" Her laugh sounded almost bitter, \"I'm more surprised that you remember me at all, Mike.\"\n\nHe nodded as he brought the cup to his lips. It was precisely what he needed this morning, especially in light of this latest turn of events. Although in a small town like Honour, Oklahoma, he supposed he should not be surprised. Perhaps he should be more shocked that he had not run into her on any of the half dozen or so visits he had made back here over the past quarter of century almost. \n\nThe woman stared at her hands that were clasped tightly in front of her on the gingham table cloth. She looked up and nodded as an elderly couple called out greetings as they headed towards the front counter to pay. The place was clearing out quickly it seemed. Mike noticed someone else he recognized as a tall, heavyset man about his age came through a swinging door that probably led to the kitchen.\n\n\"I see you remember Josh too,\" she smiled, and this time a gentle warmth reached her blue eyes. \n\n\"It was not the way Missus Lula thought it was,\" she stammered painfully.\n\nMike shrugged, \"You don't owe me any explanations. It's none of my business.\"\n\nShe nodded as she looked up at the man behind the register. The man that had become her husband just months after his best friend was killed in Iraq. Mike was not sure whether he was angry that they had found the happiness that had been denied Billy or if he was pleased that at least someone had managed to. \n\n\"You know we had to leave town after we got married,\" Mike noticed a tear finally slip from the corner of her eyes as it trailed a dark black streak down her right cheek.\n\nHe shook his head, \"No, I didn't. I'm sorry.\" Though he supposed, that explained why he had not run into them before. \n\n\"We only came back a year ago when Josh's dad retired. He knew that with all the kids grown and moving away, we were looking to make some changes. So, he thought that coming back here and taking over the restaurant might be good for us,\" the woman was rambling, talking about things that genuinely were none of his business but that was all right. He supposed he could listen if she needed to talk. Another duty he owed his long-dead friend perhaps?\n\nBut since he was not sure exactly what to say in this situation, he only nodded as he took another long swig from the cup almost draining it. She noticed when he sat it back down on the saucer and refilled it. Though this time, her hands shook a bit and a little of the hot liquid splashed onto the saucer and table. She reached for a napkin and cleaned it up in silence.\n\n\"I loved him, you know. I truly did. Well, as much as any seventeen-year-old kid can. Who knows what would have happened,\" her voice was strained as she began to wring her hands slowly. \n\nThey sat in silence for a couple of moments. Each lost in their thoughts of those 'might have beens' that never were. At last, she broke the silence as she looked back up at Mike. There were more of those dark streaks racing down both her cheeks then. Her voice cracked a bit as she spoke, \"I suppose I should get back to work. So, what you having, jarhead?\" \n\nMike forced a smile to answer hers, \"The biggest plate of greasy sausage, bacon, and eggs that you have sounds good to me.\"\n\nBrenda Jo nodded as she wiped those dark stains with the back of her hand smearing them further across her face, \"Just to warn you, doc says that shit will kill you, especially the way that Josh fries it.\" \n\nShe smiled as she looked across the room at the teddy bear, whom Mike noticed had been hovering near the register as they spoke and casting the occasional protective glance his way. \n\n\"The man can cook even better than his daddy. Always could. Damn him, he always got the highest grade in Home Ec, put all us girls to shame.\"\n\nHer face darkened once more as she stood up, \"Course our oldest is not far behind. He's joining us in the business.\" She frowned, \"Once he finishes his final tour, that is.\"\n\nMike frowned, \"Tour?\"\n\nShe nodded and wiped those tears once more, \"Yeah, do I even need to say? Marines, of course. Though as a Mama, I'm damned glad the boy wields a spatula in service of his country and not a gun.\"\n\nMike smiled as he drained the cup once more, \"Trust me, ma'am, that is a more highly valued skill than a good shot. Anybody can fire a gun, but making that shit taste decent takes real talent.\"\n\nShe laughed as she filled his cup one more time, \"I'll take your word for it. Well, let me get Josh started on a Hungry Man special for you.\" \n\nShe turned to head back into the kitchen but stopped just a step from the booth and turned again to face him, \"It really has been good to see you, Mike. I've wondered over the years whatever became of you.\"\n\nHe nodded as he turned the cup on the saucer, \"Yeah, nice seeing you too, ma'am.\" \n\nMike watched her disappear through those swinging doors, followed by the man, who had become her husband instead of the man, who had been friends to both of them. \n\nHe spent the next few minutes nervously studying the menu and not seeing a single word on the laminated plastic sheet. All of those what-ifs were back, ghosts that he lived with every moment of every day. Familiar but never totally comfortable. \n\nIt was not Brenda that brought him the massive plate of delicious smelling food, but some fresh-faced young beauty that reminded him of the girl she had once been. He wondered if the girl was one of the children that the woman had spoken of. But her darker hair and olive complexion belied that assumption. \n\n\"Thank you,\" he replied as she refilled his coffee cup. \n\nAs he brought that first bite of scrambled eggs and bacon to his mouth, he had to agree with the woman's assessment; the food was excellent \u2014 damned good. And for the next few minutes, he put all those demons aside and lived in the moment with hot coffee and great food. \n\nSometimes it was the simple things that made life bearable...when he could tear himself from the other that was. Then again, he knew it would be back; it was never that far from his shattered mind.\n\nThe place had practically cleared out by the time he finished his breakfast and another two cups of Joe. He looked around the almost empty restaurant, but neither Brenda nor the young waitress were about now. He rose slowly and tucked a five-dollar bill under the corner of his plate as a tip before walking over to the register to settle his bill. He noticed that there was a shiny silver bell next to the till and rang it a couple of times.\n\nIt was only a few seconds until the man stepped through the door, wiping his large hands on his white apron. \"What can I get you, man?\" he smiled as nervously as his wife had earlier.\n\nMike shook his head as he reached inside his wallet again and pulled out a twenty. \"Just wanted to settle my tab.\"\n\nThe man shook his balding head, \"Put that away. Your money ain't no good around here, buddy.\" \n\nHe held out his hand, \"Least we can do for Billy is feed you while you're here. What you doing back round these parts anyways? We heard that Missus Lula was dead and Mister Clyde was in a nursing home somewhere.\"\n\nMike nodded, \"Yeah, he is. But he's not doing well, so I came back to...\" He was not sure how to finish that statement...'watch the man die' did not seem right somehow. \n\nBut thankfully the man seemed to understand what he meant without the words, \"I'm honestly sorry to hear that. I know Missus Lula never forgave us. For marrying like we did. But we had our reasons.\" \n\nThe man looked about nervously as if trying to figure out what to say next. \"How long you gonna be in town for?\"\n\nMike shook his head, \"I don't know. As long as needed, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Where you staying, then?\"\n\n\"At the farm, well, what's left of it anyway,\" Mike replied. \n\nThe man nodded, \"Yeah, I was real sorry to learn that another family farm had been swallowed up by them city folks looking to escape the rat race. Of course, it wasn't so bad for business when they was building it all, but once the economy tanked, well, the construction company went bust and now it is all just sitting there turning to mud when it does rain and another dust bowl when it don't.\"\n\nMike nodded at the reminder of his part in that decision, but Billy's sister had been adamant that the only way they could afford the retirement home was to accept the offer on the land that adjoined the house. Only Mike and Mister Clyde banding together had stopped the woman from selling off the whole damned thing. \n\nBut he too regretted that the Hall farm that had been in the family for so many generations would never again be inhabited by it. Mike shuttered to think about what would become of the house which had once been so full of love and laughter. \n\nThe man broke his train of thought as he held out his hand, \"Josh, Joshua Hall. I figure after all these years you're probably no better with names than I am.\"\n\nMike frowned, he had forgotten that this man was Billy's cousin as well as his other best friend. \n\n\"Mike, Mike O'Malley,\" he said as he shook his hand.\n\n\"I remembered the Mike part at least,\" the giant chuckled as the bell above the front door chimed a new arrival. \n\nMike turned towards the door and stepped back in time. \"Hey, Dad, is Isabel still around?\"\n\nHe gripped the counter to remain on his feet. The young man looked exactly like Billy, right down to the high and tight haircut that marked him as a Marine despite the dusty jeans and faded t-shirt that he wore just then. Mike shook his head as he looked from the new arrival to the older man. \n\n\"Billy, I'd like you to meet Mike. He's an old friend of your namesake. They were best friends and served in Iraq together.\" \n\nThe man looked nervous as he turned to Mike, \"This is our oldest son, William Clyde Hall.\"\n\nMike held out his hand to the younger man, who even shared that same country boy smile that seemed to spread ear-to-ear. \n\nNone of it made sense. Or maybe it all did? Mike looked to Josh Hall as he took Billy's hand. He could almost feel the same tug, that instant bond that he had all those years ago when he had first met the boy's father. And there was little doubt in his mind that this young man was his best friend's child, not the man behind the counter. \n\nThe red around Josh's ears, the way he could not meet Mike's eyes, and the nervous crack in his voice when he spoke seemed to only confirm his suspicions. \n\n\"Like I said, don't worry about cooking while you are here. Take all your meals with us. On the house. It's the least we can do - for old friends.\"\n\nMike nodded his head, \"Thanks,\" was all he could manage to croak as he continued to pump the young man's hand. \"I will,\" he said as he finally released the young man's hand, looking around as nervously as Josh was. \n\n\"Guess I'll be seeing you around then,\" replied the spitting image of his dead friend. \"I'm helping the folks out while I'm on leave before my next deployment. At least when Isabel and I aren't looking at houses that is.\"\n\nJosh smiled, \"Yeah, he and Bel are getting married before he heads back. About damned time, he made an honest woman of that girl before my grandson starts kindergarten and people round here start talking. I keep telling the kid that some things never change in Honour...and being a bastard is one of them.\"\n\nThe look that the older men shared told the rest of the story as Mike said his good-byes and left the men to talk about business, houses, and all the other things that fathers and sons did. \n\nThe truth was that the man had stepped up and honored his friendship with Billy the only way he knew how - claiming a child that was not his own and from the looks of things being the kind of father to him that Billy would have been...had that damned bullet not torn apart their whole world. \n\nAs for Mike, he would have time to think about it all later. Right now, he had his own duty to their dead friend to fulfill as he looked back at the plain cinderblock building. Yeah, he would definitely take them up on their kind offer. \n\nNot just because the man's cooking was a damned far sight better than anything he could manage, which was very little. But because Mike needed to learn more about this young man, whose existence was a huge surprise. One thing he had learned from his time in LA was that sometimes life's twists and turns really did work out. \n\nFor some people anyway...not that they ever could for orphans who had seen too much death and never known real love. The little kid always on the outside looking in. But that was okay - as long as it did for good people like the Hernandezes and Luke Davidson. \n\nAs long as there was some good and light in this world to balance the dark, then it had been worth it all. Something worth fighting for...worth sacrificing for...maybe even worth dying for. Then again, he would not know that. He was still stuck among the living while men like Manny, Billy, and Tommy had paid that price.\n\nHe had others to pay though; he thought as he started Esther's engine and turned the motorcycle towards the town and Prairie View nursing home. \n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER THREE***\n\nThe ride to Prairie View nursing home was not that long; less than half an hour. Mike arrived about five minutes before ten, the time that Miss Landon had requested. He considered waiting outside but figured what difference did a few minutes make. When he walked through the double sliding glass doors, he wished he had. Pandemonium reigned. \n\nA half dozen or so elderly people, most still in their pajamas milled about the area that had a couple of old couches and a television set. He was not sure which was louder the TV or the people, who all seemed to be speaking at once. He sympathized with the old man sitting alone on the couch with both hands covering his ears. Mike thought the man might have the right idea as he approached the reception desk to ask for Maude Landon, but he saw no one around. At least no one he felt capable of giving him directions. ",
        "A small woman slumped over a walker approached him, \"Joe! Joe, why did it take you so long? I have been waiting here with all these crazy people for hours. You know better than to leave me alone like this, sweetie,\" she said as she saddled up to him and batted her fading blue eyes that were half-hidden behind thick bifocals. He was not sure whether to be flattered or frightened of her misplaced advances. \n\nHe shook his head slowly and tried to extricate himself from the death grip that her frail and bruised hands had on his forearm. He was surprised at how strong she was. \"Ma'am, I'm truly sorry, but I'm not your Joe. My name is Mike, Mike O'Malley.\"\n\nThe woman let go of his arm then, but only to begin pulling at her short white curly hair that already seemed a tangled mess. \"No! No! Joe! You're my Joe. I've been waiting so long for you, honey. I'd know you anywhere.\" She screamed as she leaned up and tried to kiss Mike right on the lips, only the quick reflexes of a Marine saved him from the embarrassing situation. \n\nMike was at a complete loss as to what to do next. Then a woman a few years older than he was appeared out of a doorway down the corridor to the right. She shook her head as she quickly assessed the situation and walked towards them, \"Mary, Mary,\" she called in a soothing voice that you might use with a toddler. \n\nThe older woman turned and looked at her for a long moment, then as if something clicked in her head, she smiled in greeting, \"Maude, come meet my husband, Joe. See, I told you he would come back for me,\" she beamed as she once more latched on to Mike's forearm.\n\nThe newcomer smiled apologetically at him as she tried to pry the woman's hands away, \"Mary, Joe is dead. Remember, he died in Vietnam. You have all of his mementos in your room,\" she cooed as she tried to turn the elderly patient down the other corridor. \n\nThis only agitated the situation more as Mary's grip on Mike tightened to the point that her nails began to bite into his flesh. She shook her head and stared up at him with big pleading eyes, \"No,\" she cried. \"No, tell her, Joe. Tell her that you came back for me. Just like you said, you would. Tell her, Joe.\"\n\nMike looked to Maude, the woman he had come to see for very different reasons, for guidance. She shrugged and shook her head, looking almost as pleading as the woman. \n\nHe nodded his head and patted the thin, purplish hand on his arm, \"It'll be fine, Mary. I came back,\" his voice cracked at the words as he thought of the long-dead Joe. And of all the other Joes. \n\nThis woman was another reminder of the high price of freedom - those loved ones left behind. Almost fifty years, the man had probably been dead longer than he had been alive, but still, this fragile creature clung to his memory as tightly as she did his arm. He wanted to feel sorry for the man, but could not. How must it have felt to be loved so deeply? It was something Mike had never known, not since he was seven years old. \n\nHe watched as the woman's face transformed. It lit from within as the years melted away. Beneath the wrinkled skin and mussed, thin grey hair, he saw her. The beauty that this woman once had been. His throat tightened at the pain she must have felt all those years ago. A pain so deep that even after all these years, she still could not face its finality. \n\nMaude nodded, and her smile turned to one of gratitude as the woman instantly became more pliable, \"Mary, let me help you back to your room. We need to get you dressed and ready. Frank will be here soon. You remember him, don't you? Your husband. Frank.\"\n\nMary shook her head, \"No, not Frank. Joe. Joe is my husband,\" she protested as she laced her arm through his and pressed her diminutive body against his side. \n\n\"Joe,\" she exclaimed in the same voice that a toddler would use to get its way.\n\nMike inhaled deeply and wished he had not. The place smelled. Worse than some battlefields. While the smell of fresh gunpowder was missing, the other familiar smell of death and urine and fecal matter mixed with the odors of morning breakfast, the institutional plastic trays of which he noticed stacked on a cart down the hallway that Maude was still trying to pull the woman towards.\n\n\"Mary, let's go with the woman. You can freshen up; then we can talk. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\" he suggested with a smile as he too turned in the direction that Maude led.\n\nOnce more, she shone, beamed like a bright summer sun, as she leaned her head against her shoulder, \"Yes, Joe. Yes, I'd like that so much. I've been waiting for you for so long.\" \n\nShe lifted her eyes as if something suddenly occurred to her, \"Where have you been? What took you so long? You said it would only be a few months. No more than a year and you would come home to me. Why did it take you so long?\" she pleaded like that child.\n\nThe tightness in his throat threatened to cut off his air at the pain in the woman's faded eyes. Thankfully the arrival of a younger woman dressed in bright pink scrubs saved him from answers that he did not have. \n\n\"Miss Mary, I've been looking for you. I ran your bath and have everything laid out for you. You want to look your best when Frank and your daughter get here, don't you?\"\n\nThe woman again shook her head and held more tightly to Mike's arm, \"No! Not Frank. My husband is Joe. See, he came back for me.\"\n\nMike smiled weakly at the nurse as she continued speaking, \"Yes, Mary, I see, but you still want your bath, don't you? So, you can get all dolled up for him, right?\" \n\n\"Yes, yes, of course. What was I thinking?\" smiled the elderly patient as she turned back to him. \"You'll wait here for me, won't you, dear? Just like I've waited for you.\" \n\nShe leaned in then and whispered, \"I promise it will be worth it. I bought a nice sexy black lace thing just for your homecoming.\"\n\nMike wanted to laugh at the thought of this woman in her seventies in a black lace nightie. But in her mind, she was not. She was still that young bride, wife, girlfriend that she had once been, waiting for her lover to return from war. \n\nHis chest tightened at the reminder of Rachel and of the woman he had met again this morning after all these years. Was this their fate too? Trapped in some cruel time warp of memories too painful to remember and too sweet to forget. \n\n\"I'll wait. I promise,\" he assured her. She stood on tiptoes and kissed his cheek. He watched then as the nurse led her down the corridor. They chatted away like best friends in high school, conspiring on the big Friday night date. \n\nHe turned when the other woman exhaled loudly. She held out her hand, \"Thank you, Mike. I'm assuming you are Master Sergeant O'Malley,\" she said.\n\nHe took the hand she offered and shook it firmly as he assessed the woman. Her greying hair was cut in a functional pixie style. She was on the short side and carried a few extra pounds under her slightly wrinkled blue polyester business suit. Her makeup was minimal and tastefully done. \n\nCompetent and yes, very functional were words he would use to describe her. It was very much in keeping with his few brief encounters with the woman over the phone and her weekly email updates. \n\n\"Just Mike is fine Miss Landon,\" he replied.\n\nShe smiled, but it did nothing to soften her austere appearance, \"Maude, then, Serg...\" She caught herself as she turned back towards the other hallway opposite the direction that the nurse and Mary had disappeared, the one from which she had come. \n\n\"Would you care to follow me, Mike? We can talk in my office. Then I'll take you to see Mister Hall.\"\n\nMike nodded and fell into step behind the woman. Her office was every bit as functional as the woman. Only a few certifications graced the plain white walls, not a family portrait or personal item in sight. Even the coffee mug on the corner of her desk was embossed with the logo and words Prairie View Assisted Living. \n\n\"Have a seat,\" she said as she walked behind the overly large, dark wooden desk that dwarfed her. \n\nShe pulled out a brown leather chair and sat down, nervously shuffling some papers, \"Thank you for your help with Mary. I am sorry you had to see that, but I am afraid we are a bit short-staffed with it being the end of summer. Labor Day being next weekend and all.\"\n\nMike nodded as if he understood fully though the concept was utterly foreign to him. In the military, you soon lost track of things such as holidays. You had a job to be done, same as any other day. \n\nOf course, some major ones like Thanksgiving and Christmas, you might have some big Hollywood star or country music singer show up for the publicity. Maybe a special dinner even, but that was about it. And since he had never been much of a country music fan, holidays were indeed nothing special to him, give him classic rock any day. \n\nThe woman would not meet his eyes as she began to speak again, \"Anyway, I know that was not what brought you here. And I do thank you for coming. Family involvement can make all the difference, especially in...\" \n\nShe paused again and finally lifted her eyes to meet his gaze, \"Especially in the final days. While I know that you aren't exactly family, well, frankly you have always been more conscientious in responding to my emails and calls than Mister Hall's daughter.\"\n\nShe blushed and looked down again as if perhaps she had said something that she should not have. She shuffled more of those papers on her desk nervously before clearing her throat and looking up, \"What do you know of dementia, Alzheimer's?\" she asked.\n\n\"Honestly, Miss Landon,\" he paused at the firm look she gave him. \"Maude,\" he started again, \"Not a damned thing. Only the little bit that I learned in the brochure that Mister Clyde gave me when he first told me about the diagnosis.\"\n\nShe nodded and sighed, \"Most people don't. In a society with an aging population, it is this nation's dirty little secret. It seems that we, as a nation and often even the families themselves, want to simply lock them away and forget as surely as those afflicted with the illness.\"\n\n\"I know it was an unpleasant experience, but Mary is an excellent example of the illness. Though her second husband, Frank, and their daughter are almost daily visitors, she rarely remembers them. Instead, she pines for the man she lost almost half a century ago.\" \n\nShe sighed heavily and shook her head, \"I admire Frank. To come every day to visit a wife that not only does not remember you but talks incessantly about another man she loves must be a very painful experience.\"\n\nMike nodded, trying even to fathom how that must be for this other, unknown man. But it was a mind-boggling endeavor. He shook his head slowly as the woman continued.\n\n\"Of course, as the disease progresses, things become even worse. The illness makes even the most basic bodily functions like eating, drinking, or relieving oneself impossible. Basically, these once vibrant people become children and eventually babies once more. Unable to see to even their most basic needs on their own.\" \n\nShe met his eyes, \"That I am afraid is where Mister Hall has gotten to at this point.\"\n\n\"I am saying all this now so that when you do see him, you are prepared. The man that you knew is gone already. Although he might have a few more good moments that is unlikely.\" \n\n\"Mister Hall will not recognize you. He may not even respond when you call his name. He often sits staring out the window all day silently. His mind is locked someplace that we can never understand...and his body too is failing now,\" she explained. \n\n\"Just as the mind slowly wastes away into nothing, so too do their bodies over time. Feeding becomes increasingly problematic. As a result, they lose weight, muscle mass, vitality. Until their bodies simply give out.\"\n\nMike nodded as he tried to prepare himself for the reality that this woman spoke of. He asked the one question that plagued him most, \"How long? How long does he have?\"\n\nShe shook her head, \"That I cannot tell you. These things are so variable; I simply don't know, not even the doctors do. But Mister Hall is clearly in the final stages of the disease's progression. Days or maybe a few weeks.\" \n\n\"I called you when I did because I know how much you wanted to be here...if you could, that is. Of course, I understand with your job and all that you may only be able to stay a short time, so I wanted to call you early.\"\n\n\"Thank you for that, Maude. The truth is that I am here for the duration. I retired from the Marines last week,\" his throat squeezed out the words of truth, but just barely, \"No place else I have to go or be anymore.\"\n\nThe woman nodded as if she could understand that completely, \"Yes, yes, now I remember you mentioning that on the phone. Well, normally visiting hours here are ten in the morning until three in the afternoon.\" \n\n\"That allows my staff to get the patients up and ready in the morning and also to settle them each evening. Routine is crucial to maintain their emotional and physical wellbeing. And often the patients themselves tire very easily.\"\n\n\"But, especially as the disease progresses, we bend those rules a bit. Allow extra time for families to say their goodbyes.\" She sighed heavily once more. \n\n\"And honestly, Mike, my staff is stretched thin. We run this place on a shoestring budget. My nurses often have ten sometimes even fifteen patients to care for each day. So, any help they get from families is greatly appreciated. Because as I said, too many of those families bring their loved ones here and leave them.\"\n\nMike could hear the anger and bitterness in the woman's voice. Although he did not know her job, her burdens, it was a frustration he could understand all too easily. \n\nHe always struggled with orders that made no logical sense, with a command that was so out of touch that they made decisions which could easily cost men their lives, good men. He had often found it challenging to obey such orders, commands that he knew placed his men in more peril than was sometimes necessary. So, on some visceral level, he could empathize with this woman's righteous indignation at those who should have cared but did not.\n\n\"I'll do whatever I can for Mister Clyde,\" he promised for the man that had been more a father to him over the years than the sperm donor, who had impregnated his mother, beat her and him every chance he got, and ultimately... Mike did not want to go down that road at the moment. \n\nThose other demons would wait. Wait until his final few missions were accomplished. \n\nAnd right now, this mission was to care for his best friend's dying father as his own. \"Can you take me to him, please?\" he asked.\n\nThe woman nodded her head as she stood up, \"Of course, Ser..., of course, Mike,\" she stuttered. She led him to the door and stood back, motioning for him to go first. They turned down the hall, following deeper into the maze of corridors and rooms. \n\nAt the end of the hall, she stopped. \"As I said, Mike, Mister Hall is not the man whom you remember,\" she smiled tightly as she opened the door and stepped back. \n\nBut nothing she could say might have prepared Mike for the skeleton that sat motionless in an over-sized chair facing the open window. Nothing.\n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER FOUR***\n\nMike's stomach growled just as he was putting the final nail in the new board on the front porch. He realized that he had been so busy throwing himself into hard work around the farm in a vain attempt to block out most of this day that he had forgotten to eat anything since breakfast that morning. \n\nLooking up, he noticed that the sun was already setting, which this time of year meant it would be close to eight or nine o'clock. Josh and Brenda's caf\u00e9 would probably be closed by now. Besides, he was not sure that he was ready to face all the complexities of that situation...not just yet.\n\nHe sighed as he sat back on his heels and wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. He had spent most of the day just sitting with Mister Clyde. At first, he had tried talking with the old man, reminding him of Billy and sharing stories of Parris Island with him. \n\nBut by the time his lunch tray arrived, Mike had learned that he was talking more to himself than the shell of the man he had once seen as a surrogate father. Instead, he had focused upon getting even a few bites of the decidedly bland and unappealing food into the man, but that too had proven futile. \n\nMaude had stopped by to pick up the lunch tray herself. She explained that loss of motor function that accompanied the disease and also accounted for the incontinence made it impossible for most of their patients to chew 'real' food. By necessity, the diet consisted of thin soups that were more water than soup, jello, and soft foods like mashed potatoes. \n\nShe had sighed heavily and shaken her head as she lifted the lid and saw that most of Mister Hall's food remained untouched. She alleviated some of Mike's guilt when she informed him that towards the end, even those proved virtually impossible to get into their patients. He had smiled at her in gratitude, fearing that he had somehow failed in this simple mission too. \n\nHe spent the rest of the afternoon on his phone checking emails and social media. He had even gotten so damned desperate that he had played a war game he had downloaded onto his phone. He had though insisted on helping the nurse to shower and shave Mister Clyde before he left. \n\nThat at least made him feel useful, like he had contributed something to the man's care by his presence. He knew enough about death and dying to know that sometimes just being there was all that you could do though.\n\nOn the way out, he had run into a short and balding older man in the parking lot. He was only a bit surprised when the man approached him as he got onto his motorcycle. Mike had long ago learned that social rules were decidedly different in small-town America than they had been growing up in Boston. Around here, people still smiled and said 'hello,' even to strangers. \n\nThis man went further though, holding out his hand and introducing himself as Frank Majors. At the mention of his name, Mike quickly put the pieces together. He was more than a bit embarrassed at first, considering the 'advances' this man's wife had made on him. That was until the man thanked him for the compassion he had shown his wife. \n\nFrank explained that Mary had lost her first husband, a Marine during the Vietnam War. With his 'high and tight' haircut, Mike had reminded her of Joe. Mike was not sure how to take that or especially how it must feel to be this man, who was obviously so devoted to a woman that no longer remembered him and pined for another man. A man, who she had mistaken Mike for. \n\nBut his partings words spoke deeply to Mike, \"Our fortieth anniversary is next week. All the kids and grandkids are coming in to celebrate with us.\" \n\nThe man's voice choked over the next words, \"I'm hoping for one of her good days then. It ain't easy living in a dead man's shadow, but how can I begrudge her whatever comfort her memories offer?\"\n\nThat thought, living in a dead man's shadows, had repeatedly arisen as he painted the old swing and replaced the rotting boards on the front porch. \n\nWhen he had first run into Billy's old girlfriend that morning, he had to admit that like Missus Lula he had been more than a bit resentful of her for marrying another man and seemingly living happily ever after when Billy had died in his arms. Especially knowing that the man, who had become her husband and shared her bed for almost a quarter of a century had been Billy's best friend and cousin. \n\nBut meeting her son had changed that.\n\nMike was still reeling from the shock of learning that his friend had fathered a child, probably while they were home on Christmas leave. Just before the Gulf War, as civilians called it, broke out. He knew that Billy had bought the girl a special present, a ring, an engagement ring, not that they were telling her strict Southern Baptist parents that. Not until she graduated in June anyway. ",
        "Of course, by the time June rolled around, Billy had been dead for months. He could still see the man's face laughing and joking sometimes. Other times it was that thin line of blood that ran from the corner of his blue-grey lips as his lungs filled with blood until it overflowed. \n\nThing was that when he had run into the young man this morning, it indeed was like stepping back in time. Sure, the younger man's hair was more strawberry blonde than carrot top as Billy's had been. The kid was a bit taller too, perhaps even an inch taller than Mike. He was not as lanky as the man who had sired him either. Perhaps his stepfather's, his father Mike supposed would be more accurate, cooking accounted for that. \n\nOther than those small differences this Billy looked way too much like his friend to be a cousin once removed or was it second cousins, Mike neither knew nor cared. The fact was that the young man was his friend's flesh and blood. But what was he going to do about it?\n\nHe was so caught up in those thoughts that he nearly missed the rattle of the old pickup truck until it stopped right in front of the house. Mike was not sure who it could be. Wouldn't Miss Landon have called rather than coming all the way here if something had happened to Mister Clyde? \n\nWhen the door opened though those fears were allayed, and another set came to the forefront. It was the very woman whom he had been thinking of for most of this day, Brenda Jo Sanders Hall. \n\nShe smiled wanely as she pushed open the gate that had long since lost its latch. Mike added another item to his growing list of repairs around the old farm, though he was not sure why he was doing any of it. Other than the fact that it gave him something to do instead of thinking about his ghosts and tired him out enough that he hoped he would sleep without nightmares - at least some of the time.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked as the woman climbed the steps. He hated the way it came out and opened his mouth to apologize.\n\nBefore he could though, she held up a plastic bag. \"We don't usually do deliveries this far out. Honour, Oklahoma ain't no big city after all,\" he could tell how nervous she was by how she just kept talking 'a mile a minute.' He thought he remembered Missus Lula saying that about the girl, though she was far from the teenager, she had been back then. \n\n\"But I figured since you didn't make it in tonight, I'd swing by and see if I could bring you a peace offering.\" She inhaled and dropped her eyes to the wooden boards at their feet, which Mike had just repaired. \"Have a bit of a chat maybe.\"\n\nMike wiped his hands on the front of his jeans, \"Thank you. That was thoughtful.\" It seemed the woman was not the only one that was nervous. \n\n\"Care to come in? I would offer you something to drink, but I'm afraid water and beer are about all I have,\" he said as he held open the door.\n\n\"That's okay, I brought along a couple of cans of coke just in case,\" she replied as she walked through the front door and stopped dead cold only a couple of feet inside. \"Oh my god,\" she whispered as her hand covered her mouth.\n\nMike frowned as she recovered enough to explain, \"It's just that I have not been back in this house since...\" \n\nShe stopped and swallowed. Mike thought perhaps he saw moisture collect in her eyes. They were both silent for a long moment before she spoke again, \"Not since Billy's funeral.\"\n\nHe nodded because he did not know what more to say, \"We can talk in the kitchen if you like,\" was the best he could come up with. \n\nShe nodded and followed him into it. He pulled out a worn chair with its faded yellow plastic seat and back. There were four of them around the Formica table in the center of the room. She took the seat as he opened the fridge and grabbed a beer. He held it out for her.\n\n\"No, thanks. I'm driving,\" she smiled weakly as he opened it and took a seat across from her. She rummaged in the bag, pulling out Styrofoam containers, plastic ware, and napkins, passing them across the table to him. \n\nMike opened the lid and was delighted with the Southern-fried steak, mashed potatoes, gravy and green beans that filled the compartments to overflowing. \"Wow, it looks as delicious as breakfast,\" he exclaimed as he dug in without thinking. \n\n\"Like I said, Josh could always cook better than most people. It was a damned good thing he was a lineman on the football team back in high school, or he would have never survived the teasing that he got from all the guys,\" this time when she smiled it was genuine, but then after a moment Mike noticed her eyes were getting misty again. She swiped at them with the back of her hand until Mike passed a napkin across the table to her. \n\n\"Sorry, I didn't make it in to the store in town today. Only made it as far as the feed and seed for a bit of lumber and paint. They ain't all that big on things like tissue,\" he tried to make light of it all. \"And the general store for the beer, a man has to have some comforts after all.\"\n\nShe shook her head and laughed as she blew her nose. Mike set one aside and pushed the rest of them across the table towards her. If she insisted on this conversation, and perhaps it was for the best, then he had a feeling she would need them more than he would. \n\nAfter a long moment, she exhaled slowly and looked back up at him, \"I hear you met Billy today?\"\n\nHe only nodded. He would leave the rest up to her. However much she was comfortable revealing. It was not like he had any right to demand an explanation. Even if he desperately longed for one. To know the truth of why the Halls had never known the existence of their grandson. \n\n\"I know you must hate me. Missus Lula always did. Right up until the day she died that woman never forgave me from marrying Josh. At least that is what my mother-in-law tells me,\" she sighed. \n\nMike could no longer hold back the only thing that mattered to him, \"Why? Why did you never tell them?\"\n\nBrenda closed her eyes and dropped her head, \"I know you can never understand this, but things are different around here. Even these days. People talk. And they judge you. Hold things against you for a lifetime even. Not just your lifetime either, but your children's too. The word 'bastard' is still more than just a curse word around these parts.\"\n\n\"And my parents,\" she shook her head as she looked back up. Her eyes were glistening with more unshed tears, \"They would have never let me keep the baby. It just wasn't done in their book.\"\n\nHe shook his head, \"I don't understand. They would have forced you to have an abortion?\"\n\nHer eyes went wide, \"Oh, hell, no. That is one thing they did not believe in. But they would have made me give the baby up for adoption. And even as a screwed up seventeen-year-old kid that had no job and knew nothing about raising kids, I knew one thing - that baby was all I had left of Billy. And I could not stand the thought that they would take that away from me.\"\n\nHe nodded though he still could not see why she would not have turned to the Halls, surely they would have taken her and the child in. But for now, he focused on eating the food she had brought and just listening as the rest of the story unfolded. \n\n\"I still don't know how I managed it. To hide my pregnancy for so long. I suppose folks just thought that I was eating too much, comfort food sort of thing. That I was putting on weight and letting myself go after Billy's death.\" \n\n\"But somehow I managed to do it with baggy sweat pants and over-sized t-shirts. I made it all the way to graduation without anyone finding out. Or so I thought.\"\n\n\"You see, I had it all figured out. I would graduate and then run away. I had been saving my babysitting money up for two years anyway to buy me a real store-bought wedding dress and not one my Mama made herself.\" \n\n\"I had close to five-hundred dollars, which seemed like a lot of money to a crazy teen,\" she shook her head as she chuckled at how na\u00efve that seemed now. \n\n\"I'd go away to a big city. Dallas. Houston. Maybe even Los Angeles. Wherever my money would take me on the next bus through town. I got to the station early that Saturday night and was waiting on the bench for them to open up so I could buy a ticket when Josh drove up in his old beat-up truck.\"\n\nHer eyes stared off, looking at something on the wall behind Mike, but he got the feeling she did not see any of it. \"First thing he says to me was 'how far along are you.' I was floored. I honestly thought I had everyone fooled. Turns out half the kids at school had been talking for months, but no one had the guts to tell me.\"\n\n\"I broke down crying. Told him the whole damned thing. About sneaking out to meet Billy on Christmas Eve while Mama and Daddy wrapped presents for the little ones.\" \n\nShe reached inside her t-shirt and pulled something out. It took a moment for Mike to recognize what dangled at the end of a thin gold chain, but it should not have. He had been with Billy when he picked it out. Hell, he had even loaned him an extra twenty dollars when it was more than he had managed to save up. \n\nThe tiny diamond ring in the plain gold band looked smaller somehow than it had all those years ago. Knowing that she kept it all these years, wore it around her neck still said a lot about her. And about the man who had become her husband. \n\n\"You know, no matter what...I have never regretted the Christmas present I gave Billy that night.\" Tears were flowing unchecked down her cheeks then, \"Or especially the unplanned one that he gave me.\"\n\nMike nodded, trying to imagine how difficult it all must have been for the young woman. Her fianc\u00e9 killed, pregnant, unable to turn to her family, frightened and alone. Though he still wondered why she had not turned to the Halls for help, he could at least empathize with her plight. \n\n\"Josh knew my folks. Knew what they were like. So he understood why I felt I had to get away. But he had a better plan, he said. He couldn't let me go off on my own, pregnant and all. Not with his best friend's baby.\" \n\n\"He'd been working in the oil fields with his daddy. Had a bit of money saved up. He knew about some jobs down in Beaumont. Offshore stuff where he could make good money, he said.\"\n\n\"We'd get married. Get away from Honour for a while. Just until folks stopped talking, he said. We'd have the baby together and raise it ourselves.\" \n\nShe shook her head, \"It all seemed so simple back then. Like an answer to my prayers.\"\n\nShe sighed and looked back at Mike, \"Don't get me wrong that man was and still is an answer to any woman's prayers. Not only has he always provided for the kids and me, but he has never raised a hand, won't even spank them when they need it. Don't even raise his voice.\" \n\n\"And love that boy? He has always loved him just as much, sometimes I'd swear more than his own young'uns.\" \n\n\"Thing was that coming back weren't so easy. Missus Lula had never been my biggest fan. I suppose she didn't think I was good enough for Billy. I don't know.\" \n\n\"But I do know that when I showed up for his funeral, the woman never spoke a word to me. Never hugged me or tried to comfort me when I was hurting too. And when Josh and I ran off,\" she shook her head, \"well, let's just say that the beauty parlor had a new favorite topic of conversation for months.\"\n\n\"Of course, my parents totally disowned me. Said they never wanted to speak to me or see me again. Hell, Mama still lives in the same run-down trailer just a couple of miles from the restaurant.\" \n\n\"We been back in town almost a year now and she ain't set foot in the place, called me, or nothing. Even my own sisters won't say nothing when we see one another in town. Hell, my niece goes to high school with my youngest daughter, and she won't talk to her either.\" \n\n\"That's what this place can be like sometimes. Friendly on the outside and bitter to the core. So, we just kept away. Josh's folks would come to visit us in Texas once or twice a year, and we'd hear news of what was happening.\" \n\n\"Then last year, his daddy had a small stroke. He decided then it was high time he gave up the restaurant and retired. They bought an RV and go all over the place now. He begged and pleaded with us to come home. Said the oil fields were too much work for a man Josh's age,\" she fiddled with the napkins on the table.\n\n\"I suppose we knew then we were opening a whole can of worms, but we didn't want to let his folks down. They had been the only ones to stand by us. Then too his daddy was right. Work in the fields was not always reliable and these days the only way to make any real money at it,\" she shook her head, \"Well, after losing Billy over there, I was not letting Josh work there.\" \n\nMike took a final bite of the steak. He knew it was much tastier than it seemed at the moment, but he could not seem to focus on food right then. \n\n\"Billy joined the Marines right out of high school. We never told him the truth about his father, just that he was named after Josh's cousin that had died in the Gulf War. Honest, we did not mean in the beginning to keep the truth from him. We always thought we would tell him one day...when he was old enough to understand.\" \n\n\"It was just that the moment I heard him call Josh da-da something happened inside me. A part of me screamed 'no' it ain't right, but how can you tell a baby that his daddy is dead. Over the years, they were just so close. Always hunting together on weekends. Josh coaching his Little League teams. It just never seemed the right time somehow. And years just rolled on.\" \n\n\"Then when he met Isabel and they had a baby straight off. I don't know it just seemed like history repeating itself, even though we all love little Josh to pieces,\" she looked down at her hands crossed neatly in front of her on the table now.\n\n\"But when they came into town last week, I could hear it. The silence every time I entered a room. And I knew the rumors were back. At least the older folks, the ones that remember Billy. How can you look at my son and not know? I mean, I know you did the moment you saw him?\" \n\nShe sighed, \"So, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\nMike shook his head, \"What do you mean 'what am I going to do about it'? What is there to do about anything? All of that is ancient history. You and Josh seemed to have raised a fine man. Mister Clyde would not even know his grandson now after all these years even if we told him. So what is the point?\"\n\nShe nodded and smiled, \"Thank you. I know it isn't fair, bringing you into this big family secret and all, but like you said...what is the point? And I am sorry. It was rude of me not to ask earlier. How is Mister Clyde?\"\n\nMike shook his head as he closed the lid on the Styrofoam container, \"Not good. I did not expect him to recognize me, of course, but neither was I prepared for how just plain wasted away the man has become. All he did all day was sit in a chair and stare out the window.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, really I am. I liked Mister Clyde. He was always kind to me. If there is anything else, we can do, please let us know. And we mean it, we really do expect you to take your meals with us,\" she smiled as she stood up. \n\n\"Well, breakfast and dinner. I know you'll probably spend most lunchtimes at the nursing home with Mister Clyde. So what you say, friends?\" She asked as she held her hand across the table.\n\nMike did not hesitate to take the woman's hand. As far as he was concerned, she had done the best she could with a less than ideal situation. And from what little he had seen, in the end, the boy had turned out fine. \n\nThey chatted for a few more moments about dumb things like the weather and the local football team that both Billy and Josh had once played on. Then Mike saw the woman to the door and watched as she drove away before climbing the stairs for a quick bath and another long night haunted by dreams of soft caramel brown skin and nightmares of guns and bombs, blood, and pain. \n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER FIVE***\n\nThe next few days fell into a sort of pattern for Mike. He got up early, after a lifetime in the Marines it simply seemed impossible for him to sleep in. He would pittle around the farm a bit, doing repairs that were needed, but probably in vain if it were merely to join the rest of the land, they had sold a couple of years before, in becoming further urban sprawl. \n\nEvery time he thought about the old farmhouse being demolished to make way for cookie-cutter, shoddily built modern monstrosity. Some part of him ached for things that could never be and questioned again the ways of the universe that had taken his best friend, who so obviously was needed here, and left him, whom no one had wanted, loved, or needed in a very, very long time.\n\nThen he would bath and dress. Eat breakfast at the restaurant. Though they still refused his money at the till, he always left an ample tip at the table, especially since he learned that the young Latina who served him almost every morning was Isabel, Billy's fianc\u00e9 or little Billy as he thought of him now. \n\nHe always engaged her in conversation, as much as her work would allow and came to know the woman quite well and through her his best friend's son. He was pleased to discover that the young man was everything that his father would have wanted him to be. The only cloud for Mike in all of it was knowing that Mister Clyde and Missus Lula had never gotten the chance to know their grandson and now never would. \n\nAfter breakfast, Mike headed straight to the nursing home, fancy politically correct words aside that was what it was. While it was far from a perfect solution for the patients, because there was never enough staff to go around, Mike trusted that Maude Landon was a woman on a mission, doing her best for people that society and sometimes even their own families forgot. \n\nThat was the other cloud in Mike's world at the moment. He had taken the initiative and called Becca Hall-Okadigbo. That conversation had been far, far less than what he had hoped. It seemed that school was just starting back, both for her children and the university at which she and her husband taught. So, she 'could' not take the time to come down to Oklahoma. \n\nMike had shaken his head as he hung up, not understanding the woman at all. Chicago was only an hour or two flight from Tulsa, which was less than an hour drive from Honour. How could the woman not be bothered to come down...even for the weekend...when her own father was dying?\n\nBut that was beside the point, as Mike continued to do all that he could, standing in for the best friend, who could not. In addition to helping out with Mister Clyde's care and feeding, he had taken to volunteering of sorts. \n\nIn particular, he would often spend an hour or so playing board games, reading, or simply walking in the gardens with Mary Majors, pretending for a while to be her Joe and as Frank had said 'offering her what comfort and solace' her memories could provide. He had come to know the couple and their youngest daughter, who still lived nearby, reasonably well. \n\nHe had also come to know a great deal about another long-dead Marine, First Lieutenant Joseph Battaglia, whom he learned had also been from Boston. His accent had been another reason that Mary had come to associate him with her long-lost first love. \n\nOf course, he always felt a bit uncomfortable with the deception. Especially in terms of the pain, it undoubtedly caused Frank, but the man was stalwart in his support of whatever it took to make his wife happy. That kind of love was not something that Mike could even fathom at times, but something that brought an ache and longing deep in his chest at odds moments as he watched the man care for the woman, who did not remember, let alone return that love. \n\nAfter visiting hours ended at three, though the staff at Prairie View increasingly fudged such things for him, he would head back to the old farmhouse and spend his evenings doing more meaningless repairs to the old place. ",
        "Most evenings, he would finish up just in time to be the very last customer at the restaurant, happy to accept whatever culinary delights were 'leftovers' as Brenda and Josh called them. Usually, it was one of them, who served him dinner, as Isabel only worked breakfast and lunch duty in order to spend time with her son little Josh and 'little' Billy, at least until his leave had ended. \n\nThere was one night though that Mike would never forget. He had been there about a week when Mister Clyde was having what Maude called an 'especially bad day,' meaning that the man was combative. Actually, he was quite violent, and it was not just screaming and yelling, cursing too, something that Mike had never heard the man do. Hell, he was not even aware the man knew some of the words he used that day. \n\nIt was also spitting, hitting, kicking, and even biting. In some ways, it reminded Mike of the temper tantrums that he had seen a few of his married friends' children have over the years. In the end, the only alternative had been to restrain the man for his own safety as well as the staffs'. \n\nThat had been hard, really hard, on Mike, but he had insisted on helping the mostly female staff to do what was necessary. Then he had sat by the man's side just talking in low tones, trying to calm and soothe Mister Clyde as best he could. It was well past the usual three o'clock visiting hours when the man finally fell into a restless slumber, and Mike sneaked from the room with instructions to the night staff to call him should they need him at all. \n\nBy the time all of that was done, Mike was exhausted, not just physically but emotionally too. But as he went to exit the building, a jubilant Frank grabbed him by the arm and dragged him into the day room, which had been transformed with red balloons and streamers into party central. \n\nTheir daughter smiled as she pressed an equally red plastic plate into his hand and began filling it with an assortment of delicious smelling barbeque and all the 'fixins' as she called them. She droned on and on about the significance of red as a fortieth anniversary was traditionally known as the ruby one. \n\nNone of that mattered to a tired and stressed out Mike, until he heard the crack in her voice and saw the tears in her eyes as she said, \"I know all this may seem such a ridiculous fuss since Mama won't even remember it tomorrow.\" \n\n\"Thing is...I know my parents will never have the fiftieth one, at least Mama won't be here to see it anyway. So I just guess...\" she had shrugged her shoulders and handed the heavily laden plate to Mike before wiping her eyes with the back of her hand and making a lame excuse for a hasty retreat. \n\nMike had done his best to eat at least some of the food, but nothing tasted right when his mind got this crowded. Not just with his ghosts but with the overwhelming realities of all that had happened the past few days. He had forced himself to stay long enough not to appear rude. \n\nThen he had sought out Frank, finding him as he expected next to his wife, whom he saw had had her hair fixed rather nicely in that old Southern lady curly style for the occasion. She was also attired for the occasion in a striking red dress that appeared straight out of a 1950s sitcom. \n\nHe held out his hand to Frank as he made his excuses without burdening the man with all the details of what 'a bad day' meant, though he was sure the man could imagine. What surprised Mike though was when Mary placed her small, bruised hand over her husband's and said, \"Frank, dear, won't you introduce me to your young friend?\" \n\nTurned out that while Mister Clyde might have been having a bad day, Frank's prayers for his wife to have a 'good' one had been answered. He smiled as the man did just that and for the moment at least, he enjoyed the pleasure of being Frank's friend Mike and not the woman's dead Marine husband, Joe. \n\nHe had smiled as he left their party though he could never imagine such a thing as a ruby anniversary. Hell, he was not even sure that he had ever had anything even approaching a 'real relationship' though he had had a couple of girlfriends back in his lost twenties when he spent more time in bars and bottles than he wanted to remember. \n\nHe could not imagine being with any woman for that long...well, not really. Because impossible dreams did not count. \n\nBut he took consolation in knowing that once more the wheels of Fate were balanced - that if only for this one moment, good things had happened for good people. And that was all that mattered. \n\nOf course, Fate was not done with him for that night as it turned out. When he pulled into the driveway of the old farm, he noticed a newer model truck than the one that Brenda usually drove, on those nights when he had gotten so caught up in what he was doing that he had forgotten his standing 'dinner date' at the restaurant, and the woman had insisted on bringing it to him instead. Not that she had ever stayed, not after that first night anyway. \n\nBut this time it was not the woman's petite form sitting in the freshly painted porch swing and rocking slowly back and forth. Instead it was him - young Billy. \n\nMike was not sure what to say to the man. He had not run into him since that first morning in the restaurant, but \"Hey, have you been waiting long? I'm sorry I was not expecting anyone,\" seemed as good as he could manage at the moment. \n\nThe young Marine stood up and held out a bag that Mike knew contained even more food that he could not possibly make himself eat this night, \"No problem, Sir. I ain't been waiting that long, half an hour maybe.\"\n\nWaiting half an hour just to deliver food that he could have easily left on the porch seemed a bit odd to Mike, but he was not going to pass up the chance to get to know more about this young man himself, \"One of the reasons I'm late is that some friends at the nursing home were having an anniversary celebration, so I've actually eaten already.\" \n\nMike shrugged, trying to keep things casual as he continued, \"But if you care to come in, we could have a beer.\"\n\nThe man smiled, that smile which always did funny things to Mike's tummy, the one that sent him back over the years, \"I'd like that, Sir. I was sort of hoping we could talk for a bit actually,\" he stammered. \n\nMike flipped on a lamp in the living room and ushered Billy into the kitchen. He opened the refrigerator as he motioned with his other hand towards the table and chairs, \"Take a seat.\" He opened two bottles of beer and took a place across from the young man as he held out a bottle.\n\nThey both took a long swig, emptying half of the bottle before setting it back on the table. Mike was beginning to think he had made a mistake inviting Billy in as the silence stretched on uncomfortably long with both men taking turns looking at the Formica tabletop to avoid talking. \n\nThen Billy looked up and asked, \"Tell me about him. About my father.\"\n\nMike was glad that the bottle of beer was only halfway to his mouth because he was so shocked by the man's words that he knew he would have spewed it all over the place otherwise. \"You know?\" he stammered.\n\nBilly nodded his head, \"Since I was about twelve or thirteen, I guess. We studied genes and shit in biology. I spent almost a whole Saturday looking at this chart of white and red flowers in the textbook.\" \n\n\"Then looking at this faded picture that Mama kept hidden in the drawer on her side of the bed...her junior prom with him in full Marine uniform at her side. My little brain spent the whole damned time trying to figure out how come I was such a white flower I guess, how I could possibly look so damned much like a man that was only a distant relation. Then I put the pieces together.\"\n\n\"Did you ask her about it?\"\n\nHe shook his head, \"Nah, I was afraid that it might cause her too much pain. I'd always catch her looking at me strange sometimes. All sad like and I could never figure it out. Until then.\" \n\nHe lifted the bottle of beer and drained it then, \"I thought about asking Daddy about it once, right before I left for Parris Island. We were going on a final fishing trip before Boot Camp. I figured then would be as good a time as any. I even practiced everything I'd say,\" he sighed as he toyed with the bottle, rocking it back and forth on the table. \n\n\"But then when the time came I just couldn't. I don't know it just seemed like I'd be disrespecting him \u2014 all he had done for Mama and me. I just couldn't. It wasn't worth it just to settle that little bit of doubt that was still in my mind.\"\n\nHe met Mike's gaze, boldly, \"But even that little bit disappeared that morning when I met you. Between the way you acted when we shook hands and especially how nervous Daddy was, I knew. I just knew I was right.\" \n\n\"So, I figured you were the one person I could ask. The one that would tell me the truth. Am I right? Is Billy my real father?\"\n\nMike emptied his bottle of beer and without speaking, went back to the fridge for two more. He took his time opening them as he tried to figure out what to say to the young man. \n\nSome part of him felt that he owed loyalty to the couple that had done so much, sacrificed even more to protect this young man. A couple that had been nothing but kind to him too. But another part of him remained true to his dead friend. Didn't the young man have the right to know the truth? Well as much as Mike knew himself anyway. \n\nHe placed the fresh beer in front of the man as he nodded, \"Yes, yes, you're Billy's flesh and blood, but whether that makes him your father or not, hell, even I ain't figured that one out yet.\" \n\nMike emptied almost his whole bottle of beer before sitting back down at the table across from the 'kid.' Over the next couple of hours, the men talked. Mike told him what little he knew of the tangled web of lies and half-truths around his birth. \n\nHe told him stories of the other Billy too. Stories that he knew the young man could appreciate even more because of their shared bond as brothers, Marines. It grew late, too late, but it seemed both were reluctant to break the spell of time that seemed suspended between past, present, and future around that old worn-out kitchen table. \n\nBilly finally did though as he held out his hand across the table, \"Thank you, thank you, Sir, for giving me the answers I needed. It means a lot.\" \n\nMike stood as they prepared to say their good-byes. Though he was definitely not the touchy-feely kind of guy, something made Mike pull the young man closer, give him one of those shoulder-to-shoulder embraces that was as close to a hug as some men could get. \n\n\"He'd be damned proud of the man and the Marine you have become, son,\" Mike blamed the watering that blurred his vision on the exhaustion that was once more batting at his head like the sound of cannons on a tank. \n\nThe young man beamed as he pulled back from the embrace, \"Thank you, thank you for that too, Sir.\"\n\nMike shook his head, \"No more damned Sir. Those days are over. It's just Mike now.\"\n\nBilly nodded, \"All right, Sir...Mike.\" He looked nervously at the floor for a moment before once more meeting Mike's stare. \n\n\"There's just one more thing. I'm not sure if I should ask. It is just that I go back to Twenty-Nine Palms day after tomorrow, then we deploy after that for almost a year. I know...\"\n\nMike watched as the younger man once more stared at the worn linoleum as he shifted nervously from foot to foot, \"Don't worry about it, son. You can ask me anything. If I can do it, I will. You have my word on that.\"\n\nBilly nodded as he looked back up and spoke, \"It's just that I know I won't get another chance, and I was wondering...if I can manage to sneak away for a while tomorrow, could I visit Mister Clyde? I mean my grandfather, I suppose, in the nursing home.\"\n\nMike sighed heavily. He did not know what to say. After a day like this, he would hate for that to be all this young man remembered of the man that Mike had once known, a good and loving father, a hard-working farmer, and devoted husband and family man. With a heart big enough to take in even a lost and angry young man that he had once been, hell, probably still was in some ways. \n\nOn the other hand, though he knew Mister Clyde would never remember meeting this grandson that he never knew he had, Mike liked to think that somehow or the other that family reunion would balance out karma. Bring some peace to the old man as well as the ghost of his friend that visited him most nights. \n\nAnd like the boy said, this would be the only chance. One he had to take, \"Sure, son, you do that. I'll make sure the staff knows you are coming.\" \n\nMike walked the young man to the door and watched as he climbed into the truck and drove away. The red tail lights had no sooner disappeared down the road than the weight of this day hit him full force. \n\nThis night he could not even find the strength to drag his butt up the stairs and bath before bed. Instead he barely made it to couch before collapsing there. He did not even bother pulling the crocheted multi-color afghan off the back of it. This early in the year, the weather was still warm enough that he would not need it. \n\nBut as he feared this night, there was little rest to be had as he fought the demons in his dreams. They all blended one into another other; the years, faces, and voices becoming confused and out-of-sync. It was not even dawn when Mike gave up trying to sleep and got up to begin the barren routine over again.\n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER SIX***\n\nThe days turned into weeks and weeks into a month as the nights grew colder and the days grew shorter. Leaves on the trees began to change color though not as dramatically as Mike remembered from his childhood in New England. September rolled into October and little changed with Mister Clyde. He had his good days, and increasingly he had more of those bad ones as well.\n\nThankfully his best day had been the one when little Billy had stopped by before heading back to Twenty-Nine Palms. While the man had not been alert enough to understand when Mike introduced him as Brenda's son, he had been verbal. Verbal enough to carry on a conversation with the young man, whom he mistook for his dead son. \n\nMike had been worried about how this would affect Billy, but when he tried once more to rectify the situation, the young man had shaken his head no and played along. Just as Mike had when Mary thought him her long-lost Joe. \n\nAs he walked Billy out to his truck, Mike had tried to explain, but again the boy shook his head and said, \"No problem.\" Mike had been so moved that he gave the kid another of those half hugs, right there in the parking lot. He had not seen him again before he left. \n\nIn fact, Isabel was gone for a few days too. She had gone back with him to finish packing their tiny apartment and would drive the truck back to Honour while Billy stayed with some friends until they deployed. \n\nHell, the restaurant had even been closed for three days as Brenda and her husband met the couple in Las Vegas for that wedding Josh had spoken about the first morning he met them. He was glad for the young couple. Mike knew it was what Billy would have wanted, what he would have done had he lived to learn of his own son's existence. \n\nMike had not known what to get them but felt it incumbent upon him as Billy's best friend to do something much more than a toaster. Finally, he had settled upon a simple card that he stuffed with a few hundred dollars, best that they decide for themselves what they needed. Mike certainly had no idea what newlyweds just starting out needed. So, he had slipped the card to Brenda and asked her to give it to them when she saw them.\n\nOf course, when they all did make it back, they could not wait to show him the pictures mostly on their cell phones. Mike had smiled and nodded as he listened to the stories of their Vegas wedding. He had not known what to say, so he just nodded and smiled while thinking of other weddings that had not been - Brenda's and Billy's, Rachel's and Manny's, even Tommy though he had had no girlfriend. Mike could certainly never imagine such a thing for himself. What woman could ever want such 'damaged' goods as him?\n\nBut the biggest surprise had been the sudden and unexpected death of Mary Majors. Less than a month after hers and Frank's fortieth wedding anniversary, she had gone to sleep one night and not woken up the next morning. It had been hard for Mike to fathom since the day before had been another of her good days. She had smiled and held Frank's arm as the couple walked and talked in the garden. Once more he had been Frank's friend Mike and not her Joe. \n\nThen the next morning, when he got to the nursing home, Mike had noticed that none of the patients were around. All seemed to be in their rooms; he could not even find a staff member at first. Then Maude had appeared out of Mary's room, her arm wrapped about the shoulders of a pale and visibly shaken Frank as his daughter followed behind with red, swollen eyes. \n\nMike had not known precisely what happened, thinking perhaps the woman had become ill and needed to be taken to the hospital, which had happened once before to another of the patients there. Not wanting to disturb them, he had gone into Mister Clyde's room as usual. \n\nA couple of hours later, Maude had come in to apologize for not being available for Mike's usual morning briefing on Mister Clyde's night. That is when she explained that Missus Majors had 'passed away.' \n\nMike fucking hated that euphemism - passed away. Passed where? It was not like anyone fucking knew what happened. He had, of course, been shocked, but Maude explained that sometimes these things happened. \n\nHe just nodded, 'these things,' like best friends with pregnant girlfriends and a family farm that was counting on him to take it over in a couple of years, being killed? When no one would have fucking cared or ever missed the screwed-up orphan from Boston. Things like Mary's sudden death after such a good day when it had been Mister Clyde, who had steadily been declining over the weeks. \n\nNot that anything in this fucked up world made sense. Mike should have long since stopped asking...why? When would he ever learn? \n\nMike had not been able to attend the woman's funeral. He had not wanted to intrude upon family time, but the truth was that Mister Clyde too had taken a turn for the worse. He was no longer eating at all. No matter how hard Mike or the nurses tried, they could get no more than a few sips of water or broth down him. \n\nMaude had pulled Mike aside to discuss it with him. She could speak with the doctors, perhaps transfer him to the hospital for IV feeding, and maybe even do it there. But that would only delay the inevitable. \n\nShe needed a decision from him and the man's daughter. Mike had not known what to tell her. He did not want the responsibility for such a decision, even though he had been the one who had borne the brunt of the man's care during those final days and weeks. Even though the strain was beginning to wear on him in a very different way than command or battle, but wear nonetheless. \n\nStill, he had not spoken to Becca Hall-Okadigbo in weeks, since that earlier failed plea for the woman to visit her father. Not knowing what more to say, he had left updates to Maude Landon, but this time he had no choice. This was a conversation that they should have one-on-one. \n\nHe had told Maude that he would speak with the woman that night and let her know what they had decided the next morning. Maude had given him that smile as she placed her hand on his arm, \"I know this is hard, but sometimes...these things need to be left to their natural course.\"\n\nMike had nodded, and in some ways, he even agreed. Mister Clyde was almost seventy; unlike his son, he had lived a full life. He had seen joy and pain, loved and married, struggled to keep the family farm going well past the age when most people retired and went fishing. He had buried his only son and beloved wife. His relationship with his only other close family member was strained at best. ",
        "This death was so very different from all the others that Mike had witnessed. Not only had Mister Clyde lived his life, but on those really bad days when he became so violent that they had no choice but to restrain him to the bed or chair, on those days, death seemed almost merciful. More a blessing than an existence that was nothing more than breathing. But still, Mike did not think this decision was one he could make on his own.\n\nAll of this weighed upon his mind that afternoon as he left the nursing home. In fact, he was so focused upon his own thoughts that had Frank Majors not approached him for help carrying some boxes to his car; Mike might have missed the opportunity to say farewell to the man, who had become a friend and compatriot of sorts in this battle against dementia. He was glad that the man had sought him out, though.\n\nMike was surprised at how little there was, only three small boxes that contained all the mementos and photographs of a whole lifetime. Mike had insisted on carrying all of them himself, no need to burden this elderly man with that as well as everything else he had been and still was going through. As he loaded the last box into the trunk of the man's car, he had turned back to notice tears streaming down the man's weathered cheek as he ran his fingers across a sealed plastic bag. \n\nMike instantly recognized its contents. The neatly folded triangle of red, white, and blue material could be only one thing. His throat tightened as he thought of the meaning behind that flag and compared it to the one, he had placed in Senora Hernandez's shaking hands only weeks ago. He knew that soon he too would be bringing another of them home, though he doubted very much that Billy's sister would want the damned thing. She had been barely ten when her brother was killed. \n\nAs if his mind too was on the same wave-length, Frank picked the bag up out of the box and held it reverently, \"What do I do with this?\" he spoke aloud the question that was plaguing Mike himself.\n\nThe man shook his head as tears fell onto the thick plastic that would protect its contents from even this. \"I know all of this might seem strange to you, but I knew going into our marriage that he would always hold some special place in her heart. That there was some part of the woman, I loved that was his alone, that I could never touch.\" \n\nHe looked up at Mike through those tears, \"And I never tried. I never pushed her for more than the love she had to give me. I know you cannot understand, but even then there was always so much love in that woman that it was more than enough. Never once did I feel jealous of him.\"\n\n\"You know she was a teacher. Right up until two years ago when dementia got so bad that they forced her to retire. She taught English and drama in the local high school. She had once been a B-list starlet. She was in a couple of old seventies horror movies, you know.\" He smiled as he shook his head, \"That woman could scream.\"\n\n\"They were an odd pair. The flower power hippie actress and the Marine officer. But she always said it was love at first sight.\" \n\nHe sighed, \"It wasn't like that with us, though. I was simply the science teacher down the hall that she shared a sandwich with over lunch.\" He chuckled, \"My granddaughter said she had 'friend-zoned' me whatever that is.\"\n\n\"But over time, our lunches turned into movies on Friday nights and the occasional bowling game. It's not like there is a whole lot to do around Prairie View. They weren't even dates really, just two friends with nothing more to do, hanging out together.\" \n\n\"Well, at least that's how she saw them. Me...that was another matter. I fell and fell hard for that woman from the moment I saw her. Of course, I figured what chance did a bachelor science teacher have with a Hollywood star. I consigned myself to simply looking and never touching,\" \n\n\"Over time though, I'm not even sure how, but over the next couple of years, we just always seemed to be together. Until everyone in town just sort of assumed we were a couple. Even though I had never even kissed her.\"\n\n\"She was the one that changed that. Under the mistletoe at the Christmas dance one year. Things just sort of happened from there. We were married less than a year later when she discovered that despite our best efforts, she was pregnant with our older daughter. She was brutally honest with me then. When I proposed to her, she told me that she loved me, but that she was not 'in love' with me.\" \n\nThe man shook his head, \"English teachers and their damned semantics. What's the difference anyway?\"\n\n\"Forty years? Probably almost as long as you've been alive, young fellow. Forty mostly wonderful years, three beautiful daughters just like their mother and ten grandchildren, more than a nerdy science teacher could ever dream of, let me tell you.\"\n\nHe shook his head, \"I just don't know what to do now.\" He was silent for a long moment as his fingers brushed over the plastic. \n\n\"It's not like I resent the man. Like I said, I never have. It's just that somehow I feel like this would never mean as much to me or the girls, as it did to her. As it honestly should to someone. What do I do with it?\" he asked as he looked up at Mike.\n\nHe thought for a long moment. Mike wondered about other flags. How many ended up like this one? Without a place of honor, simply forgotten over time, like the men themselves who had died. It did not seem right somehow. It wasn't right. \n\nHe sighed as he reached for it, \"Did he have any family you know of? Anyone that might want it?\"\n\nFrank nodded, \"Yes, somewhere in Boston. Mary did not talk about them much. They had never really approved of her, being as she was neither Italian nor Catholic.\" \n\n\"By the time we met, I don't think they even exchanged Christmas cards anymore. I guess I could go through the things at the house and see if I can find a name or address somewhere. It's just that...\" The man sighed, \"Just that I've kinda been putting that off. Guess, I feel that if I leave her stuff lying around, untouched then she isn't really gone, you know.\" \n\nMike nodded sympathetically. What would it be? One more duty? Another mission, of sorts? To another fallen comrade. Even though he had never met the man, who was likely dead when he was still in diapers, he felt connected to him somehow. This time it was more than merely the brotherhood of the Corps. After all, for a while at least, he had been the man, at least in the eyes of the woman, who had loved him and never forgotten him. \n\nFor a split second, Mike was jealous of the dead man. What would that feel like? To love and be loved so deeply that not even death could extinguish you from a woman's heart. It was not something he would ever know that was for sure. \n\nMaybe he owed this much to Mary as much as he did the Marine he had never known. To see this final memento of a life sacrificed in honor of its country safely into the hands of someone, who would value it as she had all these years. Or that was his hope as he took the folded flag from the other man's hands. \n\nIt weighed far more than he would have thought. More than he remembered the one he had handed to Senora Hernandez weighing. But then too this one was from another era, perhaps it was made from another type of material, heavier. Or maybe he just felt the weight of the burden he was accepting more. Perhaps he knew that this would be his final mission. The last thing he did before he...\n\nBut that was the future. Or what future Mike had anyway. There were many other missions to complete before that day would come \u2014 many more miles to cover. Old friends and comrades to visit. Right now, though, he had this one to finish. \n\n\"I'm going back to Boston at some point. If you want, I'll take it with me. I give you my word I'll take care of it like it should be until I can locate some of Joe's family, who will.\" \n\nMike promised as he exchanged contact information and extracted the man's promise that he would go through Mary's things, see if there was anything more to go on than merely the man's name and rank, though Mike figured if worse came to worse, he still had a few friends who might be able to get all he needed from that alone. He hated to put their jobs at risk by asking if Frank could provide the information he needed.\n\nThe men said their farewells. This time Mike found himself wrapped in a real hug rather than the half embraces he rarely gave his friends. As Frank pulled back, there were tears in the elderly man's eyes once more. \n\n\"Thank you. Thank you for this and especially thank you for the compassion that you showed my Mary by pretending to be him for a bit. You don't know how much that meant to her. What closure it gave her that this time, Joe came back for her.\" \n\n\"There are no words to explain how much that means to me, son. You're a damned fine man. Taking on things like that and the man in there that ain't even your father. The world would be a better place if there were more people like you in it.\"\n\nThere was nothing and no way that Mike could respond to that. If this man knew. If he only knew how many people, how often he had failed his friends. How much blood stained his hands. How the ghosts came more vividly for him every damned night. If he knew, then Mike was confident he would never say such a thing. \n\nMike just nodded, \"Take care of yourself, Frank. And I promise I will handle this for you...and for Mary.\"\n\nFrank smiled as Mike walked away. The man stayed by that open car trunk as he started the Harley and put on his helmet. The last thing that Mike saw as he rode away was the man waving after him. If he only knew the truth...\n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER SEVEN***\n\nMike plopped onto the sofa in the living room. He did not have the energy for anything more. Ten days. Even after he and Becca Hall-Okadigbo had talked and made the decision, it had taken Mister Clyde ten days to die. Long, agonizing days and nights. \n\nOnce the decision was made though, Maude and the staff had been wonderfully supportive. Visiting hours no longer mattered, he came and went as he pleased, mostly stayed, day and night. In those ten days, Mike had slept in the chair next to Mister Clyde's bed all except that first night, when he had not known that they would allow him. Maybe they thought it odd that he should hold such a vigil for a man, who was not even technically related to him, but no one said anything. \n\nAt first, he had tried eating the food they gave the patients, but that was impossible. MREs tasted better and had more substance. By the third morning, he had given up and taken a shower. He needed 'real' food, and since Mister Clyde was sleeping more anyway, he would sneak out for a bit and get something quick to eat. Perhaps even bring it back and eat it at his bedside. He had meant only to grab some greasy fast food; after all, food was food. But when he sat astride Esther at the edge of the parking lot, he found himself turning towards Honour. \n\nBy the time, he got to the restaurant; it was almost empty, the early morning breakfast crowd had dispersed to jobs and farms. Around here, the day got started early. The moment he had walked in he had been practically ambushed. Brenda Hall had thrown herself at him like a grenade, enveloping him in a hug and peppering him with a mag of machine-gun fire questions. \n\nThe best he could make out, she was worried about him and Mister Clyde because she had been coming by the farm, morning and night with food, but no one was around. She had been afraid that he had even left without saying good-bye. It felt strange to notice tears in the woman's eyes as Josh physically pulled his wife off him.\n\nMike apologized as he took a seat in his favorite booth and the woman poured him a cup of strong, black coffee that smelled like what he imagined heaven would, not that he would ever find out. If there was such a place at all. She had sat with him, keeping his cup full of the stuff. \n\nThere was no need to place an order even, within five minutes, Josh himself had brought a plate piled high with scrambled eggs, and more meat than some families had in a whole week. Another smaller plate held pancakes. The other man had just nodded as he placed the offering before him and slipped back into the kitchen. \n\nMike had known that he was hungry, needed to eat more than institutional mush that only masqueraded as food, but until his first bite of those eggs, he had not known just how hungry he was. Brenda had waited patiently as he answered her questions to the best of his ability between bites of breakfast and sips of heaven. She had frowned and nodded as he explained the latest developments. He heard how genuine she was when she told him that they were real sorry about Mister Clyde too.\n\nAfter that, Mike had not even needed to leave Prairie View for his meals. Just as the woman had delivered his meals to the farm on those evenings when he had lost track of time and missed the dinner rush, so too had she begun to bring food to the nursing home. Not just for him either, there was always extra for the staff as well. The woman used the excuse that they were just helping them by getting rid of leftovers. The nurses and Mike certainly were not going to argue. \n\nA couple of times in the late mornings between the breakfast and lunch crowds, the woman had even stayed for a bit, sitting by the bedside, holding Mister Clyde's hand and talking about Billy. Mike had slipped discretely from the room, feeling like an intruder, like he was eavesdropping on their private conversation. \n\nBut he would not forget the way the woman's voice cracked as she spoke about her first love, the man who had once been his best friend. The stories she told of their adventures, hers, Billy's and even Josh's, made Mike smile as he listened by the doorway. He learned things about his friend that he had never known. It was almost as if the woman brought some piece of the man back to him.\n\nOf course, one good thing about sleeping in that hard chair by Mister Clyde's bed was that his sleep never really got deep enough for the dreams. More like naps, an hour here, two there, throughout the night. But then again, Mike had long since learned to live without a great deal of sleep. Since Boot Camp, it had become more of a luxury than a necessity. \n\nThe last three days of his life, Mister Clyde had slipped quietly into a coma. And death when it finally did come for the man in the early pre-dawn hours of that morning had been starkly different from the ones that Mike had witnessed before. Two deep breaths, more like sighs, then nothing. At first, he had waited, thinking that the man would inhale at any moment, but he had not. His chest never rose again. \n\nIt was prophetic almost, a final exhalation after the job was done. The kind that you might give as you surveyed your labors at the end of a hard task. That was it, and the man was gone. No blood, no grey brain matter, no gaping holes. Just two little breaths as if to say...job well done.\n\nOf course, Mike's was not. Nor was Maude's. After years of reports and debriefings, that before computers had needed to be filed in triplicate even, Mike should not have been surprised at the paperwork that the government required even for the act of dying. Though they had been expecting the man's death for days, the coroner still had to be called. Had to pronounce the man dead. Then it was a matter of calling the funeral home and awaiting the mortician. \n\nThere was little Mike had to do or arrange for that at least. All of those arrangements had been made and paid for on that fateful leave, the one time that he had met the grown-up version of the strawberry blonde pixie that had always followed her big brother about the farm anytime they were back on leave. Before taking a still somewhat cognizant Mister Clyde to the nursing home, they had seen an attorney to make a will and gone to the local funeral home to make final arrangements. \n\nBut still, all of that had fallen on Mike's broad shoulders alone to oversee. It was almost late afternoon before he had been able to leave Prairie View. Unlike Mary Majors, Mike had taken all of Mister Clyde's things with him when he left that evening. What was the point in delaying it? He knew that there was a waiting list for beds, people and families that needed the intense level of care that could only be found in places like this one. Why keep them waiting? \n\nIt had taken Mike only an hour or so to pack it all up. Some of the stuff like toothbrushes, soaps, and stuff could just be tossed in the trash. Others like Mister Clyde's pajamas could be donated to others. Mike had been shocked by the total lack of care that he had witnessed over those almost eight weeks. \n\nOf course, the facility made sure that all its patients had three meals a day...if you could call them that. They also provided most of the basics like soap, deodorant, and toothpaste as well as way too many adult diapers. He cringed at the thought, and for the moment, was relieved that his future would never contain such things. But other things like pajamas, slippers, and the like was up to the family to keep in stock. And whether it was finances or simply neglect, Mike had seen way too many threadbare and torn ones to suit him. \n\nOne thing he could hand Becca Hall-Okadigbo was that she made certain Mister Clyde did not lack for such items, putting money regularly into his personal account through which Maude and the others could make certain he had anything he needed. \n\nIt was one thing at least that Mike could not fault the woman for. Even if she still had not come, even when Maude informed her that her father's death was imminent. According to the woman, Becca had asked if he would know she was there and when told 'no' had said there was no point then. \n\nMike ran his fingers through his hair that had grown longer than it had been in close to twenty-five years. He just could not understand the woman. How could she simply put Mister Clyde in the nursing home and forget him? How could any of the families? He supposed that was one blessing of dying young; you never faced such an ignominious end. \n\nFor a single heartbeat, Mike thought of the only relation he had ever had - his maternal grandmother. Of course, the woman would have never faced such a fate. No one on Beacon Hill would. Still, he wondered if it had been a lonely one. Had her 'blue book' friends abandoned her as she grew sicker and frailer? Had her long-time staff at that posh brownstone been as dedicated to her care as the ones at Prairie View? \n\nMaybe he was no better than Becca Hall-Okadigbo? After all, he had ignored the old woman's one attempt to reach out to him since the day she had turned her back on that frightened little boy and the social worker. Sometimes the woman's cold words mingled with others in his dreams, \"That boy is his child, bad seed. I will not have it in my home.\" \n\n'It.' A seven-year-old boy, who had just lost his mother and unborn sister, watched his father... \n\nMike stopped. He knew he was way too fucking tired when his mind went down those ancient streets. It was not like the man did not have enough ghosts. He certainly did not need to dredge up the boy's. \n\nHe sighed. Not as heavily or with the finality that Mister Clyde had, but then again his labors were not ending, merely transforming. One life had ended, and another with missions and duties of its own was just beginning. Be that for weeks, months or maybe even a couple of years; he did not know. \n\nBut he did know that tomorrow was another day. Likely another big one as the Southern tradition of 'receiving friends' as the mortician called it would be tomorrow night. Mike knew that he would know next to no one that would come, but that did not matter. \n\nIt was an opportunity for others, old friends, and distant relations to 'pay their respects,' or so the morticians informed him. Why those people could not have 'paid their respects' while the man was alive was beyond Mike. It seemed to him that would have meant a lot more to Mister Clyde, to have the occasional visitor while he could still remember some things than a huge shindig when he was cold and stiff in an expensive box.",
        "Once more he was just too fucking tired to drag his ass up those steps to bed. He was just about to lay down where he sat when he heard a noise at the door. He knew it could not be Brenda. She had shown up with his breakfast, as usual, that morning. The poor woman seemed visibly shaken to learn of what they all knew was inevitable. \n\nShe had only nodded through tears when Mike told her not to worry about dinner this night that he was not sure when he would be back to the farm, and honestly he was not all that hungry. Nonetheless, he had found a bag of Styrofoam containers on the front porch when he got there an hour or so ago. Of course, he was too exhausted to eat, so he simply stuck them in the fridge and pulled out a beer while he was in there. \n\nWhen the door did open, he was shocked to see the too-serious woman that he had met only once before. Becca or he supposed Rebecca Hall-Okadigbo held scant resemblance to the little girl he had once known. Her hair that she had once worn in ponytails was cut fashionably short. She was petite, he thought was the right term, just like Missus Lula had been. She wore a slightly wrinkled business suit in navy blue and matching shoes. The woman looked almost as tired as he felt.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, Mike. If I had known you were staying here, I would have checked into a hotel in Prairie View,\" she said tightly.\n\nHe shook his head and stood up like a gentleman should in the presence of a lady. Some lessons he could never forget. It seemed a betrayal of the woman, who had taught them to that small boy. The woman who had paid the ulti... \n\nHe stopped those thoughts cold once more as he forced a smile that he did not feel like for this woman's sake. \"No, Becca, this is your home. If anyone goes to a hotel, it'll be me.\"\n\nThe woman shook her head as she sat the small suitcase on the floor. She too sighed, \"No, that's not necessary. We'll work something out. It's only for a couple of days after all.\" \n\nShe shifted from foot to foot nervously, \"James and the girls will be arriving sometime tomorrow though. He promised he would drive them down tonight after his last class of the day. They won't bother you, will they? Not like another little pain, who had a huge crush on her brother's best friend.\"\n\nMike was shocked not just at this woman's revelation, but at how for a moment the genuine smile on her face so reminded him of that little 'pain' as she said, who had always seemed to be underfoot. He too smiled at the memories of those long-forgotten days, \"No, of course not,\" he lied. He had little experience with children. \n\n\"Are you staying in your old room then? Or Billy's?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mine,\" he replied as he sought something more to say to this woman that he neither knew nor understood. \"Are you hungry? There's some food in the fridge. I could make you something. I don't have much to drink though, just a couple of beers,\" he rambled.\n\nShe nodded her head slowly, \"Actually, that sounds nice. I was so rushed after Miss Landon called, trying to find people to cover my classes, throw a few things into a suitcase, and get a flight. All I could find was one of the budget ones that had nothing but peanuts and day-old sandwiches for sale. Not very appealing. I should have stopped in Tulsa I guess, but I just wasn't hungry then. Just let me put this in my old room, and I'll be right down.\"\n\nMike stood and crossed the room, taking the small case from her, \"Let me carry it up for you.\"\n\nShe nodded and thanked him as she followed him up the stairs to the room that had remained closed. She opened it and stepped just inside, flipping the switch that bathed the room in a gentle glow of another wall sconce. He sat the bag down just inside the door, \"You get settled, and I'll fix you that food.\"\n\nShe nodded and smiled, \"Thank you, Mike. I know that you have done a lot for Daddy. Things I probably should have been here to do myself. I know that you probably can't understand. I'm not even sure I do, and I'm a psychologist. But I want you to know, I do appreciate it. All you did for him.\"\n\nMike was not sure what to say to the woman's very earnest admission. He nodded as he closed the door, \"I'll have that food ready when you get settled.\" \n\nHe stood outside the door as he listened to what he thought was the sound of crying. He considered knocking, seeing if she needed anything, but this woman was not the little girl he had known or even the sullen and withdrawn teen that he had once met on one of his increasingly rare visits after Billy's death. This woman was a stranger. One that he suspected might not welcome his intrusion into whatever grief and guilt she might be experiencing. \n\nHe had no idea what to make of her admissions this night. But one thing he had learned in his too-long lifetime was...not to judge that which you do not understand. All those places, people, and different cultures that he had witnessed over the years had taught him...life was never as straightforward or as black and white as you wanted it to be. People were complicated; sometimes, situations were unfathomable. \n\nHe was reminded of one of his favorite sayings about walking a mile in someone's boots. He chuckled, not that he wanted to walk in those damned tight looking heels of this woman. But maybe that was the point. Perhaps like she said...he simply could not understand. Not that there was much in this fucked up world that he did or ever had. Or probably ever would.\n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER EIGHT***\n\nMike had been right. Dressed in his uniform, he felt conspicuous, to say the least. He knew no one that had come to the funeral home that evening. A few faces looked familiar, mostly from those Sunday church services. \n\nThe only exception had been Maude Landon and a couple of nurses, who had taken the time to stop by. Unlike all the others, who viewed the stranger that hung out in the corner of the room with veiled curiosity, they had sought him out. They had spent more time consoling him, if that was the word than they had the 'prodigal' daughter, who held court beside her father's casket with her husband and two young daughters.\n\nOf course, Mike soon came to understand at least some of this woman's reticence in coming back to this place. Having traveled and been stationed in more places than he wanted to remember, he had long since learned to put any prejudice he might have once had aside, if he ever had any that was. \n\nNot so with small Honour, Oklahoma, where the people openly gawked at the dark-skinned African man by little Becca Hall's side. Mike hoped that the two light-skinned beauties, who stood next to their mother were too young to understand some of the looks from the people of this town. \n\nThroughout the night, Mike found himself feeling more and more protective of the woman and her family, just as he once had of that little girl. Even that had been overridden when all the noise and the crush of people that were beginning to fill and overflow that small room got to be too much; he had stepped outside for some fresh air. \n\nWhat was it about funerals that made him want to smoke anyway? He approached a group of older men, who had congregated in the parking lot and were enjoying cigarettes. He would see if he could bum one off them perhaps. \n\nBut that jaunt brought him too close to a small klatch of blue-haired women, just outside the double door of the funeral home. \n\n\"How dare that woman? Who does she think she is, bringing him and those...those 'children' here? Lula Mae must be spinning in her grave right now. You'd think the woman would have the decency to at least respect her Mama's wishes more than that. Well, I never...\" said one of them dressed pristinely in a black polyester dress. \n\nIf she had been a man, Mike would have throat punched him. But since she was not, he did the best he could, \"Those 'children' as you call them are the man's granddaughters. And the man is her husband. Don't you think Becca might want and need her family's support after just losing her father?\" he demanded.\n\nThe woman lifted her nose, and half turned her back to him. Though her cheap polyester dress was anything but the couture that his grandmother might have worn, Mike knew a snub when he saw it, though this one rolled off him in a way that other one never could. \n\n\"That woman made her choices long ago. She knew how her parents felt about them too. I know for a fact that Lula Mae told her what a sin she was committing, that it was an abomination against god the mixing of...\" Mike felt his hands fist at his side as he blocked out her next words. \n\nHow was it possible that in the twenty-first century, such idiotic stupidity and racist drivel still existed in this country? The fact that men like Tommy with his mixed-race heritage and Manny with his proud Latino one had bled and died so this woman could keep spouting such asinine bullshit caused his stomach to tighten into a knot that was almost physically painful. \n\nThe fact that he knew this woman and others like her would look down upon the one woman he had ever loved in the same way filled him with a blinding rage that he had not felt since he was seven years old. \n\nHe was not sure what he would have done at that moment if it had not been for the gentle hand on his upper arm and the larger, firmer one that gripped his other shoulder restraining him just enough to allow him to tamp down that anger for the moment. \n\nBrenda smiled at the woman, \"Good evening, Missus Martha, Miss Mildred, Jolene, Beth. I see ya'll have met Mike. I don't know if ya'll remember, but he was Billy's friend from the Marines. He used to come home with him when they got leave,\" she took a step closer to him, almost protectively. \n\n\"He's the one that's been looking after Mister Clyde these last couple of months,\" she paused with a too-sweet smile.\"I'm sorry I shoulda known. You, ladies, must have run into him when ya'll visited the nursing home. Forgive my bad manners, that city living all these years, makes a girl forget herself,\" she beamed at them. \n\nMike would have sworn that the woman's nose went another inch higher as if she were smelling fresh 'cow pies' as Billy had taught him, they were called. He had to give Brenda her due. It seemed she had managed to do with her words what no fists could - put them in their place. \n\nOr so he thought until the woman opened her mouth, \"Yes, well, I am certain that you did not visit the man either.\"\n\nThe smile on the younger woman's face was not one of gloating triumph, but of genuine peace when she responded. \"Actually, I am glad I did. Mister Clyde might not have remembered me or known what I was saying, but it was nice just talking with him about old times...about...\"\n\nThe bear of a man, who was her husband released Mike's shoulder and stepped behind her, wrapping his saplings about her shoulders that were beginning to shake just a bit with unshed tears. \"We should be getting inside, baby girl. If you, ladies, will excuse us,\" the man said simply as he guided them both away from the group. \n\nThey could hear the woman, Missus Martha, Brenda had called her, in that high whiny voice, \"Well, I never.\"\n\nMike could not stifle the chuckle when Brenda wiped the moisture from her eyes with the back of her hand and whispered to them, \"I bet she ain't either. I feel real sorry for Mister Roy.\"\n\nJosh bent low and answered, \"Don't you worry about Mister Roy, suga. Word around the feed and seed is that he been 'visitin' Tessa Lee's for close to twenty years now.\"\n\nMike shook his head at the small town gossip that seemed as bad as, or worse than, all the ridiculousness that littered his friends' feed. Seemed that celebrities were not the only ones that made fools of themselves. Or had deep secrets to hide; he thought as he saw a newer pickup truck turn into the parking lot. \n\n\"His deployment was delayed. So, he flew back just for a couple of days on a special pass to see Isabel. She's pregnant again and having it pretty rough this time,\" Brenda explained as they watched Billy, his wife, and their little boy, whom Mike had never actually seen file out of the vehicle. \n\nIt seemed the Hall genes were strong ones since the boy too was the spitting image of his father, though his hair was darker and his eyes looked to be the warm brown of his mother's Latina heritage. Mike smiled and nodded as they waited for the young family to join them. \n\nThat smile widened when he saw those women's mouths drop open as Billy walked past them with his son in one arm and the other wrapped about Isabel, \"Evening, ladies.\"\n\nBrenda too laughed, \"Well, between my family and what little I heard as we were coming up the walk about Becca's, I figure there's plenty of gossip to keep Patsy Jo's beauty salon in business for another year or two at least.\"\n\nJosh shook his head at his wife and jokingly scolded her, \"Be good woman,\" he swatted her bottom playfully before reaching out and drawing his son, grandson, and daughter-in-law into an embrace that made Mike so uncomfortable he had to look away. \n\nHe would have excused himself then, perhaps even tried to slip away back to the farm early, had it not been for Billy's next words, \"So, will you introduce me to my aunt, Master Sergeant?\" \n\nMike looked from the Marine to his parents. \n\nBrenda shrugged, \"We had a good heart to heart on their wedding day. It's not like secrets keep around Honour anyway, which is probably why Josh and I stayed away so long.\" \n\nShe wiped tears from her eyes, \"Probably too long. For Mister Clyde and Missus Lula anyway.\"\n\n\"Mama, no more. We talked about this. You and Daddy did what you thought was right. And as a parent, god knows, I'm learning that's about all anyone can. So, wipe them tears, hold that head up high, and let's go do what we came to do,\" Billy absolved his mother.\n\nHis father beamed proudly at him as he released them from the hug and laced his wife's hand through his arm, \"Damn straight, son. As a family.\" \n\nMike nodded and would have taken a step back himself, fallen in line behind them, except that Brenda reached out and laced her other hand through his arm. \"That includes you too, Mike. Billy would not have had it any other way, if he were here now.\"\n\nHe fought back that tight knot that seemed to live perpetually in his throat these days and the blurred vision as his eyes watered. It appeared he was developing some sort of allergy perhaps, as he nodded his head and croaked, \"Yes, Ma'am.\"\n\nThe rest of the night had seemed almost anti-climactic. If Becca Hall-Okadigbo was shocked when the young man, who looked so much like her brother, made his way through the 'receiving line,' as Mike learned it was called, she had more class than to show it, unlike the 'church ladies' out front. She had merely smiled, shook his hand, and thanked him for coming just as she had the hundred or so others that she had greeted that night.\n\nAfter that Mike had managed to sneak away as the crowd continued to grow with people, who had never had time for Mister Clyde when he was alive, but suddenly felt the overwhelming need to 'pay their respects' now that the man was gone, dead and cold in that box. \n\nA huge part of Mike wanted to turn Esther in the other direction. Put as much fucking distance between Honour, Oklahoma and himself as he possibly could. Hadn't he done his duty here? He had sat beside Mister Clyde's bedside, fed the man, hell even changed a couple of them damned adult diapers over the weeks when they had been short-staffed and the nurses too busy to get to the man in what Mike considered a reasonable time to sit in one's own shit. \n\nHe sighed as he instead turned his motorcycle back towards the farm that had been his 'home,' if such a thing existed, for almost two months. He was exhausted and over-stimulated from the crowd, noise, and most definitely the emotional drama of this night. \n\nHe wanted nothing more than to grab a cold beer from the fridge, get out of his uniform, take a bath, and fall asleep before the others even got back. Even if he could not manage to sleep, he intended to pretend. He had had enough of people for one night...hell, for a lifetime. \n\n***\n\nMike had been lucky enough to do just that, though he was woken before dawn as usual. This time though it was the sound of the backhoe arriving and beginning the task of breaking through the dry, clumps of red earth that had sustained this family for over one hundred and fifty years. \n\nA hole had to be dug beneath the old willow tree out back. He had always thought it strange that the white picket fenced burial plot sat under the shade of the same tree with a tire swing that generations of Hall children had played on. Then again, what did orphans know of such things?\n\nHe had been surprised when he filed into the kitchen to find a red-eyed Becca sitting alone at that shabby table with her trembling hands wrapped around a cup of coffee. It did not smell as good as what he had come to expect at the caf\u00e9, but it was better than loads he had drunk over the years, especially that instant shit that was for emergency use only. \n\nShe looked up as he walked in and without preamble asked, \"When were you going to tell me about my nephew?\"\n\nMike supposed he should have expected this, but the way the woman had acted last night, he had thought perhaps she had not even noticed the strong resemblance. She had been so young when her brother died; he thought maybe she had even forgotten what Billy looked like. Or perhaps she had been gone so long, was so estranged from this place and these people, that she simply did not give a damn. It had certainly seemed that way over these past few weeks. \n\nHe knew one thing, though it was way too fucking early for a beer, he damned well needed the biggest cup of that Joe he could find to face this one. Without answering her question, he had walked over to the counter, pulled a mug from the cupboard, and poured himself the piping hot elixir of the gods before taking a seat across from the woman. Damned, this kitchen table had been the site of more drama these past few weeks than some televisions sets he imagined. \n\nHe ignored the burn as he swallowed half the contents of that cup and braced himself as he looked up to meet those blue eyes that were so much like her brother's had been. \"I wasn't sure you would even notice or care.\"\n\n\"Not notice? Not care?\" she shook her head as more tears streamed down her cheeks. \"How could I not notice a man that could have been my brother, that has been dead almost twenty-five years, walking up to me at my father's wake?\"\n\nMike nodded, \"I'm sorry, Ma'am. I didn't know the boy was coming. I thought his unit had already been deployed. I swear if I had known I would have said something to try and prepare you.\"\n\n\"How long have you known? Have you been in on this from the beginning? It sure as hell explains why Brenda Jo ran off with Cousin Josh all sudden like.\" The woman paused as she closed her eyes. More tears seeped from the corners. \n\nMike was searching his mind, trying his best to figure out what to say to the woman, rehearsing inadequate words when she opened her eyes and looked up at him with a weak smile. \n\n\"I'm sorry. I had no right to blame you like that when you have done so much for my father. Like I said the other night, things that I know I should have. I know you probably resent me, but...\"\n\nThe woman paused and brought the cup to her lips, drinking it as she shook her head, \"What's the use? Over twenty years, a Ph.D. in psychology, heck, James and I have even written protocols for grief counseling the children of Navy personnel killed in action. And I still cannot heal that hurt and lost little girl inside me. So, how can I possibly explain to you or anyone else what it is like?\"\n\nShe chuckled as another tear trekked down her cheek, \"Reminds me of a bible verse from that church where Mama and all those other hypocrites last night went. 'Physician, heal thyself.' Funny thing is that when I started studying psychology that was what I was looking for...to make myself whole again. But knowledge never seems to be enough.\"",
        "Mike nodded; he could certainly empathize with the woman. He knew all too well what it felt like to be empty, angry, and bitter. He had only seen Becca three times since Billy's death. \n\nThe first had been a few months after when he had finally made it back from that first deployment. He had noticed then that the little girl was quieter, less boisterous than she had been, but he was not really dealing with his own pain back then, spending more time in the bottle than he wanted to remember. He had just thought Mister Clyde and Missus Lula would handle it.\n\nShe had been a teenager about to graduate high school the next time he had seen her. Of course, he could not help but notice the changes then. The young woman wore nothing but black, even her strawberry blonde hair and nails were dyed and painted it. He had listened time after time as Missus Lula complained and nagged at her about it. \n\nBut he also knew that she was a straight-A student and finishing school a full year ahead of her classmates. She had been accepted at over half a dozen top universities and had scholarship offers to most of them. So like her parents, he figured it was just a phase she would outgrow.\n\nWhen he had seen her again a couple of years ago as they prepared to put Mister Clyde in Prairie View, Mike had been a bit reassured. If the woman seemed a bit uptight, he merely assumed it was just because she was some high and mighty professor now, sort of like most officers. He had written it off as just one of those things.\n\nOf course, he admitted it. She was right, over these past few weeks he had resented her, passed judgment on her. Last night for the first time though, he had begun to glimpse just a bit of what had kept the woman away for so long. \n\nNow, this. It seemed he had failed again. Failed Billy in taking care of that little 'pain' that always followed them everywhere they went when they were on leave. Failed Mister Clyde and Missus Lula when he might have been able to say or do something for that angry teen girl, a feeling he remembered all too well. And of course, failed little Becca also.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Becca,\" he said as he felt another weight heaped upon the ton which already weighed him down so heavily. \n\nShe shook her head, \"Sorry? Sorry for what, Mike? You had your life, a career. You only saw me a couple of times. How were you supposed to know? What could you have possibly done or said when my parents could not, did not...\"\n\nShe sighed heavily, \"I know they did their best. They were just farmers, dealing with the loss of their child the best way they knew how.\" \n\n\"What did they know of the stages of grief or how to help a child through them? But that's just it: that little girl cannot forgive them, either of them, for not seeing how badly she was hurting too. They were Mama and Daddy; they should have known, should have seen her pain too.\"\n\nMike tried to understand. Oh, he knew all too well what it was like to lose someone you loved at an early age. The thing was that for him there was no one to blame for 'not being there.' \n\nFor foster children, survival was not about dealing with the pain of loss. It was about having enough to eat, managing to hide a favorite toy from the others so that it was not stolen or destroyed, trying to avoid another beating or worse and wondering every single night if you would fall asleep in the same bed the next one. \n\nSo, it was a bit of a stretch to try and imagine being angry at your parents for not managing your grief as well as their own, not when your old man actually...\n\nHe shook his head and forced those thoughts away, back to the issue at hand. \"I'm here now, Becca and if you want or need to talk, I'm more than happy to listen,\" he offered.\n\nThe woman smiled and reached over, taking his mug as well as her own. \"We'll need more coffee if we're going to tackle this one,\" she joked nervously.\n\nThey talked for close to an hour before her husband and daughters came barreling down the stairs. Mike had sneaked out then, making the excuse of seeing how they were coming along with the digging. The truth was that he just needed some time to think about the things she had said. \n\nThings he had never known. That he was not the only one who had taken to drowning his sorrows in a bottle. Mister Clyde's own battle with alcoholism had remained a deep secret that the man kept hidden from everyone except his wife and daughter it seemed.  \n\nOf course, he had had hints of Missus Lula's bitterness, her anger at Brenda and Josh, her almost constant nagging at Becca and Mister Clyde and her renewed almost fanatical faith, but he supposed he had just chosen to overlook it all. \n\nHe had never thought how all of it might be affecting the little sister that Billy had loved so much. Just as he had never thought to check in on Brenda Jo, to see how the woman, who his best friend had loved so dearly was doing. \n\nIf he had, who knows maybe things could have been different for all of them. Maybe little Billy could have gotten to know his grandparents. Perhaps as Miguel had, the boy's presence would have healed some of those deep and festering wounds in this family, offered solace to them all, and brought them back together the way that Billy would have wanted. Another failure. Another friend that he had let down. Another stone dragging him down. \n\nAs he stood watching the men finish off that hole with shovels now that the hardest part of the job had been done by the backhoe, he knelt, and dusted the red clay from his dead friend's tombstone, \"I'm sorry about this too, Billy. But I give you my word; I'll do all I can to make it right. For your sister, for Brenda Jo, and most especially for that boy of yours.\"\n\n\u2003\n\n***CHAPTER NINE***\n\nMike sat on the back steps and watched as the children took turns on that old tire swing. It had been a joint operation between him, Billy, and Josh, to safety test the damned thing before letting them have at it. It had taken all of Brenda Jo's skills and Josh's fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies to distract the three children long enough to get the job done. But since to their knowledge no one had played on the damned thing in close to a quarter of a century, the men demanded it be vetted first. \n\nHe shook his head at how oddly this day had gone. Although why that should surprise him at this point was beyond him. Would he ever learn that life and the universe were a tangled, twisting road that cut back on itself more often than not? It certainly had this day.\n\nWhen they arrived at the small wooden church that the Halls had attended all their lives, Becca had shocked even him by asking Mike, Josh, and Billy to fill in as pallbearers for a couple of the older gentlemen, who had either died or were no longer up to the task. Though he was sure that group of 'church ladies' as Brenda called them would have plenty to say about this latest scandal, he didn't give a damn. He was honored and touched by her request.\n\nThis church service had tried Mike's patience even more than Manny's had. If that priest had ground his ax about the unknown ways of god, this preacher saw it as an opportunity to preach damnation and eternal salvation. \n\nNot that Mike was buying it. He had long since given up any hope of being 'saved' by anyone or anything. And the idea of heaven and eternity was definitely beyond him. This life was long enough; he sure did not want eternity. \n\nBesides what he had witnessed of those 'church ladies' had given him more than a belly full of these Baptists, even more than his Catholic upbringing. It took everything inside him not to stand up and walk out of the place in the middle of it all. \n\nInstead he had retreated into his mind and thoughts, which was never a good thing. The self-recriminations of that morning came back to haunt him as well as the ghost of that first of his too many battles. \n\nAt moments he could almost feel Billy standing in the back of that church, listening, and watching them all. The little sister, who was so bitter that she could not forgive her father before his death. The girlfriend, who had no one to turn to except his best friend and cousin. And most notably, the son that had never known his 'real' father or even been told of him until he was a man himself. \n\nMike had never been all that interested in school, especially the difficult to understand and sometimes hard to decipher English literature shit, but he did remember one quote that seemed to apply, something about the webs we weave when we deceive. This place and this family were full of those. \n\nWorse than any spider's he had ever seen. At least with a spider's web, you could stand back and admire the intricate beauty of the design, assuming you could ignore the things, dead or helplessly trapped in it. Deceit had no such pulchritude. It was nothing but the stink of those decaying flies caught in its powerful hold. \n\nHe berated himself for his part in all of that. Ignoring the signs of trouble with Becca. Just accepting Missus Lula's bitter explanation of things with Brenda Jo and Josh. The fact that he himself had come back a fucked-up kid, only marginally better off than his friend Larry had been back then, was no excuse for letting Billy down the way he had. \n\nBetween those thoughts and the way they were interrupted occasionally with a loud shout or pounding of the bible on the pulpit that startled Mike so much that he almost dove under the seat in front of him for cover, his nerves were frayed and his head pounding by the time the man called for them all to rise for the final prayer. \n\nThat was about the only thing about these Baptists that was better than the Catholics...no kneeling. But his relief was short-lived as that prayer stretched on for close to fifteen minutes as the preacher begged and pleaded with the sinners to come forward and accept Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. \n\nThen it was back into another of those black limousines for the ride back to the farm. Once more they were subjected to an overly long sermon on their supposed sin and another endless prayer pleading for them to be 'saved.' \n\nMike had stood stiffly at the back this time. He had looked around at the crowd, which had followed them back from the church. The weathered leather faces of the old farmers and their perfectly coiffed for the day wives. He noticed a decided absence of children and young people, only Becca's daughters and little Josh fidgeted in their seats, and Billy and Isabel were the youngest adults there. Mike knew that this family farming lifestyle was dying, but that brought it starkly home to him. \n\nHe had stared across at the abandoned construction site, a field of dead and dying dreams. Not only was it no longer a field of ripe wheat, corn, or freshly tilled dirt lying fallow for the coming winter, it had not even become the family homes that they had been assured would bring fresh blood and young families back to this dying town. It was as empty and falling apart as he felt. \n\nThe hardest part though was still to come as those strangers, who had not had the time to see Mister Clyde while he lived, seemed determined to hang about eating, gossiping, and making a mess until it was almost dusk. Mike had escaped back out to this corner of the small plot of land remaining in the family's hands - for now anyway. He had watched as the workers began the task of filling that hole in with the dry, red dirt. \n\nWas this all it came down to? A lifetime of laboring in that marginally fertile ground, struggling to keep the American dream alive, only to end up in a box beneath it. For a moment Mike even wondered if Billy's premature death might not have been a blessing in some fucked up way. \n\nHe would never face years of being abandoned by his own family, left to rot in a nursing home that despite how very hard Maude tried to care for its patients, was only barely acceptable. Supposed friends who could not be bothered to visit. Withering away to nothing in those god damned adult diapers. Maybe it was also a blessing that Mister Clyde had not been able to remember anything after all.\n\nHe had been just about to find some way to sneak away, look for a bar, and as he had with his motley band of brothers in the OC drown all of it in alcohol. Though he should have learned by now that too was futile. It always came back. \n\nThen he had been accosted by Josh and his son, enlisted in their efforts to ensure the safety of the next generation of Halls. The two men had even managed to hide away a few beers in their truck that they shared with him as they worked on testing the strength of that rope. \n\nIt was a job that had fallen, of course, to the younger man. Josh and Mike had stood back as Billy squeezed himself into the old tractor tire that had most definitely seen better days. He had jumped up and down in it a few times to test the weathered ropes ability to hold his weight. Then among the friendly jeers of his father, he had put the thing through its paces. \n\nMike had battled those damned allergies again as his throat tightened and his eyes watered at the sight of his best friend's son swinging from the tree that he knew his father had fallen from and broken a leg. For a second, he could almost see the man pushing that swing higher and higher, laughing with the little boy, the way it should have been. If not for that damned thing called war and death that had cut all that short, robbed this young man of his father and fractured this family to pieces that had scattered about the country.\n\nHe brought the almost empty bottle of beer to his mouth and drained it, promising himself not to fall back into those old patterns, not to take the easy road as he had after his friend's death. He reminded himself of all the reasons. He knew that with his family history, alcoholism and violence led to some very nasty places and besides those ghosts never went away when you drank; sometimes they actually got more vivid. \n\nNo, the path he had chosen was the right one. The only question now was where would be his next stop. He had spent almost two months here. Those first unbearably hot days of Southern California had turned into crisp Oklahoma fall nights. \n\nBut he had kept another promise, or he hoped like hell he had. He still was at a loss as to how to bring this family back together the way his dead friend would have wanted, but maybe some things were just impossible dreams. \n\nHer face flashed through his mind. No, some things were most definitely impossible dreams. \n\nJosh came up to him with another open bottle of beer in his beefy hand. Mike shook his head, \"No, thanks,\" he replied as the man nodded and brought it to his own lips before laughing at the antics of his oldest son as he tried to extricate himself from the tire. \n\n\"Thank you, man. Thanks for doing what he could not be here to do. For taking care of her and him like Billy would have if...\" Mike knew he had to say the words that no one else ever would, but that did not make them any more comfortable. \n\nJosh shook his head and wrapped one of those too large arms about his shoulders so that no matter how uncomfortable Mike was, he could not escape the manly embrace. \"It's been my pleasure,\" he saw tears emerge from the lined corners of the man's eyes. \n\n\"Sometimes that's the problem. Sometimes I lay in bed watching her sleep and feel like I betrayed him. Like I took what was his.\" \n\nHe shook his head, \"Watching that boy grow, feeling his first kick, right up to watching him march across that parade deck in San Diego, being there when Isabel gave birth, hell, having that baby named after my sorry ass. All of that, it should have been him. And I'm nothing more than a poor substitute.\"\n\n\"Never let me hear you say that again, Joshua,\" said the feminine voice behind them. \n\nThey turned to see the small cadre of women. Brenda Jo, Becca, and Isabel had all found Missus Lula's collection of aprons in the kitchen drawer, and each had a different brightly colored floral or gingham print wrapped about their waist.\n\nIt was Becca, who spoke then, as she shook her head, \"No, Cousin Josh. Don't ever let my Mama's bitterness or those nasty old biddies from that church make you think that again. Mike's right. I know my brother, and he would have been damned glad that you stepped up like you did.\"\n\nShe wrapped her arm about Brenda Jo, and her own face lightened, some of the pain and bitterness that always lurked around her eyes and the corners of her mouth melted away. \"And from what brief time I have spent with my nephew, it seems to me Billy would have nothing to complain about the way you raised him.\"\n\nBrenda Jo returned the woman's embrace, drawing her tighter against her. \"I'm sorry, suga. I should have been there for you. I should have seen how much his death hurt you too. I shouldn't have let Missus Lula's attitude keep me away from you.\"\n\nBecca smiled as tears ran down her cheeks, \"No one else could ever braid my hair the way you could.\" \n\nThey both laughed and hugged as the three little ones assailed Billy demanding to be first on that old swing. The man was overwhelmed, and only his father's intervention saved the day as it was decided that ladies went first and age before beauty; so the youngest of Becca's daughters climbed into the tire first and little Josh was consoled with being allowed to push his 'cousin.' Mike smiled wondering if politicians and officers should not be forced to attend training on simple common sense with the man.\n\n\"Let us help you clean up before we go,\" offered Brenda Jo when the men finally had that situation under control and were once more digging in the cooler for more beers.\n\nBecca nodded, \"Thank you. I'd appreciate it. And the chance to catch up without all those damned blue-haired biddies hanging around trying to eavesdrop on every word we say and spreading more rumors at Patsy Sue's. Is that place still around even? The woman must be seventy by now.\"\n\nBrenda laughed, \"Oh yes, the beauty parlor and the barbershop are still going strong. After all, they can't exactly discuss the tastiest bits of gossip after Sunday school, now can they? Nope, that place will be open as long as there is anyone left in Honour, Oklahoma.\" \n\n\"But Miss Patsy has hired the Phelps girl to do most of the cutting and styling these days. She's always there though to pour the coffee, make sure the woman does it all just right, and of course, embellish the truth as only she can.\" \n\nShe sighed, \"I'm afraid we've all given them enough to talk about for a while.\"\n\nThis time it was Becca, who hugged the older woman. \"Let'em I say. Who gives a damn what they think? I have the big sister I missed for so long back,\" she looked across as her husband shyly approached the men, only to be greeted with a beer, laughter, and a slap on the back that must have rattled the man's teeth. \n\n\"My favorite cousin too. And the bonus of a nephew, niece, and grandnephew I never even dreamt of. I say we got the best end of this deal, don't you?\"\n\nThe woman nodded and smiled, \"I am really sorry for keeping him from ya'll all these years. Maybe we shoulda...\"\n\n\"No, you did what you thought was right. And given the bitter gossip that both our families have been subjected to this past couple of days, who's to say you weren't right all along?\"\n\n\"But Mister Clyde and Missus Lula...\" Brenda Jo began through the tears.\n\nBecca shook her head, \"I don't know. Mama changed so much after Billy died. I'm not sure she would have been much of a grandma to that little boy.\" \n\nMike could hear the bitterness in the woman's voice as she continued, \"She sure wasn't to her grand-daughters. When I got pregnant the first time, I called, asked if she would come and stay when the baby was born. But all I got was another of her self-righteous sermons on sin and the mixing of the races.\"\n",
        "\"Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry,\" it was another round of feminine hugs and tears that had Mike looking for an escape. \n\nHe made his excuses to them and waved to the men. He could at last retreat to the quiet and solitude of the room that had been as close to a home for him as any place since he was seven years old. \n\nThough he knew it would be the last time, this the last night he slept in 'his own bed,' he tried not to think of such things. Instead he would busy himself with packing what little stuff he had. Go through that list of people and places on his phone and decide his next stop. \n\nThat was what he was pondering when the quiet knock at the door interrupted. \"Come in,\" he replied, thinking that perhaps it was Brenda Jo or Billy come to say their final farewells. He had not thought it would be Becca Hall-Okadigbo. \n\nAlthough she looked different, her blues eyes red and swollen, the hurt and pain in them were gone. She looked so much more like that carefree and innocent little girl that he and Billy had once swung from that very tree. \n\n\"I don't mean to disturb you, Mike, but there's a couple more things we need to talk about,\" she said as she came to sit on the foot of the bed next to him.\n\nHe noticed the yellowed and folded shift of papers in her trembling hands. This was it. The moment he had been dreading most. Though he knew that Mister Clyde had willed the house and remaining land to them both, even given Mike controlling interest, he had decided long ago that he would not argue, would not fight this woman about selling what little remained of their family dynasty. A dynasty that had died almost a quarter of a century before in his arms. \n\nIf the idea of someone demolishing this old house that had been built and re-built over the generations by Hall hands bothered him, well, he would not be around to witness it any more than Mister Clyde or Billy. No, the only thing he wanted was the assurance that the old tree, its swing, and that white picketed fence family burial plot would remain intact. He hoped that Becca would not think that too much to ask. \n\nHe steeled himself for that plea as the woman stared at the paper and began to speak, \"I hate to ask any more of you, Mike. Honest, I do. But I was only able to get someone to cover my classes for a few days. And honestly, I have had about as much small-town 'hospitality' as I can handle. I want to get my family back home before my daughters start to ask what 'monkey people' are.\"\n\nMike inhaled at not just the bitterness that was lurking just beneath the surface of her new smile but at the term itself. He wondered then, would his friend who had served side by side with men of all races have been able to salve some of this woman's troubles with her parents over the man she had fallen in love with? \n\nIt was yet another of those unanswerable what-ifs that Mike was sure would plague him in the remaining weeks and months of his existence. But he did not have time to dwell on it then as she continued talking.\n\n\"There are not enough assets left after paying for Daddy's care all this time. Honestly, James and I have had to dip into our savings this past couple of months, but I figured it was the least we could do,\" Mike frowned at this revelation. \n\nThat the woman, whom he had judged so harshly, had been paying what he knew was not insubstantial monthly payments out of her own pocket made him feel more than a bit guilty.\n\nHe nodded as he reached for the paper, \"I'll sign it, of course. I take it you have a buyer in mind? Can recoup some of that money?\"\n\nShe shook her head and held up a five-dollar bill, \"Maybe not the most lucrative business deal I have ever made, but I think it is the best one.\"\n\nMike frowned in confusion as she continued, \"Turns out that my nephew and his wife have been looking for someplace to put down roots once his enlistment is up. Especially with the way their family is growing.\"\n\nTears spilled over as she passed the papers to him, \"So, if you can stick around a few more days, file the paperwork for the expedited probate, and then handle the transfer of the deed into Billy's name, I'd really appreciate it.\" \n\nMike nodded his head as he tried to speak past that lump in his throat, \"It'd be my pleasure, Ma'am.\"\n\nShe wrapped him in an embrace, just as that little girl had every time he had come to visit. He thought then as he always had back then of his baby sister, who had not lived to breathe her first breath. Would she have been like this woman? Would they have been as close as Billy and Becca had once been? His list of those what-ifs seemed to grow by the second. \n\nBut one he did not have to add to the long list of his failures was the promise he had made that morning at his friend's tombstone. The family farm, or what remained of it, would see two more generations of Halls fill this house with laughter and love. He hoped with far, far fewer trials, tribulations, and struggles than the last one had endured. \n\n***\n\nIt had taken almost a week. Damned government paperwork again. But he had filled that time with more repairs around the old place, this time he had been joined most evenings by Josh and Brenda Jo. Even Isabel and little Josh, when she was feeling up to it, sometimes came by for a bit before she took the boy back to her in-laws for a bath and bed. They had worked together to repair, paint, and clean the old place. \n\nAnd though there would be plenty of work in the coming months and years for Billy to do once his deployment was over, and he returned to his family, by the time they had all moved Isabel and little Josh into the place, they were satisfied that it would be safe, comfortable, and habitable for her and the children...until this Billy made it home to them. Mike had wasted one of his few impotent prayers upon that very thing. \n\nThey had taken great pride in repainting the room that had been closed tightly for almost a quarter of a century for the man's grandson. It seemed right somehow that the child should have the place that had once been the grandfather's. The man he would never know other than as a piece of stone under the tree he would play in. \n\nThe only thing that was not freshly painted was the door frame with its yellowing and chipped surface upon which were the penciled growth markings of another little boy. Josh had passed Mike the pencil, and the honor of adding the first of this little boy's to them. \n\nThis morning had been a tearful round of hugs and reassurances that he was always welcome. That his room would remain there whenever he made it back this way. His stomach had tightened into knots around that final breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and all the 'fixins' as even he had taken to calling them. \n\nHe knew that it was an offer he would never take. That his work here was done. He had done his best by Billy, both of them. There was no reason to return to Honour, Oklahoma before he made that final, fateful trip to Boston.\n\nHe thought of that flag in its thick plastic bag and that newest mission he had acquired. He chuckled as he realized that he had not managed to shorten his list at all on this trip, merely check one-off and add another in its place. That was not how this was supposed to work. \n\nHe sighed as he approached the fork in the road that would determine his future. Or at least the next few days of it. He had narrowed the list down to two. His buddy, Gary, from Afghanistan was trying to rebuild some of the abandoned homes in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans for veterans and their families. Mike knew that since the man had been in a wheelchair for over five years an extra set of hands would be a big help. \n\nBut there was another stop. Though he wanted nothing more than to avoid the fresh painful memories and the impossible longings he knew it would bring, it called to him. \n\nIt was just four days until Halloween. How many times had he listened as Tommy told them all about her big Halloween that delighted all the children in that small Texas town? Whenever possible Tommy had tried to plan his leaves to coincide with the holiday, help his mother out with the heavy stuff like the haunted house. \n\nExcept this year, there would be no one to help Esther. He caressed the thrumming red metal between his legs as he sat at that intersection \u2014 no one except him. His friend's dying words echoed in his mind as the shrapnel scar on his shoulder burned as if to remind him of his promise. \n\n\"Take care of her.\" Those words had been haunting his dreams this past week. \n\n\"Damn it,\" he cursed. \n\nDid he have any choice? He had made a promise. Just as he had to another best friend all those long years ago. Maybe it was right that he kept those promises before seeing to the rest of his list. So, as hard as he knew this trip and his cock was going to be for the next few days, he turned the motorcycle that he had named after the woman in the direction of Sebida, Texas. \n\nIf he rode straight through, he might be able to make it by this evening. It was not very long to steel himself for his first face-to-face meeting with the only woman, who had ever captured his imagination and what heart he had left. The truth was that this would be his toughest mission, whether that be now or months from now. \n\nNo, best to get it out of the way. Check on the woman, make sure she was doing all right...or as well as she could be given that her son had died in his arms only six months ago. Maybe, just maybe, he could quiet one more of his ghosts as he had with Manny and Billy. Even if he feared that this trip would only cause him more pain... \n\nHe smiled as he thought of Luke once more and his fateful words, \"I could never get her out of my blood. You ever met a woman like that, buddy? Someone you know you'll never be good enough for, but can't help loving anyway.\"\n\nBut Mike knew that there would be no happily ever afters for him the way there had been for Luke and his Kim Lee. There had never been, not for that little orphan that was too old and too damaged by all he had seen that night ever to be adopted. \n\nNot for the Marine that knew only duty, blood, and gunpowder. So, why should things be any different for the man whose future was measured in days, weeks and months? Still he had a promise to keep...even if this one did kill him or more likely broke what little heart he had left.\n\n***AUTHOR'S NOTES***\n\nOne thing I always struggle with is placing a trigger warning upon these books. I am always humbled and awed by the comments and especially the emails that I receive from the men, women, and families that purchase our safety and freedom at such a high personal price to themselves. To hear of how Mike's story affected them, fills me with purpose, and gives meaning to my writing like no other of my stories ever have. These novellas are a labor of love. \n\nSo, to all those who know Mike's struggles intimately with PTSD...please never, ever give up. Never take that road that Luke tried, or Mike contemplates. You have no idea how much you would be missed. How much you still have to give this country and those you love. Reach out for help and as someone who has struggled with her own mental health issues, trust me I know how fucking hard that is, especially when you seem to be greeted with nothing but prejudice and roadblocks. BUT keep trying...there are resources and people out there who want to help. \n\nOf course, nothing beats that beer, coffee, or hug. I know that sometimes it seems people just can't be bothered. That is because way too many of them cannot be. But there are those out there, who can be \u2014 friends, who will listen to you. Don't give up looking for them...it only takes one true friend like that to make all the difference. \n\nAnd when you do find them...hold on to them. Don't push them away. Don't listen to those lying voices that say it is too late, no one can love you, or you don't deserve it. You do. You have paid and keep paying an incredibly high price for my freedom...one that some of us recognize and will never forget. Let us repay you some of that debt. Use that same fighting spirit that you did then to battle these demons and ghosts too. \n\nRemember especially as you read this book, the hardest in this series to write and to read, it is always darkest before the dawn. Hang in there. Mike's dawn is coming...and so too do I believe is yours. \n\nGoddess bless, protect, and heal you now and always,\n\nTara"
