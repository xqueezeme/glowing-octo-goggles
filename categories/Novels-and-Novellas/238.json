        "By woodmanone  copyright October 2010\n\nReading Chapters 1 & 2 will give you a better feel for the characters and the events that have led them to this point.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my story. Constructive comments and/or emails are appreciated and more than welcome.\n\n*******************\n\nA slight noise interrupted the confrontation causing the five gunmen to turn toward the side. They saw a man with steely eyes staring back at them. Surprise showed on their faces; they hadn't heard Dillon ride up. \n\n\"You can have the one on your end Dillon,\" Red replied.\n\n\"Get off our land and keep moving,\" Josh ordered.\n\n\"Too late for that now,\" Red responded. \"They'll just wait and bushwhack us along the trail or maybe here at the house where the kids could get caught in the crossfire. I say we take care of them right now.\"\n\n\"That's right Josh,\" Dillon agreed. \"These skunks will keep coming at you until they get you and your family or until they're stopped. Now's as good a time as any to finish it.\"\n\nStillwell and the others realized they had no choice but to try and kill Josh, Red, and Dillon. The man closest to Dillon started to turn his horse with a pistol in his hand. Before he could get face to face with Dillon a rifle shot rang out and the man was knocked out of his saddle. Dillon turned his attention to the next man and shot him in the head. By this time the other three, including Stillwell, were all lying on the ground. Their horses bolted and were running away.\n\nRed heard a horse coming fast and looked behind Dillon. Dillon turned and saw Elizabeth riding at a high gallop toward them; she had her rifle lying across the saddle in front of her. Red chuckled and Dillon smiled with pride. \n\n\"Fine shot Elizabeth made Dillon. She's about as feisty as Sarah,\" Red remarked with admiration. \n\n\"Sometimes she's got too much spunk,\" Dillon replied with a smile. As Elizabeth pulled her horse to a stop, he said, \"Thought I told you to stay back there girl.\"\n\n\"But you didn't say I couldn't help out, so I made my shot from over yonder,\" Elizabeth said as she walked to Dillon and put her arms around his waist and her head on his chest.\n\nHe hugged her to him. \"You did fine Honey.\"\n\nSarah and Danni came running out of the house, holding their own rifles. There was smoke flowing out of the barrels. \"Are you okay?\" Sarah asked as she came to Red and Danni went to Josh.\n\n\"We're fine,\" Red replied and Josh nodded. Red continued, pointing at Dillon and Elizabeth, \"Looks like our guests just paid for their lunch.\" \n\nJosh looked down at Danni and asked, \"Where are the kids?\"\n\n\"I told John to keep them in the house,\" Sarah answered. \"He's got them playing hide n go seek.\"\n\n\"Let's drag the bodies behind the barn and wrap them in a ground cloth,\" Josh said. \"We'll round up their horses and put them in the small corral. After lunch we'll ride to town and tell the Sheriff to come get the bodies and their horses.\" His face was red with anger as he added, \"Don't want them buried on our land.\"\n\n\"Sorry Dillon, guess we'll have to put off the horse trading for another day,\" Red remarked.\n\n\"We can come back tomorrow or the next day,\" Dillon replied. \"Your ladies don't seem too upset about the shooting.\" He nodded at Danni and Sarah with admiration.\n\n\"There's been a few other...err...incidents during the years,\" Red responded. \"They're veteran soldiers by now. But it will take a little cuddling tonight to settle them down. He smiled and added, \"Me too.\"\n\n\"Well if you've a mind to Dillon you can ride your pick of the horses and come with me into town to see the Sheriff. That'll give you a real feel for the animal,\" Josh suggested. \"While we're gone I'll send a rider over to the Maggie M and have Jerry bring over the two horses he's willing to part with. They were both sired by his Morgan; either one would make a good horse for Elizabeth. You can spend the night here and go back in the morning, if you've a mind to.\"\n\n\"I reckon I could stand another afternoon in town,\" Red agreed.\n\nBefore Josh could say anything, Sarah spoke up. \"You're not going off and leaving us here alone Red McCall. Either you or Josh are going to stay right here.\"\n\n\"Yes em,\" Red replied. Turning to Dillon he said grinning, \"See told ya, she's feisty.\"\n\nJosh and Dillon walked back to the corral and the horses he had available. \"What kind of horse are you looking for Dillon? That animal of yours has the looks of a good one.\"\n\n\"Buck's one of the best horses I've ever owned. I've had him since '64 and rode him a lot of miles since then. But he's going on 15 and I'd like to give him some rest; wouldn't mind breeding him too. If we find a ranch I'll need more than one horse anyway.\"\n\n\"You talked about a ranch at the diner yesterday,\" Josh said. \"Up around Colorado Springs you said. You know there's a good ranch for sale not far from here.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"Coming out here if you'd turn west at the big bluff it's about 3 miles; just this side of the mountains,\" Josh answered.\n\nDillon thought for a few seconds and replied, \"Might be worth looking into. Don't know if Eleanor would want to live here though; she got an idea about teaching school. Why's it for sale?\"\n\n\"Feller named Tom Anderson owns it. Says he's getting too old to ride the range anymore and wants to get out. His boy was killed on a cattle drive last year; there was a stampede and his horse went down right in front of the herd. Tom and his wife sorta lost heart after that; said they've had enough and are going out to California.\"\n\nThe two men came to the corral and climbed up to sit on the top rail. Diablo and two other horses came over to greet them. \"They're looking for treats,\" Josh explained as he handed each of the horses a piece of apple. \"Hello Diablo,\" he said as he scratched the horse's ears. That big grey is Balin; his name is Cheyenne for warrior. He's one of Diablo's sons out of Lady, that grey mare over there.\"\n\n\"I know that Diablo isn't for sale but what about that roan over there?\" Dillon asked.\n\nJosh smiled, \"If I sold Itsa, Diablo would be real put out. So would Danni; she's dang near made a pet out of him. He's another one of Diablo's sons.\"\n\nDillon and Josh talked about the merits and breeding lines of a few horses. Danni had come to join them and after listening to them for a few minutes she went into the barn. She came out leading a buckskin filly.\n\n\"This is Sandy, she's yours if you want her,\" Danni said. \"Sunny there is her sire and Red's quarter horse, Queenie, is her dame.\"\n\nJosh was surprised; Sandy was sort of Danni's pet. \"I thought you said you didn't want to sell Sandy.\"\n\n\"Men, you don't listen,\" Danni was grinning. \"What I said was that I didn't want to sell her to just anybody. I wanted her to go to a good home. Sandy would be a fine horse for Elizabeth.\"\n\nDanni turned to Dillon. \"It's my way of saying thanks to you and Elizabeth for helping Josh and Red.\"\n\nDillon looked at Danni and with a small smile said, \"Thank you. Elizabeth will be tickled pink. Back in Arizona she rode one of the stock horses. She's always wanted a horse of her own.\"\n\n\"It's settled then. Josh, you and Dillon work out the money details,\" Danni ordered. She went back to the house leading Sandy.\n\nThe men watched her walk away and Josh said, \"She always full of surprises.\" He chuckled and added, \"That's one of the reasons I love her.\"\n\nDillon nodded his understanding. Turning back to the corral he said, \"Could I ride Balin into town?\"\n\nJosh nodded and they saddled Itsa and Balin. Diablo pushed against Itsa wanting to be saddled. Josh had to push him out of the way. \"It's worse than having a bunch of kids,\" Josh remarked. \"If I ride Diablo too much Itsa pouts and if I ride Itsa for more than a day Diablo gets surly. I should'a raised chickens instead.\"\n\nDillon had to laugh as they rode up to the house. As he said good bye to Elizabeth he told her, \"I'm going to send a telegram to your mother and ask the family to join us in Fountain. Eleanor should look at some of these horses and there's a ranch available I think we should see too.\"\n\n\"Did you see my horse? Danni said she's a real good animal,\" Elizabeth said excitedly.\n\n\"She ain't yours yet. Josh and I have to agree on a price for her.\"\n\nJosh winked at Elizabeth, indicating that the price on Sandy wasn't going to be a problem. \"We'll be back by early evening,\" Josh said. \"If we've got time we'll stop over to Anderson's place and let Dillon take a look. Don't worry if it's after dark before we get here.\"\n\nThey rode at several different gaits traveling into Fountain. Josh wanted Dillon to see how Balin handled himself. They started at a fast walk and after the horses warmed up they kicked them into a trot, a cantor, and then into a gallop for a short stretch. Josh could see by the look on Dillon's face that he was impressed with Balin.\n\nWhen they rode into Fountain, Dillon went to the telegraph office. He sent a wire to Eleanor care of Ted. Dillon asked the clerk to make sure the message was delivered as soon as it got there. He hoped to get an answer before leaving to go back to the Josh's ranch that afternoon. Leaving the telegraph office they went to see Sheriff Kennedy. \n\n\"Howdy Josh,\" Kennedy said as Josh and Dillon entered the office. \"Surprised to see you in town two days in a row.\"\n\n\"We've had a hell of a day out at the ranch. By the way, this is Dillon Gallagher. He and his family are thinking about moving here.\"\n\nAfter greeting Dillon Kennedy asked, \"So what happened out to your place?\"\n\nJosh started the story of Stillwell and his men's attack on him and Red. Dillon added things as Josh explained the gun fight. \"We wrapped the bodies and put them behind our barn. Sheriff you'll need to come out and get them pretty quick.\"\n\nKennedy listened without asking questions; Dillon and Josh had given all the information he needed. \"Guess that's the end of that family or at least this part of it. The father of the boys and the last brother were shot while trying to rob a bank over to Pueblo two years ago.\"\n\n\"Trash is trash,\" Dillon said coldly. \"And good riddance to them.\"\n\nThe Sheriff nodded. \"Well I guess I better get a wagon and head out to your place Josh. Are you boys going back right away?\"\n\n\"I think we'll stay in town for a while,\" Josh said. \"Dillon is waiting to hear from his family in Colorado Springs. Maybe we'll have a beer or two.\"\n\nStanding at the bar in the saloon having a beer, Josh said, \"If your family starts riding tomorrow morning they can be here by mid morning, well before lunch.\"\n\nDillon chuckled. \"They'll probably come in a wagon. I don't think Oso will find a horse that he can ride at the livery.\"\n\n\"Doesn't he ride well?\"\n\n\"That's not it. He......well he's just Oso. You'll understand when you met him,\" Dillon replied.\n\nThey waited for a couple of hours and made a stop at the telegraph before they headed back to the CBC. The clerk looked up as they came into the office. \"I was just going to send my boy to find you. I've got an answer from your family Mr. Gallagher.\"\n\nDillon took the telegram, read it, and smiled. \"They'll start this way tomorrow morning,\" he told Josh. \"They should be here by late afternoon.\"\n\nAfter Dillon received the answer to his telegram, he and Josh rode back toward the ranch. It was late afternoon when they got to the turn off for the Anderson place and they decided to pay a call. As they rode toward the ranch house, Josh pointed out some of the creeks and water holes. Dillon noticed a lot of good grass land and an abundance of trees.\n\nThey visited with Tom and Julie Anderson for about an hour and looked around the ranch. Dillon asked the price and was surprised that it was fairly reasonable. \"I'd like to bring my family over to look at your place in the next day or two,\" Dillon said. \"Would that be okay?\"\n\n\"Hell yes boy. Be happy to have them,\" Anderson answered with a big grin.\n\nSaying goodbye, Josh and Dillon rode back to the CBC. After riding for several minutes Josh talked about the Anderson place.\n\n\"Anderson's is only about 400 acres but its prime cattle country,\" Josh said.\n\n\"Little small for a cattle ranch if you want to run a bigger herd,\" Dillon responded.\n\nJosh nodded and continued, \"It is smaller than our place but you can homestead the land behind it and make it a lot larger.\"\n\n\"How's that? Homestead?\"\n\n\"The Federal Government passed the Homestead Act in '62. It says that anyone at least 18 can file on 160 acres,\" Josh explained. \n\n\"That's all, just file a claim?\"\n\n\"You have to file an application on the land you want, live on it for five years and make improvements. Then you can file for a deed of title. That means that between the four in your family you could claim another 640 acres,\" Josh told Dillon. \"That'd give you over a thousand acres. That ought to be enough for a good size herd.\" \n\nDillon thought for a minute and asked, \"If it's that easy why hasn't someone homestead the land before?\"\n\nJosh laughed. \"Anderson's place runs right up to those mountains yonder. And the only pass that can be used to move cattle through the mountains opens on his land. The next closest pass is 20 miles or more away through real rough country. If anyone claimed the land on the other side of the mountains they'd be land locked unless they could work out a deal with Tom.\"\n\nNow it was Dillon's turn to laugh. \"If we bought out Anderson we could connect it to the land on the other side of the pass.\"\n\nJosh continued, \"To satisfy the improvement requirement, you'd have to build a small cabin on each of the homesteads.\"\n\n\"With all that timber on those mountains and along the creek we could easily build four log cabins,\" Dillon replied. \n\n\"Yep,\" Josh replied. \"C'mon let's get home before supper's over.\" With that he spurred Itsa into a gallop. Dillon was right beside him on Balin. The two horses broke through the trees into the clear running neck and neck. \n\nThe men pulled the horses up by the corral. \"I think it was too close to call a winner Dillon.\"\n\n\"No, I'm the winner,\" he replied. At Josh's funny look he said, \"I won because I found a damn good horse. If you don't want my first born I think we can make a deal for Balin.\"\n\nKennedy, with his deputy Roy driving the wagon, came out from behind the barn. They had the grisly cargo in the bed of the wagon covered with a large canvas. Kennedy rode up to Josh. \"Made use of the canvas you had covering them Josh. Hope you don't mind.\"\n\n\"We'd probably just burned it anyway Sheriff,\" Josh replied with a grim smile.\n\n\"Well, get a replacement at Mitchell's and tell him to bill the sheriff's office,\" he ordered.\n\n\"Stay for supper Sheriff,\" Josh offered. \"That goes for you too Deputy.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but I reckon we ought to get back to town. Got a bit of a ride and I don't fancy being on the trail after dark. See you boys the next time you get to town. Come on Leroy let's get going.\" Tipping his hat Kennedy and the deputy left for Fountain.\n\nJosh and Dillon washed their hands and faces at the pump on the back porch and entered the kitchen. Danni, Sarah, and Elizabeth were fixing supper and Red sat at the table offering suggestions on how to do it.\n\n\"Red if you don't hush up, I'll make you cook all the meals from now on,\" Sarah scolded.\n\nThe ladies didn't realize that Josh and Dillon had returned until they heard them laugh. Danni and Elizabeth came to welcome their men home.\n\n\"Well I found a horse Honey,\" Dillon said. \"I'm going to buy Balin.\" At the look Elizabeth gave him he added, \"And Sandy too of course.\" \n\n\"Time enough for horse trading after dinner. You men set the table while Danni and I get the wild bunch cleaned up,\" Sarah said pointing to the four children playing in front of the house.\n\nSupper time in the Kelly/McCall household was something Dillon, or Elizabeth for that matter, had never experienced. The four children seemed determined to out talk each other and only quieted down when scolded by the parents; the quiet would last about five minutes and then they were off again. The adults were almost as bad but they made a point to pull Dillon and Elizabeth into their discussion.\n\nAfter supper, sitting on the porch with coffee and a cigar Dillon watched the kids chase lightning bugs. For the first time in his life Dillon began to think about being a parent. He looked at Elizabeth setting with Danni and Sarah and he smiled. We've never talked about children, he thought to himself. Maybe it's about time.\n\nLater Sarah carrying a lamp led Dillon and Elizabeth to the guest house that had been converted from one of the bunk houses. \"This place will keep you from being overrun by that zoo up at the big house,\" she told them while lighting a coal oil lamp. And with a small laugh she added, \"It'll give you some privacy too. Breakfast at six, if you care to join us.\"\n\nGoing to bed Dillon put his arm around Elizabeth and she put her head on his chest. Nows as good a time as any to talk about having children, Dillon thought. Before he could say anything Elizabeth spoke up. \n\n\"Dillon, have you ever thought about us having kids?\" Elizabeth asked in a rush. Maybe I could've been a bit more tactful, she thought. When she heard Dillon laughing, she sat up to look at him.\n\n\"I was about to ask you the something Honey,\" he replied still chuckling. \"We sort of got married in a fever and never talked about things much. What about you Honey, do you want to have kids?\"\n\n\"I asked you first.\"\n\nReckon one of us has to say what they think first, Dillon thought. So here goes. \"Watching Josh and Red and their families and the way you were with their kids got me to thinking that you and I should have a real family,\" Dillon answered.\n\n\"Guess great minds think alike. I was thinking the same thing,\" Elizabeth admitted with a grin. \"When do you think we should start our family?\"\n\n\"Right now is fine with me,\" he replied with his own grin. \"Though we might want to find a place to live first.\"\n\nElizabeth laid down putting her head back on Dillon's shoulder. \"Let's not wait too long. Okay?\"\n\nAt breakfast during the normal circus of the kids and Red, Josh turned to Dillon. \"I forgot to tell you. Jerry sent word yesterday that he'd bring his horses over here tomorrow or take them into town if you'd like. He was tied up doing a repair job on the dam and couldn't get away until then.\"\n\n\"Dam?\"\n\n\"Yeah, several years back Red came up with the idea to build a dam and back Chico Creek up into a lake,\" Josh answered. \"Gave us a good watering hole for the stock.\"\n\n\"And our farmer here dug some canals for irrigation and we grow a lot of feed for the cattle,\" Red added. \"The feed sure comes in handy when we get a real cold spell or lots of snow.\"\n\n\"You're not going back to Fountain to meet your people until this afternoon, right?\" At Dillon's nod Josh continued, \"Let's take a ride over to the dam site and let Red show off a little. It'll be a good chance for you and Elizabeth to get know your new horses.\"\n\nDanni joined the conversation saying, \"Why don't we pack a picnic lunch and all go? We can take lunch to Jerry and his crew too.\"\n\nJosh nodded and replied, \"Good idea. I'll go hitch up the wagon so we can take the kids.\"\n\nWilliam, Josh's boy butted in and said, \"I want to ride, don't want to sit in a wagon.\"\n\nJohn and Daniel quickly joined in, \"We want to ride too. We want to ride too.\"\n\n\"Okay, settle down,\" Red told them. Turning to Sarah he said, \"We could ride double with them, it's an easy trail over to the dam and it's not very far.\" She nodded.\n\nJosh, Red, and Dillon went down to saddle the horses while the ladies put together food for a picnic in three baskets. Dillon was surprised that Red saddled Jasper, his big black stallion. He'd heard the stories about how mean and contrary the horse could be. Dillon asked Red about it.",
        "\"Jasper's only acts up with me or with strangers,\" Red replied. \"Watch when the boys come down here.\"\n\nRed's boys, John and Daniel, came running down to the corral and right up to Jasper. The big horse lowered his head so the two boys could scratch his ears and feed him pieces of apple. \"See he's like a big four legged teddy bear with the boys.\"\n\nWilliam had come to the corral with the other boys but went into the barn where his father was. He came out leading Diablo as Josh led Sunny and Sandy. Josh smiled at the boys and Jasper shaking his head. Diablo's the same way about William and Maggie, Josh thought.\n\nElizabeth saddled Sandy while Dillon saddled Buck. \"Thought you'd ride Balin,\" Josh said.\n\n\"Riding him wouldn't be right. I don't own him yet,\" Dillon replied. Pointing to Sandy he added, \"Don't have that choice with Sandy. Elizabeth wouldn't forgive me if we didn't buy Sandy.\"\n\nJosh looked at Dillon for a few seconds. \"You got a hundred dollars on you Dillon? Dillon was surprised at the question but nodded. Josh asked, \"Give it to me will you?\"\n\nDillon dug into his pocket and handed Josh five Double Eagle gold coins. \"You just bought yourself two horses Mr. Gallagher,\" Josh told him.\n\nBefore Dillon could object that Balin and Sandy were worth more than that, Josh said, \"It's our way, Danni's and mine, of saying thanks for your help. Besides, I know that both of them are going to someone that'll take good care of them.\"\n\nDanni and Sarah joined the group at the corral. Danni had been holding Maggie's hand but when the youngster saw the horses she broke away. Maggie ran over to Sunny and hugged one of the buckskins front legs. Sunny reached down and nudged the girl with his nose as if to say hello.\n\nElizabeth laughed at the look on Dillon's face when he saw how Danni and Sarah were dressed. Both women were wearing men's pants. Danni notice his surprise and giggled.\n\n\"Going into town we usually wear riding skirts,\" she told him. When we go to church or if we have company, like last night, we'll wear dresses. But for working around the ranch we wear trousers. Sorry to shock you Dillon.\"\n\n\"In town or when we have company we like to look like females,\" Sarah added. \"But working or riding the range we don't really care if we look like ladies.\"\n\nRed grinned at his wife and said, \"I think if you girls were wrapped in buffalo robes there'd still be no doubt that you're females. And pretty ones too.\"\n\n\"Oh Red,\" Sarah said as she walked over to him, hugged him and gave him a quick kiss. Turning back to Dillon and Elizabeth she said, \"Just when I think there's no hope for him he says something nice.\"\n\n\"We want to ride, we want to ride,\" the four kids said.\n\nRed mounted and pulled his two boys up on Jasper with him. He put John in front of him and Daniel behind him. Josh put William on Diablo and mounted behind him as Danni did the same with Maggie on Sunny. Sarah, Elizabeth, and Dillon each carried a basket of food for the picnic.\n\nAs they topped the crest of a hill Dillon and Elizabeth saw a rock dam running from one hill to another. Behind the wall was a large lake shimmering in the sunlight. Dillon estimated that the lake was at least a mile long and about three hundred feet across at its widest.\n\nRed was smiling at Dillon's reaction to the lake and dam. \"This high plateau is good grazing land but water is a little scarce if you wanted to run more than one or two hundred head of cattle up here. The cattle used to just about drink Chico Creek dry in the heat of the summer. So we came up with the idea of this dam.\"\n\n\"It wasn't we, it was Red that thought of this idea,\" Josh told Dillon interrupting his partner. \n\n\"I see a lot of leaks in the dam,\" Dillon said. \"Is Jerry repairing those?\"\n\n\"Nope, we don't care if the dam leaks,\" Red answered. \"I think it was Josh that said we weren't trying to stop Chico Creek, we just want to borrow its flow for a while.\" \n\n\"Some of the rocks have settled since last year,\" Josh told Dillon. \"Jerry and the men are just filling in some low spots with more rock.\"\n\nJerry had seen Red, Josh and the rest ride toward the lake. He also saw the baskets and knew they were going on a picnic. He motioned for his crew to stop work.\n\n\"This lake lets us run a lot more stock up on the plateau,\" Josh explained. \"It also lets us irrigate that plain over there to grow silage, hay, and corn for winter feed; there's more than 50 acres we use for that. That extra feed sure cuts down on losing cattle in the dead of winter\"\n\n\"But the best thing about the lake is it makes a great swimmin hole for the kids during the summer,\" Red added laughing. \"Makes a pretty good fishin hole too.\" He let out a rebel yell and said, \"C'mon kids let's get wet.\" Red, Josh, and Danni sent their horses at a run toward the lake.\n\nRiding Jasper into the lake up to his belly, Red picked John up and threw him into the water followed quickly by Daniel. As Josh and Diablo got close to the lake, William squirmed down and ran into the water. Danni dismounted, helped Maggie down and waded into the lake with her.\n\nDillon and Elizabeth had followed the mad rush to the shore line. Elizabeth gasped in surprise when Red threw his sons into the lake. Sarah had followed at a more sedate pace and came up behind them. \"Red and Josh had those kids swimming about the same time they learned to walk,\" she explained. \"Never would have thought that a cowboy from the dry plains of Texas would know how to swim.\"\n\nRed pulled off his boots and tossed them to dry land. He looped his gun belt around the saddle horn and stood up on his saddle. He gave another rebel yell and dove into the water beside his sons. Then the water fight started with the two boys ganging up on their father. Josh wasn't far behind and William jumped on his back trying to dunk him.\n\nDillon was laughing hard at the \"boys\" antics. Turning to Elizabeth he said, \"See what we have to look forward too?\"\n\nElizabeth looked at him with a gleam in her eye. She shucked her boots, ran to the lake, and dove in. She yelled back at Dillon, \"C'mon in, you need a bath anyway.\"\n\nDillon dismounted, dropped Buck's reins, and dropped his gun belt. He took off his boots and with a rebel yell of his own ran into the water. He looked up and saw the horses standing at the edge of the lake looking at the crazy humans.\n\nHe stood and swept his long wet hair out of his eyes. Dillon noticed movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned and squinting into the sun saw about a dozen riders on the crest of the far hill. Being as natural as he could be, he walked out of the water toward his gun. \n\nDillon reached down, picked up his gun belt and buckled it to his waist. \"Josh, Red, we've got company,\" he said pointing with his chin at the riders as he pulled his rifle from the saddle scabbard. Both men looked in the direction indicated and they began to slowly come out of the water; they brought the children with them. \n\n\"Danni, you and Sarah take the kids over behind that rock outcropping there,\" Josh ordered. \"Take your rifles with you.\"\n\nRed gathered the horses and walked them over to where the women and children hid behind the rock outcropping. \"Hold on them tight,\" he told Sarah and Danni. \"We might need them pretty quick.\" He had to smile at Elizabeth; she was kneeling behind a big rock dripping water but holding her rifle at the ready. Sarah's not the only one that's feisty, he thought.\n\nJerry and the two men working with him on the dam had mounted their horses to join the family playing in the lake. Josh gave a shrill whistle; it was a well used signal between them to form a defensive front. Jerry didn't even look back to see what the problem was; he yelled at his men and they spurred their horses into a gallop.\n\nWhen they got to the family Josh nodded at the riders on the hill. Jerry quickly dismounted and positioned his men near the women. \"Any idea who it is?\" He asked Josh. Josh just shook his head.\n\nThe riders on the hill watched as the people by the lake reacted to their presence. The leader motioned to his companions and slowly rode down the hill. They stopped at the waterway below the dam and let their horses drink. One man came on alone.\n\nRed had eyes like a hawk and quickly realized that the dozen or so riders were Indians. As the lone rider slowly got closer Red turned to Josh and said, \"I don't believe it. That's your old friend Running Wolf.\"\n\nThe Indian had gotten close enough that Josh recognized him too. \"Wait here,\" he said mounting Diablo. \n\n\"Josh, take your gun belt,\" Red suggested.\n\n\"If Running Wolf wanted to cause us trouble, we'd never seen him on the hill. This is a friendly visit,\" Josh replied. At least I hope so, he thought. He turned Diablo to ride out and meet the chief of Jicarilla Apache.\n\nJosh rode to about twenty feet and stopped. Running Wolf nodded and dismounted; Josh dismounted too. The chief walked closer to Josh and place one hand on his shoulder; Josh copied the gesture. The Indian dropped his hand and said something in Apache and smiled.\n\n\"Young Kelly has grown into a man,\" Running Wolf said in English. Josh was surprised; the first time he'd met Running Wolf the Apache didn't speak English.\n\nIt had been over ten years earlier when Josh and Running Wolf met for the first time. The Apache had been slowed by a several days of heavy rain on their way to their summer camp. They'd used up a lot of their food supply and hadn't had any success at hunting.. Josh had persuaded the wagon master, Hobart, to give the Indian band some cattle to feed the women and children.\n\nThe next day in a ceremony showing his respect and admiration for the young man that had helped his band, Running Wolf adopted Josh and Diablo into the Jicarilla Apache tribe. He gave Josh an Apache name which translated into \"Friend with big horse\".\n\n\"I've learned your language,\" Running Wolf said smiling at Josh's surprise. As he talked he made sign language along with his words. \"I see you still have the big horse.\"\n\nJosh smiled and patted Diablo. \"It has been a long time Running Wolf; it's good to see an old friend. But why is your band this far north?\"\n\n\"The white eyes have broken another treaty and the young men are talking of war. There is a Lakota Sioux called Crazy Horse in your tongue that is saying he's had a vision of a white buffalo. He says it means that we will drive the white eyes away. I think he's been smoking too much of the sacred tobacco and drinking too much of the white man's firewater.\" Running Wolf snorted showing his displeasure of Crazy Horse.\n\nAs they were talking, Red had walked forward to join them. He stopped at Josh's side and said, \"Thought you could use some help with the sign language.\"\n\nJosh turned his head to hide his smile; Red was gonna be surprised.\n\nRed made sign and said, \"It's been a long time since we met Running Wolf. Do you remember me from the meeting at the wagon train?\"\n\nRunning Wolf looked at Red for a few seconds and replied in English, \"Yes I remember the color of your scalp.\"\n\nJosh and Running Wolf laughed at the look on Red's face. \"I'll be, you speak English,\" Red remarked.\n\nThe Apache nodded and said, \"We are traveling to the north. There are fewer whites there and I want to be as far away from them as I can.\" Running Wolf stopped for a moment staring off into the distance. \"Crazy Horse is wrong. We cannot defeat the white eyes; there are too many, they are like the leaves on the trees.\"\n\nJosh didn't know what to say to his old friend. He thought for a few seconds. \"How did you know I was here?\"\n\n\"I heard stories of a tall dark haired man that carried a coup stick with many feathers,\" Running Wolf replied. \"It was said he had a man with hair like the sun with him. Our trail led us passed your lodge so I thought I would see if that dark haired man was my brother.\"\n\nJosh turned back toward the lake and motioned for Danni to join them. Pointing to the children he indicated that she should bring them too. She walked over leading William and Maggie.\n\n\"This is my wife Danni and our children William and Maggie,\" Josh told his friend. \"Danni this is Running Wolf, chief of the Jicarilla Apache. He's the one that.......\"\n\n\"Gave you the coup stick, I figured,\" Danni interrupted. She made hand signs to Running Wolf as she spoke. \"It is an honor to meet the chief of the Jicarilla and a pleasure to meet an old friend of my husbands.\"\n\nRunning Wolf smiled and nodded at Danni. \"My brother has chosen well; you are a good partner for him. Turning to the children he added, \"You've given him a fine son to carry on his name and a daughter as pretty as the first days of spring.\"\n\nLittle William was wide eyed with wonder. He had seen a few Indians in Fountain when they came into town for trade goods, but they were considered \"tame\" Indians. Many dressed just like the townspeople. This was a real live \"wild\" Indian. William knew it wasn't polite to stare but he couldn't help himself.\n\nThis man was an Apache chief. He wore buckskin leggings with a loin cloth and no shirt. His chest and arms had designs painted on them and his hair was long, with an eagle feather in it. William was fascinated with Running Wolf. When William noticed that the Indian was watching him, he blushed and hung his head.\n\nKneeling down Running Wolf faced William and said, \"You are alert and watch the things new to you. It is a good thing.\" Drawing his knife he looked at Josh; Josh smiled and nodded at Running Wolf. Danni started to step forward but Josh put his arm around her and shook his head. She relaxed, leaning against her husband.\n\nRunning Wolf took Williams right hand and pricked his thumb; then he did the same to his own thumb. As blood seeped out of the small cuts he pressed their two thumbs together. He had done the same thing with Josh years ago.\n\n\"You are now blood brother to Running Wolf. You are part of the Jicarilla. I name you \"Lichii Sitiliden\", it means Red Coyote,\" he told William. He took the eagle feather from his hair and tied it in William's mop of reddish blond hair. Reaching into the pouch at his waist he handed the boy a carved wooden totem.\n\n\"When you get your first horse Red Coyote, weave this totem into its mane. The totem will protect your horse and you,\" Running Wolf instructed. Standing he walked to Josh and Danni. He handed another totem to Danni. \"Tie this charm into your buckskin's mane. It too will protect you.\"\n\nWilliam still wide eyed ran to his father, showing him the eagle feather and the totem. \"Pa, I'm an Apache now, just like you.\" Josh nodded and let William show him his new treasurers. \"When can I have my own horse Pa?\"\n\nRed looked behind Running Wolf and asked, \"Where are your people?\" \n\n\"They are camped beyond that hill.\"\n\nDanni hesitated and then said, \"That area has little water. Move your camp here to the lake; you won't have to have a dry camp.\"\n\n\"There may be soldiers following us soon. I do not want you to put you in danger,\" the chief said.\n\n\"I don't rightly care about a bunch of Yankee soldiers,\" Red said with a little anger in his voice. \"This is our land and we'll help who we want.\"\n\nJosh patted Red on the shoulder and smiled. \"Take it easy Red. They're not even here yet and you're ready to fight the war all over again.\"\n\nRed calmed down a little but added, \"Never liked them Yankees trying to tell folks how to live and what to do back then and I don't care for it now either.\"\n\n\"You are our guest Running Wolf,\" Danni said. \"But more importantly you are blood brother to my husband and my son; that makes you family. And I won't be told how to treat a guest in our home.\" \n\nRunning Wolf was impressed with Danni. Turning to Josh he said, \"I was right, you have chosen a good woman to help you as you go through life.\"\n\nDillon had relaxed when Josh motioned Danni to join him. He wouldn't put his wife and kids in danger, he thought. Dillon walked over and joined Elizabeth and Sarah. Jerry and the two hands walked over to the rock outcropping.\n\n\"You must be Mr. Gallagher,\" Jerry said. \"I'm Jerry Barnes. Got a couple of horses for you to look at when you've a mind to.\"\n\n\"Please to meet you Jerry. Call me Dillon and this is my wife Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"When would you like to see them Dillon?\"\n\n\"We have to go back to Fountain this afternoon to meet the rest of the family. Maybe we could come back the day after tomorrow,\" Dillon answered.\n\n\"I'll bring the horse over to the ranch tomorrow and leave them for a few days. That way you won't have to rush out here to see them,\" Jerry suggested.\n\nJosh rode with Running Wolf to lead his people to the new camp site at the lake; the band consisted of about 35 men, women, and children. The rest of the picnic crowd headed back to the ranch house; Jerry and his workers returned to the dam. Dillon and Elizabeth changed into dry clothes and began their return trip to Fountain to meet Eleanor and the family. They promised to return with the whole family in two days.\n\n\"We got horses to look at,\" Dillon said. \"And I want a closer look at the Anderson place.\"\n\nDillon and Elizabeth returned to Fountain, arriving just past midday. They arranged for rooms at the boarding house and then went to the livery to wait for the family; they had agreed to meet there. Shortly after 2 PM Eleanor, Ethan and Oso arrived in a buckboard. I was right about Oso not finding a horse, Dillon thought.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you,\" Eleanor greeted Dillon and Elizabeth with a hug and a kiss. \"But was it necessary to come all this way to get a couple of horses?\"\n\n\"Yes em it is if you want to get the best,\" Dillon replied. \"Besides I may have found us a ranch. I want to show it to you tomorrow or the next day and see what you think.\"\n\nDillon explained Josh's idea about homesteading the land adjoining the ranch. \"We'd end up with about a thousand acres for just the cost of Anderson's 400.\"\n\n\"So you think we ought to buy this place?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily but I think we ought to look at it. I was only there for an hour or so but from what I saw it could be a good place to live,\" Dillon answered.\n\nEleanor saw the eagerness on Dillon's face and said, \"Well I guess we better take a look at this place.\"\n\nLater, after supper, Dillon and Oso were sitting on the front porch of the boarding house with a cigar and coffee. \"Guess I was right about y'all coming in a wagon. Couldn't you find horses?\"\n\nOso chuckled. \"We could have gotten horses for Eleanor and Ethan but they didn't have anything that could carry all this,\" he said pointing to his body. Oso was 6' 6 and weighed in at close to 300 pounds. \n\n\"Why didn't you bring your horse from the Triple E with us?\"\n\n\"I should have but he was gettin on in years. Cassidy's range boss, House, said he would take care of the animal for me. If I'd knowed how hard it was to replace him, I would've brought him.\"\n\nDillon smiled at the big man. \"Don't worry Oso, we'll find something for you to ride. Even if we have to capture and train a buffalo.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth said you two had a little excitement the other day. Something about a gun fight,\" Oso said.\n\n\"Women never can keep quiet about things, can they?\" Dillon asked with a small grin. \"I didn't want to say anything to worry or alarm Eleanor.\"\n\nDillon told Oso about the run in with Stillwell and his men. \"If nothing else we got rid of some varmints. It got me a good deal on a couple of fine horses too,\" Dillon finished the story.\n\n\"It's that damn Winterborn legend all over again,\" Oso replied with his own grim smile.\n\n********************\n\nThe next morning well before first light, Josh rode to Running Wolf's camp. They were going elk hunting; the camp needed fresh meat. The tribe had been traveling light and fast trying to stay ahead of any soldiers following them.\n\nLeading two pack horses they rode to the spot Josh had picked out. \"We will try for two elk,\" Running Wolf told Josh. \"One will feed the families now and we'll smoke and dry the other one for the trip north.\"",
        "They left the horses in a ravine and quietly walked to a spot near a game trail. Just after sun up, Josh nudged Running Wolf and pointed out the small herd of elk that was grazing in a clearing on the far side of the trail. Running Wolf pointed to two of the young bulls on the edge of the herd.\n\nJosh nodded and brought his rifle to his shoulder. As the two bulls stepped completely into the clearing, both men fired. One of the young bull elk stood still for a second, took one step, and collapsed to the ground. The other one dropped immediately. The rest of the herd ran into the aspens and disappeared from sight; Josh could hear them crashing through the brush and trees as they ran.\n\nThey got their horses and quickly crossed the game trail to the dead elk. They tied ropes to the rear legs of the elk and using the horses drug them to the tree line. Throwing the ropes over a couple of sturdy tree limbs the horses pulled the animals up off the ground. Running Wolf slit the throats so the animals could bleed. It was still very cool in this high meadow but the elk needed to be field dressed before the heat of their bodies could spoil the meat.\n\nRunning Wolf knelt by one of the elk. He dipped his fingers into the blood draining from the elk and made a mark on his forehead. Speaking to the elk he said, \"Thank you brother for your gift of life. Know that your gift will not be wasted. Speak well of us to Wakan Tanka, the Great \"Spirit.\" \n\nTurning, he raised his arms toward the rising sun. \"Wakan Tanka, accept our brother's spirits and let them graze on sweet clover until we join them.\" \n\nJosh watched the little ceremony, bowed his head, and said softly, \"Amen.\"\n\nThey quickly field dressed the elk; saving the hearts, livers, and kidneys. Josh cut some long straight poles and some smaller branches from some Aspens. He used the poles and branches to make a travois for each of the pack horses so they could take the elk back to Running Wolf's camp. \n\nRunning Wolf used some more branches to hold the belly cavities open so the elk would cool more quickly as well as hold the heart, liver and kidneys of each animal. They lowered the animals onto the travois, tied them down, and began the trip back to camp. As they got closer to the camp, Josh saw Red, Sarah, and Danni dismounting in front of Running Wolf's lodge. They had Red's and Josh's boys with them and were leading two pack horses.\n\nDanni and Sarah, with Red's help, were talking by sign language to some of the Indian woman while the boys were trying to talk and play with the Indian children. Red had been busy after Josh left for the hunt that morning. He put together some supplies that he thought the Indian band could use. The men of the tribe stood back watching as Red unloaded the pack animals. They knew that Red and the others were friends of Running Wolf's but it still seemed strange to have \"white eyes\" in their camp.\n\nRed was the first to notice Josh and Running Wolf returning to the camp. As he turned to watch them ride in the braves saw them also. The men quickly ran out to greet their chief; they were excited to see the two elk. The animals were unloaded and hung by their rear legs for butchering. They used the lodge poles that had made the travois to form a stand to get the elk up off the ground. With so many hands to help, the elk were quickly skinned and butchered.\n\nThe Indians began cooking one of the elk and a slow burning fire was started to smoke the other one. Some of the women began to cut the elk into strips for smoking while others used green branches from the nearby trees to build a smoke rack.\n\nRed called William over to him and handed him something wrapped in a piece of buckskin. They waited for Running Wolf to dismount and then walked over to him. They greeted the Apache in sign and Red pushed William forward and whispered, \"Just like I told you.\"\n\nWilliam held the package in front of him. The boy in a solemn voice said, \"My Pa and Uncle Red told me that you're supposed to exchange gifts after becoming blood brothers.\" Running Wolf knelt down to the boy's level. \"You gave me that wolf totem and the eagle feather; this is my gift to you.\" Looking at Red he added, \"My blood brother.\" He handed Running Wolf the buckskin wrapped package and with barely controlled anticipation said, \"Open it.\"\n\nRunning Wolf smiled at the boy and opened the buckskin wrapping. Inside was a leather sheath holding a Bowie knife. The Apache was surprised and touched by the gift.\n\n\"It's a Bowie knife just like my Pa's,\" William said. \"See it's got a leather sheath and on the front here is a honing stone to sharpen it and the handle is elk horn.\" The boy excitedly continued to explain the features of the knife. \"Do you like it Running Wolf?\"\n\nRunning Wolf pulled his knife and sheath from his waist and replaced it with William's gift. He put his hand on the boy's shoulder. \"It is a fine gift from my young blood brother. I will carry it with me until the end of my days. Thank you, Red Coyote.\"\n\nWilliam was about to bust with pride and ran to his father. He grabbed Josh around his leg. \"See Pa, just like Uncle Red told me.\"\n\nJosh picked his son up and hugged him. \"You did just fine son. I'm proud of you.\"\n\nRunning Wolf talked to one of his men for a minute and walked over to Josh. \"Lone Eagle has been on our back trail. He says that soldiers are following us; they are about two days behind us but moving slowly. I think it best that we leave early tomorrow my friend.\"\n\n\"You can stay on our land as long as you want,\" Josh replied.\n\n\"Damn right you can,\" Red remarked.\n\nShaking his head, Running Wolf said, \"It would only delay things. We will move into the high country. They will not be able to follow us there.\"\n\nJosh shook hands with Running Wolf and said, \"We will put the Jicarilla totem sign on our lodge. You are welcome to rest on our land anytime you travel through. We will see that your people are fed and sheltered.\"\n\nRunning Wolf nodded. \"Thank you my brother. May Wakan Tanka watch over you.\" He turned and joined his people.\n\nThe next morning at daybreak Josh walked out onto the porch of the ranch house. Sticking in the ground at the base of the steps was a coup stick. The stick was dyed red and had a coyote totem tied to it. Josh smiled; it was a parting gift for William. \n\nJosh looked toward the lake and the Indian camp. He said softly, \"Vaya con Dios my friends. I hope you find a safe place for your people.\" \n\n********************* \n\nDillon and his family spent one day looking around Fountain and talking to some of the residents. They learned a lot about the area from Sheriff Kennedy and Steve Mitchell the owner of the mercantile. They talked to the territorial land agent about homesteading. It was pretty much what Josh had said, although there was a filing fee that would have to be paid for each quarter section; they were told it was $1.25 an acre. \n\nThe following morning after an early breakfast they hitched up the wagon, saddled Buck and Sandy and started for the CBC. As they topped the rise at the rock bluff, Dillon called a halt. He motioned out over the valley in front of them. \n\n\"Good land for horses and cattle, Eleanor.\" She nodded in agreement. \"The Anderson's place is off to the west here, about 3 miles down that trail,\" Dillon said pointing. \"We're going to the CBC; it's about five miles east of here.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth told me about you two getting involved in a gun fight there,\" Eleanor said. \"I would have thought you'd had enough of that back in Prescott,\" she added with a smile. \"Just who are these people? This Kelly and McCall.\"\n\nDillon looked at Eleanor for a few seconds. \"Josh Kelly is the best horse trainer and breeder in the territory, according to a lot of folks. Look at Elizabeth's new horse, Sandy. That's as fine an animal as I've ever seen. And I met and rode with Red McCall's brother at First Manassas.\"\n\nHe stopped for a minute, again looking out over the valley. \"Josh and Red invited us out to their place for lunch and to look at some horses. When we got there five men had the drop on them.\" Dillon looked Eleanor in the eye and continued, \"I couldn't just sit there and let those men kill Josh and Red. I just don't have it in me.\"\n\n\"I know that Dillon,\" Eleanor replied. \"It's part of what makes you a special type of man.\"\n\nElizabeth spoke up to ease the tension, \"I was there too and I helped.\"\n\nDillon chuckled. \"You surely did Honey.\" He told Eleanor about Elizabeth's shot taking down the man that had turned to shoot Dillon. \"Anyway, it's over and done. Now we need to get some good horses and find a place to live.\"\n\nThe group continued on to the CBC. As they stopped the wagon in front of the ranch house, a parade of people came out to greet them. Josh, Danni, and their brood were the first to greet them. Right behind the Kelly's were Red, Sarah, and their boys. Eleanor, Oso, and Ethan hung back until the rowdy welcome for Dillon and Elizabeth died down.\n\nDillon helped Eleanor climb down from the wagon and Ethan jumped over the side; Oso remained seated. Dillon introduced Eleanor and Ethan to the Kelly's and the McCall's. Handshakes between the men and hugs between the women were exchanged; although Dillon was hugged by Danni and Sarah.\n\nTurning back to the wagon Dillon said, \"And this is Oso; my other brother in law.\"\n\nRed tipped his hat to Eleanor and shook hands with Ethan. As he turned toward the wagon he said, \"Climb down friend and join the party.\" He completed his turn and got his first good look at Oso. Red's eyes opened wide and his jaw almost dropped.\n\nHe shook himself, smiled, and said, \"Sarah, we may have to put another side of beef on to cook. I don't think one is gonna be enough for our friend here.\"\n\nOso climbed down and Red quickly walked over to him. Sticking out his hand he said, \"Just fooling with you Oso. Welcome to our home.\"\n\nAs everyone was saying hello to Oso, Jerry Barnes rode up to the ranch house leading a horse. He dismounted at the corral, dropping the reins of his horse and looping the lead rope of the other one over a corral post. Joining the people in front of the house he was introduced to the new comers. Like Red, Jerry was impressed with Oso's size.\n\n\"I didn't think you were coming by Jerry,\" Josh said. Pointing to the extra horse he asked \"Is that another horse you have for sale?\"\n\nJerry looked around and saw Ethan playing with a couple of dogs. Quietly so that only Josh and Dillon could hear him he said, \"I brought over those two from my Morgan the other day and then got to thinkin. That was before I knew Danni sold her Sandy to Elizabeth. Dillon and I talked a little at the lake and he talked about needing a horse for Mrs. Edwards. He also mentioned his young brother in law. I thought Rosie there might be a good horse for Ethan, so I brought her over.\"\n\nLeaning closer to Dillon, Jerry continued, \"Rosie is a mare, six years old and well trained. She's as gentle as can be.\"\n\nDillon smiled and thanked Jerry. \"Ethan's sprouted like a weed this last year and now he's almost as good on a horse as me or Elizabeth,\" he told Jerry. \"Rosie may be a better mount for Eleanor. Let's go down to the corral and take a look.\"\n\nAs they got close to the corral, Rosie nickered. Eleanor walked over to her and looked her over. She stepped close to the horse's head and stroked Rosie's forehead. \"Could I ride her?\" She asked Jerry.\n\nJerry went into the barn, brought out riding tack, and saddled Rosie. \"She's real gentle ma'am,\" Jerry said. \n\nEleanor climbed into the saddle and rode Rosie around the house place for a few minutes. She smiled at Dillon and put Rosie into a trot, taking the trail back toward Fountain. \n\nDillon smiled at Jerry and said, \"You may have just lost a horse my friend. Ethan, come here please.\"\n\nEthan joined Dillon at the corral. Dillon pointed to the two Morgan's that Jerry had brought over. \"Which of those is the better horse?\"\n\nThe fourteen year old covered his surprise that Dillon would ask his opinion about the horses. He grabbed a coiled rope from a fence post and stepped between the rails into the corral. Dillon had been spending a lot of time with Ethan; taking the boy under his wing to teach him some of the things he would need to know. Ethan roped one of the horses and tied the colt to the training post in the center of the corral. He spoke softly to the animal as he looked him over, running his hands down the horse's legs and across its chest.\n\n\"Good horse,\" he said as he released the animal. He roped the other Morgan and also tied her off to the post. He examined the filly a little more closely than the other one. Ethan released the horse and walked back to the corral fence, coiling the rope.\n\n\"What do you think Ethan?\" Jerry asked before Dillon could.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Barnes, I'd have to ride em but they both look to be fine animals. The colt has a deeper chest and longer legs. The filly has a lot of muscle in her shoulder's; means she'll be quick on her feet,\" Ethan replied. He paused for a few seconds and added, \"I don't think you could go wrong with either one. The colt will be a little stronger over a long ride but the filly will be better workin close in with cattle.\"\n\nEthan stopped; he seemed to be embarrassed. Turning to Dillon he asked, \"Is that about right Dillon?\"\n\nDillon smiled and replied, \"I think you got it right son.\" Turning to Jerry he said, \"Let's see if we do a little horse trading. I guess we've already bought Rosie; I wouldn't want to be the one to try and take that horse away from Eleanor.\"\n\nJerry saddled the filly and handed the reins to Ethan. \"Take her for a ride while Dillon and I talk business.\"\n\n\"See if you can track down your mother,\" Dillon suggested. \"I'd like to get over to the Anderson spread before lunch.\"\n\nEthan quickly jumped into the saddle and took off at a fast trot; following the same trail that Eleanor had taken Rosie. \"Be right back,\" he called over his shoulder.\n\n\"We may not see him or Eleanor before supper,\" Dillon said smiling at Ethan's back. Turning to Jerry he said \"I'd like to buy the two Morgan's and Rosie. How much are you asking?\"\n\nJerry looked at Dillon for a few seconds. \"You know my connection with Josh and Red, don't you?\" At Dillon's nod he continued. \"They took me in and made me a full partner when we left the wagon train ten years ago.\" Those two are the only family I got.\" He stopped to get control of himself and his emotions. Jerry wiped a hand across his eyes. \"Damn, I'm worse than an old woman,\" he muttered.\n\nDillon turned away a little to give Jerry a little time. When he turned back Jerry was smiling at him. \"My point is that I'm beholdin to you and Elizabeth for helping them out.\" Looking Dillon in the eye he said, \"I think a hundred dollars for the three horses is fair. We got a deal?\"\n\n\"If I can add my friendship to sweeten the pot, I think we can do business,\" Dillon replied with a smile shaking Jerry's hand. He knew that the horses were worth much more. Dillon also knew that Jerry was saying thank you with more than just words; he accepted the offer. \"What are the colt and filly's names?\"\n\n\"I've just been callin em boy and girl. Figured whoever bought them would want to name them,\" Jerry answered.\n\nEleanor and Ethan rode back to the corral. \"Dillon I'd like to buy Rosie and the filly that Ethan's riding,\" she told her son in law. She was a little surprised that Dillon and Jerry started laughing.\n\n\"Yes em, it's already done. We bought the colt too,\" Dillon informed her pointing to the horse in the corral. \"Now all we have to do is find a horse or two for Oso; or maybe an elephant.\"\n\nRed laughed with the rest of them and said, \"I hear tell Sanders over to the S Bar S has a couple of good sizes animals. We could take a ride over and see what he's got.\"\n\nDillon replied, \"I'd really like to take a look at the Anderson spread first. That okay with you Oso?\"\n\n\"I've been riding in that dang wagon this long; I guess a while longer won't make any difference,\" the big man answered.\n\n\"Well, I've seen Anderson's so I don't need to see it again,\" Red chuckled. Why don't Oso and I go see Sanders while y'all go to parley with Tom?\"\n\n\"I sorta thought Oso should have a look at what could be our new home,\" Dillon responded.\n\n\"Amigo, it doesn't matter where we are; just as long as we're together. You and the Senora find us a place to live. I'll go find a horse maybe,\" Oso replied.\n\nEthan had been listening and said, \"Ma, can I go with Oso and Red?\" \n\n\"You better ask Mr. McCall if he minds you tagging along,\" Eleanor replied.\n\n\"He'll be fine Mrs. Edwards,\" Red told her. \"Besides he needs to learn about the country round here if y'all gonna stay.\"\n\n\"Ethan,\" Dillon called the boy to him. \"While you were gallivanting all over the country side with your Ma, we bought those three horses.\" The boy looked at him with a hopeful gleam in his eye. Dillon just stared at the youngster for almost a full minute. He broke into a smile and told Ethan, \"You'd better think of a name for that filly; she belongs to you now.\"\n\n\"Yes sir. I'll take good care of her,\" Ethan responded with enthusiasm. \"I hoped you'd buy her and I've already got a name for her.\" He paused for a few seconds, smiled at Dillon and said, \"I'm gonna call her Shelley.\"\n\nAs Dillon raised his eyebrows in a question Ethan added, \"You know after that poet you're always quotin.\"\n\nDillon was a special man in many ways, but one was his love for poetry and literature. He sometimes quoted from the works of Shelley and Lord Byron, his two favorite poets. It amused his family that this one time Calvary officer, one time Deputy Marshal, and cowhand would quote passages from the poets. Ethan had taken to studying poetry too.\n\n\"I suppose you want to call the colt Lord Byron,\" Dillon said with a big grin.\n\n\"Yes sir, I thought we might.\"\n\n\"You've been paying attention haven't you?\" Dillon asked. \"Okay, Shelley and Lord Byron it is.\"\n\nDillon handed Oso several gold coins to pay for any horses he might find. Oso climbed back onto the wagon and with Red on one side and Ethan on the other they started their trip to the S Bar S. They'd been traveling for about twenty minutes with Red talking about the land, the water, and grazing in the area. \n\nThey stopped to rest the wagon team and Red looked at Oso for a bit. The big man noticed him staring and said, \"I was adopted.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Red replied.\n\nOso chuckled. \"I don't look like anyone else in the family. Everyone wonders the same thing when the Senora introduces me as her son. Senor Edwards found me when I was ten, burying my parents after an Apache raid. He took me home with him; that was better than twenty five years ago.\"\n\n\"Actually I was wondering how big a horse you're gonna need,\" Red answered. \n\nBoth Ethan and Oso laughed at Red's statement and they continued toward the S Bar S. As they rode up to the ranch house, Bill Sanders the owner of the S Bar S came out on the porch to greet them.\n\n\"Howdy Red. Get down and sit a spell,\" Sanders offered.\n\n\"How do Bill,\" Red replied as he got down. \"Like you to meet some friends of mine. The youngster is Ethan Edwards; the one in the wagon is Oso.\"\n\n\"Any friends of Red are friends of mine; step down boys and get comfortable.\" Oso and Ethan climbed down and stepped onto the porch with Red. Sanders shook hands with Oso and Ethan. Red explained about Dillon and the Edwards family including Dillon's help with Stillwell and his friends. Turning back toward the house the men saw Nancy Larson, Sanders sister, come out to join them carrying a tray with a coffee pot, cups, and some cookies.\n\n\"Hello Red,\" Mrs. Larson said. \"Thought you might like some of my cookies. You never seem to get enough of them.\" \n\n\"No ma'am, can't say as I do. Those are the best cookies in four counties,\" Red replied stuffing a cookie into his mouth. He spoke around a mouthful of cookie, \"Better try some of these boys, before I eat them all.\"",
        "\"Don't talk with your mouthful Red,\" Nancy told him. Turning to Oso and Ethan she offered them the plate of cookies. \"How's Sarah and the boys Red? And Josh and his family?\"\n\nRed swallowed, took a sip of coffee and said, \"Everyone's just fine Mrs. Larson. Josh took Dillon and his family over to look at the Anderson spread.\" He smiled as he grabbed another cookie. \"We might just have some new neighbors if they can get together with Tom and Julie on a price.\"\n\nBill Sanders said, \"It'd be nice to see that place be a working ranch again. I know Tom's heart hasn't been in it since his boy was killed.\"\n\n\"Guess you'll be headed back to Fountain in a couple of months when school starts, Mrs. Larson.\" Red explained to Oso and Ethan that Nancy Larson had taken over the teaching job when Sarah and he got married.\n\n\"Not really looking forward to another year of it,\" Nancy replied. \"It's been eight years now and I told them last year to find another teacher but they haven't had any luck. I agreed to teach one last year; but this is the last one. I want to travel a little and spend some time out here on the ranch too.\"\n\n\"My Ma was a teacher,\" Ethan said. \"She says she wants to be one again; she don't much care for ranchin.\"\n\n\"What brings you boys to my place?\" Sanders asked. \"I'm glad to see you Red but I know you didn't ride all the way over here just to get some of Nancy's cookies.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure about that Bill. They'd be worth the ride all by themselves.\" Red chuckled in response. \"Came to see you about those two big horses you got that's eating you out of house and home. Need a couple of mounts for my little friend here,\" he said nodding toward Oso.\n\n\"Let's head down to the lower corral; I keep those two there.\"\n\nOn the way to the corral Sanders explained that his sister had adopted a draft horse from the freight company. The animal was going to be put down because of its age. Somehow the big horse had got into the paddock where the mares in season were kept. \n\n\"These two here are the result,\" Sanders said pointing to the horses in the corral.\n\nOne of the horses was a bay in color and the other was buckskin. Even though they had different dames the two colts were similar in size. They didn't look heavy and massive like their sire but both were very large animals. The bay was seventeen hands at the shoulder and the buckskin was about a tad shorter. Their legs were long and very muscular.\n\nAs the men walked up to the corral both horses came over to greet them. \"They're nothing but a couple of pets now; everybody feeds and spoils them,\" Sanders said with a small grin. \"I'd be happy to make you a good deal on them Oso.\"\n\nOso went into the corral and looked over the horses, running his hands over their chest and legs. \"Fine animals Mr. Sanders. They're strong and spirited. Why would you want to get rid of them?\"\n\n\"They're good animals but a mite too slow of foot to make good cow ponies,\" Sanders answered. \n\nRed stood back as Oso and Sanders began horse trading. Ethan watched as the two men went back and forth until a deal was made. Sanders threw in a saddle and tack. Oso paid him, tied the horses off to the rear of the wagon and they started back to Red's ranch.\n\n*****************\n\nJosh and Dillon rode in the lead toward Anderson's ranch with Elizabeth and Eleanor following. They rode through white oak and pines trees; the streams they crossed were lined with cottonwoods. \"Lots of good timber here and up on those mountains,\" Josh said. \"Be easy to cut enough for those cabins you'll need on the homesteads.\"\n\nDillon nodded. \"There's plenty to help enlarge the ranch house too.\"\n\nAs they came into the clearing in front of the ranch house, Tom and Julie Anderson came out to greet them. \"Thought you might be back young feller,\" Tom said. \"Y'all get down and stretch a bit.\"\n\nDillon introduced Elizabeth and Eleanor to the Andersons. \"Thought we might take a look around, if it's alright with you Mr. Anderson.\"\n\n\"Tom's good enough Dillon. I'll saddle up and ride with you and point out the property lines and such.\"\n\nEleanor and Elizabeth stayed at the ranch house with Mrs. Anderson. \"The men know more about ranching and ranch land than I do,\" Eleanor said. \"I'd rather talk to you Julie about your day to day life out here.\"\n\nDillon, Josh, and Tom Anderson rode along the borders of the ranch. Tom pointed out the survey markers on each corner of his land. When they got to the cut or pass through the mountains, the three rode up to the crest and looked down into the next valley.\n\n\"There's just over 300 acres in the original parcel and we homestead that quarter section in '63,\" Anderson said pointing to the land leading up to the pass. \"Own right up to the crest of this cut here. It's the only way through these mountain for better than 20 miles in any direction.\"\n\nDillon glanced at Josh, now understanding his idea of homesteading on the far side of the mountains west of the spread. He motioned to the other two and rode down into the far valley for a closer look. They rode around the land for about an hour taking note of the grassy plains, timber and stream before they headed back over the pass.\n\n\"I think your idea's a good one Josh,\" Dillon said. \"We could homestead a full section over there; that'd give us better than a thousand acres, just like you said.\"\n\nTurning to Anderson he asked, \"Why didn't you claim the land in that next valley Tom?\"\n\n\"Too much work for me,\" he replied with a smile. \"I worked for 20 years for the railroad back in Pennsylvania and retired. My Julie was very frugal, hell she was tighter with a dollar than anyone I even met. She saved most of my wages and added hers to the stake. So we lived pretty good all these years without havin to work our tails off.\"\n\nAnderson stopped for a minute, hanging his head. \"We'd just started to think about turning the place into a real cattle ranch to leave our son when he was killed on that damn cattle drive. After that we didn't much care to stay here.\" He lifted his head and smiled. \"Gonna go to California and live by the ocean.\"\n\nThe men returned to the ranch house and dismounted. Elizabeth and Eleanor came out to meet Dillon and Josh. They stepped off the porch and joined Dillon as he walked around the clearing. He told the ladies about the ranch and the plans to expand it. Elizabeth and Eleanor could tell by the excitement in his voice and the gleam in his eyes that he wanted to buy the Anderson spread.\n\n\"It's not that far into town,\" Eleanor offered. \"We could get our shopping done and back home in one day easy.\"\n\n\"What do you think Elizabeth?\" Dillon asked his wife.\n\nSmiling Elizabeth replied, \"I told you before, whither thou goest, I will go; whither thou lodgest, I will lodge.\" Then she giggled. \"I think it would be a fine place to live, Honey.\"\n\nDillon chuckled and said, \"Now you're going make quotes at me too? Guess I started something didn't I?\" He paused and asked, \"Well ladies should we make Mr. Anderson an offer on the ranch or should we keep looking?\"\n\nFirst Eleanor nodded and then Elizabeth did also. \"Remember what you told young Cassidy, Dillon,\" Eleanor said. At his puzzled look she continued, \"You told him not to try and horse trade with me; just give me his best offer. I think the same thing applies here. Ask Mr. Anderson what he wants and if it's reasonable give it to him.\"\n\nDillon agreed with her and the three of them walked back to the house. Stepping onto the porch Dillon said, \"What do you want for the place Tom?\"\n\n\"Well I reckon we could let it go for three thousand dollars,\" he answered. \"I'm not trying to get rich here but I think the place is worth that much; maybe more. But we'd don't want to sit around waitin on a buyer with deep pockets. We'd like to head for California before the winter sets in.\"\n\nDillon thought for a minute. \"I'd like to talk it over with my partners here,\" he said pointing to Elizabeth and Eleanor with a grin. \"We'll discuss it tonight and get back to you in the morning. Is that agreeable?\"\n\n\"That'll be fine Dillon. See you tomorrow morning; come early for breakfast if you've a mind too.\"\n\nJosh, Dillon and the ladies mounted and rode back to Josh's place. When they got back to the ranch, Danni and Sarah insisted that they stay the night. After supper Josh, Dillon, and Eleanor sat on the front porch talking about the Anderson ranch. Oso joined them, listening to the description of the land. Ethan stayed inside playing big brother to the children and keeping them out from under foot as the women cleaned up after supper.\n\n\"Three thousand might sound a bit steep Dillon,\" Josh said. \"There's a lot of open prairie around here; just there for the takin. Problem is that most of it is almost high chaparral.\" Noticing Eleanor's puzzled looked he added, \"It's almost desert; there's not much water. Hard place to raise cattle or horses.\"\n\nDillon nodded; he'd seen plenty of high chaparral in Texas and in his travels to Arizona. Josh continued, \"I think Tom's place is worth the askin price; what with the good water and timber on the property. If you look at homesteading like we talked about you'd be getting over a thousand acres for that price. Course you have to add the filing fees for the homestead but it's still a lot of good land at a good price.\"\n\nRed came out to join them. \"Sarah just plumb run me out of the kitchen. Said I was just getting in the way.\"\n\n\"How about you Red? What do you think?\" Josh asked his partner.\n\nRed paused before he answered. \"If we were lookin to add to the CBC, I'd buy the place myself. The place can be made into a fine ranch Dillon. Course you might want to dicker with that old horse thief Tom a bit.\"\n\nElizabeth, Danni, and Sarah joined the group on the porch; each of them standing next to their own husband. Dillon hugged Elizabeth, nodded at Eleanor and said, \"Let's get up early and join the Andersons for breakfast; I think we've got some business to discuss with them.\"\n\nTo be continued"
