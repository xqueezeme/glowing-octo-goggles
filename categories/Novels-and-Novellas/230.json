        "Chapter 1: Seen at the Play.\n\nIt was at the school Christmas play I first saw her. Quite what it was that drew my attention to her wasn\u2019t clear. She was attractive but no more attractive than a lot of other young mothers present that evening. \n\nShe was on the other side of the school drama room from where I was sitting, and I tried to define what it was that made me keep glancing across at her. There was a remoteness, an austere quality combined with an aura of sadness about her. I felt that any attempt to speak to her might meet with a rebuff.\n\nGina Wallace was sitting next to me and I turned to her and asked, \u201cWho is that woman sitting over there in the red dress?\u201d\n\nGina looked at me quizzically for a moment, and then grinned. \u201cFancy her do you, Derek? I wouldn\u2019t go near her if I were you. Don\u2019t you recognise her, that\u2019s Aine Thorogood; her picture was in all the papers three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nThe name was familiar but I still could not put it in context. \n\nI gave Gina a questioning look and she went on; \u201cYou know, she killed her husband with a kitchen knife. At her trial it was said he was a sadomasochist. Led her a hell of a life so they say. Must have got too much for her so she grabbed the knife and stuck it into him. In the end she got off with manslaughter and received a fairly light sentence. She got out about a month ago after serving a couple of years. Good behaviour I suppose.\u201d\n\nI looked across at Aine Thorogood again, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to see her son, Jamie I expect. He\u2019s playing Joseph, poor little devil. When she went to jail he was only four and her in-laws took him. I\u2019m told they won\u2019t hand him back now. They are claiming she\u2019s an unfit mother and she should have been given life for murdering their dear son. That\u2019s about all I know.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d heard about Jamie because my daughter, Samantha, was playing Mary, and she had informed me she \u201cwuved\u201d (loved) Jamie because he shared his chocolate with her. I had not made the connection between Jamie and his husband killing mother.\n\nSamantha, or \u201cSam\u201d as she is generally known, might also be described as a \u201cpoor little devil.\u201d Four months before the night of the play Gloria, my wife, had walked out on us. She gave as her reason that she \u201cneeded her own space.\u201d Her \u201cown space\u201d proved to be a senior executive in the company she worked for. \n\nOne of her colleagues who sympathised with my position told me that the executive had suggested he could advance Gloria\u2019s career if she would, as my informant put it, \u201cCome across.\u201d She duly came across, leaving me to cope with Sam. \n\nNot that Sam was a great burden. She\u2019s a sweet child and much beloved were I am concerned. When Gloria departed the situation remained much the same as it had been from quite soon after her birth,  in the sense that little Sam had spent most of her time being looked after by my mother and father, while Gloria and I went to work during the day.\n\nThe man that Gloria was now living with had left a wife and three children, but at least she had been a full time mother. I sometimes wondered how she was coping.\n\nSince departing neither Sam nor I had seen anything of Gloria. \u201cSo much for a devoted mother,\u201d I often thought, but then, Gloria had not really wanted Sam in the first place. She had been more concerned with her career than child rearing. I suppose I was the one to blame in that I had wanted us to have a child. So, now I had a child, and was trying to be both father and mother to her.\n\nI was still looking across at Aine when she glanced at me. For a few seconds I was riveted by two large dark eyes. From where I was sitting they gave the impression of being black and conveyed a deep sadness. I looked away as Gina nudged me in the ribs and hissed, \u201cIt\u2019s starting.\u201d\n\nThe lights came up on the little stage, and we began to wade our way through a group of five and six year olds presenting their teacher\u2019s version of the Christmas story. There was much prompting and pushing onto the stage. \n\nThe baby Jesus, a doll, got entangled in Joseph\u2019s robe, shepherds dropped crooks and one of the wise men announced he had brought his gift of \u201cFrank\u2019s sense,\u201d and another that he had brought \u201cMa.\u201d The bringer of gold got it right. At the end we parents clapped heartily as our exultant offspring bowed to us.\n\nAs is common on such occasions, the school Principal made a very long and boring speech, praising the children, the teacher, the school and herself, all this while the miniature thespians were still on the stage. \n\nThen it was refreshment time and cuddles for Sam as I told her, \u201cYou were wonderful, darling.\u201d Then I had to meet Jamie, her stage husband, because \u201cI wuv him daddy.\u201d\n\nJamie proved to be a surprisingly mature six year old who shook hands solemnly with me and said, \u201cNice to meet you, Mr.Sam.\u201d Actually it\u2019s \u201cMack,\u201d but clearly Sam was the dominant name for him. The boy had the same large, dark eyes as his mother, and the hint of sadness.\n\nWhile Sam and Jamie plastered their faces with sponge cake, I looked around for Jamie\u2019s mother, but she was nowhere in sight. Eventually a woman approached and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go now, Jamie.\u201d She turned out to be the mother of an angel whose wings had wilted during the performance. She had made herself responsible for bringing Jamie and taking him home. She informed me that his grandparents would be coming to see the second performance the following night.\n\nSo, while she basked in her fame, I drove a sleepy Sam home as she leaned against me in the car smearing residual sponge cake down the arm of my coat.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Jamie nice, daddy?\u201d She sighed rapturously as I put her to bed. \u201cVery nice, darling, I can see why you \u2018wuv\u2019 him.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she sighed again, as she slipped into the exhausted sleep of a stage star, leaving me to meditate on the innocence of children and the purity of their love.\n\n\nChapter 2: On my Mind.\n\nNext day I found the image of Aine Thorogood popping into my mind. I was puzzled why this was so. Since there had been no sexual contact with a woman since Gloria left, and very little for some months before she did leave, my interest might have been put down as sexual attraction. Yet as I have already pointed out, she was no more physically attractive than a lot of other women present at the play, and I knew for certain that one or two of those were willing to satisfy my sexual needs if I had wished.\n\nAs a loyal supporter of my actress daughter, I attended the second night of the play. The children, having drawn confidence from the success of their previous performance, now flung themselves into the action with hilarious abandonment. Disaster followed disaster, all of which they carried off with grins at the audience and great aplomb.\n\nI looked around for Aine, but she was not there. After the play and an even longer and more boring speech by the Principal, there was another cake fest. During this I saw Jamie with a couple who looked about sixty years of age. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Jamie\u2019s grandma and grandpa,\u201d whispered Sam in my ear, \u201cThey won\u2019t let him play with anyone.\u201d\n\nSam might have been exaggerating, but I noted that the couple kept Jamie very close to them, and they seemed to speak to no one else.\n\nOnce more I took my little cake encrusted starlet home to be informed again at bedtime that she \u201cWuved\u201d Jamie, and added, \u201dI wuv you too, daddy.\u201d Then she said, \u201cJamie hasn\u2019t got a daddy,\u201d and went to sleep.\n\n\u201cYes, my darling,\u201d I thought, \u201cand you barely have a mummy.\u201d I choked down the emotion that threatened to bring tears, and gave myself a glass of whisky.\n\nDuring the days that followed the play Aine Thorogood continued to occupy my mind. I went so far as to go to the public library and look up her story in back numbers of the newspapers. \n\nIn so far as the media can be believed, Gina\u2019s information was about correct. The original charge against Aine had been murder, but somehow this got changed to manslaughter. \n\nHer husband, it seemed, had been an up to the minute Marquis de Sade. The witnesses for the prosecution testified to what a lovely little boy he had been, and such a virtuous teenager, never the less he ended up a depraved monster. The testimony of Aine\u2019s doctor told of the physical and emotional damage he had done to her over the five years of their marriage.\n\nThe jury found her guilty on the manslaughter charge and added a recommendation for leniency. Even though Gina had said the sentence was lenient, I thought the judge acted rather harshly considering the circumstances, giving her three years imprisonment. She served two years and was then released.\n\nPhotographs of her showed the frightened face of a bewildered woman, those large dark eyes of hers filled with apprehension. I know people say, \u201cThe law is the law,\u201d but I wondered what earthly good it was putting an ill used and frightened woman into prison. More to the point would have been some loving care. The question that arose I suppose was, who would want to love a husband killer?\n\nThere was little about her son Jamie. For once the media had the decency not to try and get its readers wallowing in that combination of self-righteousness and useless sentimentality so dear to them. There was in one newspaper a brief mention that the child would be put in the care of his paternal grandparents.\n\nA further and indignant note in one newspaper announced that Aine had refused a large sum of money to tell her life story. \u201cAt least there\u2019s someone left in this world with some wholesomeness.\u201d I thought. \u201cPerhaps not everyone can be bought with money.\u201d Then cynically I thought further, \u201cI wonder what would buy her?\u201d then I felt ashamed of my scepticism. \n\nMy only excuse for my cynicism is the bitterness I felt over Gloria who, to distort a quote from the bible, had exchanged Sam and I for a \u201cmess of pottage.\u201d Perhaps I deserved the treatment Gloria had dished out, but not little Sam.\n\nIt may have been foolish, but at first I had told Sam that \u201cMummy has gone away for a while because of her work.\u201d Ironically this was not altogether untrue. But Sam is a bright enough little girl, and after around three weeks of Gloria\u2019s absence she said to me, \u201cMummy doesn\u2019t want us any more, does she daddy?\u201d\n\nSam looked at me dry eyed, while I tried to fight back tears and attempt to justify her mother\u2019s absence. When I finished Sam, still staring at me solemn eyed, asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave me, are you daddy?\u201d\n\nI think it would be hard to find something more heart wrenching than that for a father, and hugging her to me, I assured her that I would never leave her. She sat on my lap, pressed against me for a long time, saying nothing. Then as if the matter had never been raised she got off my lap and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find teddy,\u201d and went off on her search.\n\nWhen next day I had dropped Sam off at my parent\u2019s house, I told my mother what Sam had said and how she seemed to close the door on the matter, she said, \u201cDerek, she hasn\u2019t closed the door, she\u2019s just buried her pain. You must be very careful with her.\u201d She then added, \u201cAnd with yourself, darling.\u201d\n\nI work as an engineering draughtsman and I would have willing given up my job to look after Sam, but I had to have money for us to live on. Had it not been for my parents, my plight would have been very difficult indeed.\n\n\nChapter 4: An Agnostic Prays.\n\nThe play had taken place at the end of the school year so it was Christmas vacation for Sam. She was now in my parent\u2019s care more than ever as I had to leave her to go to work. Aine Thorogood gradually faded from my mind. I had not anticipated seeing her again, so when I did see her, and the place in which I saw her, it was, to say the least, a surprise.\n\nOn Christmas Eve my parents always had a gathering of family and friends. It was a cheerful but reasonably quiet occasion, and was concluded by our attendance at the local church for a midnight service of Carols and Nine Lessons.\n\nI was something of an agnostic at the time, and went along to the service partly for my parent\u2019s sake, and partly because the service is quite beautiful and well done. Sam by special dispensation was allowed to stay up late and come with us.\n\nArriving at the service a few minutes before it was due to start I was idly looking around the congregation when I saw Aine enter the church. As she walked down the aisle seeking a seat, she spotted Sam and stopped by our pew. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the little girl who played Mary in the school play, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Sam, no doubt wondering who the lady was.\n\nAine seemed to hesitate for a moment as if wondering if to say more, then went on, \u201cI\u2019m Jamie\u2019s mother. Can I sit with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Sam with some enthusiasm, no doubt delighted to be in the presence of her beloved Jamie\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cIs Jamie coming too?\u201d Sam asked.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s gone to bed,\u201d Aine replied.\n\nSam sighed her disappointment and taking Sam\u2019s hand I said to Aine, \u201cI\u2019m Sam\u2019s father\u2026er\u2026Samantha that is\u2026 Derek Mack.\u201d\n\nAine paused again, and then said, \u201cYes, I know. I saw you at the play.\u201d\n\nAt that moment the organist gave forth with the opening bars of \u201cOnce in Royal David\u2019s City.\u201d The priest, readers and choir entered singing and there was no further talk.\n\nThe service begun, I entered into a sort of reverie, contemplating the woman sitting so close to me. A man killer with dark, sad eyes, a mother without her child, and my mind turning to Sam, a child without a mother. \n\nI was jolted back to consciousness of my surroundings. The opening of the service completed, a reader was reading the ancient myth of Adam and Eve, those two of whom it is alleged they brought sin into our world.\n\nWhat sin? What was the deed done or not done by those two and their tempter the snake? Disobedience? Sex? Murder? Consciousness of being naked? What was that fruit and tree? I had long thought of this story as pure nonsense, but tonight it struck home anew, as if I had never heard it before and it was coming to me afresh.\n\nWhat was that sin? It was irresponsibility, yes the petty carelessness of everyday, the betrayals and the denial of our accountability. The man betrays the woman: \u201cThe woman who you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.\u201d The woman betrays the snake: \u201cThe serpent beguiled me, and I ate.\u201d Generation after generation, always the same: \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault, he, she, it, made me do it.\u201d\n\nYes, the petty betrayals of everyday life, the lies and deceits that carry within them the violence that bursts out with devastating and murderous force when finally we can no longer bear the burden of what we are and what has been done to us.\n\nThe service had moved on into calmer waters as the readers read the ancient promises of a final salvation from our human mire.\n\nThe choir and congregation rose to sing the children\u2019s hymn, \u201cAway in a Manger.\u201d Aine had not risen and the hymn begun, I glanced across at her. Sam had fallen asleep lying across Aine\u2019s lap. \u201cMy God, I thought, mother and child.\u201d \n\nAine sat still as a statue and I was distressed to see tears running down her cheeks. What was she seeing in her stillness? What pain was tormenting her? Was it the hymn reminding her of the time she gave birth? The absence of her son, or a little girl, not \u201casleep in the hay,\u201d but on her lap?\n\nI looked at her profile through my own emerging tears. In her sorrow I saw a beauty I had not observed before. Her mouth shut tightly against the sounds of her weeping \u2013 a mouth that in its fullness promised laughter and love. Her slightly aquiline nose and above it a broad forehead surmounted by luxuriant auburn hair. Above all those eyes, not black as they had seemed at a distance, but dark brown and now swimming with tears.\n\nI looked away, unable to bear the sight of her grief and strangely, the sight of Sam cuddled against her. It was all so agonisingly poignant. I was so choked that I was no longer singing, but at the line, \u201cstay by my side until morning is nigh,\u201d I found myself whispering, \u201cstay by her side until morning is nigh.\u201d The agnostic offering his prayer for a woman he did not know, but who was in her grief holding his child.\n\nWhen the hymn ended the priest called the congregation to prayer. It was a prayer that caught up the needs of people, their sorrows and pains. Again I found myself praying to the doubted God, \u201cGive her love and comfort for she has born much.\u201d\n\nDuring the next hymn Aine still sat with Sam in her lap and I could see she was struggling to find her handkerchief as she tried not to disturb the child. I got my own unused handkerchief out and passed it to her. She looked up and gave me a wan smile of thanks.\n\nThe remainder of the service passed in a blur until at last the organ roared out, \u201cO Come all ye Faithful.\u201d The choir and readers processed out of the church and the priest stood alone to pronounce the benediction. The organ was hurled into a Bach fugue and the congregation began to leave, calling out to each other, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe three of us sat for a while until most of the congregation had left the church, and then I extended my arms to take Sam. Aine carefully gave Sam to me, passed me back my handkerchief and said, \u201cThank you,\u201d rose and walked out of the church.\n\nI didn\u2019t want her leave like that, alone and desolate. I tried to catch up with her but encumbered by the still sleeping Sam, I lost sight of her.\n\nMy parents were standing chatting with a little group of people, but when my mother saw me she came to me and asked, \u201cWho was that lady holding Sam?\u201d She had been sitting in the pew just behind Aine, and must have seen much of what had passed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Aine Thorogood,\u201d I told her.\n\nMother looked puzzled for a moment, just as I had on first being told the name, then realisation dawned, \u201cThat\u2019s the woman who\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s the women,\u201d I said quickly, wanting to cut her off before she said those words, \u201cKilled her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looked terribly distressed,\u201d mother said.\n\n\u201cYes, I wanted to catch up with her when she left at the end of the service, but she was too quick for me.\u201d\n\nMother stood thinking for a moment, then turned and tapped my father on the shoulder. She whispered something to him and he looked over at me and then nodded to mother.\n\n\u201cShe went that way,\u201d mother said. \u201cShe was walking, so why don\u2019t you give Sam to dad, and see if you can catch up with her. Invite her to come back to our place for a drink. No one should be on their own Christmas Eve.\u201d\n\nI mentally thanked God for my mother\u2019s compassion \u2013 what was I doing thanking God? - and took off at a trot in the direction mother had indicated. I turned the corner of the street and kept going until I reached the next junction. \n\nI looked down each street in turn and could not see her. Thinking there was no point in going further I was about to turn back when in the light of street lamp I saw a flash of white. Aine had been wearing a white linen suit!\n\nI set out at a faster pace and as I drew close I called \u201cExcuse me madam.\u201d \n\nShe stopped and turned almost warily, as if expecting something unpleasant to happen.\n\nI came up to her panting and gasped, \u201cMy mother said would like you to come and have a drink with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn, she saw how kind you were to Sam and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really would like you to,\u201d I said, I hoped persuasively. \u201cIf Sam is still awake I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to be with Jamie\u2019s mother. She says she \u2018wuvs\u2019 Jamie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am. You wouldn\u2019t want me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who you are and we do want you to. If your reason for not coming is what is past and not something else you have to do, then please come, I would like you to.\u201d \nShe stood looking at me for a few moments as if assessing my personal invitation, and then asked, \u201cI won\u2019t spoil things for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t spoil things for any of us,\u201d I replied.",
        "\u201cAll right, and thank you, it\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\n\n\nChapter 4: Getting to Know You.\n\nWe walked back in the direction of the church where my parents were still waiting, the others having gone on ahead. Sam and I had come in my parent\u2019s car, so taking Sam back from my father, Aine and I got into the back of the car.\n\nSomehow Sam had continued to sleep and once in the car Aine said, \u201cCould I hold her again?\u201d I passed Sam over to her and she drew her close to her breast. \u201cShe\u2019s thinking of Jamie,\u201d I thought.\n\nTomorrow morning there would be gifts. Sam would be laughing as she opened her parcels, and we adults would be delighted with her pleasure. Probably there would be no child for Aine to take pleasure in. I wondered about Gloria. She had sent no gift, not even a note or a card. Would she also miss the joy of a child on Christmas morning? Had Aine sent a gift to Jamie that she would not see him open?\n\nArriving at the house poor little Sam was handed over once more. I took her straight to bed and Aine, coming up behind me asked: \u201cCould I\u2026could I\u2026I won\u2019t get in the way\u2026if I\u2026\u201d\n\nI knew what she wanted, so I said, \u201cOf course. You can help me get her into her nightie.\u201d\n\nWe went to the room where Sam would be sleeping that night and I undressed the half awake half asleep little thing. Aine was holding the night dress, so I made no move to take it from her, but allowed her to put it on Sam.\n\nI said to Aine, \u201cJust wait here a minute,\u201d and I went to the room I would be using and got the small Christmas stocking to put at the foot of Sam\u2019s bed. The main gifts would be given out after breakfast in the morning.\n\nWhen I got back to Sam\u2019s room Aine was sitting on the edge of the bed softly stroking Sam\u2019s hair. As soon as she was aware of my presence she quickly withdrew her hand saying, \u201cI just wanted to touch her again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how you feel,\u201d I replied, smiling. \u201cShe has that effect on a lot of people.\u201d\n\nI placed the stocking at the foot of the bed and kissed Sam on the forehead. I saw Aine make a move as if to kiss Sam, but pulled back. I smiled again and said, \"I\u2019m sure Sam would love you to, if she was awake to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She bent and kissed the child.\n\nAs we left the room I said, \u201cBy the way, you thanked me in the church.\u201d I gave a quiet laugh. \u201cWas that because Sam had fallen asleep on your lap or because I loaned you my handkerchief?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither, although it was lovely to hold her. I thanked you because I felt you praying for me in church.\u201d\n\nThat did startle me. How on earth could she know that a near hardened agnostic verging on atheism had so far betrayed himself as to pray? I hadn\u2019t the courage to ask at that moment.\n\nThe little group of friends and relatives had gathered in the lounge and were chatting and laughing as they sipped on their drinks and ate the little sandwiches mother had made. This would be the difficult moment, I thought. How will they receive Aine?\n\nThank God for my mother \u2013 there I go again, thanking the non-being \u2013 she has a beautiful non-patronising way of drawing people in and making them feel welcome. She took over Aine and having ascertained what she would like to drink, I was sent to get it. It must have been a brandy and dry because\u2026well, more of that later.\n\nI returned with the drink plus my own whisky, and was told by mother to go away and make myself pleasant to the company because she and Aine were talking female things. In a minor way I have always been grateful that mother never used that immature phrase, \u201cGirl talk.\u201d\n\nI wandered around talking to various people until they began to make their way home. Eventually there were only my parents, Aine and myself.\n\n\u201cDerek will drive you home, Aine,\u201d mother said.\n\n\u201cOh no, I can\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t, not at this time in the morning.\u201d Then peremptorily to me, \u201cDerek!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes of course, mother.\u201d\n\nAine turned and said to mother and father, \u201cThank you for inviting me, it\u2019s been lovely.\u201d\n\nMother kissed her on the cheek and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve loved having you. Perhaps we shall see more of you in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like that if\u2026\u201d\n\nThe poor woman seemed to be for ever getting cut off before she\u2019d finished a sentence as my father shook her hand and rumbled, \u201cBeen delightful to have you, my dear.\u201d\n\nI drove Aine home and found that she lived in a rather run down part of the town. She said very little as we drove and tried to persuade me to drop her off at the corner of her street. It seemed clear that she did not want me to see where she lived.\n\nI was not having that, so she gave in and let me drive up to the house where, as I was later to discover, she rented one room. \n\nFrom first seeing her at the play I had been fascinated by Aine. The fascination initially had not been about sex or lust, or any of those usual things that are supposed to draw a man to a woman. I suppose it was an intense curiosity that had led me to read the back numbers of the newspapers. Now my feelings had become something else. Perhaps compassion best describes them.\n\nAine made to get out of the car, but I touched her arm and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk for a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pushy, Aine, but would you like to join us tomorrow morning, when Sam opens her gifts?\u201d\n\nI knew it was a dangerous question. She would have Jamie in mind and seeing another child\u2019s Christmas pleasure might be shattering for her.\n\nIt was a relief that she did not refuse outright, but asked, \u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard what my mother said. She never says what she doesn\u2019t mean just to be polite. She said she\u2019d like to see you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Derek, I should like that very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up about nine, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be ready.\u201d\n\nI drove home for some reason singing.\n\n\nChapter 5: Mother has a Talk.\n\nLate as it was mother was clearing things away when I arrived and was geared up for a talk.\n\nAfter enquiring if Aine had got home all right, she went on, \u201cI had quite a long talk with her, Derek. We did not talk about her past, it was mainly about Sam, but I could work out that she has been very, very deeply hurt by life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know. Look mother, I\u2019ve invited her here for tomorrow morning, is the okay?\u201d\n\nMother looked t me long and hard, and then said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s all right, she will be welcome, but there is one thing. I don\u2019t know what you have in mind, Derek, but be very gentle with her. I\u2019ve got the feeling that there\u2019s a lovely person inside her wanting to get out, but she\u2019s afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was very good with Sam, mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but that\u2019s because she feels that Sam is safe. Sam doesn\u2019t know about her past, and can accept Aine as she is. We do know, and it\u2019s hard to put that aside. But I tell you this, Derek, I read all the newspaper reports about her arrest and trial and listened to all the media nonsense at the time, but I can read between the lines, and what I read was that this woman has been badly hurt, hurt physically and emotionally.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been hurt yourself, not in the way Aine has been hurt, but you are vulnerable. She\u2019s an attractive woman and if you are thinking of trying to get involved, be careful with her. And if you\u2019re not thinking of getting involved, do nothing to give her the impression that you are. There\u2019s enough pain in the world without adding to it.\u201d\n\nShe rose and kissed me on the cheek and said, \u201cGood night, darling, and be careful.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood night, mother, and thank you.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and departed for her bed. It was four in the morning and I was nearly asleep standing up, so I staggered off to bed and fell into a dreamless sleep.\n\n\nChapter 6: \u201cOn Christmas Day in the Morning.\u201d\n\nI was awakened by Sam shaking me and saying, \u201cDaddy, look what Father Christmas left me.\u201d\n\nShe was holding the little Christmas stocking, her mouth already smeared with some chocolate it had contained. In addition there were the usual small things, a doll, whistle and what could have been a Dalmatian dog or a spotted cow, it was rather hard to tell.\n\nIt was one of those deeply touching moments when a child is so delighted with such little things. They have not yet learned to demand vastly expensive gifts of their distraught parents with such blackmailing phrases as, \u201cAll other girls (or boys) have got\u2026\u201d\n\nI looked at the bedside clock and saw it was eight o\u2019clock.  Giving Sam a kiss and getting a taste of her chocolate I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go and get the lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to get Jamie\u2019s mummy. She put my night dress on last night, didn\u2019t she? Can I come with you to get her, please, daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I said, but you\u2019ll have to hurry, I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d\n\nThere was a flurry of showering and breakfasting and two minutes after nine o\u2019clock we were outside Aine\u2019s house. She must have seen us arrive because before I could get to the door she came out and walked to the car.\n\nSam was jumping up and down on the seat and before Aine had a chance to get into the back of the car Sam called out, \u201cCan I sit on your lap again Mrs. Lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d I said.\n\nShe smiled and said, \u201cOf course,\u201d then lifting Sam out of the seat, she sat in the front and placed Sam on her lap.\n\nThere are situations where a male and female relationship is in the process of being formed, and where one or both adults have a child. They make an exaggerated fuss of the other\u2019s child. They are trying to convey the impression that they really would make a good substitute mother or father.\n\nThe exaggerated attention and affection usually makes it easy to pick that sort of situation, and often the affection does not extend much beyond the first entanglements of the adult pair. With Aine I got no impression that she was pretending to affection she did not really feel. She was what people call \u201cnatural\u201d with Sam. She simply listened to her chatter about what she had found in her Christmas stocking and made appropriate comments.\n\nThe thought flashed through my mind, \u201cIf only Gloria could have\u2026\u201d I put the brakes on that one, recognising the futility of \u201cIf only\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAs soon as we got back to the house, it was present time. Aine looked embarrassed and I heard her whisper to mother, \u201cI haven\u2019t got anything.\u201d\n\nMother whispered her reply, \u201cYou are here, and that\u2019s enough, my dear.\u201d\n\nI could see that Aine looked puzzled by this response, but began to visibly relax.\n\nWe all got our Christmas present from under the tree, including Sam, but her special  present from me had been hidden away. It was her first little two wheeled bicycle and on seeing it she was reduced temporarily to silence. Then she was all over me with thanks and kisses and requests to be taken out and taught to ride it. Then she suddenly paused in her exuberance and whispered to me, \u201cMrs. Lady hasn\u2019t got a present, do think Father Christmas would mind if I gave her the little dog?\u201d We had agreed that it was a dog.\n\nI whispered back, \u201cI think he would be very pleased that you are such a kind little girl.\u201d\n\nSam rushed from the room to return almost immediately with the dog wrapped in what looked like toilet paper.  She went to Aine and handing her the ragged parcel said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a present for you.\u201d\n\nAine hesitated for a moment, and then took the gift and unwrapping it exposed the dog. She stared at it for several seconds, and then holding it to her breast she gasped, \u201cThank you darling, its lovely.\u201d \n\nHer shoulders began to shake, and mother said to father, \u201cArthur, will you take Sam outside and start teaching her to ride on the garden path?\u201d\n\nFather may not be as sensitive as mother, but he took the situation in and said, \u201cOf course, my dear. Come along, Sam, let\u2019s ride.\u201d\n\nAine had been fighting back her tears, but as soon as Sam had left with father, she broke down. I think it was one of the most agonising moments in my life, to witness someone so broken, so open, releasing what must have been the pent up misery of years.\n\nThe tears streaming down her face and sobs shaking her body, she looked up at my mother and said, \u201cOh Mrs.Mack, it hurts so much, so very badly. My heart is broken.\u201d\n\nMother went to her and sitting beside her on the sofa and took her in her arms. She rocked Aine in her arms saying, \u201cCry my love, cry it all out. You can say it all because you\u2019re safe with us.\u201d\n\nOut it poured the pain and suffering of her marriage. The imprisonment and her separation from Jamie. People\u2019s rejection of her, their suspicion and whispers behind her back. Her loveless existence. \n\nThat austere, remote look I had observed on first seeing her had fallen away completely, I saw a human being in all the beauty and ugliness of raw suffering. She was one of life\u2019s little ones hiding in the comfort and protection of my mother\u2019s breast. All her strength had gone and she was utterly fragile and defenceless in the face of her own grief, and she hugged the little dog to her. \n\n\u201cA happy Christmas, Saviour of the world,\u201d I sneered silently, \u201cYou didn\u2019t save her, did you?\u201d\n\nI was shocked at what happened next. To this day I don\u2019t know if I had a moment of madness, but as clear as if someone was in the room speaking the words, I heard in my head: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t save her. You prayed for her so I knew that I could leave it up to you.\u201d\n\nAine had started to calm, and mother looked across at me to ask something and stared at me for a moment, then said, \u201cDerek, are you all right, you\u2019ve gone as white as sheet.\u201d\n\nPoor mother, she must have thought she had another lost soul on her hands, so I pulled myself together and replied, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nMother stared at me with that suspicious look mothers have when you\u2019re a child, and they have asked you if you\u2019ve opened your bowels that morning and you say \u2018yes\u2019 to escape being given a laxative.\n\nMother apparently decided to accept my declaration of all rightness and said, \u201cGet Aine a drink, Derek.\u201d\n\nI went to the drinks table and remembering Aine\u2019s drink of the previous night I poured her a brandy and dry. \n\nTaking the drink to her, I could see that Aine\u2019s body was still being shaken by intermittent sobs, and she was shivering.\n\n\u201cGo to the cupboard in the hall,\u201d mother ordered, \u201cand you\u2019ll find a woollen rug. Bring it here, would you?\u201d\n\nI did as ordered and returned to find Aine stretched out on the sofa, her head on a cushion. Mother took the rug and draped it over Aine saying, \u201cSleep now for a while, and we can talk more later.\u201d\n\nShe signalled me to leave the room, and followed me a minute later.\n\n\u201cWell, Derek, you\u2019ve seen a woman at the end of her resources. We\u2019ll let her sleep until lunchtime, and then see what\u2019s to be done. Now why don\u2019t you go and take over from your father and teach Sam how to ride her bicycle?\u201d\n\n\nChapter 7: A Cycling Interlude.\n\nAgain I did as instructed, and took Sam out to a nearby park to run up and down the path supporting her as she wobbled along on her first velocipedic adventure. \n\nBy lunch time I was exhausted but Sam was exuberantly demonstrating her new found skill of balancing on two wheels. We had achieved this with no more than a grazed knee and a breathless father, and I think both of us were ready to eat.\n\nAine did not join us for lunch, but mother took her something on a tray.\n\nSam was rather puzzled by \u201cMrs. Lady\u2019s\u201d absence, and wondered aloud if Mrs. Lady would come and see her ride in the park that afternoon. Mother told her Mrs. Lady was not feeling very well, and would need to rest, but she might be able to see Sam later.\n\nI was once more denied access to the lounge, and was told to take Sam back to the park to ride her bicycle. Thus a large part of the afternoon was spent watching Sam gain riding confidence while I sat on a park bench under a tree.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how much pleasure a parent can get from their child\u2019s delight. Watching Sam and hearing her cries of glee at her success, the afternoon passed quickly. It was not until my father came seeking me that I realised I had been sitting on the bench for nearly two hours.\n\n\u201cYour mother wants you,\u201d he said significantly,\u201dI\u2019ll stay with Sam for a bit longer.\u201d\n\nI hastened to obey the summons and was met by a thoughtful mother.\n\n\u201cDerek, I want you to drive Aine to her house and help her pack some things, and then bring her back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\n\n\u201cAine will be staying with us for a while,\u201d she replied. \u201cShe must not go back to that place to be alone, not for the next few days, anyway. We\u2019ve had a long talk, and if it\u2019s all right with Aine I\u2019ll tell you about it later. Just go and help her get her things now.\u201d\n\nI turned to head for the lounge to get Aine, and mother added, \u201cAnd Derek, she\u2019s in a very delicate state, so no careless remarks or comments. Be sensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\nChapter 8: The Lady of the House.\n\nAine looked pale and drained, and although she was not especially short, probably about five feet six or seven, she seemed diminished, smaller.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you to collect your things,\u201d I said.\n\nIn a hoarse, almost inaudible voice she said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nWe drove to her house, or rather, her room. It was dim and sparsely furnished, with a single bed, small table and a wardrobe. Aine opened a drawer at the bottom of the wardrobe and began to take out various items of underwear and put them in a suitcase. I noted how worn and tattered some of the garments were. \n\nOpening the wardrobe door she took out the linen suit she had been wearing at the church and one dress. Apart from a top coat there was nothing else in there except a large box wrapped in Christmas paper.\n\nAine packed a few other items from around the room, including a photograph of a child that I recognised as Jamie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d she said.\n\nAs we left an aggressive looking woman came out from a room near the front door and stood before us. Addressing Aine she said, \u201cYou owe me two weeks rent, when am I going to get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you as soon as I get my social welfare cheque,\u201d Aine whispered.  \n\n\u201cNot good enough,\" the woman said, \"I want me bleedin\u2019 money now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got the money,\u201d protested Aine.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019d better hang on to yer things,\u201d the woman responded belligerently, as she made a grab for the suitcase I was carrying. \u201cThought yer could sneak off with yer fancy man without payin\u2019 did yer!\u201d \n\nI held fast to the case and asked, \u201cHow much is owing?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe owes me a hundred and twenty bleedin\u2019 dollars, and she ain\u2019t pissin\u2019 off with you until she\u2019s paid up.\u201d\n\nI took out my wallet and handed the woman the money saying, \u201cThere you are, and Mrs.Thorogood won\u2019t be coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s \u2018Misses Thorogood\u2019 is it? We are coming up in the world, ain\u2019t we!\u201d\n\nIgnoring the woman I turned to Aine and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take the rest of your things now, you\u2019re not to come back here.\u201d\n\nWe returned to the room and collected what was left, which was not very much. As we left the house the woman was waiting by the front door.\n\n\u201cThink she\u2019ll make a nice screw do yer? Just wait until yer get a knife in yer ribs one of these nights.\u201d\n\nI was about to make some retort, then changed my mind. What was the use? The wretched woman was probably only trying to dump some her own pain on Aine, so why reinforce her troubled mind with a pointless comment?\n\nAine had been almost totally silent since we had left my parents\u2019 home, and she made no response to the women\u2019s abuse, in fact she hardly seemed to hear it. I hurried her to the car and we put her belongings in the back. As we clambered into the car the woman shouted out, \u201cAn\u2019 if I find you\u2019ve taken any of my things, I\u2019ll have the law on yer.\u201d\n\nAs I drove away with a bowed Aine beside me, I wondered what I was going to do with her, having decided for her that she wasn\u2019t going back to that room. Mother had implied a few days for her stay at their house, how would she respond to the idea of a longer period?\n\nChapter 8: A Sister?\n\nI needn\u2019t have worried. My mother, with her seemingly boundless compassion for Aine, simply commented, \u201cShe can stay as long as necessary, Derek. We need to bring her back into life. I\u2019m going to put her into the room Sam slept in, so I\u2019ll go and help her unpack, then let her sleep again if she want\u2019s to.\u201d",
        "\u201cIt won\u2019t take you long to do the unpacking,\u201d I said, \u201cShe\u2019s got very little and most of what she does have looks as it\u2019s fit for the rag bag, especially her underwear. Would you mind if I made a contribution and bought her a few things?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d mother said.\n\n\u201cOnly thing is, I don\u2019t know what\u2026you know\u2026how to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou men really are a useless lot,\u201d mother snorted. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll check up on her sizes while we unpack, and you and me can go out together to get the things when the shops open on Monday. Now don\u2019t go away because I want to talk to you when I\u2019ve got Aine settled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Sam,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOut in the park again with your father, on her bicycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll go and take over for a while and send dad back. He can give me a call when you want to talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\nI retired to the park and was greeted by an exuberant Sam with, \u201cLook what I can do daddy.\u201d\n\nShe had previously had to stop the bike and get off to turn the thing around. She now demonstrated her ability to turn the bicycle around while still on the move. I had to witness this feat a number of times, offering my praise and admiration.\n\nMy father returned to announce that Aine was asleep and mother was ready to talk with me. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a bit left out, dad,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll reserve her talk with me until we get into bed tonight,\u201d he grinned. \u201cBy the way, she says it\u2019s time for Sam to come in, and I\u2019ve got to supervise her shower. She really knows how to take over once she\u2019s committed, that woman of mine,\u201d he laughed.\n\nMother looked all limbered up for serious talk, but she began by saying, \u201cShe\u2019s a size fourteen and takes a 38C in bras. I can see what you mean; her stuff is falling to bits. We\u2019ll shop on Monday if it\u2019s all right with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, but you don\u2019t think she\u2019ll object to us taking over like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s partly what I want to talk to you about, Derek. Let\u2019s go and sit in the lounge.\u201d\n\nSeated, mother started. \u201cAine and I have had a long talk. She\u2019s been wide open, letting all the misery and pain, all the poison, come out. I don\u2019t need to give you the sordid details, do I?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I read them for myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is something you probably don\u2019t know, Derek, and I don\u2019t know what to make of it. When she came to the church last night it was a sort of farewell. She was going back to her room to turn on the gas fire and kill herself. I can see that she had plenty of reasons for giving up on life, but there was one last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nShe paused for a moment seeming to be struggling with her own emotions, then went on in a low voice: \u201cYou saw that big box wrapped in Christmas paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, what\u2019s in it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn electric train set. It was for Jamie. She bought it with money she\u2019d saved out of her social security, but knowing she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to see Jamie, she sent it, and they returned it. No note, nothing, just sent it back. Can you imagine anything crueller you could do to a mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the church service she changed her mind about committing suicide, and do you know why?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause somebody cared enough about her to pray for her, and you know who that was, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t understand how she knew, I mean, I didn\u2019t speak out loud, except during that hymn \u2018Away in a Manger\u2019, but I was so quiet she couldn\u2019t have heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t hear in the accepted way of hearing, she felt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean, \u2019felt\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to get her to explain that, and all she said was it was like a warm feeling, and she knew somebody cared enough and was praying for her, and she felt the compassion coming from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say any more than that, Derek, because she didn\u2019t say any more herself. Perhaps when you were a child I should have warned you about praying for people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarned me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I should have told you that praying for people can be risky.\u201d\n\nI was completely lost as to what mother meant and I asked, \u201cHow is it risky praying for someone, after all, it\u2019s just words?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what a lot of people think about praying, but that\u2019s not really prayer at all. Real prayer puts us in the position of being responsible to and for the person we pray for.\u201d\n\nI felt a sudden lurch in my stomach. I contemplated telling mother about the voice I had heard, but decided against it. She might think I\u2019d gone crazy, so I remained silent on the matter and merely indicated to her that I\u2019d understood.\n\nMother went on: \u201cAt the moment Aine is right down at the bottom of the pit, emotionally, physically and intellectually. What she needs is a hand stretched out to give her a start in her climb out of that dark place. We can offer that hand.\u201d\n\nMother fell silent, and we both sat meditating on the situation. I began to wonder why we had got our selves involved. With all the pain and suffering in the world, why this one? And what of myself, did I not have pain? \n\nThen the realisation came that since first seeing Aine at the Christmas play, I had hardly thought about my problems with Gloria. I had gradually focused away from my own difficulties, and begun to focus on someone else\u2019s situation. \n\nBut what about mother, and father for that matter? I found myself cynically asking myself, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for them.\u201d I decided to voice that thought.\n\n\u201cMother, why are we\u2026why are you going to all this trouble for Aine, when\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen there are so many others? It\u2019s simple, Derek. Aine came across our path. I can do very little for the entire world\u2019s suffering, but I can do something for this one sufferer. She was there, Derek\u2026\u201d\n\nMother paused; staring into space, then went on: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not telling the complete truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDerek, I\u2019m not being the unselfish person I\u2019ve been trying to tell you I am. There\u2019s something in it for me.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t see what would be \u201cin it\u201d for her, so I asked, \u201cWhat is in it for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething I\u2019ve always wanted, a daughter. I love you Derek, you know that, but one of the sad things for your father and I is that we never had a girl. When you brought Gloria into our lives I tried to be a mother to her, tried to love her, but she was too independent, too ambitious and quite frankly, too self-important to want anything I had to give. Perhaps it was my fault as much as hers. I never really liked her, and maybe she felt that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you want to take Aine as a daughter?\u201d\n\nMother gave a wan smile and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not biologically possible, and in any case she might not want it, but in the mean time I shall give her the love I would have wanted to give to a daughter in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you expect me to be her brother?\u201d I asked, grimacing. \n\n\u201cWhat you are to Aine will be your decision, but just remember, you were the one who prayed for her.\u201d\n\nMother suddenly changed the direction of the discussion and said, \u201cRegarding her son Jamie, I shall get your father\u2019s legal brain working on that one, he\u2019s a solicitor so I\u2019m sure he can find out the situation in law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d I thought, \u201cthat will be dad\u2019s bedtime fare tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout Monday\u2019s shopping,\u201d mother went on, \u201cpick me up about nine. Would you? Now I\u2019ve got to get on preparing the meal or we\u2019ll all starve.\u201d\n\nShe rose and went to the door, and then turned and said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t just sit there, come and help me.\u201d\n\nI followed her to the kitchen to peel and wash things.\n\nFather arrived with a polished Sam. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave as soon as we\u2019ve eaten,\u201d I said, then hastily added, \u201cI mean, after we\u2019ve helped clear up. I think Sam should have an early night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother about clearing up; go as soon as we\u2019ve eaten, your father can help clear up.\u201d\n\nAine joined us for the meal, and although she said very little, she did seem better for her rest. Sam and I left when we had finished amid a flurry of kisses. As I passed Aine at the door she made as if to kiss me, and then drew back. Instead she offered me her hand which I took, but pulled her to me and kissed her on the cheek. It was just a brotherly kiss!\n\nChapter 9: Brotherly Love?\n\nPutting Sam\u2019s bicycle into the back of the car together with her other gifts and mine; we drove home, both of us in thoughtful mood. As we neared the house Sam sighed, \u201cMrs. Lady didn\u2019t see me ride my bicycle, can she see me tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot tomorrow, darling, but we are going to grandma's again on Monday; she might be able to see you then.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I think she\u2019s nice, daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, darling, but she is very tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is she tired, has she been working hard?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. There are other things that make people tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Will she be tired on Monday?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Sam. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nWith Sam tucked up in bed I sat back with a glass of whisky and contemplated the events of the last couple of days. It was all rather confusing. It was I who had brought Aine into our lives, but I wasn\u2019t sure why. Connected to that question \u201cwhy?\u201d and in some ways more important, were my feelings about Aine.\n\nMother\u2019s talk of seeing her as a daughter had been faintly disturbing. If it were pursued by mother and accepted by Aine, I foresaw certain complications arising for me. It would put her much more into the centre of our lives, and did I want a \u201cbrother substitute\u201d role? After all, what did we really know about Aine? We knew what the media had splashed around, and had heard people talking about her. Their views ranged from \u201cShe should have been hung,\u201d to my initial questioning of putting her in prison.\n\nI gave up the mental struggle and my mind wandered on to Gloria. Where had she been during Christmas? Had she thought of Sam? Was there any pain for her? With the influence of a second glass of whisky I drifted off to sleep in the armchair and dreamed of pulling a white faced Aine out of a dark pit.\n\nI woke some time later and dragged myself to bed and another dream of Aine, but this time it was\u2026well, I awoke with an erection in the morning.\n\nIt was Sunday and Sam was given permission to ride her bicycle up and down on the footpath without oversight from me, but with a stern directive, \u201cDon\u2019t go on to the road.\u201d\n\nI pottered around the house doing odd jobs that had been left over from before Christmas, catching up with the washing and ironing, and preparing meals for Sam and I.\n\nThroughout the day Sam kept raising matters concerning \u201cMrs. Lady.\u201d \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very pretty isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cWhy was her face so white?\u201d \u201cIf Jamie is her little boy, why doesn\u2019t he live with her?\u201d \u201cWill she be tired tomorrow?\u201d \u201cI think Mrs. Lady likes me. Do you think she likes me, daddy?\u201d \u201cWill mummy come home one day?\u201d\n\nAnd so it went on, with that heart wrenching innocent persistence with which a child can seize upon the core of matters, while we adults continue to argue with ourselves or others about the \u201cIfs and buts\u201d. \n\n\nChapter 10: I Go Shopping With Mother.\n\nWhen Monday morning dawned I felt oddly pleased with myself and wondered why. A bit of psyche prodding allowed me to admit that I was pleased I would see Aine. Further more, I was pleased that mother and I would be out doing something nice for her, or at least, I hoped it would be nice.\n\nSam and I, together with the beloved bicycle, arrived dead on the appointed time. Knowing mother I wouldn\u2019t dare do anything else.\n\nAine was looking much better, no doubt because of the rest she had, but also because she found herself in an accepting environment. Mother would have been fussing over her, and father would have been engaged in his rumbling concern. \n\nFather was to take charge of Sam while mother and I went on our errand, but it was Aine who first took charge of her, telling her how pretty she looked and that they would go for a walk.\n\nI didn\u2019t think it would be a walk for Sam, as she would no doubt insist on riding her bike.\n\nMother and I departed, and under mother\u2019s instructions we entered the car park of a large store. We seemed to ride up and down a bewildering array of escalators until we finally arrived at a department with a sign, \u201cLadies Lingerie.\u201d\n\nLike many men I hesitated to enter this silken region for fear that people, especially the shop assistants, would get the wrong impression. I hung back, but mother saw my wavering and commanded, \u201cDon\u2019t be so silly, Derek, you\u2019re the one who is buying.\u201d Taking me by the arm she impelled me into department and up to a glass counter.\n\nThe place was festooned with a bewildering array of vests, panties, bras, slips and other items of female underwear that I could not give a name to. Sylph like waxen models with blank faces and nigh impossible figures displayed the items for sale.\n\nMother took control of an assistant and began the task of choosing the items. Her selection was, shall we say, practical. The sort of thing a girl would wear in the everyday hustle and bustle of life when the gear was not intended for the eyes of another in the more intimate moments.\n\nStarting to feel a little more relaxed in the ambience, I let my eyes rove over the multitude of things for sale. I had no idea there could be such a variety of ladies personal attire. \n\nIn the process of looking around my eyes fell upon one particular model wearing what almost did not exist. What there was of the garments consisted of a matching set of panties and bra. They were made of the finest delicate black material; the bra consisting of little more than under lift and the panties seemed to be made of narrow pieces of cloth.\n\nI nudged mother and whispered, \u201cWhat about something for special occasions,\u201d and jerked my head in the direction of the displayed delicacies. \n\nMother stared at the items for a moment, and then turned her gaze on me. \u201cWhat \u2018special occasions\u2019 did you have in mind, Derek?\u201d \n\nRealising I had committed a faux pa I tried to amend my words. \u201cI mean something to make her feel really nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mean to make someone else feel \u2018nice\u2019?\u201d She giggled, which is most unusual for mother, then said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Derek; something to make her feel pretty, but they\u2019ll cost you fortune.\u201d\n\nI failed to see how the substantial things mother had chosen, containing far more material than the scant objects I had chosen, could cost less. However, such are the mysterious ways of the female and their attire.\n\nI shrugged and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take them.\u201d\n\nI had taken scant notice of the things mother had decided on, and had little idea about relative sizes. When mother told the assistant \u201c38C bra, please\u201d, and the bra appeared, I had a dazzling vision of what would go inside those near non-existent cups. Something stirred in my nether region.\n\nOur purchases wrapped we began our journey through the maze, and in doing so passed another department selling female clothing. I think both of us were struck by one displayed item. It was a sea green pant suit.\n\n\u201cWith her hair colouring she\u2019d look lovely in that,\u201d remarked mother.  \n\n\u201cYes, stunning,\u201d I murmured as I pictured Aine wearing it together with the special panties and bra. \u201cShe\u2019s only got that white suit and a couple of rather washed out dresses.\u201d\n\nMother contemplated for a minute or so, and then said decisively, \u201cI\u2019ll get it for her.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later we emerged from the store triumphantly bearing our purchases and headed for home, anticipating the pleasure we would give Aine. Didn\u2019t someone say, \u201cIt is better to give than receive\u201d?\n\n\nChapter 11: A Delayed Christmas Day.\n\nWhen we got to the house it was to find Aine, father and Sam absent. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone out with Sam and her bicycle,\u201d I commented.\n\nThe Christmas tree was still standing in the corner of the lounge, so we decided that the parcels should be put under there, and on Aine\u2019s arrival we would announce that they were belated Christmas presents for her.\n\nThen began that impatient excitement that besets the givers of gifts as they await the arrival of the intended recipient. One of us was constantly looking through the window or going to the front gate to see if they were coming.\n\nEventually mother came rushing in from the front gasping, \u201cThey\u2019re coming, they\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\nI draped myself nonchalantly on the sofa, while mother prepared to waylay father in the hall to alert him to what was about to happen. I heard mother say to Aine, \u201cJust go in to the lounge, would you dear?\u201d\n\nAine came in holding Sam\u2019s hand and there was a low murmur in the hall and mother and father entered.\n\nMother and I had failed to arrange who was to present the gifts, so there was a brief hold up as we each waited for the other to speak. I decided to take the initiative and said, \u201cAine, we thought as you only had a gift from Sam on Christmas Day, we\u2019d like you to have a late Christmas Day, so we bought you some presents.\u201d\n\nI pointed to the parcels under the tree and Aine, with a look of bewilderment, knelt down to begin opening them.\n\nMother and I decided that the best should be last, so the everyday things were on top, followed by the delicacies of my choice, and finally the pant suit. \n\nOpening the \u201cevery days\u201d Aine was delighted and said, \u201cOh, lovely, they\u2019re just what I need, how did you know?\u201d\n\nShe looked at me, and then blushed, realising I had noted her underwear when I helped her pack. She turned away and opened the second parcel and became very still, staring at the panties and bra for a long time. She said nothing and finally opened the last parcel.\n\nIt was too late to whisk Sam out of the room this time as we were all taken by surprise.\n\nAine clutched the suit to her breasts and began to sob helplessly. Through the gasps and gulps could be heard, \u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s too much\u2026Oh no\u2026Why did you\u2026?\n\nSam ran to her and put her arms round her neck and began to kiss Aine\u2019s tear soaked cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Lady (\u2018Misses\u2019 had dropped off and \u2018Lady\u2019 had taken on the character of a proper name). Please don\u2019t cry you\u2019ll look very pretty in it.\u201d\n\nAine held Sam to her as well as the suit, and her sobs began to diminish. I had expected mother to swing into action as she had the first time Aine wept, but instead, she looked at me and whispered, \u201cYou prayed for her.\u201d\n\nI went to them and engulfed Aine and Sam in my arms. \u201cIt\u2019s all right Aine, we loved getting them for you. We didn\u2019t want to make you unhappy, we just thought\u2026\u201d I stopped speaking. Holding Aine and Sam I felt warmth emanating from them. I had thought we were fulfilling a need in Aine, but suddenly I found that these two were gratifying something in me. \n\nAine turned her face to me and kissed me on the lips, then still with her arm round Sam, went to my mother, kissed her and did the same to my father.\n\nShe stood for a moment looking at us, then very quietly said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t the words to express what I\u2019m feeling so, thank you.\u201d\n\nWe all stood silent for a moment, then mother went to Aine and putting her arm round her said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to your room and put the things away.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I help, Lady? I can put things away,\u201d Sam pleaded.\n\nAine took her hand and said, \u201cOf course you can.\u201d The three of them left the room.\n\n\nChapter 12: Father Has a Talk.\n\nFather rumbled wordlessly for a moment, then said, \u201cFeel a bit of a cheat getting a kiss, I haven\u2019t done anything.\n\n\u201cYes you have, dad,\u201d I grinned, \u201cYou\u2019ve provided the money for mother to spend.\u201d\n\nHe laughed then said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my orders. I\u2019ve got to look into the business of her son. Not my line of law really, but I can get one of the colleagues to take it up. Can be very tangled this family business. People using kids and property to get back at each other. See what I can do, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, mum said she\u2019d get you going on the matter.\u201d\n\nHe laughed again; \u201cShe\u2019s always getting me going on something, but what about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, you and Gloria. Heard anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing; She could have disappeared of the face of the earth as far as Sam and I are concerned. I could have tried to get in touch with her through the company she works for, but what would be the use. If she doesn\u2019t want Sam and me, especially Sam, there\u2019s no point in pursuing her.\u201d",
        "\u201cMight be a good thing for you that she has gone, but how about the little one?\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, dad. The other day she asked if Gloria would be coming home one day, but she mostly doesn\u2019t talk about her or ask questions. As mum said, she\u2019s probably buried it somewhere deep inside her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, a lot of kids do that; can come out later in nasty ways. I\u2019ve been out with Sam and Aine, as you know. Watching those two, they\u2019re as thick as thieves. Got the idea Sam has taken Aine on as a substitute mother, and Aine is compensating for Jamie with Sam. Not sure I like it, but\u2026\u201d He shrugged and fell silent for a moment, then looking at me intently asked, \u201cWhat about you, old boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll, do you mind the two of them getting on so well? What do you feel about Aine? Damned pretty woman, or will be if she gets over all this grief she\u2019s been going through.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know dad, mum keeps asking the same sort of question. She seems to think I should have some sort of\u2026well\u2026intentions regarding Aine. She even went so far as to warn me about Aine\u2019s delicate condition.\u201d\n\nFather rumbled loudly, \u201cHa, not got her pregnant, have you? That\u2019s what women used to say years ago when they were pregnant, they were in a \u2018delicate condition\u2019.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo dad, I\u2019ve not got Aine pregnant, in fact I\u2019ve barely had physical contact with her, and apart from the fact that I haven\u2019t touched her, I should think getting pregnant would be the last things she\u2019d need right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, old son. Of course the girl\u2019s in a delicate condition. Been through a hell of a time, but given the departure of Gloria\u2026well\u2026you know\u2026wouldn\u2019t blame you having thoughts, if you see what I mean.\u201d \n\n\u201cI see what you mean, dad, but I should think that two people with the problems Aine and I have got are better off apart. We\u2019d probably end up with another problem on top of the one\u2019s we\u2019ve got. And anyway, I\u2019m not considering Aine as a possible partner, sexual or otherwise.\u201d\n\nFather gave another rumbling laugh and said, \u201cPity, the way things are going your mother would love to have her in the family. Wouldn\u2019t object myself. Seems a nice enough woman. Probably have a lot to give if she ever gets into her right mind. Look here, old chap, if you need any help over Gloria\u2026you know, legal stuff, just let me know. I could get the right chap on the job to sort things out for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks dad, I\u2019ll bear it in mind, but I\u2019m not ready to finalise things in that direction yet. I\u2019ll get around to it in the new year.\u201d\n\n\n\nChapter 13: The New Year Resolutions.\n\nThe Christmas break over, I returned to work. Sam was not returning to school for a few more weeks, and so the daily ritual was, to take Sam to my parents in the morning and pick her up after work in the late afternoon. Father was back in his law office as well, so Sam had a large part of her day with mother and Aine.\n\nIt became obvious that Aine was gaining an increasing influence over Sam. Sam\u2019s conversation when I picked her up was littered with, \u201cLady says\u201d this, \u201cLady says\u201d that. \u201cLady and I went shopping today. Grandma says Lady is feeling much happier. Lady keeps the little dog on the table beside her bed, I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d \n\nMother also kept me constantly up to date with the health, welfare and deeds of Aine. Father had got his colleague to look into the matter of Jamie, and theoretically there was no reason why the boy should not join his mother.\n\n\u201cYou see, old chap,\u201d father said when we were alone, \u201cthere was never anything legal about their taking the lad. Aine\u2019s parents are both dead, and her brother lives overseas, so the paternal grandparents were an obvious choice. The thing is, though, if Aine made a strong bid at this stage to get him back, or even tried to get access, the grandparents might try and put their custody on a legal footing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the matter came to court, the judge would want to ascertain whether Aine was in a position to take care of the boy properly. That would include her health and mental state, and whether she could provide a proper home for him. There would be all sorts of psychological people and welfare workers poking their noses into Aine\u2019s fitness or otherwise, to have the boy back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve suggested to Aine that we leave the matter over for a while, until she\u2019s more settled. She doesn\u2019t like the idea, but sees the sense of it.\u201d\n\nMother was next in line with her plotting.\n\n\u201cI think Aine should get some work,\u201d she stated baldy to me. \u201cShe needs to get a sense of self worth. The trouble is, she got married to that man rather young, and stopped working when she got pregnant. She\u2019s only got limited skills and I\u2019m afraid her reputation as a husband killer precedes her. I\u2019ve got a solution, though. I\u2019m going to have a chat with your father tonight and see if they can\u2019t find a place for her in their office.\u201d\n\nI wondered how much of this had been discussed with Aine, and what the clients of my father\u2019s law office might think about Aine being employed by them. I decided, however, to say nothing and let the situation develop for a while.\n\nOn New Years Eve my parents usually had another gathering of friends and family. During the few days between Christmas and New Year word had got around that Aine now lived in my parent\u2019s house. This had given them a little time to get used to the idea, and as seems usual in our family, they accepted Aine as part of the scene.\n\nI had thought that Aine would dress up in her new pant suit for the occasion, but instead she wore one of her old dresses.\n\nShe spent a large part of the evening attached to Sam and me. I took this to mean she found security among relative strangers by sticking with the known. Her appearance had improved remarkably in so short a time and she was beginning take on the pretty looks father had predicted.\n\nI had never asked her age, and on first seeing her at the play I had assumed she was about thirty. Now I could see she was somewhat younger than that. \n\nI had tried to convince my parents and myself that I had no interest in Aine but to help her. That I wished to help her was true, but gradually a further dimension had crept in. I was beginning to see her as an attractive and desirable woman. I knew from mother\u2019s warnings that to seriously pursue Aine would be fraught with difficulties, not the least of them sexual, never the less, she occupied my mind increasingly.\n\nIt was during our New Year gathering, when for a few minutes I was without the company of Aine and Sam, that mother casually said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t take Aine out some time. I know she likes music so why not take her to a concert? Your father and I could look after Sam for the evening.\u201d\n\nI tried a minor delaying tactic by pointing out that Aine might not care to go out with me, but mother countered this with, \u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you ask her, will you? And she needs to start getting out more.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the New Year gathering I realised that a number of, if not resolutions, at least some intended directions, had been put forward. Attempts to return Jamie to Aine to be put on hold; an attempt to get Aine a job was in the pipeline and I was to take Aine out to a concert.\n\nPerhaps more subtle in its implication and less consciously focussed, was the growing relationship between Sam and Aine. I would have been quite happy about this if I could have been convinced that this was anything other than substitution; Sam using Aine as a mother replacement, and Aine using Sam as a child replacement.\n\n\nChapter 14: Dating Aine.\n\nI made no immediate attempt to \u201cdate\u201d Aine, but in the days following New Year I began to look out for advertisements announcing concerts. I liked Aine and cared about her and in addition I began to feel excited about the prospect of an evening out with her.\n\nOpportunity came with a concert by the State Symphony orchestra. Picking up Sam after work one evening, and trying to sound casual, I asked Aine if she would like to attend the concert with me. The response was an animated \u201cYes.\u201d \n\nI suppose I felt sufficiently flattered, as most males do, that a woman has jumped at the chance of going out with me. Of course, I might have looked at it from another perspective, namely, that she was jumping at the chance of going to a concert, the ticket price of which she could have ill afforded out of her social welfare cheque, and the escort was but an adjunct to the main event.\n\nOn the evening of the concert it was arranged that I should have my evening meal, shower and change of clothes at my parent\u2019s house. Sam would not have to be taken back and forth, and further, it was arranged that both of us would sleep the night there.\n\nAfter the meal Aine and I prepared for our evening out. Showered and changed I waited for her in the lounge with my parents and Sam. When she walked in we were all momentarily silenced. She was wearing the green pants suit and looked absolutely stunning, in addition to which, she seemed to be glowing with pleasure.\n\nSam was the first to recover and ran to Aine, reaching up to put her arms round her waist saying, \u201cYou look ever so pretty, Lady.\u201d\n\nMy father rumbled, \u201cSure you wouldn\u2019t like change places with me tonight, Derek.\u201d\n\nMother said, \u201cYou look lovely, dear.\u201d\n\nAine\u2019s face was flushed with pleasure, but her escort could not find his tongue until we were on our way to the car. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in the suit before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t worn it before. I was reserving it for a special occasion.\u201d\n\nI laughed, \u201cThe orchestra will be flattered.\u201d\n\nShe said softly, \u201cIt isn\u2019t for the orchestra, it\u2019s for you.\u201d\n\nMy laughter died as stab of painful pleasure shot through me and my head felt a little dizzy. More importantly, and uncomfortably, I began to get an erection. \n\nI suppose that this was the moment when I realised what I might have realised earlier, I wanted her. It was a sexual drive, but not that alone. As my feelings ran riot in that brief moment, I knew I wanted to love her, however difficult the way ahead might be. \n\nIf I tried to describe the concert I would be lying. Throughout the evening my awareness of Aine being close grew ever more intense. It seemed to blot out all else. I did not want music, I wanted only to be with Aine. I longed to be alone with her. I wanted to pour out my feelings for her, but I knew neither was going to be possible, at least on that night.\n\nDuring the drive home little was said. Aine was never very vocal, and I was too overwhelmed by what I was now feeling about her. Had it been any other woman, I might have attempted to bed her, but I conjectured that any attempt on Aine would be to destroy something that was in its embryonic stage.\n\nThe house was in darkness when we arrived, so we both went to our bedrooms. Before parting from her I kissed her softly on the lips and said, \u201cThank you for coming with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a lovely evening, Derek,\u201d she said, and slipped quickly into her room.\n\nThat night I had to relieve myself of an overwhelming sexual tension.\n\nOther evenings out followed, and my desire to be with her increased with each occasion. Weeks, then months passed. Aine began work carrying out clerical tasks in my father\u2019s office. It was a very junior position and although it paid little, she ceased to be eligible for social welfare money. She continued to live in my parent\u2019s house and neither father nor mother seemed concerned about this. It was quite clear that mother had grown to love her dearly and would be hard hit when she did leave.\n\nIt was around eight months after first seeing Aine that two critical events took place. The first concerned my relationship with Aine.\n\nI had held back from declaring myself for some time, but finally could not remain silent any longer. I told her quite plainly that I loved her as we sat in the car one evening after our return from attending a theatre.\n\nHer first response, typically spoken in a quiet voice was, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve known for some time you loved me.\u201d\n\nThe calmness with which she seemed to take my declaration had me puzzled. If she had said, \u201cAnd I love you,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t love you,\u201d even \u201cI can never love you,\u201d I would have felt grounded on something I could deal with. I suppose I became a bit irritable at her response that left me up in the air, so I said, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Derek, it isn\u2019t. There are things I\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time, but haven\u2019t known how to say them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay them like they are, Aine, but please, don\u2019t leave me hanging like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike they \u2018were\u2019, would be more accurate, Derek. He said he loved me, and I told him I loved him, and he hurt me. Oh, not at first, but when he did start he hurt me so badly I had to have repairs done to me -  repairs inside me. He started after Jamie was born. I\u2019ve never understood why, but he used to say, \u201cIf you love me, then you\u2019ll let me do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors almost begged me to tell the police, and I would have left him, but for Jamie. He told me I would never be able to keep Jamie, and I was na\u00efve enough to believe him. It was only when he started on Jamie that I cracked. He was actually going to inflict pain on his own son. That\u2019s when I killed him. I didn\u2019t mean to kill him, I only wanted to frighten him, to stop his mad ideas...but\u2026\u201d\n\nShe ceased speaking and we sat in silence. There had been no frills about what she said, no histrionics, just a bare statement of what had happened. I wanted to respond, but didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\nIt was Aine who broke the silence. \u201cI know most women would have been having a sexual relationship with you by now given the time we\u2019ve had together. You haven\u2019t once approached me or tried to manipulate me sexually, and you\u2019ll never know how much I\u2019ve loved you for that. If I were to give you advice on our relationship I\u2019d say, don\u2019t bother with me, I\u2019m not worth your effort. But I\u2019m not going to advise you. I\u2019m going to ask you to be patient with me for a while longer.\u201d\n\nI found my own voice; \u201cFor as long as it takes, Aine. I love you, and I shan\u2019t back away until you tell me to.\u201d My mother had said that I would have to wait for Aine to come to me, and that, it seemed, was how it had to be.\n\n\nChapter 15: Waiting for Aine.\n\nAs Aine and I were going out together ever more frequently, I was spending more and more time at my parent\u2019s house. In addition to just Aine and me going out together, we would often take Sam with us. I suppose we could be accused of playing a game of happy families, but it was not like that. The inclusion of Sam seemed to be a perfectly natural outcome of our emerging relationship.\n\nAine spoke no more about the experiences with her husband, but Jamie crept into our conversations more and more. I think one of the fears she had was that Jamie would forget her, and even if he did come back to her, they would be as strangers to each other.\n\nI spoke with my father about the problem, asking if it was not now time for an attempt to be made to get Jamie back. He was doubtful.\n\n\u201cYou see, Derek, we want to be sure that Aine is settled. Its fine her living here, and your mother and I are enjoying having her, but it\u2019s still not a place of her own. She\u2019s doing well at work and the colleague who actually employs her has just given her a rise, but I think just a bit more time.\u201d I had to rest content with that.\n\nOne of the problems I was facing was my ever increasing sexual desire for Aine. There had been no other woman since Gloria, and not lacking in virility, and frankly I was badly in need of Aine.\n\nAnother factor was her growing attractiveness. She now seemed in excellent health both physically and emotionally, and as she became increasingly relaxed, she spoke out more, and revealed a sharp intelligence. Now, because she was getting more money than she had received on social welfare, she also dressed better. To use my mother\u2019s word, she looked \u201clovely.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you might think I would be pleased to have such a striking woman as a companion, but I had my own problems to cope with in that regard. When we went out men would turn to take another look at her. I had in mind Gloria\u2019s desertion, and wondered if Aine would eventually make a better deal than a draughtsman.\n\nThe culmination came on a day when Aine, Sam and I had gone to the foreshore to watch a small yacht race. The race, from a viewer\u2019s point of view, was as exciting as watching grass grow, but for some males there seemed to be an alternative source of excitement, Aine.\n\nNo doubt my own insecurity and sexual frustration played a large part in how I felt, but I overheard a young chap comment to his mates as they passed us, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind getting on to that and screwing it.\u201d \u201cThat\u201d being Aine of course.\u201d\n\nI felt a murderous anger and jealousy boil up in me, and almost started fight. Unreasonably I wanted to partially blame Aine for attracting such attention, but managed to retain sufficient self-control to see the irrationality of my thoughts. The afternoon was spoilt for me, and I was silent for the rest of the time we were there.\n\nWe returned to my parent\u2019s house with me still sulking and Aine trying to find out what was wrong. My wretched pride would not allow me to express what I was feeling, that I wanted her all to myself, and hated other men looking at her lustfully. \n\nWe were to eat at my parent\u2019s place, and then Aine and I were going out to see a film. By the time we were due to go out I had calmed somewhat, and when Aine joined me in the lounge wearing her green \u201cspecial occasions\u201d suit, I felt completely mollified. \n\nOn our return my parents and Sam were already in bed. Aine and I had a drink, and then went to our bedrooms. It had become habitual for us to say goodnight outside the door to her room, and to kiss. These were what you might call, \u201cvirtuous kisses,\u201d but mild as they were, they added fuel to the fires of my desire for her. This night she held on to me a little longer than usual before slipping into her room.\n\nI went into my bedroom with a raging erection. I was still carrying the remains of my drink, so I sat on the side of the bed thinking and finishing it off.\n\nThe drink gone, I stripped and was about to climb into bed and turn off the light, when there was tap on my door.\n\nI scrambled quickly under the bed covers and called, \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nAine entered. She was still wearing her green suit and she approached the bed to within about a metre then stood still.\n\nI waited to find out what she wanted, but she simply stood there, her head down, not looking at me. I was about to ask her if she was all right, when she spoke.\n\nVery softly she asked, \u201cWould you undress me, darling?\u201d\n\nI lay on the bed staring at her stupefied, and then she added, \u201cI think it\u2019s all right now.\u201d\n\nI pushed back the bed covers and swung my legs so as to sit on the edge of the bed. It was one of those situations where I had to be sure she meant what I thought she meant.\n\n\u201cAine, do you mean you want me to take your clothes off?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nShe could not help but see my rampant erection so I stood and went to her asking, \u201cYou\u2019re quite sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI began to unbutton the suit, taking off the top first to discover she was wearing the flimsy bra I had bought her. I removed it and gazed at what was revealed. I was so moved by the beauty of her breasts I broke out with, \u201cOh, my love,\u201d and bent to kiss her rosy nipples. As I did this she gasped and held me to her. I heard her say, \u201cI do love you, Derek.\u201d\n\nI took off her pants to reveal that she was wearing the matching panties and taking these off I saw she had no pubic hair.\n\nAs if sensing my observation she said, \u201cHe hated it so he made\u2026I had it permanently removed\u2026you don\u2019t mind, darling, do you?\u201d\n\nI smiled at her and said, \u201cOf course not,\u201d and knelt to kiss her mons. As I did I could see her firmly cleft vaginal lips with a silvery trace of her lubricant already there.",
        "I rose and lifted her on to the bed and she clung close to me and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo my love, I will never hurt you.\u201d\n\nWith Gloria sex had been all techniques: vaginal, oral and anal sex had been grist to her sexual mill. With Aine I understood it had to be very different. My mother had warned me, and I heeded that warning. I would do nothing to Aine that was not clearly initiated by her.\n\nI kissed her and for the first time felt her mouth open to receive my tongue. Our lips clung together for a long time, and when I finally broke away, it was to suckle her beautiful nipples. \n\nI had imagined her breasts many times, and as ideal as my fantasy had been, they were beyond anything I had envisaged. Firm and creamy coloured, they were surmounted by rose pink nipples. Had I been less urgent in my desire for her I might have lingered long over her lovely mounds.\n\nMy need was too great. I explored her vagina with my fingers, and finding it wet with her lubricant, I parted her legs and came over her, ready to penetrate.\n\nI hesitated: \u201cDarling, I haven\u2019t got anything\u2026I mean\u2026you might get pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know Derek. Would you mind?\u201d\n\nVisions of Gloria arose in my head; her resistance to pregnancy and my pleadings for us to have a child. Now, here was woman who actually did not mind my impregnating her, someone who might actually want to have a child with me. No argument, no fuss, just opening herself for me to fertilise her.\n\nStill I hesitated. \u201cDarling, are you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, very sure.\u201d\n\nI entered her and very quickly ejaculated into her, pouring out the frustration of months of holding back from her. She had no orgasm, but when I had stopped pumping into her she said, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me yet.\u201d\n\nI had no desire to leave her, and as I lay upon her she kissed my lips and face saying over and over, \u201cOh my love\u2026 my darling\u2026\u201d\n\nMy hands caressed her breasts as I felt a wave of contentment pass over me. I loved her; loved her almost to distraction. It was a love the like of which I had never experience before; a love that was tender and protective, yet passionate and demanding. It was a love that wanted to both give and receive. \n\nMy penis, still inside her, began to harden again, and I began to move in and out. Suddenly she clasped me and began to moan, \u201cOh my darling, my darling, don\u2019t stop\u2026please don\u2019t stop\u2026\u201d\n\nShe gave a tremendous upward thrust and cried out, \u201cDeeper\u2026please deeper.\u201d\n\nHer legs wound round me and I put my hands under her buttocks, and thrust in to the last millimetre of my length. I felt the sperm pumping up my shaft, and then it was firing into her as she wept and continued to cry out, \u201cMy love\u2026 my love.\u201d\n\nIt was over, our first coupling. I lay inside her for a long time as she climbed down from her climax. She gave out soft whimpering sounds that ended with a sigh of contentment, and we lay, looking into each others eyes, neither of us desiring the inevitable separation of our bodies.\n\nWhen we did part, Aine said, \u201cI love you very dearly, Derek,\u201d then slipped out of the bed and ran from the room. I had wanted her to stay with me for the night so that I might sleep with her in my arms, but Aine had decided otherwise. I was disappointed, but having emptied myself into her, I slept in peace that night.\n\n\nChapter 16: The Morning After.\n\nI awoke next morning as if to a new world. It was Saturday and I did not have to go to work. I sang as I showered, and went to a breakfast I hoped to share with Aine. She was already sitting at the table eating, and looked up briefly as I came in, then blushed and looked down at her plate.\n\nI was about to make some affectionate comment when mother entered. She was carrying Aine\u2019s pant suit and underwear and she was smiling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for you both,\u201d she said, \u201cbut do be more careful with your clothes, Aine.\u201d\n\nIn my euphoria on waking I had failed to notice the garments I had removed strewn across the bedroom floor. Mother had started her morning tidying around the house, and found them. \n\nShe sat beside Aine and said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad, darling. Was my brute of a son \ngentle?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery gentle, mother,\u201d Aine replied.\n\nIt was the first time I had heard Aine call her \u201cmother\u201d. It marked how great the bond that had developed between them was.\n\nI wanted to get Aine on her own to speak to her. I wanted to reinforce my devotion to her, but after breakfast mother caught me first in the lounge.\n\n\u201cDerek, was everything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes mother, it was lovely.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, I\u2019m so glad for you. I\u2019ve wanted it to happen almost most as much as I imagine you\u2019ve wanted it. I gather from the presence of her clothes in your room she came to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, Derek, Aine is not like a lot of women and their one night stands. If it went well with you both, she will feel bound to you. It will have been as important as that to her. She overcame her fear to be with you, and that took courage. What I want to ask you, not out of prurient curiosity, but for Aine\u2019s sake, \u201cWas it important to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes mother, very important.\u201d\n\nMother came to me and kissed me; \u201cI don\u2019t want to see either of you hurt, darling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you will, Mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ll keep Sam and father out of your way for a couple of hours. I\u2019ll take them shopping. You\u2019ll find Aine in the kitchen. Speak to her, Derek.\u201d\n\nMother began to leave the room, but paused at the door, turned and asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve got three bedrooms in your house, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d She smiled and left me. \n\nThe significance of my mother\u2019s question about my three bedrooms did not sink in immediately, and putting it aside I made my way to the kitchen and found Aine working at the sink. She must have heard me come in, but she continued working. I went up behind her and put my arms round her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet this morning.\u201d\n\nShe was still and silent for a moment, then she turned in my arms but kept her head turned from me.\n\n\u201cDerek, was I very terrible last night?\u201d\n\nI laughed and said, \u201cYou were exquisite, darling, why do you think you were terrible?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing to you like that, asking you to undress me, and\u2026\u201d\n\nI laughed again. \u201cDarling, I couldn\u2019t come to you. If I thought that was possible it would have been a long time before last night. You understand why I couldn\u2019t approach you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Then you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a slut? You know\u2026cheap?\u201d\n\nI kissed her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever think of yourself as a slut again.\u201d I gave another laugh and said, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not cheap. Look at the money I\u2019ve spent on you taking you out.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me for a moment as if considering how serious I was about the money, but after I kissed her again, she laughed, \u201cWas I worth it?\u201d\n\nI became serious and responded, \u201cYou were worth that and far more, and I\u2019m not just talking about sex. You\u2019ve had a bad time yourself, but you\u2019ve brought sunshine to my life, and Sam\u2019s. What I want to know is, can we look forward to more sunshine in the future?\u201d\n\nAs soon as I said it, I could have kicked myself. Aine had laid herself on the line coming to me the previous night, I was in a sense asking her to do it again. It was for me now to say something about the future by making an offer.\n\nIt was at that point mother\u2019s three bedroom question sank into my thick head. The implication was I might want to take Aine to live with me, and beyond that, perhaps have Jamie come to us. I made up my mind to speak out, so I led Aine to the rather unromantic kitchen table and we sat.\n\n\u201cAine, you know about the situation Sam and I are in. I\u2019ve begun no divorce proceedings but, if you feel we can have a future together I\u2019ll set things in motion. Gloria hasn\u2019t been near us; she\u2019s not even sent a letter or made a telephone call. It a little while I can file for divorce on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you asking me if I\u2019ll marry you, Derek?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it very well did I? Let me say it properly. When I\u2019ve cleared up my marital situation, would you marry me, Aine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all been wonderfully kind, you, your father and mother, but just because of last night you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it, Aine; you know it isn\u2019t because we made love. I would have\u2026I\u2019ve wanted to ask\u2026Damn it, Aine I love you, will you marry me or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t women answer a simple question with a simple answer,\u201d I silently wondered. Then, as if to confound me, Aine said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nSurprised at the final clarity of her answer I waded straight on with, \u201cAs soon as we are settled I\u2019ll get dad moving about Jamie.\u201d\n\nAine made no response to this but sat looking at me speculatively. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIs what it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I heard you.\u201d \n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you pleased I said yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell of course I\u2019m pleased. What makes you think I might not be?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t kiss me.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the earth open up and swallow a blundering idiot,\u201d I thought. I ask the woman to marry me while I\u2019m still married to someone else, I propose in the kitchen, and I don\u2019t even kiss her when she says \u201cyes\u201d. \n\n\u201cDarling,\u201d I said contritely, \u201cI think you might consider changing your answer to \u2018no\u2019. I mean, you don\u2019t want to be married to a thoughtless clod, do you?\u201d\n\nI kissed her long and passionately, the she said: \u201cYes, I do want to be married to a \u2018thoughtless clod\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, they won\u2019t be back for some time, do you think we could\u2026\u201d\n\nYes, I did have that in mind.\u201d\n\nWe made our way to the bedroom. \n\n\nChapter 17: One Door Closes.\n\nIf I was superstitious I might suspect that what happened next was provoked by the understanding Aine and I now had. I would have wished Aine to come and live with Sam and me, but cautious as ever, Aine said we should wait at least until the divorce proceedings were set in motion.\n\nAs it happened it was just as well Aine did not come to us immediately, because a little over a week after our agreement to ultimately marry, I received a telephone call from Gloria.\n\nNot only was I surprised to hear her voice, but was amazed at her effusive cheerfulness.\n\n\u201cDarling, it\u2019s been such a time. It\u2019s lovely to hear your voice, are you well,\u201d and so on and so on. \n\nThe upshot was, she wanted to see me and would be arriving the following evening. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing you darling\u2026and Sam of course.\u201d\n\nThere was no question as to whether I wanted to see her or not, and she rang off before I could make any adequate response.\n\nOne thing was certain; Gloria would not see Sam until I had found out what she wanted. I saw no point in risking Sam being disturbed once again by her erstwhile mother.\n\nI contacted my mother soon after Gloria was off the phone, and telling her what had happened, asked that she keep Sam for the following evening and night. She immediately saw the point and agreed, and added, \u201cHave a talk to your father darling he might be able to give you some advice.\u201d\n\nFather came on the phone and rumbled, \u201cComing to see you is she? Well, whatever she wants, don\u2019t agree to anything until you\u2019ve had a chat with my colleague. Never liked that woman, but she\u2019s no fool, so just be careful, and for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t put anything in writing or sign anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks dad.\u201d I rang off.\n\nNext day I was tense and made errors in my work due to lack of concentration. It was not knowing what Gloria wanted that troubled me, and like most people in those situations, I conjured up the worst possible scenarios.\n\nArriving home I prepared a meal I couldn\u2019t eat and moved restlessly around the house waiting for Gloria\u2019s arrival.\n\nThe front door bell clanged and I went to it and opened it. Gloria stepped straight in and flung her arms round me.\n\n\u201cDarling, it\u2019s been ages. Have you missed? But of course you have.\u201d\n\nI disentangled myself from her grasp and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go into the lounge to talk.\u201d\n\nSeated I looked at her, trying to assess from her appearance what was coming.  Gloria was an attractive woman in a buxom sort of way. Large breasted, in fact, with what used to be described as and \u201cHour glass figure.\u201d She had clearly gone to some trouble preparing her self for this visit.\n\nShe has long dark hair, and I always used to enjoy seeing her wear it in a single braid over her shoulder. That was how she had it tonight. Her dress was cut low to reveal an expanse of upper breast, and the hem line exposed more than it covered.\n\nGloria was looking round the room. \u201cWell, darling, you do seem to have looked after things while I\u2019ve been gone, so neat and tidy.\u201d She gave a stupid giggle, \u201cYou really would make a delicious house husband, sweetheart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it you want, Gloria?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so serious, so solemn, anyone one would think you weren\u2019t pleased to see me. And where is my sweet little Samantha, darling?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is stopping with my mother tonight.\u201d\n\nOh, darling, that's not very kind, is it? I was so looking forward to seeing her, but never mind; I can see her another time, perhaps tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust tell me what you want, Gloria.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, isn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m coming back to you.\u201d \n\nI was speechless. Whatever I had conjectured about Gloria\u2019s visit, this had not been thought of.\n\n\u201cDarling, didn\u2019t you hear what I said? I\u2019m coming back to you; back here, to our house. Now tell me how pleased you are.\u201d\n\nIt was amazing at the apparent self-assurance of this woman. No question about whether or not we should come together again, simply a blank statement that she was coming back. I think it was the utter gall of the woman that paralysed my vocal chords.\n\n\u201cWell, say something, darling.\u201d\n\nMy voice returned and I asked, \u201cWhat makes you think I want you back?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh darling, don\u2019t be so pompous, of course you do, you love me. Now tell me how much you\u2019ve missed me,\u201d she gave another giggle, \u201cespecially in bed.\u201d\n\nOnce I had felt bitterness and anger at her desertion of Sam and me. Now, looking at and listening to her, I only felt sickened. It seemed hardly credible that anyone could be so blind to the anguish she had caused, so arrogant as to believe she could just walk back in. \n\nI decided that the conversation, if that is what it was, had gone far enough. I came out directly with what I thought and felt. \n\n\u201cGloria, if ever I might have taken you back, it\u2019s all too late now.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Taken me back\u2019? You take me back! I\u2019m not asking you to take me back. I\u2019m telling you I am coming back.\u201d\n\nShe had spoken in anger, but she calmed again, making a visible effort to control herself. \u201cDarling, I realise you might want to punish me a little, but you know in your heart you want me back. It will be just like it was before\u2026better. Come on darling, come over here and kiss me. I might even agree to something more than a kiss if you\u2019re nice to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you Gloria, you\u2019re too late. I don\u2019t want you back and I don\u2019t want you in this house. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to bring you back here, but would you please leave!\u201d\n\nShe gave a laugh touched with hysteria. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me back! God almighty, who do you think you are? Where do you think you\u2019ll get someone as good as me? You sniffed around me often enough before, you couldn\u2019t keep your hands off me, and now you don\u2019t want me back! You must have lost whatever senses you ever had, Derek, since I went away.\u201d\n\nShe made another effort to control herself again. \u201cLook, sweetheart, it was all a silly mistake. Let\u2019s call it an aberration, a marital hiccup. I know I should never have left, but\u2026\u201d\n\nI felt utterly cold as I sat looking at her. \u201cNo Gloria, you shouldn\u2019t have left, you are quite right, but you did. You left without a thought for me, and worse still, Sam. Well, I can tell you we\u2019ve made a life without you, and to put it bluntly, it\u2019s a much better life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bastard, you self-righteous arsehole; I\u2019ll take you for everything you\u2019ve got, and I\u2019ll get custody of Sam, you can be sure of that. Courts always give preference to the mother. You\u2019ll find out\u2026You don\u2019t want me back\u2026\u201d She gave another even more hysterical laugh. \u201cYou think...\u201d She stopped in mid sentence and her face contorted even more with fury. \u201cOh, I see\u2026you\u2019ve found yourself some stupid slut to stick your prick in. Which gutter did you scrape her out of Romeo?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy God, you\u2019ve got a nerve. You stuck a bloody kid in me, very nearly ruining my career, and now you\u2019ve got yourself some tatty tart you think you can dump me. Well, my sanctimonious spouse, you\u2019ve got another think coming to you. I\u2019ll be a millstone round your neck for as long as you live.\u201d\n\nI almost reacted to her vicious and foul remarks, but I was alert enough to realise that this would be just what she wanted. I restrained myself and said, \u201cGloria, if you\u2019ve said all you came here to say, would you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going got do, chuck me out? I know you, you wouldn\u2019t lay a violent hand on a lady your too much of a gentleman or too gutless.\u201d\n\n\u201cGloria, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing yourself much good and it would be better if you left. We can perhaps talk through our solicitors if you wish, but for now\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see. We\u2019re going to hide behind our lawyer daddy, are we? All right, I\u2019ll go, but I shall be back and you\u2019ll be out of here. What do you say to that, arsehole?\u201d\n\nRecalling my father\u2019s warning to be careful what I said, I made no response.\n\nGloria stood, and for a moment I thought she would rush at me and tear my face with her nails. She made another mighty effort to control herself, but she was shaking all over, indicating the fury raging within.\n\n\u201cSee you in court,\u201d she screamed, and left slamming the front door behind her.\n\n\n\nChapter 18: Another Door Opens.\n\nI was shaken. I cared little about the house, but if Gloria should ruin the future I had in mind for Sam, Aine, myself and hopefully Jamie\u2026.\n\nIt was too late to do anything further that night, so I went to bed, but not to sleep. I tossed and turned until morning, wondering what was ahead.\n\nI rang the office first thing and said I had a domestic crisis. They knew my circumstances and agreed I should take time off to try and sort things out.\n\nI was about to ring father\u2019s office to make an appointment to see Mr. Smyth-Anderson, the member of their firm who specialised in \u201cFamily Law,\u201d when an inspiration came to me. I dialled the work number of my mole inside the offices where Gloria worked. I had not heard from him since he told me about what Gloria hoped for by \u201ccoming across\u201d for her executive lover.\n\nWhen he came on the line and I identified myself, I hardly needed to ask him anything. He was bubbling over to tell me the latest Gloria news.\n\nIt came to this: Gloria had moved in with her would be benefactor. All went well for a while but the promised advancement was not forthcoming. Gloria got increasingly, as he put it, \u201cUppity\u201d. \u201cYou could have cut the atmosphere between them with knife,\u201d he said.\n\nThen a new girl had started work in the office, apparently with more charms than Gloria as far as the gentleman was concerned. In no time at all Gloria was out and the new girl was in, and, it seemed, with the same offer of career advancement that Gloria had received.\n\nIt seems that the senior executive had played this game several times before and had frequently shuffled back and forth between his long suffering wife and family and the latest target female in the office.\n\nThe Company Board had finally had enough of his office philandering that had caused a number of emotional disruptions in the workplace, so they dumped him. His wife also, having had enough, started divorce proceedings. Gloria had retained her job, but only just.\n\nI spoke next to Mr. Smythe-Anderson my \u201cFamily\u201d legal advisor, and made an appointment to see him. Leaning on the special privilege afforded me because he was a colleague of my father\u2019s; I got to see him that morning.\n\nThere were three clear areas for discussion: Divorce from Gloria, which could be easily effected after twelve months separation; Property settlement with Gloria; Custody of Sam and visiting access; Retrieval of Jamie from the clutches of his grandparents and his restoration to Aine. ",
        "It was a long interview which, had I been paying, which I was not, would have started to run up a very steep bill. Thank God \u2013 there I go again \u2013 for a solicitor father.\n\nSmythe-Anderson hummed and hawed for a while, obviously trying to sort out which aspect to tackle first. He started with the divorce.\n\n\u201cAh, hem, er\u2026easily fixed unless you cohabit with her before the twelve months is up. Don\u2019t let her back into the house or anything like that. Keep away from her as much as possible.\u201d\n\nI told him I had no intention of cohabiting with Gloria, so he went on to the next aspect.\n\n\u201cAh, as to property matters; she does have a claim on you and if you decide to remain in the house, the court would no doubt award her a payout from you. Say, around half the value of the property, depending on how the court weighs up what each of you have contributed. The alternative is for you to move out and let her have the place, in which case she would have to pay you.\u201d\n\nI told him my preference was to stay put and he nodded and said, \u201cHave to see what she\u2019s got to say, probably through her solicitor by the sound of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, ah, er, as to Samantha.\u201d He stopped and blew his nose, then went on, \u201cAh, could be\u2026 er\u2026er touchy. Sure you want custody?\u201d\n\nI told him I certainly did.\n\n\u201cWell, if Gloria turns nasty and demands custody, could have a bit of fight on our hands. Men and women are supposed to be equal in these matters, but the Family Law Court still tends to favour the woman. Ah, however, ah, given the circumstances, things might work in your favour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs to the question of the son, well, don\u2019t want to er\u2026er dwell on the past but\u2026ah, ah, but it could be touchy, very touchy. However, if the grandparents who have the boy at the moment are denying access, might get a court order to fix that. Actually they have no real legal status in the matter since there was no, as it were, signing over of the boy to them in the first place. Of course, Aine should talk to me, or another solicitor, since you have no real status in the matter at present. I take it you intend to marry Aine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould er\u2026could weigh in her favour, married to a man of good character and all that. I take it you do have a good character?\u201d\n\nHe gave a chuckle that sound like the opening of door with rusty hinges.\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cYes, well, ha hum, the lady can see me almost any time she wishes since she works here, but I shall suggest to her we delay the matter until we\u2019ve cleared up the other aspects.\u201d\n\nPoor Aine, it seemed that the restoration of Jamie to her was always being delayed. \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d went on Smythe-Anderson, \u201cWe, ha hum, let divorce matters run their course, and wait to see what the lady does about property settlement and custody of Sam. As soon as anything happens, let me know.\u201d\n\nI did not have long to wait. A letter on impressive paper from the law firm of \u201cBoot, Boot, Foot and Askew\u201d arrived a few days later. It virtually demanded on Gloria\u2019s behalf that I hand over the entire house and contents, or make a payment equivalent to the value. I was severely shaken by this demand as I had insufficient financial resources to meet the demand.\n\nI took the letter to Smythe-Anderson who hummed and hawed again for a few minutes then said, \u201cThey\u2019re trying it on. You notice it says nothing about Samantha. No demand for custody, not even a request for visiting access. I could be wrong, but I conjecture she\u2019s blackmailing you. Without saying so she\u2019s offering that you can keep Samantha if you hand over the property. I er\u2026er shouldn\u2019t worry too much as this stage, if I can see the game, so can the court. Leave it with me from now on and I\u2019ll deal with matters through her solicitor, on your instructions of course. I\u2019ll bet they won\u2019t let it come to court.\u201d\n\nHe gave his rusty chuckle again.\n\nI thanked him and departed, and despite his suggestion not to \u201cworry too much\u201d, I worried.\n\nAine and I now slept together fairly regularly, a double bed having been provided by my mother and placed in Aine\u2019s bedroom. I was growing impatient for the time I could take Aine to my home permanently. \n\nHaving come to trust that I was not another sadomasochist, Aine was eager for sexual intercourse.  She was also increasingly open to the wider aspects of love making, like oral sex and some of the slightly more acrobatic couplings.\n\nWith Gloria I had always been aware that we were practicing sexual \u201ctechniques\u201d, with Aine our coupling was far more natural and had a depth of meaning I had not experienced with Gloria.\n\nIf Aine was eager for sex, I was at times almost beside myself with desire for her. It was inevitable, given our circumstances, that there were many times when we could not be together, but I hungered for her.\n\nIt was not for sex alone I wanted her. I loved to be in her presence; to be near her and inhale her sweet woman aroma, to touch and hold her. \n\nDespite her growing boldness in sexual matters, she retained some of her shy manner. Ridiculous though it might seem given what I have just written, there was always something of the warm, tender and yielding virgin about Aine. Every time we coupled it was like a first time when if all has gone well you fulfil each other\u2019s long dammed up needs. \n\nEven a couple of day\u2019s separation from Aine now found me desperately ejaculating within seconds of entering her. This of course was followed a little later with a much longer coupling in which we could express our love rather than raw lust. \n\nThis love and powerful drive for Aine was exacerbated a few days after my visit to Smythe-Anderson when, Aine and I just having finished making love, she announced cautiously, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant darling.\u201d \n\nThis came as no surprise to either of us since from the very first we had taken no precautions against her being fertilised.\n\nMy first response was to kiss her and tell her I loved her and was delighted. Aine somewhat timidly asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind. We both new it was a possibility right from our first coming together.\u201d\n\nI paused and thought for a moment, then asked \u201cAre you happy about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, now I know it\u2019s all right with you.\u201d\n\nYes, it was all right with me, but I did have additional food for thought.\n\n\nChapter 19:  The Way Ahead.\n\nThe fact that Aine was pregnant injected a new urgency into the need to divorce Gloria and get the matters of property and Sam settled. I thought I\u2019d better appraise Smythe-Anderson of the situation so I telephoned for an appointment.\n\n\u201cAh, oh, yes, I was going to contact you. Got a response from her solicitor, ah, better come in and see me. Today if you like.\u201d\n\nWhen I saw him he had good news for me. Gloria was now willing to settle for a more reasonable sum of money and expressed no desire to have the house or contents. Better still, there was no mention of Sam.\n\nWhen I voiced my satisfaction with the new situation Smythe-Anderson did his humming and hawing, then went on, \u201cOf course, we could hang out for an even better deal, but I wouldn\u2019t advise it. If we did hang out she might bring Samantha into the picture. Even though I suspect she doesn\u2019t really want the child, she\u2019s a useful pawn in her game. Wonder what happened to what they used to call, \u2018motherly instinct\u2019? Ah well\u2026\u201d\n\nI told Smythe-Anderson about Aine\u2019s pregnancy and he hummed for quite some time over that one.\n\nYes, well I er\u2026I take it Gloria is unaware of your er\u2026er\u2026liaison with Aine?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry and keep it from her. Might give her a bit more ammunition if she found out, especially if she knew that Aine was er\u2026er blooming, ha, ha. Must congratulate her, eh?\u201d\n\nI left feeling somewhat relieved even though the sum asked for by Gloria was beyond anything I possessed at that moment. It meant a remortgaging of the house, damn it, just when the place was nearly paid for!\n\nThings moved with surprising rapidity, given the usual, as the bard put it, \u201cLaw\u2019s delay.\u201d \n\nI persuaded my bank manger into a remortgage, paid out Gloria and shortly after found myself in the family court seeking a divorce. Gloria didn\u2019t even bother to show up. I was granted a decree nisi, and unless Gloria lodged an objection it would eventually become absolute.\n\nI was still unable to marry Aine yet, but she finally moved in with me and Sam to our deep satisfaction. \n\nAine seemed to have cast a spell of love over us; first my mother, then Sam and perhaps to my shame, then me. Even my usually undemonstrative father seemed captivated by her.\n\nSmyth-Anderson had referred to Aine as \u201cblooming\u201d, and that was just what she was doing. She was clearly one of those fortunate women who were at their best when pregnant.  Following Smythe-Anderson\u2019s metaphor, Aine seemed to blossom and glow. I don\u2019t think she had ever looked lovelier. \n\nSmythe-Anderson warned me that Gloria could still at any time take action regarding Sam, but as time passed we heard nothing. \n\nThe one delay was the matter of Jamie. Smythe-Anderson decided that it was time for Aine to apply for access to him. This had an unexpected outcome. Instead of the grandparents agreeing to access, they virtually handed over Jamie to Aine. \n\nThe reason for this has never been made clear. Perhaps they felt they did not want all the problems of a child, and later a teenager in their latter years; or perhaps they knew that any legal tussle would probably end in Aine\u2019s favour. Whatever their reasoning a simple telephone call from them to Smythe-Anderson informed him that Jamie would be delivered to my house\u2026or rather, \u201cour\u201d house\u2026at a date and time nominated by Aine.\n\nThis was not a good way to approach the matter, as we had wanted time for Jamie to get to know Aine again, and to adjust to my and Sam\u2019s presence in her life, and of course, in his.\n\nWe were somewhat comforted when Sam, who had to be told that Jamie was coming to live with us, announced that she had told Jamie, and he was very excited. Sam was of course beside her self at the thought that Jamie whom she \u201cwuved\u201d would be with us.\n\nOn the day of Jamie\u2019s arrival we were taken aback by the way in which he was delivered. A car drew up and Jamie got out and stood on the footpath. Suitcases and various boxes and packages followed. Then the car drew away leaving Jamie standing there.\n\n\u201cThe bastards, the lousy bastards,\u201d I burst out, and Aine ran from the house to Jamie. When she drew near typically of Aine, she hesitated as if afraid of rejection. Jamie stood with bowed head, but he extended his arms up towards her, and Sam and I who had held back heard him say, \u201cMummy.\u201d\n\nThat did it. He was swept up into Aine\u2019s arms and there was kissing and weeping. She carried him into the house. \n\nSam asked, \u201cWhy is Lady crying, isn\u2019t she happy to see Jamie?\u201d\n\nHow to explain the mysterious ways of adults to a child? \u201cYes, she\u2019s very happy darling, that\u2019s why she\u2019s crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026?\u201d Sam gave up trying to fathom the inscrutable ways of grown ups, and helped me carry in Jamie\u2019s goods and chattels.\n\nNow began that awkward period of Jamie settling in and, I suppose, we resettling in with him. Sam demanded to be allowed to show Jamie his room, and then came unpacking and putting away as Sam escorted Jamie round the house to introduce him to its various corners.\n\nAlmost a year before, at the school Christmas play, I had noticed an unexpected maturity in Jamie when he met me. Now there occurred another mark of that maturity.\n\nI had not sought to impose my company on Jamie, but decided to let him come to me in his own time. It was about four hours after his arrival, and as I was doing some work in the garden, he approached me.\n\n\u201cHow are you settling in, Jamie?\u201d I asked. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll like it here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe stood looking at me for some time, and I felt impelled to find out what he wanted.\n\n\u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s all right, I mean, is there something you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know why I haven\u2019t got a daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to hear mummy screaming and crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat must have been terrible for you, Jamie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to be bigger so I could stop him hurting mummy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked mummy and she says you\u2019ll never hurt her, or me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll never hurt you or your mummy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you love mummy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I love her very much.\u201d\n\nHe paused for another long period, and this time I did not break in on whatever he was thinking. When he did speak I nearly copied Aine and cried.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a daddy, so if I\u2019m good will you be my daddy.\u201d\n\nHe had asked this very solemnly and I responded with equal solemnity; \u201cI shall be your daddy even if you are not good.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I call you daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019d like to call me, Jamie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen daddy it is.\u201d\n\nHe extended a small hand for me to shake. It was the sheer grown upness of his gesture that was as moving as anything that had passed between us. I shook his hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s agreed?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go and tell mummy.\u201d\n\nHe trotted off down the path to the house but stopped and turned back to stand before me again.\n\n\u201cYou love Sam don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you love me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me for a moment, smiled, and continued his journey back to the house leaving me choking with emotion.\n\n\nChapter 20: Love Came Down at Christmas.\n\nChristmas was nearly upon us and with it another school play. Jamie and Sam did not play such prominent roles this time the former being a Wise Man and the later an Angel. \u201cMummy\u201d and \u201cDaddy\u201d duly attended the event, and because the children were marginally older, they might also be said to have improved in their acting skills, marginally. \n\nGina Wallace was present at the performance and was clearly flustered about seeing Aine and I together. Perhaps she was upset because I hadn\u2019t taken her advice at the last performance to stay away from Aine.\n\nThe same principal made substantially the same speech as the previous year, and we engaged in the same sort of bun fight after the play, and showered praise upon our little thespians.\n\nThe grand finale to our year of love and turmoil came, not through any of the people involved. It came during the service of Carols and Nine Lessons that our family attended once more.\n\nThe children\u2019s hymn \u201cAway in a Manger\u201d was being sung again and it was during the line that had so affected me the previous year, \u201cStay by my side until morning is nigh.\u201d I glanced at Aine and the two children, and I heard that damned voice in my head again: \u201cI knew I could leave it up to you.\u201d"
