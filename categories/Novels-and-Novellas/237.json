        "I suggest you read Chapter One; the story line, characters, and events will make more sense if you do.\n\n****************\n\nA third shot from Josh's .50 caliber Sharps dropped the grizzly back to all fours; the big bear now critically wounded snarled at Red, roared once more and then slowly slumped to the ground. \n\n\"You all right Red?\" Josh asked as he quickly came over to his friend.\n\n\"That bear skin would have made a nice rug in front of the fireplace,\" Red replied pointing at the dead grizzly with a grin. \"Your Sharps put some mighty big holes in it so we can't likely use it for that.\"\n\nJosh returned Red's grin. \"Ifin I'd known you wanted a bear skin rug, I would have just let you wrestle him to death.\" Josh knew Red was okay because of his joking manner but Josh felt a little shaky. \"It was a close thing partner,\" he remarked to Red. \n\nRed walked to the dead bear, pacing off the distance. \"About 30 foot more and I might have gotten that chance to wrestle the big fellar.\" He looked over at Josh and said, \"Glad I didn't have to though; it might have messed up my new shirt.\"\n\nJosh put his hand on Red's shoulder and said, \"I'm glad you didn't have go hand to hand with him.\" Then he smiled and added, \"Sarah would use my hide for a rug if I let anything happen to you.\" Both men laughed, they realized that the confrontation with the bear could have had a very different outcome.\n\nThey stretched the dead grizzly out and Red pointed to a barely healed wound on its front shoulder. \"Looks like he got himself gored by a steer, don't it?\"\n\n\"That's probably why he was huntin cattle,\" Josh said. \"He was too slow to hunt like he used too. Cattle are big and slow and every time he killed one he remembered his injury and went a little crazy. Should we skin him and take the hide for that rug you mentioned?\"\n\n\"I was just funnin with you. Don't really want a fir rug; especially one from somethin that tried to eat me,\" Red responded. \"Besides I don't think our horses want to carry a bear skin. Look at them.\"\n\nItsa and Queenie were trained to ground tie but the growls and roars from the bear had made them very nervous. The horses were almost dancing; their training told them to stay put but their natural instinct told them to run.\n\nJosh had to smile as he watched Itsa. The horse would take two or three steps away from the entrance to the box canyon and then he would take those same steps back to where Josh had left him. Queenie had her head stretched out trying to maintain the ground tie as she kept stepping away from the canyon.\n\n\"Itsa is about ready to run off,\" Josh said. He walked to his horse and stroked its neck and rubbed its forehead to calm the animal. \"Take it easy big guy,\" he said. The horse began to settle down as Josh talked to and petted him.\n\n\"Queenie isn't in much better shape,\" Red replied. He too stroked and talk to his mare to calm her. \"Let's ride over to the Maggie M and let them know we got the bear. Maybe Jerry will want the hide.\"\n\nJerry Barnes had been the third partner in the group when they'd left the Hobart wagon train for Colorado. His parent's had been killed during a raid on the wagons; he'd been 15 at the time. Josh and Red had sort of adopted the youngster. They admired and respected the way Jerry had stood up to very bad event. \n\nAt 15 Jerry had been about 5' 8 and stocky; not having reached his full growth yet. Now at 23 he was a man grown. He'd hit a growth spurt at 17 and was now 6 foot with big hands that could handle a weapon or a horse with ease. For a youngster from Illinois he had become a seasoned talented hand with stock.\n\nDaniel and Maggie Maguire, the parents of Sarah and Danni, had fussed over Jerry a bit and reminded him of his parents. Their son Jacob was twelve; he and Jerry quickly became friends. Jerry worked and stayed at the Maggie M with the Maguires even after the three partners bought the Lazy L. He had grown from a fifteen year old orphan to a 23 year old partner of a fine ranch. \n\nJerry was the first to hear and then see Josh and Red as they rode in. He walked down to the corral to greet them. \"Howdy, have any luck?\"\n\n\"Yep we found the big guy over to that box canyon. I wanted to dance with him but Josh was in a hurry to get home so he shot him,\" Red replied with a grin.\n\n\"We left the body in that canyon. If you want the hide you're welcome to it Jerry,\" Josh said.\n\n\"By the way, Sarah's up to the house,\" Jerry informed them. \"I expect you're gonna get an ear full about chasing after dangerous animals and such.\" Jerry gave his two partners a big grin. \"I think you're in for it now, Red.\"\n\n\"Me and Jerry will take care of the horses Josh. You go on to the house, we'll be there shortly,\" Red suggested with a smile. \"I'm not in a hurry for Sarah to light into me.\" \n\nFive minutes later Sarah rushed off the porch and ran to him as Red got close to the ranch house. \"Josh told us what happened,\" she said. \"I don't know what I'd do without you,\" Sarah added as she hugged her husband.\n\n\"I'm fine Honey,\" Red replied hugging her back. \"Josh just had to show off with that big rifle of his'n; I had everything under control.\"\n\nJerry rode up to the house on his big horse Charger leading a pack horse. \"I'm gonna skin that bear before supper. The hide will make a nice rug for in front of the fireplace.\"\n\nRed and Josh both laughed at Jerry's statement. The young man looked at them not understanding the joke. Josh, Red and Sarah decided to head back home to the Lazy L. Daniel and Maggie invited the three to stay for supper but they said they needed to get back.\n\n\"I left kids with Danni and she's probably cussing me about now,\" Sarah said. Looking at Josh she added, \"Besides after today I think Josh is in a hurry to see Danni. Aren't you Josh?\"\n\nWhen they got back to the ranch they fed and watered the horses. Josh spent an extra few minutes with Itsa, feeding him an apple, brushing him, and telling him what a good job he had done. It had been the young horse's first real adventure and he had handled himself well.\n\nJosh was greeted by Danni with a big hug and kiss. Later that evening after getting the children to bed, Josh told her about the run in with the bear. \"I thought that big cuss was gonna eat Red up. I don't think I've ever been that scared.\"\n\nDanni hugged Josh to her. \"Don't you know nothing can happen to you two when you're together? You and Red watch out for each other more than a lot of brothers.\" \n\nJosh looked at Danni and said, \"I think we should take everyone on a picnic tomorrow and just spend some time with the ones we love.\"\n\nIn their bedroom Sarah looked at Red, \"You were pretty quiet tonight at supper Honey. What happened out there?\" Red started to joke about the bear hunt but Sarah stopped him. \"No kidding around this time please.\"\n\nRed looked at his wife for a few seconds put his arm around her and pulled her to him. Kissing her gently he said, \"That bear was gonna make supper out of me until Josh stopped him.\" Red stared at the wall for a few seconds and continued, \"I hit that animal with seven or eight shots from my Henry and never slowed him down. If Josh hadn't a been there with that big Sharps of his that bear would be digesting Red McCall about now.\"\n\nSarah hugged him back. \"Josh and you together are a hard pair to beat. I'm glad I've got both of you in my life.\"\n\n**********************************\n\nDillon was riding Buck and leading the way. He looked back over his shoulder at the two wagons following him. Good thing we bought those wagons, he thought. Don't think regular ranch wagons could have made this trip. \n\nThey had bought two Prairie Schooners for their journey to Colorado Springs. Each wagon was a smaller version of the big Conestoga wagons and could haul up to 1600 pounds if necessary and was big enough to sleep in if the weather turned bad. The big wagons were put together so well that the body was almost water tight; they could float them across deep water fords. \n\nDillon had insisted that they carry no more than 1200 pounds in each wagon. No need to put more stress on the wagons and the animals pulling them that they had too. They could pick up some supplies from little towns and settlements along the way.\n\nEleanor left most of the arrangements in Dillon's hands. She said he was the one with the most trail experience. He decided to use mules to pull the wagons, instead of oxen or horses. They bought eight big Missouri mules to make up two teams of four. They had two horses from the ranch tied off with a long lead rope to the back of one of the wagons; the animals were saddled and ready if needed.\n\nDillon explained that although oxen were stronger, they were a lot slower and each ox ate as much as two mules or horses. Mules were stronger than horses and could pull heavier loads for longer periods. On flat land they could use just two mules per wagon; giving the other animals a rest. \n\n\"Besides we can sell the mules when we get to Colorado Springs,\" Dillon said. \"Freight companies or the mines in the area can always use mules. If we use oxen we'll end up with pets or a big cook out at the end of the trip. They're not much use on a ranch.\"\n\nThe small wagon train made its way east from Prescott Valley to the freighter trail than ran north and south from Phoenix to Flagstaff. This route added a few miles to the trip but the trail north had passes through the mountains. It also avoided having to climb the Mogollon Rim; a rocky escarpment which was 7,000 feet in places. The hardest part was the climb out of the Verde River valley. The trail was actually pretty good up the mountain but it was very steep and hard on the mules.\n\nOnce they climbed out of Verde Valley and up on the Rim, a good portion of the trail was across grass lands and they made good time. When the trail became more dangerous Dillon would take over from Eleanor and Elizabeth. But he let them drive as much as possible; he felt he was needed to scout ahead for the easiest routes, places to camp, and to keep an eye out for Indians.\n\nDillon and Oso hunted along the way to add to their food supply and Ethan became very good at setting snares for rabbits and grouse. When they stopped each night he would scout out the game trails and set his traps; he was usually successful. One advantage this trail offered was a plentiful water supply; they usually found water holes, springs, or creeks every day or so.\n\nThere was a period of three days they spent crossing a high desert with no water. That was when the four water barrels they carried on the wagons really made the difference. They rationed the water they used to make sure the mules and horses didn't suffer. If anything happened to their mules they would be in a dangerous situation. \n\nAt night Eleanor usually chose to sleep in their wagon. She said sleeping on the ground hurt her back. The real reason she stayed in the wagon was to give Elizabeth and Dillon some time by themselves. Weather permitting they would pull a feather bed under the wagon and sleep there.\n\nThey had just crossed into the Colorado Territory and were about half way to Colorado Springs. The wagons stopped for the night at a large spring fed creek. After supper Dillon decided he was going to take a bath; he was dusty, dirty, and needed a shave. He heated a little water on the fire, shaved, and headed for the creek to wash himself and his clothes.\n\nHe undressed and washed his clothes using a little lye soap. Dillon hung his pants, shirt, and socks on a limb and waded naked out into the stream. He was washing his hair when he heard someone sneaky around on the bank of the creek. Dunking his head to rinse the soap out of his hair and face he stood and faced the direction the noise had come from.\n\nWhen he saw who was making the noise, he grinned and chuckled. It was his wife Elizabeth wading out to join him; she was dressed the same as he was. \"Maybe the most private time we've had,\" she said returning his grin. \"Want to wash my back?\"\n\nDillon nodded and replied, \"Maybe I should take a bath more often.\" It was better than two hours before they got back to camp. \n\nAt first light the wagons were on the trail again. \"Things will get easier when we get to Trinidad,\" Dillon told them. There is a trail north to Pueblo and on to Colorado Springs that's used by the freight wagons.\"\n\nThe spent two days in Trinidad, resupplying and taking a short rest to get ready for the last 150 miles. They were all eating supper at a diner when the Sheriff walked over to their table.\n\n\"Howdy folks, I'm Sheriff Blevins,\" he said. \"Thought I'd just say hello. Y'all just passing through or you gonna stay with us?\"\n\nDillon stood, shook hands with the Sheriff, and introduced the rest of his companions. \"No sir, we're on the way to Colorado Springs. Hope to set up a ranch and raise cattle.\" It's nice to hear a Texas drawl again, Dillon thought. \n\n\"Where y'all from?\"\n\n\"We sold our ranch in Prescott Valley,\" Eleanor said. \"That's our stake for the new place.\"\n\n\"Sorry to be askin all these questions, ma'am,\" Blevins said tipping his hat to Eleanor. \"You folks take care; there's been some trouble with some road bandits on the other side of Pueblo. Keep on your toes and good luck to ya.\" He nodded and walked out of the diner.\n\nEight days later they pulled into Pueblo and got ready for the last part of their journey. Dillon suggested resting for one day because half of the remaining journey was through mountain passes. He wanted the mules to be rested and as fresh as possible. \n\n\"How much longer Dillon?\" Eleanor asked; she and Elizabeth were getting a little tired of life on the trail.\n\n\"With any kind of luck we should be there in about 7 or 8 days,\" Dillon answered.\n\n\"I'll sure be glad to get there,\" Oso said. \"My butt's developing calluses from sittin on this wagon seat.\"\n\nThe next morning they were on the trail again. We had our share of good luck so far, Dillon thought, as he rode point on the trail. Sure hope it keeps up for a while longer. It was the middle of their third day out of Pueblo when Dillon noticed a dust cloud coming up behind them. He turned Buck and rode back to the wagons. \n\nAs he got to Elizabeth in the first wagon he said, \"Some thing's coming up behind us; not sure what just yet. Let Oso take the lead and you follow whatever he does.\"\n\n\"Think its trouble?'\n\n\"Don't know but I'm going to scout back down our trail a ways to find out what or who it is.\"\n\nDillon rode to the second wagon; turning to ride close so Oso could hear him. Pointing with his chin he said, \"Some things causing a big dust trail behind us. I'm going to check it out. I want you to take the lead and if you hear my gunshot find a defensive position for the wagons and hunker down.\"\n\nOso nodded his understanding and kicked the mules up to catch and pass the first wagon. Dillon saw Ethan climb into the back of the wagon and look back down the trail; the boy was carrying a Henry rifle.\n\nAbout an hour later, Oso saw a rock bluff and pulled the wagons up close to it. The bluff would protect their backs in case of an attack. We can wait here for Dillon until he returns, he thought. The mules can use the rest and if there's any trouble we'll be ready for it.\n\nThey'd just gotten the wagons pulled in when a gunshot rang out. Oso saw that there were now two dust clouds moving toward them; they were closing the distance much faster than before. It wasn't long before he could make out Dillon riding at a high gallop back toward them. He pulled Buck up as he rounded one of the wagons and jumped off.\n\n\"Ethan, take Buck; he's got a rock under his left front shoe. He pulled up lame those last twenty yards or so. See if you can get it out and then get back to the wagons,\" Dillon ordered. Oso and Elizabeth already had their Henry rifles in their hands.\n\n\"There's a group of about twelve riders coming fast. I think it's those bandits Blevins warned us about,\" Dillon told them. \"Anyway they shot at me when I got close to them.\" Dillon retrieved a shotgun from one of the wagons and handed it to Eleanor. \"We'll try and keep them at bay with our rifles Eleanor, but if any of them get close blow them to hell.\"\n\nThe twelve raiders rode at the wagons firing their guns. Dillon told the others to wait until he fired before they started shooting. \"Idiots,\" he said. \"You can't hit anything with a gun from horseback riding at a gallop.\"\n\nAt fifty yards, Dillon opened fire and the others quickly started shooting too. Two of the bandits were knocked out of their saddles before they could get turned around. They regrouped at a distance of about three hundred yards. Ethan rejoined the wagons.\n\n\"Buck's fine Dillon. I got the rock out but he'll have a sore hoof for a couple of days. I tied him off to a tree back there and gave him a little water.\"\n\nDillon nodded at the youngster and passed him a rifle. \"Give us a hand here Ethan,\" he said. Seeing the disapproving look on Eleanor's face he added, \"This is a harsh land sometimes Eleanor. He don't have time to be a boy right now.\"\n\n\"No quotes Dillon?\" Oso asked. Dillon enjoyed poetry and usually had a quote ready for most times. Dillon smiled and shook his head.\n\nEthan smiled and made sure the rifle was loaded. \"For that which we are about to receive, we thank thee, Lord,\" he said.\n\nDillon looked at him with a question. \"Strange thing to say.\"\n\n\"It's the only quote I could think of,\" Ethan answered. \n\nThe bandits tried another assault on the wagons, again starting to shoot while riding hard. This time the volley from Dillon and the others downed three of the raiders. The remaining group turned and rode even harder away from the wagons; they'd lost five men. The horses of the dead men followed the retreating bandits.\n\nDillon watched them ride away and then turned back to his people. \"Anyone hurt?\" Everyone was uninjured. The only casualty of the attack was one of the water barrels; it had several bullet holes in it and was leaking. Oso and Ethan quickly used cooking pans and Dutch ovens to transfer the water to the other barrels.\n\n\"Reckon they thought the cost was too high,\" Oso said with a grim smile.\n\n\"Shouldn't we bury those men?\" Eleanor asked as they drove away. \"It's the Christian thing to do.\"\n\n\"Think they would have bothered with us if it'd turned in their favor?\" Dillon's eyes were cold and hard. \"Hell is empty and all the devils are here,\" he quoted. Dillon paused and added, \"We sent a few devils back to hell today.\" \n\nOso had seen Dillon in his battle mode before but it never failed to amaze him that this big gentle man could turn into a cold and ferocious warrior when the need arose. \"What about their horses? Should we round them up?\" Oso asked.\n\n\"Most of them are just nags from what I saw,\" Dillon replied. \"They'll follow the rest of the bandits and their horses. Let's collect any weapons and such from the bodies and get on our way. If any of the stuff is good we'll keep what we want and sell the rest.\"\n\nElizabeth, Eleanor, and Ethan came to join Oso and Dillon in examining the dead men. \"This isn't a job for a lady. Why don't you two stay here? Oso and I can handle it?\" Dillon suggested. \"You too Ethan, stay with the wagons.\"\n\n\"But you said I didn't have time to be a boy,\" Ethan complained.\n\n\"That's right I did, but there's no reason for you to grow up all in one afternoon. As wild as this country can still be, I'm afraid you'll see your share of dead men as you get older.\" No need to rush it, Dillon thought. \"Go help your mother and sister water the mules and get them ready to travel please.\"\n\nEthan was disappointed at being demoted back to a boy. \"Yes sir,\" he replied.\n\nThey didn't find much of value on the men. Not very good bandits, Dillon thought. The weapons were mostly old and almost worn out, the clothing were close to rags, and the men had little money on them. Dillon left the gun making sure they couldn't be used by Indians or anyone else that might find them. ",
        "\"Let's water the mules and get going,\" Dillon suggested. \"I don't think they'll come back but I'd like to put some distance between us.\" He changed his saddle to another horse and led the wagons to the next camp sight\n\nThe weather had been extremely good during their journey; now it decided to pay them back. It started to rain and the wind picked up until the rain drops were coming at them from the side. Riding close to Elizabeth driving the wagon Dillon smiled and said, \"Never saw sideways rain before. It puts a whole new meaning to being wet, don't it?\"\n\nElizabeth laughed and replied, \"This wagon cover doesn't help much when you're sitting out here on the seat. Oh well, we won't have to take a bath tonight anyway.\"\n\n\"That's too bad,\" Dillon said chuckling. \"I was sort of looking forward to another bath.\"\n\nDillon had been impressed with Elizabeth and Eleanor on their trek. Neither of them used the excuse of being ladies to slack off from their share of the work. In fact several times Dillon had to order them to rest and take it easy. Hell of a woman that I picked, Dillon thought as he smiled at his wife. Or was she the one doing the picking.\n\nThe freighter trail was almost as good as a road and they made good time using it. But now with the heavy rain it turned into a mud bog. Three times they had to stop and take the mules from one wagon to help pull the other wagon out of a mud hole in the trail. Even Oso's great strength couldn't push the wagons free of the clinging mud. After freeing a wagon for the third time, Dillon called a halt.\n\n\"We're spending more time getting wagons out of the mud than we are traveling. We'll make camp and hold up for a day or two until the storm passes and the trail dries out some,\" he told his crew. \"As close as we are I don't want anybody getting hurt or the mules injured just to save a couple of days.\"\n\nThe rain stopped that evening but they waited two days for the trail to dry out before they resumed their journey. The night before it had started raining, Eleanor looked at the clouds and decided to stow a lot of dried wood in the wagon. Because of her they didn't have a cold camp; they were able to stretch a canvas from one of the wagons to the other and have a dry place to cook and eat over a small fire. \n\nSitting under the canopy leaning back against his saddle, Dillon thought this isn't too bad; he gently stroked Elizabeth's hair as she leaned back against him. Got a warm dry place out of the weather, got my wife and family, and got a full belly; not bad at all. If nothing else the two days rest will give Buck a chance to heal up some. \n\nOther than a few still wet and muddy spots on the trail they had no more adventures. It was just the normal ten and twelve hour days plodding along with the wagons. It took them six more days to reach Colorado Springs. They followed directions given to them at one of the general stores to Ted and Tillie Clark's. As they stopped the wagons in front of the house, Tillie came running out to greet them.\n\nThe trip from Prescott to Colorado Springs had taken them 71 days. Pretty good time, Dillon said to himself.\n\nTillie suggested that they pull the wagons out back of the house until they decided what they were going to do and put the mules in the corral out there. The three horses were put in the barn. Ted returned from his office about two hours after their arrival. He told them they were welcome to stay as long as they wanted. After supper sitting in one of the parlors of the old bordello, Ted asked what their plans were.\n\n\"Suppose we'll start looking for ranch land right away,\" Dillon answered.\n\n\"I hope it takes a while,\" Eleanor said. \"If I never sit on a wagon seat again, it'll be too soon.\"\n\nAfter spending two days seeing the town, they began to make some plans. \"First thing I want to do is buy another horse,\" Dillon said. \"Ole Buck is 15 and he's carried me a long way. I think it's time to give him a little rest. But I'll want something special; the horse will have a hard go to live up to Buck.\"\n\n\"The best horses in the area are bred and raised by a feller down near Fountain,\" Ted informed him. \"Y'all passed through Fountain on your way here. It's a full day's ride round trip. Josh Kelly is his name.\"\n\n\"I remember Fountain,\" Elizabeth said. \"It looked like a nice place.\"\n\n\"Kelly and his partner own the Chico Basin Cattle company about ten miles southeast of Fountain,\" Ted continued. Ted and Dillon got involved in talking about horses. \"Kelly's got this one big red horse named Diablo that may be the best I've ever seen,\" Ted remarked.\n\n\"Think he'd sell this Diablo?\"\n\n\"You'd probably have a better chance at buying his wife than getting that horse,\" Ted replied laughing. \"Don't think he'd sell him but he's been breeding the big guy and you might get one of his sons. But be prepared to pay top price and then some. That's no ordinary horse.\"\n\n\"Guess I'll take a ride to Fountain tomorrow and look up Kelly,\" Dillon said. \"Want to go with me Elizabeth?\"\n\nNodding her head, Elizabeth replied, \"Maybe we should stay overnight and get a feel for the town.\" Grinning at her husband she added in a low voice, \"It'll be the first chance we had to be alone since our bath.\"\n\nDillon chuckled, \"Sounds like a good idea to me.\"\n\n***********************\n\nJosh, Red and the whole clan came into Fountain. Danni and Sarah along with little Maggie were in the general mercantile getting supplies and shopping. Josh had business at the bank and Red decided to stay with the other three children. He wasn't fond of banking and the business side of the ranch.\n\nRed had Josh's boy William and his two sons John and Daniel in the big wagon. He was telling them tall tales about the journey he and Josh had made from Santa Fe.\n\n**************\n\nDillon and Elizabeth were inside the store browsing. Dillon walked over to the man behind the counter. \"Howdy, I'm Dillon Gallagher. Wonder if you might help me?\"\n\n\"I'm Steve Mitchell, I own the place. What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Looking for a Josh Kelly. Understand he's got the best horses in the area. I'd like to do some business with him. Can you give me directions to his spread?\"\n\n\"I can do better than that,\" Mitchell replied. Pointing to Red in front of the store he said, \"That's his partner Red McCall out front with the kids. Josh is probably in town too; that youngest boy is his son.\"\n\nDillon nodded his thanks and stepped outside; Elizabeth was busy looking at some ladies hats so he left her there. As he got closer, he heard Red talking to the three boys in the wagon.\n\n\"So there we were. Just me and Josh facing over a hundred Indians. William your daddy stood there with that coup stick, you know the one that's hanging over the fireplace at home, well anyway there he was holding the coup stick in one hand and his rifle in the other. I was right beside him with my own rifle.\" Red looked to make sure his audience was paying attention. All three of the boys were sitting on the edge of the seat with their mouths open.\n\n\"Those Indians took one look at Josh and me and whipped up their horses and rode away as fast as they could,\" Red finished.\n\n\"Really Uncle Red?\" William asked.\n\n\"Oh Pa,\" John said. \"Are you sure it was a hundred Indians?\"\n\n\"Might have been more John; I didn't have time to count em.\" Daniel giggled at the face Red made at John.\n\n\"You must be the famous John McCall,\" Dillon said.\n\nRed turned around to face Dillon, hooking his thumb on his gun belt. \"My name is McCall but most folks call me Red. Who might you be Mister?\" Red wasn't being unfriendly but he didn't know this man.\n\n\"That's right; your father said it was only your mother and Charley that called you John.\" He paused a little and said, \"Names Dillon Gallagher.\"\n\nRed smile at the mention of his family. \"Pa wrote me about a man stopping by to see him. Said that he'd served with Charles and Sam. That was almost four years ago. That be you?\"\n\nDillon nodded. \"I didn't really ride with your brothers. Charley and I met and talked for a couple of hours before we charged the Union lines at First Manassas. He sure thought the world of you; talked about you most of the time. He was a good man, sorry he didn't make it.\"\n\nRed hung his head for a moment remembering. \"Yeah, Charley meant a lot to me too.\"\n\nDillon gave him some time and then said, \"I'm looking for your partner. Need to talk to him about a horse or two. He around?\"\n\n\"He's over to the bank but he'll be back here soon. Our wives are in the mercantile and then we're gonna have an early supper before we head back to the ranch. You're welcome to join us; if you can put up with these three rascals here.\"\n\n\"My wife is inside too. I'll go tell her we're having supper with y'all.\"\n\nAs Dillon entered the store, Elizabeth called him over. \"Dillon this is Danni Kelly and her sister Sarah. Danni's husband is Josh Kelly, that man you came to see about horses. She's invited us to supper; you can talk to Josh then.\"\n\nDillon laughed. \"Just met Red outside and he asked us to supper too. He belong to you Sarah?\" \n\n\"Yes, he's mine. All though sometimes I don't care to claim him,\" she answered with a grin.\n\nLater that afternoon the three families met at the diner. Josh joined them and was introduced to Dillon and Elizabeth. The stories of the three families were exchanged during supper. As they finished eating, Dillon told Josh why he wanted to meet him.\n\n\"I hear you've got the best horses around and I need a couple of good ones,\" Dillon said. You can never go wrong complimenting a man on his family or his horses, he thought. \"Folks mentioned your horse Diablo. Any chance of seeing him?\"\n\n\"Sure, c'mon down to the stable with me; he's down there. I need to saddle him and Danni's horse Sunny so we can start back to the ranch,\" Josh replied.\n\nRed loaded Sarah, Danni, and all the children into the wagon and drove to the stables. Dillon, Elizabeth, and Josh followed them, talking as they walked. When they got to the stables Josh told Dillon to wait a minute and he and Danni went into the barn. A few minutes later, they came back with two horses.\n\nJosh and Danni weren't actually leading the animals. They had the reins looped over their shoulders and the horses followed them like heel hounds. Stopping in front of Dillon, Josh fed a piece of apple he had brought from the diner to a big red stallion. As Dillon stepped closer to look at the horse, Josh rubbed the horse's nose and neck.\n\n\"Behave yourself Diablo, these are friends of mine.\" The big horse nodded his head up and down as if he understood Josh. \"This is Diablo, Dillon. He and Sunny there are the breeders for some of my horses.\"\n\nJosh grinned at Danni and said, \"Sunny used to be my horse too but I loaned him to Danni several years ago and she won't give him back.\"\n\nDanni laughed. \"Sunny's got more sense than to go back to Josh. He's mine now, aren't you boy?\" The buckskin pushed against Danni looking for his own apple.\n\nDillon walked around Diablo and then Sunny. He was a good judge of horses and knew that these two were some of the best. \"Fine animals Josh. Big, strong, and from the look in their eyes pretty smart.\"\n\n\"You and Elizabeth come out to the ranch tomorrow for lunch and I'll show you some stock. Maybe we can find something you like,\" Josh suggested. \"We've also got some horses sired by Red's horse, Jasper. Jerry our other partner has bred his Morgan to a couple of our quarter horses too.\"\n\nDillon asked, \"How do we get to your place?\"\n\n\"Take the south road out of town. Follow the main trail past a big rock bluff; you'll cross Black Squirrel Creek at the bottom of the rise. Take the trail that branches off to the left and it'll lead right to our place. It's about ten miles from town.\" \n\nDillon nodded, \"Thank you, we'll see you around midday\".\n\nRed had gone into the stable and came back leading a tall fast looking black. \"This is Jasper.\" \n\nElizabeth walked toward Red and Jasper but Red warned, \"I wouldn't get too close. Jasper can be as mean as a snake sometimes.\" Red grinned and added, \"I think he likes to show me he's the real boss of the outfit.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, he wouldn't hurt me, would you big boy?\" Elizabeth got a piece of apple from Josh and fed it to Jasper as she stroked his head. \"He's just a big baby that wants some attention.\"\n\nRed chuckled as Jasper pushed his head against Elizabeth, wanting her to continue petting him. \"Jasper don't normally take to strangers,\" Red remarked surprised at his horse.\n\n\"One more thing Dillon,\" Josh said. \"There's talk about road agents causing a ruckus between here and Pueblo. We haven't had any trouble around here but keep alert on the ride out to the ranch.\"\n\nDillon nodded. \"Yeah, we run into a little trouble with them on the trail north of Pueblo.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Danni asked.\n\nHe hesitated for a bit and with a steely look in his eyes said, \"None of my family was hurt. Let's just say that there's not as many bandits as there were.\"\n\nRed saw the look in Dillon's eyes and thought, this is a hard man when he has to be. He's seen the elephant.\n\nThe Kelly's and McCall's waved good bye to their new friends and started back to their ranch.\n\n*******************\n\nThe four men were just below the crest of a hill watching the two families below them on the trail. A fifth man was back in the trees with the horses. \n\n\"There goes that damn Kelly and McCall,\" one of the men said. He was the leader of the band of men.\n\n\"Let's take em now,\" one of the others said.\n\n\"Naw, they're on the lookout now. See the rider, that's Kelly and he's got a rifle lying across the saddle. McCall's the one drivin the wagon and his rifle is right beside him. Even the two women have rifles at their feet. No, we'll wait until tomorrow and ride up to the ranch house pretending to be looking for work. Then we'll surprise them.\"\n\nIn a soft voice the man said to himself, \"that's when I'll make the both of them pay.\"\n\n******************** \n\nThe next morning Dillon and Elizabeth rode toward the CBC. Stopping at the top of the rise by the rock bluff, they dismounted. Dillon remarked, \"Pretty country; I could see us living out here.\"\n\nElizabeth nodded. \"It is pretty and from the looks of it, it's good land for raising cattle and horses.\"\n\nThey gazed over the rolling hills separated by grassy meadows. In the distance they could see a small mountain range. Dillon pointed out the stands of oak and hickory and the cottonwoods lining the creek at the bottom of the rise. \"Lots of good grazing and water with just enough trees to act as a wind break against a Blue Norther,\" Dillon said almost to himself.\n\nHe saw the question in Elizabeth's eyes. \"Up here that's what they call a cold, hard wind blowing from the north; down in Texas we called them a Texas Norther. I've seen the temperature drop from 50 to below zero in an hour or two. Most of the time there's snow blowing in with it. A Norther is tough on stock as well as people.\n\n\"I've never seen one,\" Elizabeth said. \"I mean we got cold wind and snow around Prescott but not like you're talking about.\"\n\n\"The hills, mountains, and big pine trees around Prescott acted as a natural wind break,\" Dillon replied. \"We got some cold and snow but not blizzards. This far north that cold wind can be a problem I bet. Down in Texas sometimes after a Norther blew through, ranchers would find some of their cattle froze to death.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" Elizabeth responded. \"You're just making fun of me now.\"\n\n\"No, really. The cattle were out in the open without a wind break. They'd turn their backs to the storm and that cold wind and snow would just freeze them.\"\n\n\"Well if one of those Norther rolls through here, I'll just have to get up against you real close to keep warm,\" Elizabeth said stepping close to Dillon and hugging him.\n\n\"Sounds like a fine idea, Mrs. Gallagher.\" Dillon hugged her back and gave her a quick kiss. \"We'd better get along or we'll miss lunch.\"\n\nElizabeth giggled and asked, \"Would that be such a bad thing?\" \n\nDillon laughed and mounted Buck. Elizabeth sighed a little and got back on her horse. After they crossed the creek they took the trail going east for the final leg to the ranch. \n\n****************\n\nJosh and Red were on their way down to the barn; they had laid out the work for the hands and sent them on their way earlier that morning. Now they were going to put the horses they had for sale in the corral. Red had explained the connection between Dillon and his brother to Josh and he wanted to offer the best they had when he got there. \n\nBefore they got half way to the corral, the five men that had watched them the previous day rode out from behind the barn. Josh and Red stopped as the men confronted them.\n\n'Howdy boys,\" Josh said. \"Something we can do for you?\" Josh wasn't fooled he knew these men were looking for trouble. They weren't cowhands.\n\nThe man in the middle pushed his hat back off his almost bald head; the chin strap kept it from falling. \"I've been waiting almost six years to get out of prison so I could meet up with you Kelly.\"\n\nHearing the threat in the man's voice, Red slowly slipped the safety strap off the hammer of his pistol. \"Why's that Mister?\" He asked.\n\n\"Been wantin to meet you too McCall. You two killed Jake Stillwell and I'm here to avenge him. My name's Curly Stillwell; Jake was my brother. And when I'm done with you, me and the boys will help ourselves to those pretty wives of yours and anything else we want.\"\n\n\"Looks like they named you right, what with all your hair and everything,\" Red replied with a cold hard smile.\n\nYou boys are in real trouble now, Josh thought. Red's got his dander up and there's no stopping him when he gets in this mood. \"Your brother and three others tried to kill us, Stillwell. We were just defending ourselves,\" Josh explained. He was trying to talk some sense into the man; at the same time slipped the safety strap off his gun.\n\nJosh wasn't afraid to defend himself but he didn't want to kill the men if he didn't have to. As far as Red was concerned the men were already dead; he could read it in Red's eyes. No one threatens his family, Josh said to himself.\n\n\"Stillwell when the shootin starts you'll be the first one I kill,\" Red told the man. It wasn't an idle boast; Red was one of the fastest men in the territory with a hand gun.\n\n***************\n\nDillon and Elizabeth had cleared the last trees coming into the clearing in front of the ranch house and saw the five men facing Josh and Red. Neither group could see the new arrivals as they came in quietly from the side. Dillon in almost a whisper said \"Elizabeth, stay here. I'm going to give our new friends a hand.\"\n\n\"But Dillon, I can........\"\n\n\"No arguments girl. These aren't just some rustlers; they're hired guns. If you're with me I'll be more worried about you than taking care of them. Stay here,\" Dillon ordered again.\n\nElizabeth remembered her mother's advice that sometimes you just have to obey what your man says without argument. She nodded and dismounted, pulling her rifle from the saddle scabbard. \n\nDillon applied knee pressure and Buck walked toward the men. Buck had been trained for war and could move very quietly as need be. He had been about two hundred feet away but as Dillon got closer he could hear the men talking.\n\n\"You take the two on the right Josh; I'll handle Stillwell and the others,\" Red ordered.\n\n\"Leave a couple for me,\" Dillon said drawing his own pistol as he got into range.\n\nTo be continued..."
