        "*Author's note - If you have not read Part I, you are encouraged to do so before proceeding.\n\n*\n\nCindy was relaxing on the couch in her apartment, flipping through the TV channels hoping something remotely interesting was on -- there wasn't. Either re-runs or completely uninteresting programs. She turned the volume down and tossed the remote on the coffee table. Dressed in a pair of sweat pants and a fleecy top and a pair of fluffy bunny slippers she was treating herself to a lazy Saturday. She took a sip of tea and drew her legs up until her knees were almost touching her chest. She wrapped her hands around the warm mug and drew it to her chest. Wrapped up like this, she felt safe and comfortable, almost decadent. There was certainly things that she could be doing, but she promised herself a day of laziness as a reward for a hard week. It seemed like one of those days that you could wrap yourself up in like a blanket and be cuddled by someone. A perfect treat. Only the TV intruded on the peace and that was almost white noise thanks to the low volume. She closed her eyes and concentrated on the spreading warmth from the cup and let her mind drift to nothingness. Almost like meditation, her body started responding to this by relaxing tension that she didn't even realize was there until it's absence was felt. Her mind started picking up various sounds and sensations and played with them like a kitten with a piece of string. The sudden gust of wind, the reflected heat from the couch at her back, the smooth feeling of her teeth against her tongue. She let her eyes open and wander down to her slippers and was examining the furry material when her ears plucked a ribbon of sound out of the air.\n\n\"...Nicola Tesla claimed that he would visualize a new invention completely, down to the most minute details before starting physically working on ...\"\n\nIt was a documentary on the mind. She had no real interest in watching it, but that one line had a remarkable effect on her. A name blazed through her like a meteor falling to earth -- Steve. Her pussy actually clenched as her mind drenched her in snapshots and sound bites from earlier in the week. She felt her nipples start to stiffen as she swam through the torrent of hot steamy memories and lazily let herself float with the current. He had made her come without laying a hand on her, in essence he had fucked her with his mind and skill. She felt another twitch in crotch and became dimly aware that she was starting to get wet, in more than one way. She'd been so distracted that she had tipped the cup she was holding and had spilled warm tea down the front of herself. \n\n\"Shit, and my pants too! Damnit!\" She jumped up and checked the couch. \"No stains, just me -- perfect.\"\n\nShe walked to her bedroom and started stripping off her wet clothes, letting them drop to the floor. She pulled on her terry cloth robe and headed to the bathroom to run a bath. She was planning on having a soak anyway, the time just got moved up a bit -- this was her trying to console herself about having her lazy day interfered with. The water running in the bath was just the thing to relax her mind and the irritation faded away. She stood at the mirror and started putting her hair up when a thought flashed through her. The last time she was wearing this she was knocking at Steve's door, planning to clean his apartment in the nude. She remembered the raw fear that surged through her as she reached up to knock on the door. \"RUN!\" screamed part of her as she heard the metallic sound of the bolt coming free of the striker. The shock of realization that he'd cleaned up so she wouldn't have to, the anger she felt at him for covering her bet, and the feeling of tenderness at him being such a gentleman for the very same thing. The rest of the night was spent going from pleasure to pleasure, she would never have dreamed that someone could do that to another. She felt bad that she fell asleep, passed out from exhaustion to be more correct, before she could reciprocate. She felt even worse that she woke up on his couch, wrapped in a quilt and a note on the coffee table facing her.\n\n\"Last night was incredible, hopefully you enjoyed it as much as I did. I didn't have the heart to wake you before I left. I have to head out of town for 2 days - company emergency. Help yourself to anything in the fridge, I'll call you when I get back.\"\n\nIt seemed like a brush off, but didn't at the same time. The last thing she could really remember was the mind ripping pair of orgasms in the kitchen. She turned off the water and slipped into the liquid warmth.\n\n\"I wonder if he's back yet?\" she mused aloud. Her brain wouldn't stop replaying the images from that night. \n\n\"What he could do with the stuff I have in here.\" Her eyes skipped from object to object. He might put the perfume bottle in her, or the hairbrush handle. No, that was too obvious. She almost pouted as she thought to herself that she wasn't as inventive as he was. She tried to force herself to think about something else but it was no use. She slipped her fingers down belly and dove for her clit. No need to be coy about it, I'm going crazy thinking about this already. She placed a finger on either side of the little nub and drew her hand back almost roughly. Her clit was forced out of it's hood and up against her fingers. She rubbed her fingers against each other, gently rolling her clit between them while her other hand found her breast and started mimicking the motion using her nipple. Her pussy itself was twitching drawing up into her, almost like it was trying to coax something to enter her to complete the sensation. She could feel the trembling waves start to build and her mind started to fog.\n\n\"Oh... soon...\" she said aloud, as if to encourage herself to keep going. Her hips hunched down and released outside of her will, her fingers clamped tightly on their captives and her body finally gave her the release she wanted. This one was more like being slowly submerged in warm oil, starting from the hips and working out. It seems to last forever and at one point she toyed with trying for a second one when the phone rang. Almost in slow motion, she picked up the cordless handset and flicked it on.\n\n\"Hello\"\n\n\"Hey Cindy, it's Steve. Am I interrupting anything?\"\n\n\"No, I just finished something.\" She grinned \"Are you back in town?\"\n\n\"Yea, got in yesterday actually. I've been busy\"\n\n\"I'll bet, have a hard day slaving over a hot microchip did you?\"\n\n\"Cute. Got any plans for supper?\"\n\n\"Not really, what did you have in mind?\"\n\n\"I've got Chinese being delivered in about twenty minutes, enough for two.\"\n\n\"Isn't that a bit presumptuous? What makes you so sure that I'm coming over for dinner?\"\n\n\"It's not like that at all, I can make the leftovers into something tomorrow if you don't want to come over -- no big deal\"\n\n'Damn him anyway' she thought. A man who could sidestep a classic female jab so easily, a rare one indeed, She should sacrifice herself to ensure that his tactics can't spread to other males. She mentally laughed at the little joke.\n\n\"Sure, I didn't have any plans. See you in 15\"\n\nShe jumped out of the tub and started an accelerated version of her morning routine. Thankfully her hair wasn't wet so she could spend more time getting a look together. She picked up the brush and was drawing it through her auburn locks when her eyes met in the mirror. How should she look? Professional, casual... slutty? Casual, with a flirt she decided. Clothes, what to wear. Several changes and one good swearing jag later she was ready to go. A final inspection in the full length mirror by the door she was pleased. Boot cut jeans, a black camisole with a white waist jacket, her hair looking soft but playful and her make-up just right. Shoes were a black strap sandal with a rhinestone buckle to complete the look. \n\nShe headed down the hall to Steve's apartment and raised her hand to knock on the door when her mind started flashing images and sensations back to her from what happened the last time she knocked here. Two strong contractions in her pussy reminded her that this way lead to wonderful feelings, her heart started pounding in a response to the adrenaline dumped into her system and seemed to be trying to escape itself. How could she face him, the things she let him do that night, but of the things he did to her that night...\n\nThe door opened with her frozen in mid-knock.\n\n\"Hey, I thought I heard you coming down the hall, come on in and get comfortable. The food's on the coffee table.\"\n\nShe shook her head slightly to break the dazed sensations from her mind. Mustering all her poise and composure, she drifted into the room.\n\nPolite conversation, chopsticks and cardboard boxes were the next hour. Cindy was having a hard time staying focused. She was sitting on the very couch that had been used that night, the kitchen in the corner of her eye, the linen closet. A week ago if someone told her that a towel could make her go wet she would have thought they were crazy. Hold it together girl, he doesn't need to know how much of an effect he had . WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?!\n\n\"Pardon, could you say that again\"\n\n\"I built a new toy, if you're interested in playing again some time. The parts I need for the mixer will be more that a week, so I thought I'd try to make something else. I am your slave for the week remember?\"\n\nShe blushed. If there is is such a thing, she blushed hard. Head to toe blushing she thought, that's another one that no other man has got me to do.\n\n\"I'll understand if you don't want to, things went really far and fast last time. I'm moving too fast -- this is just too weird right?\"\n\n\"Well, as far as my relationships go, yes. Kinky and fast moving.\"\n\n\"Yea, better if we slow down. You know I wasn't even going to bring up the water bug. I don't know what made me bring it up. I really want us to try to be more than friends, but I can't stop thinking about the other night\"\n\n\"Water bug?\" Just the knowledge that the night of passion she had at his hands was special to him as well melted her even more.\n\n\"The toy I built for you.\"\n\n\"Sex toy I'll assume\"\n\n\"Well, that was the impression I got from you about the mixer you wanted me to rework.\"\n\n\"True, I can't blame you there\"\n\n\"Look, I'm not pushing anything. I understand if this is too weird for you. I shouldn't have brought it up\"\n\n\"I didn't say that, as a mater of fact, I haven't said no, stop, slow down or anything else. That's your mind making the arguments for me. Here's what I see. You exposed a part of yourself to me that you keep locked up and hidden from everybody -- right?\"\n\n\"That depends on what part you mean\"\n\n\"The desire to experiment on a woman for mutual pleasure, using unconventional means to archive that goal.\"\n\n\"OK, when you put it like that, yes.\"\n\n\"You showed me that you are kinky, something else you don't normally share.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I'd say kinky\"\n\n\"Machines, towels, toothbrushes, vegetables and kitchen tools,\"\n\n\"Fine, I'm kinkier than a hairpin\"\n\n\"You say it like it's a bad thing. Actually you're looking at it backwards\"\n\n\"Huh, how do you figure that?\"\n\n\"Well, look at it like this. Most guys just want a fuck, the girl's pleasure is either secondary or not a consideration. You on the other hand, have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to figure out how to please a woman. Your hacker skills however are tailored for as you put it -- hardware. You just crossed hacking and fucking and there you go. A considerate pervert!\"\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\n\"Just joking\" She replayed what she had just said to Steve and realized that she was dealing with a very delicate moment. She knew he didn't have many friends and she remembered that it took her weeks to get him to say more than two words to her. He was an introvert that she caught in an uncontrolled moment of passion.\n\n\"Steve, show me what you built for me. I'm not promising I'll use it, but it's so sweet that you put all this work into it and I want to see what you made for me.\"\n\n\"OK, it's in the bathroom. I was doing some fine turning earlier\"\n\nShe let him lead her to his creation. She wasn't really sure what it should look like, but as soon as they stepped into the bathroom she realized that there would have been no point in trying to guess.\n\nIt stood in the tub like an insect waiting for it's prey. An X shaped front formed from two spread feet and a pair of antenna with a small \"head\" between them. The flattened football shaped body extended from the head and towards the back wall while a single leg protruded back and terminated with a single suction cup stuck to the wall. A proboscis snaked away from where a mouth would be and was hooked to the spout of the tub. The entire thing was painted a bright blue. As she studied it she thought it looked better than a lot of modern art she had seen. The name Water bug seemed appropriate. \n\n\"So what do you think\" he ventured.\n\n\"It looks... interesting. What does it do?\" She countered\n\n\"To be crass,\" he said, with a bit of forced bravado \"you.\"\n\n\"Funny. Seriously though, what does it do\"\n\n\"I'm not saying.\" The set of his jaw told her he wasn't joking. \"If you want to try, fine. I'm not explaining how it works until I get your personal feedback on how it felt\"\n\n\"I see. And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"I'm not making a demand, you have nothing to refuse. I'll dismantle it and you'll never hear me mention it again\"\n\n'Damn him anyway' she thought.\n\n\"I didn't say I wasn't interested. I just want to know what I'm getting into\"\n\n\"Getting into?\"\n\n\"I mean might be getting into, if I was, I mean, if, ah hell\" She blushed and admitted to herself that she wanted to know what this machine could do as badly as he wanted her to try it.\n\n\"So you wanna ride?\" he said with a kid kid style grin.\n\n\"All right dammit, what do I have to do?\"\n\n\"As little clothes as possible. This should work best with bare skin, but it might get you to come in your underwear\"\n\n\"Nah, you've seen me at my best before\" she winked and started stripping. Her back was to him, but she could feel his gaze burning across her back and ass as she stripped. 'I really must do something for him this time' She mused.\n\nShe turned around in a classic Venus on the half shell pose and shot him her best innocent look.\n\n\"What do I do now Steve?\"\n\n\"Um, let me run the water to prime the system and make sure it's at a good temperature\" He dove for the controls and taps and turned his back to her. Not before she noticed a hint of a blush and flush of excitement on his face. It was that first night again. Like playing Truth or Dare as kids, you never knew when someone would chicken out or if they knew something about you that you thought only you knew.\n\n\"OK, put your wrist in the water and tell me how it feels\" \n\n\"Nice, almost body temperature.\"\n\n\"Let me add a bit more cold water then. Ready?\"\n\n\"I doubt it, but what the hell. What do I do?\"\n\n\"Climb on like it was a horse, I'll cover the rest as we go.\"\n\nCindy stepped into the tub and studied the creation before her. The saddle had an oval shaped opening to the front and a smaller round nub further back. At the front of the saddle was a panel with a bunch of chrome t-handles and one big red handle labelled 'STOP'. She put one hand on the closest 'antenna' to steady herself and swung her leg over its back. She looked up at the antennas and saw two small brass nozzles pointed at her. 'What have I gotten myself into this time' she thought.\n\n\"Looks like I got the hight right. Comfortable?\"\n\n\"Yea, so what now?\"\n\n\"The lever marked STOP, push it towards me until it's level with the panel. If you need to stop at any time, this halts everything in one pull.\" She pushed the lever, but nothing happened. He saw her brows furrow and started to explain.\n\n\"Its like a circuit breaker, you just made power available to the system, but you haven't directed it yet\"\n\n\"Power? There's electricity in here?! You're gonna kill me!\"\n\n\"No, there is no electricity. The power comes from water pressure -- a pure hydraulic system\"\n\n\"Ok, so it's safe\"\n\n\"Remember what I told you last time -- safety then hacking\"\n\n\"I feel better, so what next?\"\n\n\"On the panel in front you've got T-handles arranged in a 'Y' pattern, turn the one in the centre a bit to the right.\"\n\nCindy grasped the smooth metal and twisted. If the saddle wasn't in the way she probably would have scampered away from the machine. Warm water flooded her crotch and then stabilized into gentle stream of water tunnelling up between her labia, seeming seeking her clit. She wiggled her hips a bit and without Steve knowing what she was up to she managed to spread her lips enough to allow the water better access to her.\n\n\"Mmm... that's nice. What a lovely sensation you have here.\"\n\n\"Give the handle a bit more of a turn.\" Cindy did as he asked and she was pleased to see that the pressure increased as did the water flow. Suddenly the water stopped, disappointment rose as she thought that something had gone wrong when the flow shot back up, and stopped, and then started again. The pattern became regular at about a second on, half second off and she realized that this was no mistake. He had somehow managed to make a water based vibrator. A dreamy smile spread across her face.\n\n\"I thought you might like that. It'll go faster and harder as you turn the knob. It's able to do about 500 pulses a minute at full strength.\"\n\n\"Oooh, that sounds like a bit much but it's good to know that it's mnnn flexible. God this feels soo good. I don't know if I've ever felt anything like this before\"\n\n\"Ready for more?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd hate to leave all these features untested\" she said with a dreamy smile.\n\n\"The bottom handle, give it a half turn\"\n\nShe did as he instructed, but didn't notice any change. After about 5 seconds of nothing, she noticed something rising up from the saddle and was now pressing against her. Lubricated by the water from the jet at her clit, it spread her lips and relentlessly tunnelled inside her. Slowly, oh so slowly it continued its burrowing. It must have been a full 15 seconds before she felt it start to retreat back down. It felt soft and warm inside her but at the same time rigid. Her clit was starting to throb in a very happy response to it's water drumming and this new addition was making her twitch in a very pleasurable fashion. \n\n\"From the look on your face, I'll assume that works. Turn the handle to \u00be \" Steve's voice was almost trembling.\n\n\"Oh fuck this feels so luxurious -- I could do this all day. A slow lover.\" She giggled and turned the handle.\n\nHer pussy registered the change by way of clench and an almost electric wave of sensations. The mechanical cock started moving faster and was almost pulsing almost twisting inside her.\n\n\"Oh Steve, what is this -- what are you doing to me?\"\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! Oh so much. But what is it doing to me?\"\n\n\"Hopefully, making you very happy\"\n\n\"Oh, ummm, yes, but , mmm, how?\"\n\n\"I'll explain later, Top handles to \u00bd\"\n\nShe didn't realize it until he said it, but she had been gripping the sides of the panel quite fiercely. Without really thinking about what these would do she turned them as he commanded and saw water come streaming out of the antennas of aimed in the vicinity of her breasts.\n\n\"You can adjust the aim by moving the nozzles, I'll assume I don't need to tell you where to aim them\"\n\n\"Duh\" She laughed and adjusted the streams until the water was aimed directly at her nipples. The sensations were intoxicating. Her clit was being drummed on, her pussy was being filled with a pulsing cock, and now her tits were being pounded with thousands of tiny water droplets. She was going to come from this and it wasn't going to take long either. Knowing that Steve was standing there watching her squirm on his machine made it a thousand times hotter than it could have been and all the sensations were piling up on her.",
        "\"So that's it. You can adjust it you like. You've got all the controls active now.\"\n\nCindy nodded and reached out for the control panel. Almost frantically, she twisted handle after handle, the top two were maxed out, followed quickly by the one at the bottom. The machine responded, the drops that were driving into her nipples turned harder while the cock started pounding into her and was now almost buzzing instead of pulsing. Her hand hovered over the final handle for a moment and then shot down and wrenched it all the way to the right. The water drumming at her clit increased in power and speed. Her hands left the panel, shot to the antennas and locked there as if magnets had drawn them. She felt the orgasm running her down like an avalanche, so fast, so quick. Her head snapped back like a whip and her eyes closed so hard that she felt a tear escape. Her back arched and her toes curled as if to gain a better grip on the floor of the tub. She was dimly aware that she was chanting \"OhgodOhgod\" but wasn't really able to do anything about it. Wave after wave tore through Cindy -- it seemed for a while it wouldn't stop. This devilish machine would somehow make her come forever. Finally it started to ebb enough for her to remember the STOP lever. She wrenched her left hand free and yanked the lever to stop the machine. The sensations stopped so abruptly it was almost a shock. She slumped over the panel and let her breathing start returning to normal. Her body was still twitching occasionally as aftershocks of pleasure bolted though her. \n\n\"So, are we calling this one OK?\" Steve grinned.\n\n\"OK? Jesus, if it could cook I'd marry it on the spot!\" Cindy grinned. A satisfied smile spread across her face as her body started winding down. She felt like she needed sleep, but there was no way Steve would be denied again. She owed him several good solid fuckings already and she wasn't about to have the tally climb any higher.\n\n\"I'll go get you a towel, you're gonna get cold. Be right back.\" Steve headed for the linen closet.\n\nCindy was about to slide off the back of the machine when the realization dawned on her. The thing still had her impaled on its dick. It was at full extension and there was no way she could get free until it was retracted.\n\n\"Steve\" she called out in a playful tone \"your little creation doesn't want to let me go. Tell me you trained it to lie down.\"\n\nSteve came back in with a concerned look on his face until he realized what was going on. \n\n\"Damn, I hadn't thought of that. No problem.\" He reached around and twisted all the handles to their original position. He then snapped the STOP handle down and twisted the bottom handle about \u00bd way. She felt the jump inside the machine as it started to come back to life. Slowly the phallus retreated back to it's original position. She turned off the machine and swung a trembling leg over the saddle and stepped out of the tub.\n\nSteve came up behind her and draped a towel around her shoulders. Almost an embrace she thought, and yet, he actually hasn't touched me. She took the ends of the towel from him and tucked them down the top of the towel to hold it in place.\n\n\"Steve, can we go sit in the living room for a bit?\"\n\n\"Sure, can I get you something to drink? Wine, water?\"\n\n\"I've had enough water for the moment.\" She smiled \"I don't suppose you've got any Brandy?\"\n\n\"I do actually. It's not a great one, but it's not bad\"\n\nShe arranged herself on the couch and fussed with her hair a bit while waiting for him to come back.\n\nHe slipped a warmed brandy snifter in her hand and sat on the opposite couch.\n\n\"So, tell me about the little invention of yours in there.\"\n\n\"What did you want to know?\"\n\n\"It doesn't use electricity, but it moves like nothing I've ever see. How does it work?\"\n\n\"Well, the antenna nozzles are just straightforward garden hose nozzles on goose necks. The front one is a sprinkler head with a little propeller to one side. As the pressure increases it starts spinning. It interrupts the water briefly giving it the pulsing effect. The higher the pressure, the faster it spins.\"\n\n\"And it feels fantastic\" She squirmed slightly as she recalled the sensation \"what about the other part?\"\n\n\"Ah, that was a bit of a challenge. You've seen lawn sprinklers that slowly wave a fan of water back and forth?\" Cindy nodded \"well, inside that is a little waterwheel and a set of gears. With a bit of work I cut one of those apart and hooked it up to a vertical slider. All I had to do then was stick a dildo on it and it was ready.\"\n\n\"But that's not what you had hooked up. That didn't look or feel like any dildo or vibe I've ever heard of.\"\n\n\"You noticed, cool.\" Steve looked almost smug. \"The one you were enjoying was a prototype I've been working on today. It's a nylon plastic mesh tube inside a thin rubber sleeve. Inside is a little rod with holes drilled in at an angle. That rod goes down to the outflow of the gearing so when there is enough water pressure it starts spinning like the spray arm in a dishwasher. That sprays water inside the sleeve making it hopefully feel like something good.\"\n\n\"Hah, good? You have no idea how that felt. I couldn't describe it if I had a week to try. Fucking awesome comes to mind though\" \n\n\"I'm really glad it worked and that you like it. It means a lot to me.\"\n\n\"So how the hell do you come up with this stuff. You can't be working out of a book. Do you walk through the gardening centre and think, Gee, that'd look good stuffed up somebody's snatch\" She giggled into her snifter and flashed a devious look at him.\n\n\"Well, no, yes, kind of. It's hard to explain.\"\n\n\"Try\"\n\n\"When I go to a store, I kind of inventory the stuff that is there. When I get an idea for something I'll go back through that inventory and figure out what I can use off the shelf. If I can't find it, I'll make it.\"\n\n\"But the ideas themselves, how did you come up with that little delight in there?\" She jerked her thumb over her shoulder, pointing at the bathroom\n\n\"I'd be lying if I told you I completely understood the process. I think my mind will toy with an idea outside of my normal thoughts and when it decides that it's got something it flashes it to me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, you're going to have to explain that. Flashes?\"\n\n\"Hmm... I'm not sure I can. You know the phrase 'like a bolt out of the blue' it's kind of like that. Or trying to read a book by the light from lightning flashes. If it's a simple idea it's easy to get in one bolt. something like the water bug took several, and the other night was a continuous storm.\"\n\n\"I kind of get it. But you're saying that you don't actively invent these things.\"\n\n\"Well, of course it's all me. The flashes show me rough plans or basic concepts. I have to then actively work on them to bring them into the real world.\"\n\n\"So in essence I was riding the lightning.\" That statement sent a thrill through her. He was just about ready to be trapped.\n\n\"I... well...\" Steve looked like she had slapped him. He hadn't thought of it like this.\n\n\"Fucking me with your mind.\"\n\n\"...ah ...I\"\n\n\"You don't spring effort like this for just anybody -- do you?\"\n\nSpeechless and almost frozen in place - Steve just blinked. She had him.\n\n\"In fact, I'm willing to bet that I'm the only person that has ever been lucky enough to have 'ridden the lightning'. Am I right?\"\n\nSteve nodded, almost in a trace.\n\n\"Wouldn't you say that this is something that you do for someone you care deeply about. This is a pretty deep part of your soul you've shared with me.\"\n\nAgain he nodded.\n\nShe put down her glass and stood up in front of him.\n\n\"Don't think for one minute that I haven't wanted this too. I screwed up my computer deliberately more times than I can count to get you to come over. But you'd never make a move. Don't you like girls?\"\n\nHe lifted his head and looked into her eyes. The fiery gaze that looked down from her seemed to be cutting right through him.\n\n\"Y..yes of course I do.\"\n\nCindy flipped the corners of the towel out and let it drop to the floor. Steve's gaze fell to the floor.\n\n\"Don't you like me?\"\n\n\"Yes, but...\"\n\n\"But nothing. Look at me.\"\n\nHis eyes lifted to hers again.\n\n\"Steve, I'm going to fuck you. Unless you don't want me.\"\n\n\"I want you to\" he said quietly.\n\n\"What's wrong, don't you like me?\"\n\n\"It's not that, I just don't want things to change. I've found someone who is accepting of my kinks for lack of a better term. I don't want to lose that, even if it means our relationship doesn't advance beyond this point.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see where this takes us. Now touch me.\"\n\nSteve reached out to her and placed his hands on her hips, she reached down and started running her fingers through his hair. She took a step closer to him and his hands drifted down the sides of her thighs and back up, his palms flattened and slid to the small of her back. His lips gently kissed her stomach and he started moving kiss by kiss to her hip. \n\n'Damn, he's thoughtful.' most men dive right for the prize when offered its like this. She forced herself to remember that this was supposed to be for him, not her. She lowered herself so that she was sitting on his outstretched legs and pulled his mouth to her left breast. He immediately took her hard nipple between his lips and started drawing his tongue across it in slow full length licks. His other hand moved from her back to her hip and finally to her pussy. He used the back of his hand to stroke her gently at first but she ground down on his hand to let him know that gentle and slow was not the order of the day. Taking her cue, he turned his palm up and slid two fingers between her lips and started stroking the area around her clit -- being careful to avoid the little nub itself. She reached down and undid his belt and opened his pants. Stepping back and kneeling down she helped him out of the rest of his clothes. She placed her hands on his knees and look at his face.\n\n\"So, how bad did you want me that first night?\"\n\n\"Really bad.\"\n\nHer hands moved slowly up his thighs.\n\n\"Why didn't you try to get somewhere that night\"\n\n\"The bet was one reason, and the fact that you passed out on the couch from exhaustion would be the other. It would have been pretty scummy to try to do anything.\"\n\nHer hands reached the base of his cock, she gently laced her fingers together encircling it as if to contain it. His eyes closed at her touch and a slight moan escaped from him.\n\n\"True, but I'm not tired now.\" With a smile she turned her head slightly and brought her face down to the head of his cock. She pursed her lips and placed a tight kiss on the tip. He moaned as she pushed her still pursed lips down to meet her fingers. Her tightened mouth made for an incredible sensation and this was augmented by slowly swirling her tongue around the head and drumming her fingertips on the shaft. Pent up and extremely turned on by her session on the water bug he realized that he was getting close to coming.\n\n'Too fast, I've never come this fast' he thought.\n\n\"I'm close, oh Cindy, I'm close\" he warned through gasps.\n\n'Gotcha now' Cindy thought to herself. Her hands suddenly dropped to his thighs and she slid the full length of his cock into her mouth. She felt the tip touch the back of her throat, she swallowed hard twice knowing that the sensations from her tongue and throat would tip him over the edge. Sure enough she felt the first spasm, quickly she pulled back and placed her hand over his head and felt the first jet of cum blast into her waiting palm. Now that she had sufficient lubrication, she quickly shifted her hand so that she had her fingers wrapped around the head of his cock and her thumb blocked the next jet from escaping. Steve's hips did the rest of the work. Now that his body felt something tight and wet at the tip of his cock, his hips bucked to drive further into the target. Jet after jet flooded Cindy's hands, cum was now flowing out between her fingers, making his cock slippery and gooey. She continued to stroke and caress him, spreading his cum over him and revelling in the power her held as she watched him lose all control under her ministrations. Finally he slowed and collapsed back to the couch. Cindy slid her cum soaked hand down his shaft, rested the heel of her palm at the base of the shaft and started giving gentle rhythmic squeezes to mimic a twitching pussy.\n\n\"That... was... incredible!\" He gasped.\n\n\"Glad you liked it. Let me get a towel and clean up before we mess up your couch\" She let her grip relax and slid her fingers gentle off his shaft. \n\n\"I can do that.\" He said\n\n\"Shut up and lie there. Let me do the work for a change will ya!\" She grabbed a towel from the hanger in the bathroom and was about to head back when she had an idea.\n\nSteve was still coming out of the post orgasm glow when she came back and knelt beside him. \n\n\"Let me get this, I made the mess anyway\" she said with a wink. His eyes bolted open and then relaxed as he realized what she had done. He was expecting a terry cloth towel, what he got was a warm moist sensation gently moving over him.\n\n\"Clever.\" He said with a smile.\n\n\"Someone showed me that a warm wet towel would feel better than a dry rough one.\"\n\n\"Wonder who that was.\" He moaned softly and his head dropped back and he closed his eyes as she finished wiping him off. She stood up and headed back to the bathroom to hang up the damp towel. The water bug was still sitting in the tub, almost looking at her like a pet that wanted attention. She tossed the towel over the antenna, thinking that it was kind of like putting a blanket over a birdcage. Folding her arms across her chest she studied the machine. Lawn sprinklers and pipe turned sex toy, who would have believed it. Shaking her head to bring herself back to the present and headed back to Steve.\n\n\"So, you think you've got one more left in you? I'd really like to be fucked by a human for a change.\" Cindy almost didn't believe that was her that said that, so raw and aggressive -- not like her at all.\n\n\"I... but... sure!\" Steve passed from surprise to confusion to excitement. His body however suffered none of the confusion as his cock started to rise almost as soon as Cindy had finished her question.\n\n\"Excellent. Why don't you lie down on the floor and let me drive?\" She felt a flush of excitement run through her body. She was never this aggressive, but she was starting to enjoy the feeling of power it gave her. She decided that she was going to explore this tonight, Steve seemed to be responding to it as well.\n\nShe stood over his face and looked down at him.\n\n\"Do you like the view?\"\n\n\"Very much\"\n\n\"Would you like a closer look?\"\n\n\"Absolutely\"\n\nShe dropped to her knees and straddled his face. His breath on her thighs was enough to make her pussy twitch, but she planned for more action than that.\n\n\"Do you like that?\" She asked\n\nHe didn't answer her, but she felt his fingertips on her labia. Gently he opened her and the cool air washed over her.\n\n\"Ohh... put a finger inside me Steve.\" She blushed as she said this.\n\nHe complied eagerly, her soft flesh parted and his finger tunneled inside. He could feel her vagina clenching and trying to draw his finger deeper inside her. Almost without thinking about it, his other hand went to the small of her back and he pulled her down to his mouth. As she sank down she moaned in anticipation, slowly she maneuvered so that she was where they needed her to be. Steve drew a deep breath and his brain surged at the smell of her wet pussy. A musky sent with a floral undertone, he let his tongue snake up between her flesh to her clit and started slowly circling it. Cindy responded to this by moaning softly and clenching his finger more intensely. His tongue squirmed and dove and circled and licked and spooned her pussy while his finger alternated between pistoning in and out and firmly circling her g-spot until she thought she was going to cum right then, but she had other plans. She slowly moved back up on her knees and moved down his chest. Sensing what she was doing, he slipped his finger from her. She reached down between her legs and guided him to her entrance. She lingered there for a moment, letting him feel her hot lips sliding around his head. Without warning she dropped and let her pussy envelope his total length. They both moaned with pleasure. She lifted her hips up and back down, the hard cock filling her and retreating. Steve started pushing his hips up to match her descent, adding to the speed and pressure. His hands found her nipples and started gentle twisting and pinching as her moans coaxed him to continue. She leaned forward slightly and placed one hand on the edge of the nearest couch for support while her other sought her clit. Total abandon took them. Her moves were matched by his. His cock flexed as she hit bottom, she clenched to answer, he thrust up to get further inside her, she ground down to let him tunnel deeper. Her hips started to grind each time she bottomed out a stroke, his heels and shoulders were soon the only parts of him left on the floor -- his back was arched like a bow drawn to fire. She felt it before he said it, the tell tail twitch of impending ejaculation. \n\n\"Are you able to cum?\" He gasped.\n\n\"No, but cum for me.\" And to make sure that he really didn't have a choice she clenched hard and ground down on the next down stroke. She felt his body start to go rigid and his hands dropped to her hips, locking her down to him so she couldn't rise back up. The hot jet of his cum made her pussy slicker than it had already been, the second jet caused her to realize that she just might be able to cum, if he could just keep this up a bit longer. Her fingers worked frantically to get the build-up to the breaking point, his cum was now drooling out of her and lubricating her fingertips. Not like her own juices, his was thinner and more slippery, another jet lashed at her cervix and that was all she needed. Wracked with an onslaught of sensation and passion they were both locked and frozen, silent and joined together in a single mind numbing shared experience. Cindy shuddering as her fingers moved to get all they could from her, Steve trying to pull more of himself into her and filling her with his cum at the same time. Finally the twinned orgasms receded, Steve collapsed to the floor, Cindy fell on top of him. Both of them heaving to catch their breath. Steve was softening inside her and she could feel him trickling out of her as he pulled out.\n\n\"Holy hell, I have never felt anything that powerful.\" Steve moaned.\n\n\"What can I say, a girl's gotta have some tricks.\" She grinned as she rolled off his chest and onto the floor beside him. \"I've got to have some way of competing with that wonderful mind of yours.\"\n\n\"Mmm.. so it's strictly competitive is it?\"\n\n\"I hadn't planned on it. But thanks for reminding me, you still owe me.\"\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"You are still my slave remember? Are you going to have my mixer done before the end of your week of servitude?\" She asked with a dreamy giggle in her voice.\n\n\"What if I don't\" He challenged.\n\n\"Well, I guess you'll remain at my beck and call until it's done.\" She parried.\n\n\"Months\" he mumbled as he snuggled his face to her breast \"it could take months.\" "
