        "I love hotels. Not for their comfort or cuisine but their ability to lower people's inhibitions. There's something about a hotel room that's intensely magical; step inside and you become just one of hundreds of strangers in the building, thrown together by circumstance. Families or couples on holiday, business people on stopovers, honeymooners and busloads of tourists make up small-knit groups of strangers that mill about in the lobby and gradually disperse to their personal, rented spaces for the night. And there's plenty of opportunity to enjoy the relative anonymity that affords. Moreso, it seems, in the French capital.\n\nParis in the summer is gorgeous: beautiful people, delicious food, stunning architecture, amazing weather, and the unwritten promise of sex when the sun goes down. Maybe it's something in the air. The city somehow exudes sexiness in spite of the commuters and hustle of metropolitan life. It has an electrically charged atmosphere that's simply missing from any other place in the world.\n\nIt was within this potent mix of elements I found myself for a few days this summer. The conference itself was on the dull side but, in its defence, web content symposiums aren't engineered to be hotbeds of excitement. For my sins -- or perhaps as a reflection of the economic climate -- the company had put me in accommodation on the outskirts of the city. A nondescript, high rise chain hotel devoid of any flair, with a breakfast to match. But that didn't bother me one iota. Cheap hotels are the same as expensive hotels when it comes to construction: the designers always skimp on the material between bedroom walls, which suits me perfectly. Because I like to listen.\n\nI'd washed the grime of the day from my body -- a combination of the jostling Metro commuters, the barrage of information from over- confident businessmen and the clamminess of being stuck in a suit in 30-degree heat. My choice of white cotton blouse, a close- fitting mid-thigh skirt, heels and no stockings had offered little respite from the closeness of the day and I was glad to peel everything off, letting the air conditioning tickle my damp skin before heading for the shower. I allowed the air con to dry me afterwards too, as I admired my body in the full-length mirror by the desk.\n\nTurning this way and that I concluded there were worse bodies out there. Perhaps I was a few pounds the wrong side of a supermodel, but I liked the way I curved from calves to shoulders where my wet hair pooled. The occasional rivulet of water trickled down my back, hugging my smooth contours until either the air conditioning evaporated it or it splashed to the floor. I smiled at myself. The anorexic, angular frames of the catwalk minority were only suitable as expensive, wiry clothes racks: I gave garments context and shape.\n\nThe curtains were open on purpose. I was on the 9th floor facing the edge of another grey, concrete block hotel the other side of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique and if anyone cared to look across, all they'd see would be a voluptuous, naked stranger in a hotel room with a glass of ros\u00e9 in her hand watching the lights of the city beginning to flicker on. I let my mind wander to what might occur later in the rooms opposite me. Men and women locked in carnal lust, hot bodies sliding against one another, hands gliding over smooth skin, pulses racing, minds acting out fantasies that wouldn't feel quite the same at home. I shivered and brushed my fingers over my hips and belly, lost in thought.\n\nAs night drew closer and the air conditioning began to raise goose bumps on my skin I slid into a pair of tight cotton boy-shorts and closed the curtains. Peeling back the crisp bed sheets I climbed in, poured myself another glass of wine and settled into the plump pillow with the TV remote.\n\nFrench TV was as crap as I recalled; a curious mix of incomprehensible game shows, dubbed cop dramas and intensely acted national films, invariably starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu. I set the volume low and chose an episode of CSI; more to be entertained by the dubbing than the action itself; after all, the TV was only a distraction until what I hoped was some uninhibited lovemaking from my hotel neighbours.\n\nDoors banged periodically in the corridor, the muted ping of the elevator distributed patrons throughout the building, and the odd drunkenly loud conversation passed my door.\n\nThe clock on the TV informed me it was approaching what I termed the \"sweet spot\": 10pm. For some reason, ten o'clock usually marked the start of nocturnal activity in hotels. I'm guilty myself of being its slave on occasion; lazing in a white king size bed with my boyfriend, running my hands up his thighs and over his toned torso, and as ten pm rolls around like some kind of wanton trigger I'll first take him in my mouth to stiffen him fully, then slide my body up his, place a wet kiss on his lips and ride him noisily until we come together.\n\nBut tonight I was alone with my thoughts. I traced the contours of my midriff up to my breasts and back again, feeling the energy coursing beneath my skin. My hand brushed the smooth material of my underwear, then travelled down my shapely thigh and back across to my centre. I waited, hand poised just an inch above my mons and could feel the heat radiating from within. I stopped myself going further, returning my hand to the bed. Plenty of time for that later.\n\nThe usual noise that alerts me to activity the other side of the wall is a door slamming nearby, muffled voices that often turn to giggling and eventually lead to the unmistakable, rhythmical groan of bed springs. I'll then assume a position near the wall and listen as the action heats up. Depending on the nature of the neighbours and the degree of inhibition the hotel environment swallows will determine if I'm treated to soft moans of passion or a full orchestra of human emotion. I'd witnessed both ends of that spectrum and a lot besides, during my time as an audio voyeur.\n\nAlthough my preference is couples, they are by no means the only entertainment. Single women can be surprisingly horny when left to their own devices and, though rare, I've been party to a pair of racy lesbians enjoying each other's delights. In general, I find solo men and gays tedious to listen to; with them it tends to be all about the end product not the journey.\n\nLost in my thoughts of past experiences I was caught off guard -- though almost on cue at a little after ten -- by the squeak of the internal door in the next room and the compressing and uncompressing of tired bed springs as someone clambered into bed. I quickly shut off the TV and listened.\n\nNothing.\n\nMaybe I'd imagined it. Maybe it was from the room above and the acoustics in the sparsely decorated room were playing tricks on me. Then some more creaks of a bed. There was definitely activity next door. I stole from under the covers, dragged the desk chair to the wall and sat. Leaning into the wall I pressed my ear to its surface and adjusted the angle to hear more clearly. It's not the most comfortable position in the world but it works.\n\nI waited for more sounds but there were none that I could discern. Usually voices would give the game away or the sound of a bath running, the sound of pee trickling into the toilet, or a flush. So far nothing. I decided it must be a commuter or someone too tired to play and, disappointed, was about to give up when I heard what I thought was a sigh. It was barely perceptible, but it certainly sounded like one. Sometimes quiet sounds can be reflections of my own breathing as I strain to hear what's on the other side. I had to be sure.\n\nI grabbed the remaining tumbler from the desk -- luckily the hotel wasn't so cheap it used plastic cups -- and inverted it so the mouth was against the wall. It made a crude but very effective amplifier as I pressed my ear to its base and wiggled my head a little to achieve the best sound transfer.\n\nAnd there it was again; louder this time. A definite female exhalation followed by some shifting of the bed springs. Jackpot! A possible solo woman with some sexual energy to burn. I began to feel the tingle of excitement surge through my body as I pictured her lying on the bed, hand rubbing her warm pussy, arching her back every few strokes to match the lewd thoughts in her head. I had no idea if she was fifteen or fifty, her ethnicity or whether she was wearing any clothing. But it didn't matter; that simply added to the thrill.\n\nOne problem with using the upturned glass trick is that it amplifies not only the desired sounds but also those of the surrounding environment. The background hum of the traffic around the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique was interwoven with the odd shriek of laughter from a room in another part of the building. Some TV chatter, probably from the room above or below mine, was also mixed into the signal. It took a little repositioning of the glass and my ear to achieve the optimum sound, especially given that the woman was being rather discreet.\n\nAs I listened, one thing became clear about the woman: she liked to take her sweet time. Long bouts of silence -- minutes at a time -- were punctuated with bursts of activity as her breathing deepened, the bed springs moaned five or six times in succession as she tensed and untensed, then she'd sigh a little and go quiet. I was straining to hear any signs of movement during the gaps, trying to complete the picture in my head of her whereabouts in the room, her orientation and what she might be thinking. I thought I caught the odd muttered word but was unable to tell what she said.\n\nA car roared past the hotel nine storeys below; my glass dutifully relayed the sound to my ear, momentarily drowning out the far quieter actions of my neighbour. As the car disappeared into the distance, the bed springs creaked again once, twice, three times, and a sigh caught in the mystery woman's throat. The rustle of bed sheets met my ear; perhaps she was turning over. The next few gentle moans were definitely muffled. I pictured her on her knees, naked backside upturned, face buried in the deep pillow, a sheer nightie pooling at her mid-back snagged beneath her ample bosoms.\n\nThe sound of wetness reached me; probably her finger sliding back and forth past her slick labia, reaching for her insides and then gliding out again, shiny with her juices. Someone chose that moment to flush a toilet a few rooms away. Luckily for me it had a short flush cycle and I was soon back with my woman next door. The wet sounds continued for a short while longer as her finger slid in and out of her hot pussy. Occasionally I would hear a muted gasp as her pillow absorbed the majority of her excitement.\n\nI became aware of my hand caressing my own breast; I hadn't realised I'd begun rhythmically squeezing the flesh in time with the woman's finger movements. One hand held the glass firmly in place against the wall while the other alternated between massaging my boobs and tweaking my nipples, perched at the end of my proud 36Cs. The tips were hard nubs, engorged red in the dim light from the bedside lamp. I caught myself breathing hard once or twice and wondered if she could hear me. Would it turn her on knowing I was becoming excited listening to her masturbating? I hoped so.\n\nThe internal door to her bathroom squeaking brought me back from my reverie. She must have climbed off the bed. Had I missed her orgasm? I cursed myself for becoming too caught up in my own pleasure to have missed her moment of rapture. Echoing through the wall space I heard the lid of her toilet seat come to rest against the porcelain. Then silence for thirty seconds or so. My breathing was a little laboured and I could hear the blood rushing between the glass and my ear as I strained to hear any sounds from her bathroom. The tinkle of two tiny bursts of pee hitting the bowl made me smile. She must have needed to go mid session -- I guessed she hadn't finished after all.\n\nI rearranged my position slightly to relieve the cramp in my hand clutching the glass. The springs complained as she climbed back onto the queen size bed. Her room would be an exact mirror image of mine because hotels were like that; arranged in pairs all the way down the corridor. Her bed would thus be directly facing the upturned end of my glass; perfect for capturing any further playtime.\n\nElsewhere in the building the party in the room was ramping up. Boisterous yells and laughter bubbled to my ear from the depths of the hotel. I filtered them out as best I could, listening intently for telltale noises from my adjoining roommate. The distant Parisian two-tone wail of a police car invaded my cup, but it soon passed to be replaced with comparative silence.\n\nThen she breathed out sexily and I allowed myself another smile: she certainly wasn't finished. Tiny movements became discernible amid the odd gentle yet deep inhalation. I guessed she was now on her back, legs apart facing me. I pictured her hand cupping her wet pussy, fingers rubbing in circles over her sensitive clitoris. Perhaps one hand was massaging her breasts and twisting her own nipples just like I was doing to mine.\n\nWhat was she thinking? Did she think of a boyfriend, husband or lover filling her aching loins? Or was she fantasizing about someone else; maybe imagining herself the centre of attention in a three-way? Perhaps something dirty like anal sex, or being tied up and dominated? Or did she crave the touch of another woman? I felt a pang of jealousy as I imagined another woman sampling her delights, running a tongue up and down the slick wet folds of _my_ stranger's pussy; at that moment I desperately wanted to be the other woman! I even considered knocking on her door in the hope she might welcome me into her room and share her body heat and pussy with me. But I dismissed the idea as the product of an overactive imagination and continued to simply listen instead. \n\nShe must have given her pussy a little spank with the tip of a few fingers because the light splat of wet on wet greeted my eager ears. She sighed appreciatively at her ministrations. I wondered if she was shaved like me. It certainly sounded like there wasn't much hair to impede her slaps, though she could have been holding her pussy lips open with her other hand. She repeated the slaps again and again, each time letting out a cute sigh. The last one turned into a subtle yet unmistakable moan and the bed springs creaked a few times as she arched her back and dug her fingers inside herself.\n\nI was building a profile in my head and guessed from the tone of her voice that she was in her late twenties or early thirties. Maybe late thirties at a push. Certainly experienced enough to know how to use her body as an instrument of pleasure and to prolong the excitement of her orgasms; she'd been going almost an hour and hadn't showed any obvious audible signs of coming yet. Unless she was the silent type, channelling her orgasms internally to the places it mattered most. I knew the feeling of restraint and how powerful it could make my orgasms when my boyfriend and I bucked and rolled passionately at my parent's house, trying not to wake them in the midnight hour. But I had to admit that under normal circumstances I tended to be more of a screamer. If I'd been playing myself for this length of time tonight, the neighbours three doors away would know about it.\n\nShifting positions again and trying the other ear I noticed the wetness between my legs. My boy-shorts were damp, the soft material shiny with my secretions. I looked down and saw my pussy lips engorged in the hotel lamplight, smooth and inviting beneath the tightly stretched material. I drove my free hand beneath my pants and slid two fingers gently past the outer folds of my pussy. Bringing my hand up to my mouth I tasted them, tracing my tongue over their outline, imagining they were her. I tasted so sweet, yet tangy, and wondered if my neighbour liked the taste of herself when she was aroused. I imagined lying between her soft thighs, savouring every drop of juice I could sample of her slick patch. Flicking my tongue rhythmically over her clit, circling it, licking it, sucking it until she boiled over in wanton abandon, clutching my back with her fingertips as I rode her orgasm.\n\nJust then I became aware of the unmistakable sound of sex somewhere deep in the building. A woman obviously in the throes of passion crying out \" Oui, oui, oui...\" over and over. In the absence of any sound from my neighbour I allowed my mind to wander to this other woman, probably sat atop her husband's stiff cock, riding him hard. Perhaps her back was arched with him clutching and massaging her breasts while she was holding onto his ankles as he drilled up inside her wet cunt. Or maybe she was on all fours with him slamming into her from behind. He may have been holding onto her rump or had slid his finger inside her bottom. Was the woman next door listening to the show too? It was difficult to tell.\n\nThe couple didn't last long and after a final loud scream, silence ensued. Immediately after he had come the little flutters of masturbation returned next door: she had been listening, the dirty minx! I was transfixed again listening to her tiny moans of pleasure as she tried to contain herself while tending to the raging inferno between her legs. I tightened the grip on my glass and dug my other hand firmly into my underwear, openly rubbing my protruding clit. The smooth lips of my pussy felt welcoming and oh so deliciously wet as I played with my button. I moaned, perhaps a little too loudly, but I didn't care any more. I needed release; needed to feel the surge of energy shoot through my body, touching every part of me at once as the nerve endings in my erogenous zones lit up.\n\nNext thing I knew, the squeak of her internal door signalled her entry to the bathroom once more. Surely she couldn't need to pee again. This time I stood and followed her into my own bathroom. I climbed into the bath and pressed the glass to the wall just above the tiles, hearing the toilet seat clink against the cistern. She took a seat on the bowl, then I heard something crystal clear that I'll never forget. She carried on masturbating on the toilet, let out a little cry of pleasure and I heard the same pee sound from earlier: two strong short bursts. I couldn't believe it: she had been coming all along but was a squirter and didn't want to mess the bed up! She panted loudly into the space of the bathroom and I picked it up through my glass amplifier.\n\nInstantly I flung my free hand inside my soaking shorts and diddled my clit furiously. I wanted to be there with her; to hold her, lick her, come with her, feel her horny juices squirt onto my face and down into my eagerly waiting mouth, finally resting on my chin and dripping to the floor. And when she was spent I'd trail butterfly kisses up over her tummy, around her breasts, into the recesses of her delicate neck, up over her jaw line to arrive at her soft mouth. Her lips would be parted and I'd kiss her. Long, deeply, passionately; swapping her come between us with tongues lancing inside mouths, grabbing her head through tangled damp hair as we became one, joined at the lips. Our breasts would crush together and she would grab my bottom, clinging to me. \n\nI imagined her sinking to her knees in front of me and pushing me back against the bathroom door, yanking my shorts from my body and spreading the bare lips of my snatch apart for her dancing tongue. She'd look up at me with doe eyes, seeking permission to press on and I'd melt as she snaked her long tongue inside my hairless pussy and spread my juices over my distended clitoris. She'd circle it repeatedly, each time eliciting louder and louder moans from deep within me. Then she'd slide two fingers inside me and drive them back and forth, sitting back to watch my reaction to her sawing motions. My bucking against the wall, groaning loudly and telling her how much I loved thrusting down onto her dripping fingers would spurn her further to add a third digit to my aching box. She would use her thumb to massage my tender clit and press her fingers hard against the front wall of my sopping canal. She'd charge me up with dirty talk and then, inexorably, like fireworks exploding in my groin, I'd start to come. Exactly as I could feel myself doing under my own ministrations.",
        "The heat travelled quickly, spreading from where my pussy clung to my now drenched boy-shorts, swirling around my clit, tingling my entire labia and then up through the walls of my core. It spread like a forest fire from there in all directions at once, shooting sparks of energy down my legs to the tips of my toes and upwards past my flat tummy, through my breasts and engorged nipples, flushing my neck a deep pink. All the while, my brain signalled the release of more hormones, flooding my body with the love chemical and making me glow. I imagined my mystery woman was there between my legs, basking in the aftermath of my orgasm, smiling up at me with a contented radiance.\n\nI gradually became aware of my laboured breathing -- almost panting -- and couldn't have said if I'd remained quiet during the event. My mouth was agape and I shut it. As the rush that swamped my senses began to fade and my hearing returned to normal I listened through the base of the glass again. Nothing from next door. Perhaps that was it for the night.\n\nWeakly, I stood and awkwardly clambered from the bath, my legs still unsteady. Making my way back into the bedroom I stood for a moment in the centre of the room, the rising and falling of my breasts gradually slowing as my pulse dropped. In the mirror I could make out a sheen of perspiration coating my body; it shimmered in the low light, making me look sexy; womanly; irresistible. I looked shattered and contemplated bed, but curiosity won. Resuming my position on the chair by the wall I placed the glass up against the room divide and adjusted my ear until I could hear into the room next door.\n\nIt became clear that wasn't it for the night.\n\nMy horny neighbour had begun masturbating again. I could hear the rhythmical rustling of bed sheets and the occasional spring as she rearranged her position while her fingers played their part. I guessed she was on her back again judging by the faint oohs and aaahs I could hear projected into the room, and collected by my makeshift amplifier. She was being less discreet than earlier but still very quiet compared to some people I've witnessed; I still had to strain to hear the details. Things weren't helped much by the traffic noise from the ring road below us. A motorbike decided it was going to invade the space between me and her, its engine starting low and distant then raising in pitch and intensity as it neared. I cursed the rider who seemed to enjoy shifting gears a lot; up a gear then down, then up again. He must have passed behind a building because the sound lessened momentarily before reappearing. It was only when the motorbike didn't seem to be disappearing into the night that the realisation hit me: it was her vibrator. And from the sounds of things it was powerful; probably a mains-powered wand.\n\nOnce again I was enrapt as I listened to her altering the speed of the machine to suit her thoughts. The buzz would fade in and out and change pitch as she rolled it around her pussy lips and clit, making a sound like a bee caught in an animal's mouth. The drone would occasionally all but disappear as her legs clamped up around the head, usually accompanied by a breathy sigh. As her sticky thighs flopped apart back to the bed she'd step it up a notch and groan, then back the wand off to tease herself. I don't know how she maintained that much self control; I'd have been an orgasmic wreck.\n\nThe gentle fluttering in my belly from my last orgasm began to churn again as I listened to her increasing arousal. I could feel the moisture inside me building again so I relented, stood and slid my soaked underwear to the floor, stepping out of it. I bent to retrieve the panties from the floor, my lithe legs and strong, shapely calves flexing. Bringing the garment to my face I smelled my arousal for a long moment before standing, imagining it was her I was breathing. Over in my bag in the corner I knew I'd brought my own vibrator; a much smaller affair than my neighbour's but perfect for hitting the spot. I paced over to collect it and returned to the seat, switching it on in the process. It hummed to life in my palm, tickling me.\n\nWith the glass back in position I sat totally naked in the chair listening to the woman next door. She had to also be naked by now. My free hand lazily traced the outline of my pussy lips with the vibrator, tingling and warming my centre in equal measure. The buzz echoed insistently from the walls and I wondered if it was audible next door over the sound of her much larger machine and rhythmic panting.\n\nShe began gently spanking herself; the cracks of feminine hand on flesh unmistakable through the wall. Each time she'd murmur something incomprehensible; though at one point I thought I could make out the words \"dirty bitch\": was she referring to herself or to me for listening?\n\nThe bed springs creaked and complained as she turned over, bottom upturned. The vibrator went up another notch and I heard some muffled but far louder groans smothered by her pillow. She spanked herself harder now, each smack echoing deliciously down the glass to my ear. What I'd give to be the one to administer the spanking. I'd only indulged in girl-on-girl a couple of times -- as a rule I prefer my sex hard and rough -- though I had thoroughly enjoyed how naughty it made me feel to be licking the pussy of another man's wife, and her me. The second time we'd pushed the boundaries a little and she had blindfolded me, barking commands and spanking my bare bottom if I didn't comply to her whims in a timely fashion. That had been both fun and intense; to have one of my senses removed and having to put all my trust in someone else to tease and maintain my arousal all evening. Thinking about that night again -- also acted out in a hotel -- brought another flood of wetness surging through my tunnel. It oozed from my puffy lips to the chair. I again wondered if my hot stranger would be averse to me turning up at her door wearing nothing but a smile and a frothing pussy. But knowing who she was might shatter the magic so I again stopped myself.\n\nInstead I dropped to my knees next to the wall and repositioned the glass so I could continue to hear her bringing herself closer and closer to orgasm. The wand vibrator had reduced its intensity again as she languidly danced it over her clitoris, and glided it up and down her wet slit, teasing and heightening her arousal. In the short pauses between direct contact with the vibrator I could hear the smacking of her wet pussy lips and did the same to myself in unison. It felt so good, like we had an invisible connection through the wall; two lovers in complete harmony, remote controlled by shared passion.\n\nPositioning my vibrator pointing up on the floor I manoeuvred myself over it and sank onto the phallus, gasping as it transferred its energy to my insides. It was my favourite toy when separated from my boyfriend; its lightly contoured shaft wide enough to stretch and fill me completely but not so wide that it required a hand to drive it. As I began to contract my pussy around the toy, squeezing it out of my hot channel, I'd rise enough to let it almost completely exit my body. Just as my lips gently began to draw closed to their rest state around the tip of the humming machine, I'd descend again allowing it to split me apart on the way down and massage my quivering pussy. The slow pace was at total odds to the fire raging inside me; I wanted to hammer the tool in and out of my slippery cunt and scream the place down but the restraint somehow intensified my nerve endings and made the soft, downy hairs on my back stand on end as shivers of desire travelled my spine. It was quite a challenge to slowly rock up and down while maintaining my ear contact with the glass but with a little practice I managed it.\n\nMy neighbour had racked her wand up a few notches further so the buzzing could actually be felt as well as heard through the wall. I imagined sitting behind her upturned bottom and just watching her drive herself to the edge of her sexual tether with wet slaps to her glistening mons and the insistent hum of her vibrator causing spasms of pleasure to ignite her body. How I longed to be in that position, to bend to her upturned cheeks and run my tongue over her dark, nether rosebud, tasting the muskiness of her taboo hole. Having my own bottom licked drives me wild with desire and I hoped it would do the same for her. I reached around with my spare hand and massaged the ring of muscle I found, gently probing the tip of my finger inside as I tenderly rode my toy.\n\nThe springs began to squeak rhythmically as the woman bucked her hips in response to the action of her vibrator. By now I expected her clit to be crimson and proud as the mini internal explosions grew closer together until they merged into one continuous shuddering orgasm. Her gasps were still quiet and muffled by her face buried into her pillow but they were more ragged and insistent now. The urgency for release overcoming the desire for discretion.\n\nJust then the wand abruptly shut off. The bed springs creaked awkwardly as she scrambled from the bed and padded to the bathroom again. The creak of the bathroom door gave way to the sound of the lid against porcelain, and she sat on the toilet. I imagined fingers blurring over her clit, her head tipped back, hair tousled, lips apart as she panted heavily towards uniting the fires inside her body. I wanted to be there with her, to come when she did, so I began bouncing more forcefully on my vibrator, squeezing and releasing the walls of my aching pussy in time with my rocking. A bead of sweat trickled from my forehead as the vibrator sawed in and out of my wet tunnel. I shoved my finger further into my ass and wiggled it around, igniting the nerve endings in my bottom. I could feel the vibrator pushing insistently against my finger through the thin wall of muscle and had a hard time keeping the glass still as my insides began to converge, rolling towards my own crushing orgasm. I hoped she was close too. Her panting was increasing in frequency and I pictured her with her eyes closed flashing her whole palm rapidly over her sensitive clit. Was she thinking of me at the same time, imagining what she had driven me to doing this evening? I was making far more noise than she was: she must have heard.\n\nSeconds later, with a long drawn out groan I heard her boil over, splashing her juice against the inside of the bowl in three intense squirts. I slammed my drenched, hairless cunt right to the floor, impaling myself fully on my toy. Its vibrating tip tickled my very centre and I shuddered as the sexual energy that had been building all evening erupted. White hot flashes of electricity surged through my entire body as the orgasm took control. The glass dropped and bounced off my knee, rolling to a stop across the room. I grabbed my tits one after the other and squeezed them hard, my nipples on fire. Time stood still; nothing existed except my roaming hands, my finger buried in my bottom and the heat radiating from my energized body. The vibrations from inside my sopping box continued to send rapid pulses the entire length of my body. I threw my head back and gave in to them, letting out a series of screams that gradually led to softer moans, then dying to whimpers of pleasure.\n\nI'm not sure how long I sat with the vibrator humming away inside me. It felt like an hour as the waves of orgasm crashed through me, but was probably less than a minute before the sensations overwhelmed me. As the heat began to dissipate I slumped forward onto all fours and raised my pussy from the vibrator. It slithered to the floor leaving a sudden void inside me. Wetness drained from my insides and pooled on my outer lips, dribbling stickily to the carpet. My lips stayed apart for a long while, like puffy wet flower petals after rain; only gradually beginning to close after I'd reached down to silence the vibrator.\n\nFor what seemed an eternity I remained in that position. The thunder that had ravaged my body had left me both exhausted and exhilarated. The ripples were still lapping at my extremities when I finally picked myself up and tottered unsteadily to the bed, sliding between the crisp cotton sheets and drawing them to my chin. I ran my hands over my body tenderly, lazily tracing circles where the ebbs and flows of my orgasm still remained, my mind in the room next door imagining her doing the same.\n\nI don't remember drifting off to sleep but slept soundly, waking late as the sun peeked round the curtains, casting fingers of light into the room and across the bed. My vibrator and underwear lay spent lewdly on the floor reminding me of the night's activities. I smiled and rolled over in bed, hugging the sheets. My insides felt raw yet satisfied.\n\nStill naked, I slithered from the bed and padded to the bathroom, stopping mid tracks. A small piece of paper was on the floor by the main entrance to the room. It had evidently been pushed beneath the door akin to the way hotel staff do for express checkout guests. Shakily I bent to pick it up and unfolded it with trepidation. A cursive scrawl on hotel headed notepaper simply read:\n\nI'm here all week. Next time, knock :-)\n\nI smiled at the note. Maybe I will."
