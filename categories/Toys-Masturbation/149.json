        "It was a cold and dreary day as Jeb exited from his car and walked toward his eastside home. He could well remember a day when he was happy to be coming home but not anymore. Not since Laura had died in that terrible accident last week, a week when everything seemed to just stop. In fact, Jeb had done almost nothing since his wife died. He had stopped attending Sunday and Wednesday church services, stopped his Friday night bowling with his friends; yes, Jeb had stopped doing almost everything he normally did except for showing up to his job everyday.\n\nJeb inserted the key to his front door and turned it hearing the familiar click of the deadbolt.\n\nOnce inside a soft sigh escaped from his lips as he closed the door and once again is faced with an empty home which once was filled with so much love and life.\n\nJeb plops down onto the couch in an almost lifeless mass and then blindly reaches for the remote and switches on the TV to drown out the seemingly deafening silence in his living room. As the TV flickers to life and begins to shed light into the dark and gloomy space Jeb's stomach reminds him that while many things which were once normal can be forgone nourishment was not one of those things.\n\nJeb stumbles into the kitchen and opens up the fridge hoping to sort through what was left of the seemingly endless supply of covered casserole dishes which his friends from church had dropped by after Laura's funeral but finds almost nothing left now except for a single dish which has a green fungus covering the top of it.\n\nMoving now with at least a sense of purpose Jeb grabbed his coat and keys from the hook beside the door. The instant Jeb saw the coat rack his mind was flooded with memories of when he hung it beside the door. Suddenly Laura was there, dressed in that white dress with the bright red tropical flowers on it that she loved so much. He remembered how she nagged him about their needing a rack to hang stuff on beside the door and how he resisted saying it was silly because his own mother always insisted on coats being hung up in the hall closet not crowding up the entry way of a home. Now he was glad she won that argument. Glad and also a bit sad he thought to himself as he opened the door and stepped out into the crisp night air brushing a tear from his eye.\n\nThe car roared to life and Jeb pulled the gear shift into reverse and carefully backed out into the street and made his way to the corner grocery. Traffic was light partially due to the hour and partially due to the crappy weather which seemed to hang over the city of Sumner like an ill fitting dirty overcoat as it had for weeks now. \n\nJeb parked the car and made his way inside the supermarket and began trying to decide what he wanted to eat. As he stepped out of the weather into the market the smell of grease and chicken fat filled his nostrils, and instantly Jeb knew what he wanted. He stepped over to the deli counter and ordered the fried chicken and a half pound of JoJo potatoes to go. \n\nNancy pulled her overcoat tightly to her chest as she walked into the Supermarket, deciding in her mind what she needed to buy in order to get a dinner on the table by 7 pm. I just should have left the women's group early she told herself as the bright lights of the bustling supermarket forced her to squint her eyes to adjust to the change. \n\nShe grabbed a cart and begin her usual journey through the market. Nancy always liked to go down each and every isle in the store no matter what was going on in her life. You never know when your memory will be jogged to get something you need just by walking by everything she always told her husband whenever he complained at her habit. Secretly, Nancy just loved shopping but she wasn't going to admit that to Bob. No way no how!\n\nAs she rounded the first corner in the store and begin to pass the deli counter she saw him and while she wasn't sure what to say she knew she needed to stop and at least say hi. After all she was the Pastor's wife and her position in the church demanded certain things of her.\n\n\"Jeb\" she said 'Is that you?\"\n\nJeb turns around slowly and sees the Pastor's wife. \"Oh, hi Nancy,\" Jeb says thinking to himself that the last thing he needed right now was another church member telling him how they miss him at church again.\n\n\"Jeb, I know this is a really terrible time for you and you don't need people telling you what you need to do, but I did want to let you know if you need anything, anything at all just give Bob or I a call and we will be more then glad to give you whatever we can to help you.\"\n\n\"Thanks Nancy, to be honest right now I don't even know what I need, but it is very nice of you to offer.\" Jeb says as he thinks to himself, God I'm so glad she didn't try to guilt me back into the church.\n\n\"Well Jeb, it is good to see you and again just let us know if we can help you in anyway,\" Nancy says as she turns and returns to her shopping moving steadily toward the fresh fruits and vegetable section of the store.\n\nJeb watches her walk away and instinctively his eyes lock on to her swaying hips and beautiful legs. I always did love a woman in a dress he thinks to himself as a sudden twinge of guilt flashes across his mind. \n\nThe counter girl in the deli snaps him back to reality with her voice.\n\n\"Sir, will there be anything else for you, perhaps some potato salad?\"\n\n\"No thanks, this will be just fine.\"\n\nJeb turns and heads for the check out counter and pays for his food and once again braves the dark and gloomy night. The trip home is thankfully quick and painless and once food is again in his stomach Jeb is quickly asleep on the couch. The couch which has become his bed since his wife died.\n\nNancy reaches into the meat counter and selects a precooked pot roast and then moves down to the refrigerated section where the prepared oven baked cut up potatoes are. Just need to get the frozen corn on the cob and some dinner rolls and I'm all set she thinks to herself.\n\nNancy pays for her purchases and heads home knowing time is of the essence as her husband and two boys will be expecting dinner on the table by 7pm just as it always has been for the past 15 years. \n\nOnce home Nancy places the potatoes and dinner rolls in the oven and the corn and pot roast in water. Thank God for boil in bag meals, Nancy thinks to herself as she busies herself with setting the table.\n\nOnce dinner is on the table and Bob and the boys are all quietly eating Nancy breaks the usual silence.\n\n\"I saw Jeb Jackson today at the supermarket.\"\n\n\"Really, how is he doing\" Bob asks?\n\n\"Well he looks a bit sullen to me but I suppose its to be expected seeing how only a week has passed since Laura has died.\"\n\n\"Did you tell him we miss seeing him at Church?\"\n\n\"No I did not, that is the last thing he needs right now is someone else telling him what to do or how to feel!\"\n\nBob drops his head slightly, \"Yeah, you're probably right; 3 different people have told me they have encouraged him to come back to church and be around people again. I am sure he has had his fill of that. I just wish there was something we could do.\"\n\n\"Me too!,\" Nancy says as she takes another bite of pot roast.\n\n\"Say, maybe you could get a few of the women to volunteer to go over and see if his place needs some cleaning or something like that. I am sure he has just let things go seeing how hard he has taken Laura's death.\" Bob says perking up slightly from the mild rebuke his wife had just given him.\n\n\"Yeah! Nancy says, \"That is a great idea, Bob. I'll call Nicole and Cindy and see who they can come up with as well. This will be a good way to help Jeb and also get him around people again.\"\n\nNancy cleaned up the dinner dishes and started the dishwasher then got on the phone and set her plan into action. She called Nicole first and then Cindy and asked each of them to get a list of women who would be willing to volunteer time and get back to her. Then she picked up the church directory and looked up Jeb's number and placed her last call of the night.\n\nThe ringing of the phone woke Jeb from his couch-bed. He sat up and rubbed his eyes then reached for the phone.\n\n\"Hello\"\n\n\"Hello, Jeb? This is Nancy Walker.\"\n\n\"Oh, Hello again Nancy.\" Jeb says as he thinks to himself, what in the world does this woman want now?\n\n\"Listen Jeb, Bob and I were talking over dinner and we were wondering if maybe I and some of the women from church could come by and maybe give you a hand with the housework to kind of help you out for a while. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Nancy, that is a really great offer but are you sure you and the other women want to do this? I mean I have kind of let things go here for the past week.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jeb I am sure, we would love to do that.\"\n\n\"Well, if your sure and it's not too much trouble then I think it would be alright for a while.\"\n\n\"Great Jeb, I will set it all up and let you know tomorrow who will be coming by and when.\"\n\n\"Nancy, I work pretty late and don't usually get home to after 6 pm so why don't I just put a key to the door under the front mat and whoever comes can just let themselves in if that's alright.\"\n\n\"Yes sure Jeb that will be fine with us. I will be starting off tomorrow while Nicole Doherty and Cindy Von Holt get the list set up if that's not too soon for us to start out?\"\n\n\"Sure Nancy, that will be great.\"\n\n\"Ok Jeb, then I will probably see you tomorrow at your place when you get home from work then.\"\n\n\"Ok Nancy. Oh Hey and Nancy thanks for doing this, I mean its really\u2026\"\n\n\"Jeb don't worry,\" Nancy interrupts, \"We all really want to do this. OK?\"\n\n\"OK, then Nancy, and again this is really very nice of you women to do for me.\"\n\n\"Sure thing Jeb, and I will see you tomorrow.\"\n\nJeb hangs up the phone and sits there on the couch somewhat dazed by the conversation. On one hand what Nancy offered is really, really nice but also Jeb didn't want those women thinking he was a total slob who couldn't take care of himself either. Jeb stood up and began picking up the empty soda cans and sacks of fast food from around the room and placed them in a garbage sack which he placed in the can inside the garage. Once back inside he surveyed the room to see what else he could do before going back to sleep but he just didn't have the energy to do any more.\n\nHe laid back down on the couch and pulled a pillow under his head and nodded off to sleep again; thinking of that sight of Nancy Walker pushing the shopping cart down the isle at the store.\n\nThe morning sun shining through the windows awakens Jeb to the start of a new day. He rises and performs his ritual, catlike stretches to shake the last vestiges of sleep from his body and then heads for the shower.\n\nAs the warm water begins to pour from the shower head and steam starts to rise Jeb remembers the phone call from Nancy Walker last evening. Got to remember to leave the extra key under the mat, he reminds himself as he steps under the downpour of water and allows it to flood over his face and down his body. \n\nThe warm water deluging over his body gives him the energy necessary to get moving, so Jeb soaps up and rinses off quickly and steps out of the shower clean and renewed, ready to face whatever comes his way today. A quick shave and clean work clothes, then off to the kitchen for a morning cup of coffee and a bagel. \n\nSitting at the kitchen table slurping down the coffee and chewing on the toasted bagel Jeb mulls over the idea of Nancy Walker coming into his house again. Why am I so preoccupied with her Jeb thinks to himself? Shaking his head he stands and then placing his dish and cup into the sink with the rest of the dirty dishes from the week and then grabs his paper on the way out to the car.\n\nIn the car heading to work Jeb finds his mind once again turning back to Nancy and the sight of her in the supermarket last evening.\n\nNancy wakes up earlier then usual this morning and goes about her morning chores. Breakfast for Bob and the kids, then some cleaning in the family room from the boys night of watching sports on the TV, which always seems to include an overabundance of chips and soda.\n\nI'll have to vacuum in here again after the kids are up and Bob is headed out to the Church, Nancy thinks to herself as she smoothes out the cushions on the couch and straightens up the various knick-knacks which the boys always seem to want to goof around with during the commercial breaks of their nightly TV watching ritual.\n\nBob, comes down stairs and kisses Nancy on the cheek. \"Morning sweetheart,\" he says.\n\n\"Good morning darling,\" Nancy says smooching back at his light peck on her cheek.\n\n15 years of marriage had allowed them both to settle into quite a rut physically and emotionally. Sex every Saturday night, morning kisses and a hug at the door as Bob leaves for the office are about as romantic as Nancy and Bob get anymore. That accompanied with the fact that Bob sees sex as something strictly to be performed for procreation and then just often enough so neither of them wander or are tempted to do so, at least he thinks so anyway.\n\nWith the kids up and off to school and Bob off to the church, Nancy quickly finishes her morning routine and sits down at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and makes a call to Nicole.\n\nNicole picks up her ringing phone \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello, Nicole, this is Nancy. Did you and Cindy come up with some people who we can count on to help with the work at Jeb Jackson's place?\"\n\n\"Oh, Hi Nancy, yes we have 3 other women from the church who have volunteered already and Cindy and I have several more calls to place today.\"\n\n\"Great to hear Nicole, I spoke with Jeb last night after talking with you and he told me he will leave a key under his front mat so we can get in when ever we need too due to his late work schedule so be sure and let all the other girls know that as well will you.\"\n\n\"Sure will do. Say when are we going to start on this project, next week?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I told Jeb we could start today, is that a problem?\"\n\n\"Well\u2026\" Nicole's voice kind of trails off \"Cindy and I figured we wouldn't start until we had a decent list of women and so we told everyone to plan on next week as a potential start time.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that then I can take the extra work through the weekend myself, Bob and the boys aren't that much trouble.\" Nancy says laughing. \"I already have 90% of what I need to do today already done.\"\n\nNicole laughs back and says, \"Yes you're lucky you have them all pretty well trained.\"\n\nNancy smiles at Nicole's comment and then says \"Well, I better run then if I am going to get everything done I need to do for two households. Do let me know when you and Cindy get a schedule together and I'll pass it along to Jeb so he knows who is in his house and when. Bye.\"\n\nNancy hangs up the phone and swallows the last of her morning coffee gets up to get back to work on her daily routine. The vacuuming and dusting goes surprisingly quickly and by 11 am Nancy is done with her housework and ready to put a roast with potatoes and carrots in the oven for Bob and the boys with instructions on when it needs to be taken out plainly spelled out for them. Setting the oven on 250 degrees so it will slow cook all day and make a nice and tender dinner she leaves the kitchen and grabs the phone off the table and phones Bob.\n\nThe ringing of his private number pulls Bob from the depths of his sermon preparation. He reaches over and answers the ringing phone \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Bob, I am going to head over to Jeb Jackson's place to get started on what we talked about last night and I have no idea how long it will take me given that he has been without a wife for a week, so I set the oven on low with a roast. Can you take it out when you get home tonight, and make sure the boys do the dishes for me?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure honey. I will take care of it don't you worry about a thing. By the way, I sure am proud of the way you are stepping up and leading the way for the women on how the body of Christ is to take care of one another.\"\n\n\"Thanks babe, that means a lot to me. Well I better get running, like I said I have no idea what lays ahead for me today.\"\n\nNancy hangs up the phone, grabs her purse and stops by the back door to think for just one last time before she leaves to make sure she hasn't forgotten a thing before she has left. Nope, I am ready to hit the road, Nancy thinks to herself as she steps out the door and make her way across town to Jeb Jackson's place.\n\nArriving at Jeb's place Nancy feels a bit out of place. The last time she was over here Bob was at her side and they were coming to comfort Jeb when the news of the terrible crash which killed Laura was less then an hour old. She could still remember how nervous she was that day and somehow it made her nervous again as she stepped onto the front porch and bent down to search for the key Jeb told her would be under his front mat.\n\nSure enough the key was right where Jeb had promised it would be and in seconds Nancy was inside Jeb and Laura's home. \n\n\"Hello.\" Nancy called out as she stepped inside and closed the door behind her.\n\nNo answer.\n\nNancy hangs her coat and purse on the coat rack beside the front door and surveys the front room looking for a launching point for her attack on the work ahead of her. In minutes Nancy is in her element as she begins picking up various and sundry articles lying about the room. Carrying the dirty clothes into the laundry room, the dirty dishes into the kitchen and placing the trash into the large black plastic trash bag she found in what was obviously Laura's cleaning supply cupboard under the kitchen sink.\n\nWith the laundry going and the dishwasher doing its best against what seemed like 4 or 5 day old dried caked on food debris on plates and utensils, Nancy turned her attention to the floors, first vacuuming the carpet, then mopping the vinyl floors and finally dusting what appeared to be at least a weeks worth of dust.\n\nNancy stopped for a moment to survey the work performed and smiled to herself, pleased with what she had accomplished. Glancing at her watch, it was 2 pm.\n\n\"Buzzzzzzzzzz\" The sound startled Nancy. Oh that must be the dryer she thought to herself. Moving into the laundry room and removing the load from the dryer and replacing it with a load from the washer she grabbed the laundry basket and headed into the master bedroom to fold the load in there.\n\nOpening up the door to the Master bedroom Nancy could tell by its nearly immaculate state that Jeb had not been in her since his wife died. It almost seemed like she was intruding into a sacred shrine as she walked into the room. Noting the order of things in the room Nancy was sure she was right, everything was put away and placed properly not slightly askew as a man would do. She sat on the end of the bed and began folding underwear, tee shirts, and pairing up socks first, then went over to the closet to look for hangers for the hanging clothes.\n\nQuickly finding the hangers she needed Nancy makes short work of the hanging clothes and places them into the closet then begins opening dresser drawers to put Jeb's undergarments away. As she opens the first drawer she finds Laura's underwear drawer, but as she begins to close it back in as a strange object catches her eye.\n\nNancy stops dead in her tracks, never in her entire life has she seen anything like this before. Hesitantly she reaches out to touch the object and recoils backward as her fingertips touch the soft, almost skin-like phallus lying in Laura's drawer. A thought runs through her mind to close the drawer but something inside her won't let her shut the drawer.\n\nThere she stood transfixed by what was the largest dildo Nancy had ever seen. The thing looked so huge! And it had\u2026it had BALLS!!! Again Nancy reached out and gently stroked the fleshy feeling surface of the dildo but this time she didn't recoil backwards. She allowed the pads of her fingers to run over its length feeling what appeared to be life-like veins running just underneath what could only be called its skin.",
        "Slowly Nancy encased the dildo in her hand amazed at how little of it she could encircle. Her hand going only partway around its girth. She lifted the object from the drawer and stood there in front of the dresser holding the phallus just staring at it.\n\n\nNancy lifted the life-like dildo to her face and closely examined it, there was a knob on the underside of what looked like its balls, near the base of the dildo. She grasped the knob and turned it clockwise and felt the object begin to vibrate in her hand. Nancy let go and it dropped to the carpeted floor with a soft thud, the soft whir of its vibrations filling the quiet room with sound.\n\nMinutes went by as Nancy stood there staring at the huge vibrating dildo, she was unable to move it seemed, her gazed locked onto it. Then slowly once again Nancy found the courage to reach down and pick up the dildo and bring it up towards her face. She held the object directly in front of her face holding it just inches away from her mouth. Never had she ever, ever been face to face with anything like this. Bob had never let her even touch his penis, let alone look at it up close.\n\nBut here she was face to face with the most life like dildo she had ever seen. Nancy had never even known such a thing could be, let alone would be made!!! Then almost without thought she pulled it toward her lips and softly kissed the head of the dildo. A shockwave of vibrating pleasure rippled through her lips and across her tongue when she did so.\n\nQuickly she pulled back and glanced up at the mirror hanging directly in front of the dresser and once again was transfixed by the sight of this large dildo in her hand just inches from her mouth. The sight of all this was stirring feelings inside her body that Nancy had never felt before. Suddenly she was aware of a dampness between her legs and an increase in her breathing. She became aware that this object, this dildo, was something that she wanted to have touch her in places no man, except her husband, had ever touched her.\n\nNancy stepped backwards toward the bed and sat down on the edge of the bed and let the soft smoothness of the dildo gently glide over her face and neck. The feeling of it's silkiness coupled with the gentle vibrations made her heart race ever so slightly. Nancy's mind was reeling as she let it slowly touch her face and neck. She licked her lips and moaned softly. \n\nThen all of a sudden she sat bolt upright as the object came into contact with her tongue. Without realizing it Nancy had brought the dildo over her mouth at the exact moment her tongue was licking her lips. Nancy thought for a moment about what she was doing and what she wanted to do then stood up. Walking back over to place the dildo back into Laura's underwear drawer she was once again struck by the figure of herself in the mirror holding the dildo.\n\nThen without even thinking she raised the dildo up to her mouth and licked the tip of it with her tongue, again a strange new sensation came over her. Nancy didn't know why, but she wanted to have that thing inside her mouth. Slowly she licked over the head of the dildo trying to work the object into her small mouth. Grasping the base of the unit she began pushing it rhythmically into her open mouth feeling it begin to slide past her lips and into her mouth stretching her mouth open.\n\nLooking up at the mirror she was shocked to see a picture of herself with a large dildo wedged into her moist open mouth. The sight only served to arouse her further as she looked at the sight of her mouth encircling what was the only object she had ever placed in her mouth besides food. She began to lick and suck on the dildo as her passion grew. The feeling of dampness between her legs was calling for her to do more then just suck this object.\n\nPulling the dildo from her mouth and turning back toward the bed Nancy pulled her dress up and pushed the hem of it into her belt to hold it up then quickly took off her panties and dropped them to the carpet. Her mind was in shock as she watched herself in the mirror. She saw her hands part her outer and inner lips and exposed the moisture between her legs.\n\nThe flesh of her vagina was glistening and bright pink, her outer lips were red and swollen and the small mound of flesh above her vagina was swollen and poking out from under the hood of flesh surrounding it. Nancy had never looked at her own vagina, heck she had never, ever seen anyone's vagina up close. The sight of her own swollen lips and clitoris coupled with the moist glistening inner recesses of her vagina amazed her.\n\nNancy sat the still vibrating dildo on the bed and placed one finger on her clitoris and felt her body shudder as the strong almost electric shock ran through her body. She closed her eyes and softly, ever so gently made small circles tracing the outline of her clitoris. Before she even realized it Nancy was having her first ever self-induced orgasm, right there in Jeb Jackson's bedroom. Nancy's fingers amazed her as they were able to deftly probe into her warm, moist vagina and give her pleasure like she had never felt before. The strong odor of Nancy's sex was filling the room and pushing her into a higher and higher state of excitement. Suddenly she needed something more then her fingers inside her body.\n\nShe reached over and grasp the dildo and again brought it to her mouth and sucked it slowly inside her mouth. Then pulling it out she looked straight into the mirror on the wall and lowered the dildo toward her vagina. Her gaze was locked on the mirror as she guided the dildo toward its target. She watched with fascination as it begin to move into her waiting vagina.\n\nThe sheer size of it as it stretched her open was a bit uncomfortable but she was so transfixed she couldn't stop what was taking place. It was like she was watching someone else penetrate her with the dildo. As it slid into her body she could feel the skin around her clitoris being pulled downward stimulating her even more. She began to slide the dildo in and out of her waiting vagina, watching as it slowly fucked her. Her hand moved rhythmically pushing the dildo deep inside her vagina then slowly pulling it out. Feeling her body tense up as the stretching of her clitoral hood stimulated her even more and the dildo pushed deep inside of her filling her with a deliciousness that was beyond description.\n\nOver and over she pushed the dildo into her body, until the room was filled with the slick, slurping sound of the dildo forcing its way into the inner recesses of her body. The room was filled with the sounds of sex, slurping in and out as moans emanated from Nancy's open mouth. Her body was on automatic now, pushing the dildo in and out of her body. Her legs began to quiver at first then her whole body began to shake. Nancy collapsed into a heap on the edge of the bed, the large dildo still vibrating inside her vagina, her chest heaving up and down, her legs agape and looking like rubber. This was an orgasm like she had never experienced before.\n\nAs her breathing began to return to a more normal level Nancy looked away from the mirror which has so transfixed her and began to realize where she was and what she was doing. Here she was in another man's bedroom masturbating with a dildo. She grabbed the knob on the base of the dildo and turned it counterclockwise to shut off the vibrations and pulled it from her body.\n\nA familiar voice came from across the room, \"You don't have to stop on my account.\"\n\nInstantly Nancy's eyes darted toward the door and there he stood, Jeb Jackson look at her on his bed with her legs wide spread, her vaginal lips puffy and swollen and his dead wife's dildo in her hands. Then she noticed what he was doing, he had his pants undone and around his ankles and he had the largest hard-on she had ever seen in her life in his right hand.\n\nJeb let go of his dick and reached down for his pants and slide them up his legs and held them up as he walked toward Nancy with his engorged penis sticking out like a wooden pole. Her eyes gazed on his manhood as he walked making it jiggle to and fro in it's excited state.\n\nAs Jeb neared the bed Nancy kept her gaze on his dick, she was mesmerized by its size and he knew she wanted him as much as he wanted her.\n\nNancy reached out and softly caressed his erect cock and looked up with big eyes as if to ask if it was alright to touch him. Jeb placed his hand on hers and guided it up and down the shaft of his cock for a few strokes then let go and watched as Nancy continued to pump his penis up and down. Then Nancy leaned forward and slide off the edge of the bed onto her knees and encircled the head of his penis with her lips and continued to slide her hand up and down his cock.\n\nNancy moaned a deep guttural moan as she sucked his penis and jerked him off. She couldn't believe she was doing this but her body had complete control of what was happening and her body wanted to be satisfied by a man. A real man with a real cock not a fake one like she had just masturbated with.\n\nSlowly she slid more of Jeb's cock onto her mouth until she almost gagged. Then pulling back just a bit she continued sucking and pumping the length of his shaft as Jeb looked down on her. Jeb placed his hands on the back of her head and begin to move his hips pushing his cock in and out of her mouth, once again there was a slurping and moaning sound in the room but this time the wetness was Nancy's mouth and the moaning was coming from Jeb. \n\nNancy bobbed up and down on Jeb's cock until it began to swell and stiffen even more. She forced his cock as deep into her throat as she could and pumped furiously on his shaft looking up at his face. Jeb looked down at this woman who had his cock deep in her mouth pumping away at him and it was too much, he lost control and grabbed her head and forced himself deeper into her mouth and began to climax. \n\nNancy could barely breath as Jeb shot streams of cum down her throat, his cum beginning to rise up into her mouth so fast that she felt it coming out her nose as she tried to swallow it. Then Jeb relaxed his grip on her head and pulled back giving his semen room to fill her mouth. Still looking up Nancy sucked and swallowed wanting all of his cum inside of her.\n\nFinally as Jeb's cock begin to deflate Nancy let him fall from her mouth. What is he going to say to me after what I have just done, Nancy thinks to herself. But Jeb just reaches down and takes her hand and raises her up and pulls her close. The warmth of Jeb's strong arms around her made her realize words were not needed. She had given him something they had both needed.\n\nJeb eased his grip on Nancy and slowly began to unzip her dress and let it fall to her feet. She felt his strong yet gentle hands slide over her tiny body and try to release her bra. Nancy pulls his hands away and steps back out of her dress standing nearly naked clothed only in a bra and then slides the straps off her shoulders exposing her breast and slides her bra around so she can unclasp the hooks and then lets it fall to the floor.\n\nShe moves back in toward him and looks into his eyes and speaks for the first time in hours.\n\n\"I don't know why I am doing this, but I am yours for this evening. I want you and I believe you want me too. Please make love to me here in this room tonight.\"\n\nNancy watched as Jeb stepped out of his pants and underwear and then pull his shirt off over his head to expose his naked body to her for the first time ever. Jeb stepped close and cupped her breasts in his hands and lifted one to his mouth as he began to suck on her already erect nipple. She felt his tongue flick across the tip of her nipple and felt shivers run down her spine. Bob almost never touched her breasts and never had he sucked on her nipples. Now she knew what she had been missing. Nancy felt her pulse quicken and her breathing become deeper as Jeb sucked first one then the other nipple, squeezing her breasts, she could feel this warm breath run over her skin causing her excitement to rise, and her hips to begin to move back and forth.\n\nThe movement of her hips was allowing her vaginal lips to rub against her clitoris reigniting her passion. Nancy knew if Jeb kept on sucking her breasts she would be cumming right here standing in the middle of the room. Gently she pulled at Jeb coaxing him toward the bed until she could ease herself down onto the bed and pull him on top of herself.\n\nOnce horizontal Jeb went back to sucking on Nancy's supple breasts and pressed his body down on top of her own. His erect member slipped right between her legs and as he moved it rubbed up and down the length of her slit pushing her closer and closer to another orgasm. Nancy was moaning loudly as Jeb sucked her breasts and squeezed them in his hands and she began to hump his penis rubbing herself to climax as he suckled her breasts.\n\nAll at once Nancy began to shake as orgasm washed over her body again. She grabbed his head and pushed him down between her legs and Jeb willingly begin to tongue her clitoris as she rode his face to another hard orgasm. Nancy shook so hard this time that she thought the whole room was shaking, Jeb's tongue darting in and out of her opening, flicking across her clitoris while she came. Slowly her orgasm began to subside and Jeb withdrew his face from between her legs and inched up her body until his swollen dick was where his mouth was. \n\nNancy reached down and guided his penis toward her opening as Jeb slowly slid his cock inside of her. His cock was at least as big as the dildo from before and once again she felt her clitoris quiver as the hood surrounding it drew downward and outward from the stretching. Then he begin to pump his cock in and out of her extremely wet opening. The squishing sound was back again this time it was from the wetness of her vagina. Jeb drilled into her over and over again, both of their bodies pushing and grunting. It was as if they both wanted to push into each others bodies until them merged into one massive blob of orgasmic flesh.\n\nNancy could feel Jeb's breath on her face and neck, and her own heart beating so fast it seemed as if it would burst from her chest. Her body succumbing to the pounding it was taking and again began to shake so hard this time that the only sound she could make was \"Unnnnnnuhhhhhhuhhhhhh.\"\n\nIt seemed as if his cock was going to pass right through her body and into the bed beneath her has he fucked her as hard and fast as he could. The orgasm wouldn't stop, it just kept shaking her body, wracking it with orgasmic pleasure as Jeb pounded her mercilessly. Then his pace quickened even more as he neared his second climax of that day. His cock took over and thrust deeper into Nancy's body until the sweet release came and a flood of semen begin to flow inside of her. \n\nJeb's body went limp from probable sheer exhaustion as his seed flowed into Nancy's vagina. She wrapped her legs around his butt and pulled him closer as they lay there in each others arms. She could feel his cum leaking from inside of her and onto the bed but she didn't care. This was the best sex she had experienced in her 42 years of living and she didn't want it to end.\n\nAfter a few minutes of warm embrace Jeb raised up and Nancy felt his penis slid out of her well worn vagina. She looked at him, and he looked back at her. She laughed to herself as she thought about the last two days and what she had promised him in the store. She had told him if he needed ANYTHING at all just let her know and she would be glad to give it to him.\n\nAnd boy was she glad she had given it to him. She looked at the clock in the bedside table and saw it was almost 9 pm. For 7 hours she had been in this room masturbating and making love to Jeb. Guess it was a good thing I asked Bob to see to the dinner tonight for him and the boys she thought.\n\nNancy got up and stumbled to the bathroom her legs weak from all the orgasms she had had today and began to clean herself up. Once dressed she kissed Jeb on the lips and said \"Thanks for what you gave me, I needed it more then you could ever know.\"\n\nWith those words Nancy stepped out the door and headed for her car and home to Bob and the kids. But she knew she would be back for more of Jeb's tongue and cock, in fact she would be back tomorrow to continue what she started\u2026"
