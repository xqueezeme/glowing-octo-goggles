        "For those who are interested in Penny's story and who have not yet done so, read my series A Strange Arrangement, the latter half of which tells her tale mostly from Andrew's perspective. \n\nContinued thanks to GaiusPetronius, whose edits were very helpful throughout this series. \n\n******* \n\nI always knew he'd come for me. My prince. He told me today that he's going to take me home soon. It won't be long now. I love him - so handsome and brave. I hope he doesn't hate me. He should hate me. I hurt him, I hurt him so deeply. I lost his treasure. \n\nBut he said he loves me and that he'll take care of me. He's never lied to me. Not with his words, at least. But his eyes were so sad. When he said he loved me, his eyes said he didn't want to love me. He has to love me. I feel bad doing this to him. I hurt him so bad. \n\n******* \n\nThey tell me I'm going home soon. Everyone seems happy for me. Even when my prince comes to see me again, he seems to smile in a way that isn't totally forced. He says I'm looking better. What does that mean? Did I look bad? \n\nHe tells me stories, stories of faraway places that he once took me to see. Stories from a long time ago. He smiles when he tells those stories, so I ask him to tell me more. I want him to smile that way when he looks at me. \n\nWhen he gets up to leave this time, I do something I can't remember doing for a long time. I reach out and put my arms around him. He looks scared at first. Do I look so bad? Then he moves towards me and opens his arms. \n\nHis embrace is warm and strong. He puts a hand gently on the back of my head. My stomach tingles and I remember other times his arms were wrapped around me, other times his hand cradled my head in that way. Times when we were not standing in a sterile room, like now. Times much more private. Yes, my prince loved me once, and I gave him everything I could. \n\nI want to tell him how happy he makes me. I try to tell him. I open my mouth and I choke. My tears are hot on my cheeks and my throat tightens. I gasp and back up. He looks at me, worried but not frightened. I've ruined it. I've ruined our happy moment. I stagger backwards and fall into the chair. Why am I here? Why can't I go home? I look up at him in despair. I hope he doesn't hate me. He really should. \n\n\"Andrew?\" I cry. He's standing where I left him, looking sad. \n\nThere's still a lot of instability, the doctor is saying to him. \n\nBut a lot of progress, too, Andrew replies. \n\nYes, she's much more lucid, but not consistently, the doctor comments. Is he talking about me? Why won't they talk to me? I'm right here! \n\nAnd you still think she should be at home? my prince is asking. \n\nIt's up to you, but I think she's ready. It might help lead her to the next level. \n\nAndrew steps closer to me and places a kiss on my forehead. I close my eyes and try to take hold of his wrist. But he's not there. The doctor is gone, too. My prince is gone again. Someone leads me by the arm to a room. They give me pills. I rest. \n\n******* \n\nI awake sometime in the morning, and I feel like I'm coming out of a fog. I don't know how long I've been here. I don't even remember much of what has gone on. I feel like I've been trapped in another life, my mind buried just below the surface, unable to really take in what's going on. \n\nBut something is different today. It's been changing, I can feel it. I want to talk. For the first time in ages, I feel like I want to have an honest to goodness conversation with someone. Oh, I hope Andrew visits today. But Andrew was just here last night, wasn't he? I won't see him today. \n\nA nurse comes in to get me ready for the day. \n\n\"When is it?\" I ask her, my voice much softer than I had intended it to be. \n\n\"What?\" she replies, seeming a little startled by the question. \n\n\"When is it?\" I repeat. \n\n\"When is what?\" \n\n\"Now. When is it... the day... the month... When are we?\" \n\n\"Oh!\" she says, grasping my meaning. \"It's Tuesday...August 21<sup>st</sup>.\" \n\n\"Oh,\" I nod, not really feeling like that answered anything. \n\nMy body goes through the motions of the day, but my mind is beginning to really observe it all. I know I have been here for some time. Has it been months? Years? For the first time, I feel... bored. There is a monotony to the routine. No one else seems to mind. \n\nI see a group of doctors and try to answer some questions for them. I try hard, but it's all so murky and confusing. And yet they seem very pleased. They dismiss me and I go to watch TV. I take my pills. I sit. Eventually, I go to bed and sleep. \n\nAnd again, the monster comes. \n\n******* \n\nHe's huge and silent. He only comes when it's dark. He pulls my hair and puts something in my mouth. He makes me do things that hurt and frighten me. I can't ever get away: the monster is too big and strong. But my mind can escape. I try to find a happy thought to cling to. I'm not really there anymore. It's just a body. I'm somewhere else, somewhere sunny and safe. \n\nI gag and cough. He's pulling up his pants and walking out the door. I'm back in one piece now, mind and body back together, crying. I should be used to this by now. It started when Hannah left home. Her eyes had turned cold and distant. We hadn't laughed together in years. After she left, she would send me letters every now and then, but they never said where she was. I understand why. \n\n******* \n\n\"Penny, do you know where you are?\" The dark woman with the beautiful springy hair is talking to me. Her voice is soft, her smile genuine. There are other people at the table, mostly men in white coats and a few in suits. But the woman is easy to look at. She's holding papers, a clipboard. She has a white coat on, too. Is she a doctor? \n\n\"Penny?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"My mind was wandering for a second.\" \n\n\"That's OK. I was asking if you know where you are.\" \n\n\"A hospital... of some kind?\" I venture. \"I don't think my mind has been working quite right lately.\" \n\nSome of the men look down and scribble on their own clipboards. They make me nervous. I try to make a joke about it. \"I feel a little under-dressed for this group.\" I force a smile and a nervous chuckle. Surprised glances around the table. One of them mumbles something about \"Self-awareness.\" \n\n\"Do you know how long you've been here?\" springy-haired woman asks. \n\n\"A few months, maybe?\" I say hesitantly. \"I'm sorry, it's all a little foggy to me. I really only remember the past few days. And then... and then before all this...\" My heart begins racing. Panic. \n\n\"Do you remember your home?\" she asks, her soothing voice tamping down the surge of fear. \n\nHome. Home was... I pictured the house where I was raised. No, home wasn't there. Home was... \"Andrew. I remember... Andrew,\" I say. \"Yes, I remember my home.\" \n\n\"Penny, we're wondering if you'd want to try to live back at home for a little bit,\" she says. I smile at the way her hair bounces. It's just a bit darker than her skin. A few dark spots on her cheeks make her look younger than she is, I think. \n\n\"You're so pretty,\" I tell her. \n\nShe smiles awkwardly. One of the older men leans forward. \"Penny,\" he says, his voice deep and smooth, \"do you like it here?\" \n\n\"No,\" I say, snapping back to the moment. \"It's so boring. All there is to do is eat, sleep, watch TV, and...\" I stop myself before saying 'masturbate,' which is what a lot of the other residents do when the nurses aren't in eyeshot. Some of them have stupid grins all the time and probably don't even know where they are or what they're doing. They're just responding to their natural urges. That, plus the boredom. I've found myself looking for chances to slip my hands unnoticed down the loose blue pants we all wear. And alone in my room every night with nothing but my thoughts... \n\nI realize they're waiting for me to finish my sentence. \"And think,\" I conclude. \n\n\"What do you think about?\" springy-hair lady asks. \n\n\"My family. My past. Going home.\" \n\n\"You want to go home?\" she asks softly. \n\n\"Yes,\" I answer, tears suddenly forming. \n\n\"It might not be easy, Penny. Things won't be like they used to be,\" she warns, her voice kind. \n\n\"Things can never be like they used to be,\" I say, fighting to keep my mind from wandering. \n\nThat's because you fucked it all up, a voice accuses me. \n\n\"No...\" I whisper. \n\n\"Hmm?\" she asks, looking intently at me. \"No what?\" \n\n\"No... It won't be easy,\" I agree. \n\n******* \n\nWe had a few more meetings like that over the next two days. They always asked what I think about, what I remember, what I've been feeling, and if anything strange has been happening. One time, in answer to the last question, I said, \"Yes.\" They all leaned forward eagerly. \"You've asked me the same questions for three days. Doesn't anyone else think that's strange?\" \n\nThere was silence for a few seconds, then hearty laughter around the table. \n\n\"Yes, Penny,\" said the white-haired old man who looked like Colonel Sanders. \"You should find that strange, indeed.\" \n\nWhen they seemed like they were wrapping up our meeting, one of the men in suits asked, \"Penny, is anything bothering you? Are you having any problems?\" \n\nNo one had asked me that in a long time, it seemed. Everyone seemed to assume they knew what my problems were. \n\n\"Sleep,\" I said. \"Sleep bothers me.\" \n\n******* \n\nHe was angry - livid - when I chose a college on the other side of the country. I made up some half-convincing reasons, but there was really only one. I had to get away from him. It took me months to start sleeping normally again. I hadn't realized how on edge I was at night. But in the dorm, I was safe. \n\nWhen I came home for Christmas, he picked up right where he had left off in August. He was rougher now, as if he was punishing me for being gone. Suddenly, sleep was a terrible thing again. Sleep was what brought the monster to my room. \n\n******* \n\nToday was odd. I remembered the whole day from beginning to end, and that almost never happens. I remembered waking up, I remembered all my meals, I remembered trying to fill my time and getting bored when there was so little to do. Then after dinner, Andrew came. We talked for a while, and he kept getting a funny look. I apologized that I didn't have much to say - my life wasn't filled with much worth talking about. He smiled at that. Then we talked about memories - stories from college. He reached out and held my hand, and his touch warmed my whole being. \n\n\"When am I going to get to go home with you?\" I asked him. \n\n\"Very soon,\" he promised. \"Today is a good day, but not every day is like this for you, Penny.\" \n\n\"I...\" My eyes went down. I couldn't remember much of the bad days. They were like gaps in my memory. I looked back up. Andrew was sad. Was he disappointed in me? God, had I ruined his life? He deserved better than to have a wife locked up in a place like this. What had his life been like these past... weeks? months? Why hadn't he moved on, found someone better, someone who could make him happy? Had he been waiting for me all this time? Did he really love me that much? \n\nYou fucked up his life, the voice said. \n\n\"I'm sorry?\" I whispered. \"You should be happy, Andrew. Go away and be happy. Please. Don't... I'm not...\" \n\nAndrew put his hand on my shoulder to shush my confused ramblings. I closed my eyes and sighed deeply. I wanted him to move closer. I wanted to feel his body on mine again. I wished we were far away from this place, somewhere private, where I could give him what I hadn't been able to for so long. \n\n\"It's OK, Penny. Don't worry.\" \n\nYou've fucked it all up. Can't even have one good conversation, can you? \n\nAndrew stayed a few more minutes and tried to tell me stories from work. Didn't he work at a bank? Why was he talking about cars? It was too much. Too much. I shook my head and held up my hand. Too much. When I looked up again, I was back in my bedroom. It was dark and Andrew was gone. Why couldn't he stay the night? Why couldn't my prince stay and protect me from the monster? \n\n******* \n\nI remembered something. I think the medicine is really clearing up my head, maybe. I was having nightmares last night, memories of my father and his abuse. I barely remember the abuse itself because my mind used to start escaping as soon as he opened the door to my room. I remember clearly only the beginning stages, before I learned to get my mind away. Once I developed that technique, my body would just do whatever he made it do, and at some point after he left, I would come back to my senses. \n\nThat must be why I never remembered him raping me. \n\nIt was all rape, of course, from the moment he first walked into my room. But he always just used my mouth or my hands... or so I thought. \n\nBut now I remember. \n\nI don't remember it happening, but one of the last nights before I went back to school, at the end of Christmas break, I think he did more. I woke up later, in pain, thinking my period must be starting early. I used the bathroom and felt the urge to touch myself. Back under the covers, I rubbed myself, thinking of some of the boys I had met during that first semester of school. But even as I moved my fingers gently around my lips, I winced. I felt extra-sensitive. I rationalized it as horniness, or sitting funny on my bike, or something else equally innocuous. And I was wet, wetter than usual. Surely I had been having an erotic dream. \n\nBut then it happened again the next night. And the next. And then, after I flew back to school, it stopped. Only now could I say for sure why. \n\n******* \n\nToday was the day. I was going home! They introduced me to Brittany, the nurse who would come help me. There was a long medical check before I left - blood samples, lights in my eyes, questions, clipboards - but knowing I was going home made it all easier. There was a point to it this time. \n\nAs we walked out the door and through the parking lot, I leaned on Andrew a bit. I was overwhelmed. It was the first time I had worn regular clothing in ages. It was hot outside, and very sunny. \n\n\"You're coming with me?\" I squeaked nervously to Andrew as he opened a car door for me. I was suddenly nervous that it wasn't really happening. \n\n\"No, Penny. You're coming with me,\" he said. His eyes twinkled. It was a joke. It took me a few seconds to realize that and to smile back. But he was already on the other side of the car, getting behind the wheel. \n\n\"Brittany will meet us there,\" he said as he started the engine. \n\nThe first few minutes, I just stared out the window. I had almost forgotten what so many things looked and felt like. Being in a car again made me extra nervous. I tried not to think about it. I tried not to think about why it was so upsetting. If Andrew hadn't started talking, I might have lost it. He told me it wouldn't be a long drive and that the house would be mostly as I remembered it. I was just dozing off when we pulled into the driveway. \n\nHome. \n\n******* \n\nThe next hour or so was tiring. Andrew moved me back into the house, and Brittany moved a little bit of her stuff into our extra bedroom. I had to look. It wasn't Noel's room anymore. Andrew had taken all of the baby stuff out and had put in an old recliner. It looked so lifeless to me without Noel or any sign of her. Brittany said the room would be fine and that she wouldn't be living there all the time anyway. Brittany. She was just a child to me. So young, so innocent. So untouched by all the sadness the world could throw at one person. I didn't envy her. I wanted to protect her. \n\nWe needed to establish a routine - where medicines would go, how to keep track of things, what our schedule would be. Andrew took a few days off work to get things set up. But to be honest, I slept much of the time those first days - slept and watched TV. I was feeling exhausted. Brittany said they had upped my dose of the new drug they were trying and that my body was just adjusting. It was good. Even though I was sleepy, I was still aware of what was happening. \n\nA few days after I moved home, I found myself alone in the house. Andrew was at work. Brittany was... I didn't know where she was. I ate the breakfast that had been left on the table for me, then I went and sat on the couch. Just the feel of those cushions evoked so many memories. The smell of the pillows, the feel of the fabric on my skin. I thought back to that special moment on that couch, the day my parents said they weren't coming to the wedding. \n\n******* \n\nWhen we began dating in college, I had told Andrew I was a virgin. I think at the time I sincerely believed I was. We had only been dating a few weeks when the topic came up. If any part of me suspected the truth, I probably wouldn't have told him anyway. I so desperately wanted him to love me, and I wanted to be everything I thought he wanted me to be. He was a virgin, too, and after I learned that, even though I was putting together the jagged pieces of my own history, I couldn't bear the thought of telling him I wasn't as pure as he thought me to be. \n\nI had planned to wait until our wedding night to have sex. Maybe I thought that waiting would somehow restore me to some innocent state that I had lost long ago. But then my parents called to say they weren't coming to the wedding. They said hurtful things and shattered my illusions that things were going to be different once I got married. Andrew and I sat on the couch in our new house and cried. Andrew didn't even know all the pain behind my tears, but somehow he carried that pain with me. \n\nEmbracing became caressing. Our lips met and I stopped caring about waiting a few more weeks until our wedding night. My fairy-tale wedding was never going to happen, which made waiting for it seem pointless. I could still feel the wetness of tears on my cheeks as I began to unbutton my blouse. By the time Andrew realized what I was doing, I was removing my bra. He pulled back and looked into my eyes. Are you sure? \n\nI shivered - the air conditioner was running high because we had been moving boxes into the house that day. I nodded and tried to pull off his shirt. Andrew helped, and soon we were lying down on that couch, the skin of his chest warm against my breasts. Our hands moved frantically, desperate to experience the excitement of touch before one of us changed our minds. All the new sensations were overwhelming us, making me dizzy with fear and ardor. \n\nHe unbuttoned my pants and pushed the waistband down just a little bit, enough to make clear his intention to move forward. I pulled my lips back and took a deep breath. Lifting my hips up, I gave Andrew the clearance to pull my pants the rest of the way down. His lips peppered my breasts and stomach with kisses as he slid all the way down, gently slipping my pants past my feet and tossing them to the floor. Standing up, he removed his own jeans with much less tenderness, kicking them aside and crawling back on top of me. I whimpered in excitement and nervousness as I realized with fresh clarity what we were about to do. \n\nLooking back, I think I was stunned. I felt a little guilty about taking that step, and maybe I thought that by not taking any active initiative, I wasn't really the one doing it. Maybe that doesn't make sense. Without me really noticing what was happening, my panties had come off and Andrew was naked on top of me. \n\nI wanted him, I wanted this. Why did I feel so scared? I started breathing fast, trying to find a way to stop this. I felt his tip poking me. \n\n\"I can't... I'm not sure...\" he said, frustrated. \"Can you... can you help me?\" \n\nI didn't move. Why did I feel so scared? \n\n\"Penny... Baby... Do you want me to stop?\" \n\nThe tone of disappointment in his voice startled me out of my trance. I shook my head. \"No... here.\" I reached down and touched it. So warm, so firm, so smooth. So intimidating. I winced as I aimed him towards my opening. I don't think I was very wet. ",
        "\"Go ahead,\" I whispered. \n\nA familiar sensation. The pushing, the pain. I squeezed my legs shut involuntarily. I wanted Andrew, but my body didn't know the difference between this act of love and the acts of violence it had always associated with those sensations. \n\nHe grunted from effort, his breath heavy as he tried to push past my entrance. He wasn't looking at my face and so he didn't see my tears. Finally, he was just inside a little bit. When we felt that first sudden bit of progress, we each let out a long breath. Andrew paused for a moment, kissing my cheek as I trembled. \n\n\"It's OK,\" I told myself. \n\nI must have whispered it out loud, because Andrew replied, \"Alright,\" and began pushing farther inside. I must have learned to keep quiet, to swallow the pain. My muted whimpers accompanied his grunts of exertion. Then he was in. I could hear the trembling in my breaths and I felt Andrew's weight, suspended by his elbows above me but still pressing down at the hips. \n\nMy mind began to wander, accustomed to seeking refuge when I was in such a position. I was remembering something else, something totally unrelated. It was a walk in the forest near my grandmother's farm. I was just a little girl and life was happy. I could almost smell the sassafras roots as we walked. Andrew's hand on the side of my breast slowly brought my attention back to him... to us... to what we were doing in that moment. This was no monster attacking me. My prince was speaking. \"Penny,\" he said softly, \"I asked if you're ready to keep going. Do you want to be on top or something?\" \n\nHis eyes searched mine - not just looking for answers but for an explanation. Maybe he sensed that something wasn't right. I wouldn't meet his gaze, not wanting him to suspect anything. But I pushed up with my hips. My eyes closed and I fought the tears. They should have been tears of joy, but the monster had taken that away from me. \n\nEvery thrust into my being made me think of him, of all those moments I had been erasing as they happened. My heart swung like a pendulum from anger to despair, from rage to fear. \n\n\"...to stop?\" his voice broke through my fog. What had he been saying? I was still moving my hips without meaning to, but Andrew had stopped. \n\n\"What?\" I asked, blinking him into focus. \n\n\"You seem really upset. Does it hurt too much? Should we stop? I don't want to make you...\" \n\n\"No,\" I interrupted. \"Don't stop, please.\" I didn't want to fail him. I didn't want Andrew to have to pay the price of my own mess. I didn't want to ruin this for him. At least one of us should be allowed to have a perfect moment. \n\n\"Look me in the eyes and tell me that, please,\" he said. \"I need to know if you mean that.\" When I didn't respond at first, he pulled out of me, and I knew he was serious. I moved a hand and turned his face towards mine. Looking into his eyes for the first time since we had started, I realized why I wouldn't look at him. I was afraid it wasn't him. I was afraid I would look and see the monster with red face puffing and dark eyes closed while he smiled in cruel pleasure above me. \n\nBut when I looked up, there was Andrew. There was my prince, my long-suffering lover. \n\n\"Don't,\" was all I could whisper. I don't know what he saw in my eyes, but it was enough to convince him. Without ceasing to look at me, he slid back in. Slid might not be the right word - I was still mostly dry and clenched tight. But after pushing and working himself forward and reuniting us as one flesh, he began moving slowly in and out. His eyes were my lifeline. For years to come, I would need to see those eyes when we made love. Those eyes showed me all the strength and gentleness and compassion and tenderness that I needed from him. \n\nThe monster was always lurking every time we made love. A careless stray thought could bring him charging back to my mind, and Andrew would no doubt feel me seize up, frozen in terror. But his eyes would heal me, soothe me, console me, restore me. \n\nFor several long minutes, Andrew's body glided along on top of mine. That delicious friction of his manhood filling me over and over gave me my first hints that sex could be a beautiful, mutually pleasurable thing. It would be some time before I felt the same kind of pleasure as Andrew felt that day, but to simply feel protected and treasured rather than abused and cheapened was a very special pleasure in itself. \n\nI could tell from his sharp gasps and whimpers that Andrew was getting close. But he seemed to be holding back for my sake. \"Go ahead. It's OK,\" I said, running my hands up the smooth skin of his back. Tilting my hips a little, I closed my thighs against his sides. Andrew closed his eyes and pushed harder. That was what he had been avoiding. He didn't want to hurt me. With a few deep thrusts he gasped, then cried out gently. I felt his pulsing inside of me, for once welcoming that sensation not as the end of my ordeal but as a precious reward for my lover, a gift only I had ever given him. \n\nAs Andrew gasped, giddy in the afterglow of his first time, I arched my back and rubbed my hands along the couch, forever associating that texture with the purest love I had ever known. I would always prefer to make love on that couch in the light of day rather than in a bed at night. The monster had spoiled beds and darkness. But there on the couch, with the sun forcing past carelessly closed blinds, I knew I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. The first time my prince conquered the monster. \n\n******* \n\n\"Penny? Penny... time to get up.\" \n\nI moved my head slowly, unsure of where I was. Then I felt it under my cheek. The couch. Had Andrew and I just...? \n\nNo. It was no such perfect moment that I was waking from. I was in my robe and it was Brittany's voice coaxing me into a sitting position. She had my medicine. \n\n\"Andrew?\" I asked, looking around. \n\n\"He'll be at work for a few more hours yet,\" she said, jotting down some notes as I swallowed the pills. \n\n\"I had the most wonderful dream, Brittany,\" I mumbled to her. \n\n\"Did you now?\" she said, sounding genuinely interested. \"That's not usually what happens when you sleep.\" \n\n\"It was more of a memory, really. Or a reminiscing that led me to a nice sleep.\" \n\n\"Well you could use some more reminiscing like that,\" she said, getting up and heading to the kitchen. \n\nI sighed and put my hands to my face. Was that all I had left? Just memories? Was there a future for me anymore? And was Andrew stuck with me like this? Had I robbed him of any future as well? I had already hurt him so much... \n\nMy hands were shaking. No... No, I didn't want to think about it. I was standing, walking, where to? I must have made some noise or something. Brittany was soon at my side... No, she was over me. How did I get to the floor...? \n\n******* \n\nDays. Weeks. Blurs. I have good times, sometimes a small string of days where Andrew and I can even talk about things. Then I have big gaps, and I find out days have passed without me knowing. I'm so afraid. I want Andrew here with me all the time, but I know he can't be. I feel ashamed to tell him how scared I am without him. \n\nLast night, I tried to give him what I know he has been missing. He didn't say anything about it, but I know it was almost our anniversary. I think he thought I couldn't understand such things yet, or that I couldn't handle thinking about them. I understand why he thinks that - what goes on in my head can't quite make it to words most of the time. I start to speak and more voices fill my head and I get confused. I can see people's faces, and I see that I'm not making sense. \n\nBut I know that Andrew and I are man and wife. I know what it means to be married. And I know my body can still function as his wife. And I know I want to feel him like that again. He came home late, and I could smell a faint whiff of alcohol, even after he showered. He thought I was asleep when he came to bed. I had waited for him. \n\nWhen he was settled under the covers and I could hear his breathing start to slow, I moved closer and put my hand on his thigh. Sliding it under the waistband of his boxers, I took hold of his soft manhood. Andrew sighed and moved his hand to cover mine. \"Mm, baby,\" he said softly. I pressed my breasts against his back and put my cheek on his shoulder. \n\n\"Happy Anniversary, Andrew,\" I said, using a voice I hadn't used in a long time. \n\nA few seconds after those words left my mouth, Andrew froze up. Pulling my hand away from his stiffening member, he rolled out of the bed and stood up. There were no lights in the room, but the nearly full moon showed me the confused expression on his face. \n\n\"Penny?\" \n\n\"It's OK, Andrew. I really want this. I want it for myself and... and I really want to do it for you. I know that...\" \n\nAndrew began pacing the length of the bed, one hand on his forehead. \"No, Penny. You... you don't understand. You shouldn't be doing this. It wouldn't... It's not right.\" \n\n\"What's not right?\" I pleaded. \"We're still married, aren't we? I'm still a woman, even if I'm not... not completely OK. I can be a woman for you, at least, even if I can't be a good wife!\" \n\nHe stopped and looked at me, struggling to find the right words. \"Penny, I know you don't understand everything that's going on right now. But you're still not well at all. The doctors say maybe someday... but... there's still a long road ahead of you, ahead of us.\" \n\nI was frustrated. He thought of me as a child, as an imbecile. \"Don't underestimate me, Andrew. I know full well what's going on. I can't stop being crazy. I can't stop him from talking to me and doing what he does to me and you're supposed to stop him but now you aren't even here! And there's a chair in Noel's room and you don't even care and you resent me for ruining your life!\" I was starting to yell. And all the thoughts and images and fears and voices were mixing together and Andrew was backing up and turning on the light. And I heard the laughter, the evil laugh. He was winning. The monster would win in the end. \n\n******* \n\nI don't remember much else from that night. I had horrible dreams. When I woke up, I found Andrew in Noel's room, asleep on the recliner. Brittany had moved out a month earlier and only came by for a few hours each day. The room seemed barren and so very empty. I wondered if we would ever turn it into a nursery again. The walls were still pink, but blue would be just as good. \n\nAndrew wouldn't come to bed with me again after that. In the days that followed, he was distant, sad. More than once I found him looking at his phone, as if he was thinking about calling someone. Or hoping someone would call him. I suspected he was debating telling the doctors to come take me away again. \n\n******* \n\nI woke up, and it was dark. I thought I heard Noel crying. I ran to her room but everything was different. She was gone. \n\nOh, God, Noel was gone! And where was Andrew? Had they finally left me? \n\nNo, they hadn't left. I had lost Noel. And then I remembered it all again. It was this night, five years ago. The truck that swerved, the tumbling. Hanging upside-down, my leg trapped. My baby crying. She would have been six this year. And the one I had been carrying in my belly that day. We would have... but it was my fault they wouldn't. \n\nI heard him laughing at me. Basket-case, he had said. Can't do anything right, he would complain. You'll see, he had told Andrew. You'll find out the hard way. \n\nHe had to stop. I had to stop it all. It was so much noise. The brakes squealing, the monster laughing, Noel crying, that inhuman grunting as he raped me... There were pills somewhere. Somewhere there were pills that would always make it stop. I had to make it stop. \n\nI ran back to my bedroom, then opened the medicine cabinet. Which ones made it all stop? I tried some, they didn't work. Maybe those? No, they didn't work. Maybe the pink ones? Why wouldn't it stop? \n\nMy throat was so dry... a bottle on the nightstand... so bitter... never liked beer... \n\nI sat down on the floor and cried. I started to feel calm again. I should get back to bed. But it's so far away. Just a short rest here on the floor, then I'll go to bed... \n\n******* \n\nHannah flipped open her laptop. This sucked. Living with two other women wasn't working out. She needed a new place, and for once she didn't feel like fucking her way into a new living situation. Opening a few tabs of apartment searches, she scrolled through her new emails. Mostly junk. Except for that one. \n\nIt was from Donna, who had stopped writing a long time ago. Even Donna had given up writing after three years with no response. Hannah would have deleted it without looking, but the subject line caught her attention. \n\nPenny's dead. \n\nHannah paused a moment, then clicked on the message. As it opened, Hannah's first thought was, Good for her. \n\nThen, just as quickly, she muttered, God damn him to hell. \n\n******* \n\nHannah wasn't much for irony, if that was even the word for it. She had watched Penny's wedding from across the street, and now she parked across the street to watch her funeral. It wasn't a big crowd, and she didn't recognize most of those in attendance. Once the cars had lined up to follow the hearse to the graveyard, Hannah pulled out and joined them at the back of the line. \n\nShe stood a good distance away, her brown coat wrapped tightly around her to keep out the mid-November chill. She missed Florida winters. She could make out Andrew among the mourners, but for some reason his fianc\u00e9/new wife wasn't present. Perhaps Isa had stayed home out of \"good taste.\" \n\nA few words from a somber minister and the crowd began to disperse. As a half-dozen or so stragglers milled about, Andrew looked Hannah's direction. He squinted and she looked away, as if she was merely wandering among the grave markers. She nervously looked back at him. He was talking to someone else. \n\n\"Hannah?\" \n\nShe was startled by a voice behind her. Turning around, she took in the round, rosy-cheeked face of a short brunette girl. Her form was mostly hidden by the thick coat she wore, but Hannah could tell that she had a fuller figure than her own wiry frame. \n\n\"Hi, Donna,\" she said casually, with resignation. \n\n\"I'm glad you're here,\" Donna said cautiously. \n\n\"Are you?\" Hannah challenged with a smile, then quickly resumed a more blank expression. \n\n\"Yes... really,\" Donna said with sincerity. Unlike her oldest sister, Donna had an air of naivet\u00e9. \n\nAfter a moment of awkward silence, Hannah commented, \"I didn't expect to see Andrew here.\" \n\n\"Why wouldn't he be?\" asked Donna. \n\n\"Because I would think he would have moved on a long time ago. I would have.\" \n\n\"Hannah, he was her husband, all the way up until the end,\" Donna rebuked her, trying to steady her emotions. \"He worked two jobs just to take care of her.\" \n\nHannah cocked her head and weighed those words. That account didn't mesh with what she had seen with her own eyes - the sassy, petite girl with the ring who had answered the door when Hannah had come to see Penny a few months earlier. Lost in thought, she didn't notice that Donna was carefully watching her, searching for the right words to say. \n\n\"Hannah,\" she ventured, \"why did you leave?\" \n\n\"Why did you stay?\" Hannah tossed back. \n\nLooking slightly angered, Donna insisted, \"It was home.\" \n\n\"It was never home for me.\" \n\n\"But we are your family.\" \n\n\"No... No, Donna, that wasn't a family.\" \n\nFrustrated, Donna pulled her coat tighter around and snapped, \"How can you say that?\" \n\nAs if the dam had finally burst, Hannah pointed back at Penny's' grave and growled, \"He did this, Donna. He killed her.\" \n\n\"Who did?\" \n\n\"Nicholas,\" Hannah hissed, so quietly that it seemed she was afraid the mere mention of the name would summon his malign presence. \n\nWith unfeigned innocence, Donna replied in disbelief, \"Daddy?\" \n\n\"Don't... call him that,\" Hannah warned sharply. \n\n\"What? Look, Hannah... I know he was... distant and wasn't very affectionate, but...\" \n\nHannah couldn't stop the tears this time. And yet her voice remained steady and terse. \"I wish he was distant and unfeeling. I wish to God he had been that way!\" \n\n\"Hannah?\" \n\n\"He's a total narcissist, Donna. He couldn't name us after himself, but he still put his initials right in the middle of our names. He wanted to mark us as his property. We only existed for his convenience, to meet his sick needs. That filthy, God-damned son of a bitch just... He just took whatever he wanted. And when I left, he took it from Penny, too.\" \n\nHorrified, Donna twisted her face in shock. \"No... No, Hannah, that's not true. You can't mean...\" \n\n\"I was a child, Donna, and he... he...\" Then as abruptly as it had started, Hannah's outburst ended. Her cool demeanor returned, and with an even voice, she continued. \"Anyway, I came to Penny's wedding - I saw you there from across the street. I needed to know if Penny was really happy. He screwed me up, Donna, and I can't shake him. But if Penny could be happy, then I knew he hadn't won. I needed to see that it didn't have to... it didn't have to be this way,\" she said, sweeping a hand down to indicate herself. \"But he wins, Donna. Penny's dead and I'm only a shell of a person.\" On the verge of tears again, Hannah looked disdainfully at her baby sister and added, \"And I don't know what the hell kind of damage he did to you for you to defend him like that.\" \n\nStunned, and blinking away her own tears, Donna could only shake her head. Eventually she stammered, \"He never... I wasn't... I had no idea. I'm so sorry, Hannah, I had no idea.\" \n\n\"Excuse me... Donna?\" a soft male voice interrupted them. Hannah kept her back to the speaker and breathed deeply to calm herself. The speaker went on, \"Thank you so much for coming all this way. You're welcome to stick around longer if you want - my house is always open to you.\" \n\n\"How's Isa doing?\" Hannah asked, only half turning towards the speaker. \n\n\"Isa? Isa's... fine, I think. She got married this summer... but I haven't seen her since she stopped cleaning my place months ago... I'm sorry, do I know you?\" \n\nHannah, grasping the extent of her misunderstanding, winced at the awkwardness, though she stopped short of regretting the names she had called Andrew after her aborted visit earlier that year. \n\nAs Hannah turned to face Andrew, Donna stepped forward and spoke. \"Andrew, this is...\" \n\n\"Hannah,\" Andrew stated, his eyes widening in wonder. \"My God, in this light you could almost pass as her twin.\" \n\n\"Oh, but you wouldn't find me nearly as agreeable,\" Hannah said flatly. She briefly considered hatching a plan to seduce her newly available brother-in-law, just to bring him down a few pegs, but a stubborn loyalty to Penny convinced her it wouldn't be right. \n\n\"Well, I'm glad to finally meet you, though I wish it was under different circumstances,\" Andrew said calmly. His voice was soft and genuine, reminding her of Wes. A pang of something like guilt struck her briefly. \"I actually have something for you,\" he continued. \"I was going to pass it off to Donna to eventually get to you, but... here it is.\" \n\nReaching into a pocket on the inside of his winter coat, Andrew pulled out a small envelope. It had Hannah's name scrawled on the front and was sealed shut. Hannah took it with a look of restrained curiosity. \n\n\"I don't know,\" he said in answer to her unvoiced question. \"Penny wrote it a month or so ago. She said it was a birthday card for you, but she didn't have an address to put on it. I forgot about it until it turned up the other day when... uh...\" Andrew paused and clenched his jaw. \"Anyway, she wasn't always... lucid... so I can't say what's in there. Might be nothing. Don't... get your hopes up, or anything.\" ",
        "\"Oh. Well, thank you... I guess,\" Hannah said, uncomfortable with everything about their conversation. \n\n\"Will you stick around, at least for dinner?\" he asked the sisters, his eyes moving back and forth from one to the other. \n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Hannah began, but was interrupted by a hand on Andrew's shoulder. \n\n\"Hey man, we're taking off, but seriously - Saturday lunch at our place. I will come and get you if you don't... Holy Sh-...\" \n\nEveryone looked at the speaker, who was staring at Hannah. \n\nAfter restraining her own surprise, Hannah chuckled. \"I was right,\" she said. \"The beard really suits you, Ernst.\" \n\nAn exceedingly awkward silence ensued. Hannah smiled at Ernst, who stared in disbelief back at her. Andrew connected the dots and whistled in amazement. Donna looked from one person to another in clear confusion, and the auburn-haired woman with her arm linked to Ernst's looked suspiciously at the threateningly sexy blonde who was smiling at her husband. \n\nHannah sized up the situation and said, \"Actually, I was just leaving,\" to no one in particular. And no one broke the silence with a response. Walking over to Donna, she reached into the young woman's coat pocket and pulled out a phone. After quickly entering a number, she slipped it back into Donna's pocket, put her mouth to her sister's ear, and said, \"Go ahead and call. I promise... I'll answer.\" Then she walked briskly to her car, head held high, coat wrapped tight.  \n\n******* \n\nHannah, \n\nHappy birthday big sister! I hope you're happy. I'm happy sometimes. I have Andrew, and I wish you would come meet him. He's my hero, my prince. He's the only reason I'm holding things together (but maybe I'm not really - haha!). Whenever I'm with him, I feel safe and at home. You should try it sometime. Maybe you already have. I wish I knew. I imagine you happy and safe, because I can't bear to think of anything else for you. You have to be happy Hannah, please. You can't let the monster win. Find somewhere, someone that can be a home and really really make it work. All it takes is one person to love you, that's what home is. \n\nAnd come find me and let me know, because if I can't hold on, I need you to be the one that gets it right. You were always the stronger one, anyway. I wish I was strong like you. \n\nMuch Love, \n\nPenny \n\nThe writing was barely legible, and Hannah wept as she read it. She read it over and over, sitting in her car at the first gas station near the cemetery, weeping until the words were blurry and her hands shook. As the sun set and lights flickered on in the houses scattered over a small ridge in the distance, Hannah pulled out her phone and dialed a number she had never intended to memorize. After a few rings, a quiet, soft voice answered, \"Hello?\" \n\nHannah winced, then held her eyes shut as she spoke. \"Hello, Wes? This is Hannah. Can we... can I come see you?\" \n\n*******"
