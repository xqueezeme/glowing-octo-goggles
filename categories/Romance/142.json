        "Thank you to GaiusPetronius for editing this series.\n\n* Donna and Steve had been talking for so long that the waitress kept coming by just to ask if they needed anything. The food was long gone, as were most of the other patrons of the restaurant. And yet the two of them continued to swap stories. That they had much in common made conversation easy. That they each seemed to never tire of the other's company made conversation enjoyable.\n\nDonna liked the way Steve would ask for more details when she was telling a story. She never caught him looking around the room, though she was sure there were much prettier women about. Even the waitress, with her long, sleek, black hair and perfect-looking svelte figure didn't distract his attention from her. Maybe Hannah was partially right. Or maybe Steve was a perfectly gentlemanly gay guy. Either way, it wouldn't take long in this town for him to find a girl (or guy) who really suited him. Especially once he started doing shows. His interest in Donna was easily attributable to her being the only person he knew in town, but that would change soon.\n\nWhen Steve finally called for the check, Donna assured him, \"I'll get this.\"\n\n\"No,\" he objected, taking the small black folder from the waitress, \"I'm old-fashioned that way.\"\n\n\"Old-fashioned?\"\n\n\"A guy asks out a girl and he pays. That's my way.\"\n\n\"So, this is a date?\" she asked with some hesitation.\n\n\"What else would it be?\" he laughed.\n\n\"You don't have to do this, Steve. We want to sign you. I don't need to be...\"\n\n\"Donna,\" he spoke her name firmly, cutting her off. \"I wanted to take you out.\"\n\n\"Well, that's... sweet. Thank you,\" she said, still not sure how to respond. Her inner voice was warning her that a guy like him wouldn't be interested in a girl like her for very long. Not when he had better options available.\n\nAs they walked the two blocks back to Donna's place, she tried to talk about what he could expect on Monday. But Steve interrupted her. \"Can that wait? I mean... I'd like you at least for right now to think of me as something other than a... a client, or whatever.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, feeling embarrassed. \"OK.\" Not knowing what else to talk about, Donna pointed out a few of the local places as they passed them. Steve listened with a smile, often watching her face as she spoke.\n\nWhen they got to her apartment building, Steve said, \"Like I told you, I wanted to take you out. And I'd really like to again. I don't know if that makes things weird, but... I'm more interested in you than in your agency, if that makes sense.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Donna said, nodding. It made sense on one level, but she couldn't really comprehend it.\n\n\"So,\" he said, prompting her. When she didn't respond, he clarified, \"Can I take you out again, sometime next week?\"\n\n\"Oh! Yeah. Yes. That would be nice.\" Then she stepped towards him and rolled up onto her toes. Craning her neck up, she placed a friendly kiss on his cheek. Steve froze. Donna, on impulse, kissed his cheek again. At the same time, Steve pressed his lips to the side of her face, as well. Then, ignoring the warning bells in her head, she rose up one more time and touched her lips to his. They kissed softly for a few seconds, his hands on her elbows, their breaths rising in little clouds on either side of their faces.\n\nDonna pulled back slowly, then lowered her feet to be flat on the ground. She stepped back, forced a nervous smile at Steve, waved goodbye, and walked swiftly into her apartment.\n\nAs she walked the flight of stairs to her apartment, she repeated over and over to herself, Don't get your hopes up. Don't get your hopes up. Don't get your hopes up.\n\n*******\n\nHannah had grit. She had done many things in her life that required determination and strength. Just surviving her teenage years, until she was old enough to leave home took courage. Making her way across the country by herself took perseverance. Each partner she left behind, each casually discarded cell phone took a measure of resolve that few people possessed.\n\nBut by far, the hardest thing she had ever done was to show up on that chilly Saturday afternoon to see Wes.\n\nEasier isn't better, she kept reminding herself.\n\nWes was waiting for her. He had reserved a table in the rooftop greenhouse of a downtown restaurant. Because it was mid-afternoon, they had plenty of privacy. Hannah appreciated the foresight that choice of time and venue showed on Wes's part. It's easier to trust someone who is looking out for you, someone who anticipates your needs.\n\nThey exchanged simple greetings and ordered their food. Hannah had decided that the only way this would work was if she said everything she could think to say while she still had the courage to say it. So while Wes was casually buttering a dinner roll, she took a deep breath and began.\n\n\"My father raped me almost every night for four years,\" she began. Wes's eyes went wide and his hands froze in place, butter still on the knife. For fifteen minutes, Hannah unloaded her story, speaking of things that she had never before acknowledged to anyone other than her sisters. Her mother's craven timidity, her father's savage cruelty, her escape, using her body to buy space between herself and her father, learning to stop feeling anything, learning to fake sentiment, Tim, Ernst, Kyle, Penny, Andrew, Donna. She told him how safe she felt with him, how she didn't feel deserving of such respite, how she wanted to pretend to be what he wanted, to want what he wanted, hoping it would become reality.\n\nTheir food came and Wes still listened. She described the great stone dam that had for years contained her fear and anger, and with them, her capacity to love and delight. She described a dry world, barren of of color and life, yet safe. She told him how each day with him chipped away at that stone wall, allowing cracks of affection to slip through. She described their last night, when, caught between dreaming and wakefulness, she mistook him for her father. The great dam, weakened by the trust and security she felt with him, was no longer sufficient to contain the reservoir of emotions. And in a great deluge, her long-repressed rage and fear overwhelmed the landscape.\n\n\"When I walked into that hospital room,\" she recounted, trembling as if she were living the moment over again, \"my thought was that you looked as bad on the outside as I did on the inside. And I knew I had done that to you. And I didn't think it was safe for me or for you if I stuck around. I blamed the... the feelings I had for you. Everything had been fine when I shut down those emotions. But once you opened that door a little bit...\"\n\n\"The good and the bad came out,\" Wes said softly.\n\n\"Exactly,\" she said, her voice even. \"And so I sat there in the hospital, paralyzed with fear. And I did the only thing I knew how to do. I put the walls back up. And I knew if they were to stay up, I couldn't be with you. It wouldn't work... for either of us.\"\n\nWes chewed thoughtfully on a bite of food, nodding as he processed Hannah's tale. Then narrowing his eyes, he asked a question that was bothering him, though he now thought he knew the answer. \"Hannah, how can you talk about this without even a hint of... of tears, or emotion or something?\"\n\n\"I've been shutting off that valve for a long time, Wes. I'm pretty good at it.\"\n\n\"That's scary.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\nWes finished chewing a bite, then said, \"I have no idea what to say, Hannah. I suspected a little bit of that, but, damn. I mean... damn.\"\n\nHannah looked at him and shrugged. \"So that's it. You want everything; that's everything, more or less. You can probably understand why I held that back from you.\"\n\n\"Yes and no. But we don't need to have that discussion right now,\" he said.\n\nHannah's face began to harden. \"And that look you're giving me right now,\" she said with a hint of anger, \"that look is one thing I hate, one reason I don't want to talk about this.\"\n\n\"What look?\"\n\n\"That look that says I'm some kind of damaged goods, some poor broken thing that needs to be handled delicately. That... that pity. I don't want that,\" she spat out, almost losing her unflinching demeanor.\n\nWes sighed. \"I'm sorry. It's a little bit of pity, yes, but not what you think. I just can't imagine how you've carried this burden alone for so long. Nobody should have to do that.\"\n\n\"I've gotten kinda used to it,\" she said calmly. Then visibly softening, she added, \"But I know I can't keep that up. And that's why I'm here. I need to be in the kind of situation we had -- a place to feel safe and treasured and... and maybe to heal a bit. That's why I'm doing all this stuff I've never done before. I'm a walk-away girl. And now I'm banging on your door in the rain trying to get back.\"\n\n\"I wish it was that easy, Hannah. But you really hurt me, and you broke my trust. And... and this is a lot to take in all at once. I need to really think hard about whether or not I'm ready to take on all this.\"\n\nHannah sniffed in derision and rolled her eyes. Her impulse was to brush it off and leave. She fought against that impulse and said tersely, \"I understand.\"\n\nAs they got up to leave, Wes moved close, leaned in, and gently kissed her cheek. Hannah never used to like such soft expressions of affection, but in that moment she cherished it, pressing her cheek towards him and longing for him to move closer, to place his cheek on hers, to wrap even one arm around her back.\n\n\"Give me a week to think it over,\" Wes said. \"No showing up at my house, no calls. Just give me a week. I'll call you either way,\" he said.\n\nHannah closed her eyes. Some days felt like an eternity lately. \"A week,\" she agreed.\n\n*******\n\n\"I'll say it again, Hannah, so you know I mean it,\" Donna said, pouring coffee into her sister's mug, then walking the pot back to her kitchen. \"You're more than welcome to stay with me.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's come to that,\" Hannah said, looking around at the small apartment. \"He'll say yes, I'm sure of it.\" It had been four days since Wes had asked for a week. Hannah was a little surprised that he hadn't called her yet -- Wes was really playing this out to the end.\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Because he's a guy, Donna,\" she answered with the tone of someone explaining something obvious to a child who should know better. \"He's alone right now, and I never said no to sex with him. He's trying to show me that he doesn't need me, that he has the upper hand, but I've got what he doesn't have and always wants, so...\"\n\nDonna paused from scooping sugar into her mug and looked questioningly up towards the ceiling. She shook her head a bit to get the bangs away from her face. \"Don't you think you're oversimplifying it? Is he really that shallow? And if he is, do you really want someone that shallow? Someone who treats you like... like an object?\"\n\nHannah gripped her mug a little tighter at that last question, remembering that the reason she abased herself and went back to Wes was precisely because he did not treat her like an object. But she still had no other categories for thinking of men and her relationships to them. It was a consumer culture, and her sexuality was her greatest commodity.\n\n\"How do you know you're not overcomplicating it?\" she retorted. \"Guys want sex. If you give them that, you have power.\"\n\n\"Is that what you want?\" Donna asked. \"Power?\"\n\n\"Well, the sex is nice, too,\" Hannah replied, her smile appearing above the rim of her mug. \"But seriously, yes, I think. Power to... to have them play by my rules, I guess. But, no.\" She put her mug down and sighed. \"That's what's so confusing. I'm finding myself wanting to try the sincerity thing.\"\n\n\"The sincerity thing?\" Donna asked.\n\n\"You know, being honest and real, not putting on an act. I had started doing that with Wes, or he kind of coaxed it out of me. Or maybe it wasn't even that much -- I think I was trying to act the way I thought I should. But then it started to make me feel just a bit different. I was scared, but I wanted more. But then he got in my head and I fucked it all up.\"\n\n\"He? You mean...\"\n\n\"Nicholas. He messed me up good, Donna. And the only reason I'm trying so hard with this guy is just to prove that Nicholas can't get the best of me in the end.\" They sat silent for a moment, then Hannah added, \"Like he did with Penny.\"\n\n\"And like you think he's doing to me?\"\n\nHannah smiled gently, condescendingly, though Donna failed to notice it as anything other than kind. \"He's got you in a different way. I bet you still haven't even made a move on what's-his-name.\"\n\n\"Steve... And I did. We've been on a few dates.\" Hannah's eyebrows went up in surprise. \"And I kissed him.\"\n\n\"Oooh, you kissed him,\" Hannah teased. \"How scandalous!\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Donna said with evident annoyance in her voice.\n\n\"Still don't think he's hot for you?\" Hannah asked.\n\n\"I think he thinks he is, but he's new in town, and I'm the only person he knows so far...\" Donna shrugged. \"I just expect he's going to move on to someone else once he gets settled. So I'm trying not to get my hopes up.\"\n\n\"Baby, you need to just...\"\n\n\"I'm not going to... to... to just have sex with him, if that's what you're going to suggest,\" she said angrily. Then softening her tone, she explained, \"I don't want to get hurt, that's all.\"\n\nHannah rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, 'cause it'll feel just fine when he moves on.\" Donna's eyes stared daggers across the table. \"Don't be so weak, little sister. He wants you. You're in control here.\"\n\n\"No,\" whispered Donna after a moment's thought. \"No, I'm not. Because if I give him that, sooner or later he moves on. I can't stop it. I can't keep them from going away. Not looking like this, I can't.\"\n\nHannah just shook her head and looked with pity at her sister. \"So. Fucking. Blind.\" she said softly, to herself. \"I hate him.\"\n\n*******\n\nThe next night, Donna and Steve were leaving a local theater, laughing at how horrible the play had been.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Steve apologized. \"I had no idea.\"\n\n\"It's OK,\" Donna laughed, leaning on the arm he had offered as they walked. \"I guess local theater is like local music -- sometimes it's great and sometimes...\"\n\n\"Sometimes it's the guy in a cowboy hat who sings the same song every week on the open mic,\" Steve suggested.\n\n\"Yes! Just like that,\" Donna replied, forgetting for a few minutes to be self-conscious around her date.\n\n\"Listen,\" Steve said, taking a deep breath to calm down. \"That went later than I thought. I had planned for us to go walking along the Cumberland tonight, but it's getting cold. Let me just drive you home, OK?\"\n\nDonna's chest tightened a bit. Was he expecting to come up? Wasn't there a certain expectation for third dates?\n\n\"I can get a cab,\" she said, not quite as nonchalantly as she had planned. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"What?\" he gasped. \"I can't let you do that. My truck's right over there. Come on.\" He pulled her gently at the elbow and Donna recoiled.\n\n\"No, really. I'm fine,\" she insisted nervously. Steve stood a few feet away, slightly stunned.\n\n\"Donna... I'm sorry... I don't know what...\" He searched for the right way to finish his sentence, but nothing came.\n\nDonna sighed and hid her face with glove-covered hands. \"No, I'm sorry,\" she forced through the barrier. Then putting her hands down limply at her sides, she smiled weakly and said, \"A ride would be nice, thanks.\"\n\nSteve waited for an explanation, but when none came, he turned towards the parking lot and started walking slowly. He didn't reach out for her arm or hand, and Donna was equally relieved and disappointed. As they rode through the quiet streets, Steve made some comments about the acting, and Donna made polite conversation in turn. But inwardly, she was telling herself, He's just a friend, just a nice guy. He's just being friendly. It's nothing more than a fun evening with a friend. He's not going to try anything.\n\nAs they pulled onto her street, Steve looked at Donna's leg, which had been bouncing up and down nervously throughout the ride.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, fiddling with the truck's control panel. \"Are you cold?\"\n\nSeeing what he was looking at, Donna stopped her leg bounce and said, \"No... I, uh... I'm worried I might have left my coffee pot on. I really want to get upstairs and make sure everything's OK.\"\n\nWhen the truck stopped, Donna hopped out and stood next to the door. \"Thanks for the ride, Steve. And, uh, for a fun evening.\"\n\nJust as she was beginning to shut the door, Steve hollered, \"Wait!\" Donna paused and felt herself bracing. \"I had a really good time. Are you doing anything Sunday afternoon? Can we take that walk then?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Sure,\" Donna hurriedly assured him. Then closing the door and waving, she ran into her building and up to her apartment.\n\nHe's just lonely and looking for a friend. She told herself, fumbling for her keys. Nothing more. He's not going to hurt you because he doesn't think of you that way. Finding the right one, she put it in the lock. But why did you have to kiss him? What the hell were you thinking?\n\nTossing her coat, gloves, and scarf on a chair, she went to the fridge in search of something sweet. After a minute, she was sitting down at the table with a small cup of pudding.\n\n\"Just you, then?\" a voice asked from behind her.\n\nDonna startled, squeaked in surprise, and spun around. \"Hannah!\"\n\n\"I wondered if what's-his-name was coming in for a nightcap,\" she said, as if it was perfectly normal to be appearing in her sister's apartment. \"I was going to stay back in the room and put on some headphones or something.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Donna sputtered.\n\n\"You said I could stay here. And you leave your spare keys on a hook by the door, which is practically an invitation for someone to grab them on the way out.\"\n\n\"You are so weird,\" Donna answered, putting her elbows on the table and burying her face in her hands.\n\n\"So... not-so-hot date tonight?\" Hannah fished.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\"I'm just saying, three dates now, right? Isn't that the longest a guy will wait these days?\" Hannah's voice almost had a mocking tone as she pressed for details.\n\n\"Steve's not...\" Donna paused.\n\n\"Don't say 'Steve's not like that,' or some other nonsense. He's got a dick, right?\" Donna made a disgusted face. \"He's got one, and he's like that,\" Hannah concluded.\n\n\"Then why don't you go fuck him and just leave me alone,\" Donna suggested in a tired voice that clearly didn't mean what it said.\n\n\"Because he wouldn't give me a second look, I bet,\" Hannah stated confidently. \"He's hopelessly infatuated with you, and I can't compete with that.\"\n\nDonna rolled her eyes, \"Well, you're right that one of us wouldn't be able to compete, but it's not me. Besides,\" she continued, swallowing her last mouthful of pudding, \"I was going to say Steve's not into me in that way.\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" Hannah laughed. But before she could continue, Donna changed the subject.\n\n\"What brings you here anyway? Wes didn't give you the answer you expected?\"\n\nHannah sat down at the table, grabbed the empty pudding cup from Donna's hands, and scraped her finger around the side. Licking her finger clean, she said casually, \"No word yet. And I'm feeling...\"\n\n\"Nervous?\"\n\n\"Horny.\"\n\nDonna's eyes widened and she put up her hands. \"No, no, no. Don't look at me, sister.\"\n\nHannah sighed and slouched. \"I didn't mean that,\" she said, spreading her arms out on the table and putting her head down. When she spoke again, her voice was muted by the table. \"I don't trust myself to wait one more day for Wes. I've been waiting for weeks already. I keep thinking about him and he's driving me crazy.\"",
        "\"Aww,\" said Donna. \"You're in love!\"\n\nHannah raised her head and said sharply, \"No, I'm not in love. I'm in heat.\"\n\n\"No, it's love alright,\" Donna corrected her. \"It's your own twisted version of it, but it's love alright. If it was just lust, you wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Shut up or I leave.\"\n\n\"It's all the same to me,\" Donna smirked, glad to finally have some leverage over her sister. She stood up and took her spoon to the sink. Then, smiling, she made a bed for Hannah in the guest room.\n\n*******\n\n\"Donna?\"\n\nSomeone... Hannah... was saying her name in the darkness. She looked at her clock -- 3a.m.\n\n\"What?\" she asked groggily, not raising her head from the pillow.\n\n\"Have you ever been in love?\" Hannah's voice was soft, slightly quavering, vulnerable.\n\n\"I'm in love with the idea of sleeping right now,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Hannah said, and Donna felt the weight of her sister's body rise from the foot of the bed.\n\n\"Wait...\" she sighed. \"I'm sorry, gimme a sec.\" Donna sat up and rubbed her eyes. Neither of the women made a move to turn on the light.\n\n\"I thought I was in love once... or twice,\" Donna answered. \"But I don't think it's love if it only goes one way. Or if it doesn't last.\"\n\n\"Slept with them?\" Hannah asked frankly.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Donna whispered, not wanting to talk more about it.\n\nHannah sat silent for a few moments, then asked, \"What did it feel like? Love, I mean. Not the sex.\"\n\nDonna sighed and pulled her knees to her chest. \"Excited. Scared. Like anything was possible. Like you want them to see your naked soul. Naked bodies are just... just a step towards something much more intimate.\"\n\nHannah thought for a minute and then asked, \"Why scared?\"\n\n\"Because everything changes. You stop being the center of your own world and suddenly everything orbits around this other person. It's disorienting. And maybe part of you knows how much this person could hurt you.\"\n\nHannah didn't speak for a while, and Donna felt herself drifting off. But then, in a voice that Donna barely recognized as her sister's, she said sadly, \"I think I am in love.\"\n\nHalf-asleep, but sensing her sister's fear, Donna said, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nHannah replied softly, \"Thanks.\"\n\nDonna heard a sniffle in the dark and a shifting on the bed. \"Donna?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You really don't see how pretty you are, do you?\"\n\nDonna bit her lip and breathed deeply. \"You wanna hear something really sick and pathetic?\"\n\n\"No. But go ahead.\"\n\n\"When you told me that Daddy had raped you... and... and Penny... my first thought...\"\n\nShe paused and breathed in, her voice shaking and her eyes watering. Hannah sniffled in the darkness.\n\n\"My first thought was, 'Why not me? Wasn't I pretty enough?'\" Donna dropped her head to her knees and cried. \"And I know that's so pathetic and wrong and I don't want to minimize all the trauma he put you through and that I should be glad he didn't touch me and I really am but, Hannah... he didn't love me at all, not even enough to notice me.\"\n\nDonna wanted and almost expected her sister to move closer and put her arm around her. She needed to be touched. But instead, Hannah stood up and headed towards the door.\n\n\"I hate him,\" she rasped, her voice saturated with venom.\n\nDonna listened to the door shut firmly behind Hannah, then sat awake in the darkness. She tried to hate her father, she really did. But she couldn't. All she felt was an ache, a hunger to be noticed and the sadness of not being good enough.\n\n*******\n\nThe next day, Donna emerged from her room mid-morning, somewhat nervous about Hannah's potential mood that day.\n\n\"When did you get up?\" she yawned to her sister, who was busily putting plates on the table.\n\n\"Sometime yesterday morning,\" Hannah replied tersely.\n\nWhile Donna considered that answer, Hannah explained, \"I don't always sleep.\" Then, as Donna nodded in understanding, Hannah added, \"And I'm pretty anxious today.\"\n\n\"Today's the day?\" Donna asked, knowing the answer.\n\n\"For better or worse,\" her sister muttered, bringing to the table a plate piled high with bacon.\n\nDonna's eyes widened in surprise at the size of the pile, and she asked, \"Are we expecting company? Like... twenty people?\"\n\nHannah shrugged and said, \"I don't much know how to cook. And... my mind wasn't exactly on what I was doing. I stopped when I ran out of bacon.\"\n\nPutting a few slices on her plate, Donna said, \"Well, I guess the leftovers will go well on salad...\"\n\nA few minutes into the meal, Hannah's phone rang. She jumped from her chair, looking at the number and washing down her food with a gulp of coffee.\n\nDonna watched her sister hurry to the living room and pace nervous circles around the coffee table.\n\n\"Hey,\" Hannah answered with feigned casualness. She twirled her hair with one finger.\n\n\"Yeah, at my sister's place in Nashville right now.\"\n\nDonna watched, frustrated at how unreadable her sister's expressions could be at times. For nearly two minutes, Hannah listened in stone-faced silence, occasionally nodding in response, even though Wes couldn't see her.\n\n\"Well that's... not quite what I expected, but...\" she said calmly, then paused.\n\n\"Yeah, I understand that, but...\"\n\nAfter another pause, Hannah lowered her voice. Donna could still make out her words, however. \"Look, if sexual tension is your concern then I don't think avoiding sex is the way to go right now. I could be at your place in twenty minutes to solve that problem.\"\n\nAs she listened to Wes's response, Hannah closed her eyes, bared her teeth, and raised a balled fist in the air. Then forcing herself to calm down, she said, \"Look, I'm not some kind of nun. I have needs, too, you know.\"\n\nAfter a few seconds, she said in a strained voice, \"You are so... so...\" Hannah was going to say 'weird,' but she restrained herself and, in a controlled, calm voice, said, \"You are so right.\"\n\nShe nodded her head as Wes spoke, then said, \"Tomorrow then. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nHannah ended the call with an exaggerated pressing of her thumb, then tossed the phone onto the couch. Watching it land, she stood in the living room for a moment, then returned to the table and put a heaping helping of bacon on her plate. Donna watched her pour syrup on the bacon, watched her take a first and second bite, and then finally said, \"Well?\"\n\nHannah looked up as if startled by Donna's presence in the room. Then, becoming more aware of her surroundings, she wiped her mouth and said, \"He wants to try dating again.\"\n\n\"That's great! Right?\"\n\nHannah shrugged. \"Like, from the beginning, from scratch. Like we're strangers. He wants to take a walk along the river tomorrow and 'get to know each other.'\"\n\n\"And you don't like that because...\"\n\nHannah looked up from her plate and answered sharply, \"Because there's no guarantee how things will turn out in the end. There's no way to know if...if this will even work out. He still might say no. I feel like... like...\"\n\n\"Like you have no control?\" Donna volunteered.\n\n\"Yes! And on that note, sex is off the table for now. It took me almost a month to get him in bed the first time. What am I going to do for a month, Donna? I have needs,\" she insisted, pointing her fork towards herself.\n\n\"What did he say when you told him that?\"\n\n\"He said that 'the essence of love is setting aside your needs for the sake of the one you love.'\"\n\n\"Aww,\" Donna smiled. \"He sounds sweet.\"\n\nHannah scowled. \"He sounds like a fucking Hallmark card.\"\n\nDonna smiled. \"In any case,\" she said, \"I look forward to meeting him. Maybe I'll bump into you tomorrow. Steve and I are taking a walk along the river, too.\"\n\nRelishing the chance to turn the conversation away from her frustration, Hannah leaned in and said, \"Oh, really? Just a friendly walk along the river with the guy who isn't interested in you in that way? Maybe I should take that to mean that Wes doesn't like me in that way either. Apparently the walk along the river is just something you do with people you don't care about.\"\n\n\"Hannah, don't be a bitch,\" Donna said politely, standing to clear the table of dishes.\n\n\"I prefer 'truth-teller,'\" Hannah said, joining her in the kitchen.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Donna murmured.\n\n*******\n\n\"Hey, isn't that your sister... uh... Haley?\" Steve asked, pointing towards a bench.\n\nDonna looked in the direction he was pointing and smiled. \"So it is. Her name's Hannah, by the way.\"\n\nWithout discussing it, they both turned in the direction of the bench where Hannah and Wes were sitting and talking. Hannah noticed them walking up, and she rose to meet them. Wes followed her lead, and when he was introduced to Donna, he looked surprised.\n\n\"I hadn't known until yesterday that Hannah had a sister,\" he said \"and one nearby, no less. I'm happy to meet you.\"\n\n\"You too,\" Donna said, sizing Wes up as well as she could. Her guess, which she later learned was correct, was that Wes had been a late bloomer. He had been the high school and college geek who had cultivated a kind and sincere personality before his looks had developed to the point of catching the attention of the women he was interested in.\n\nHannah was visibly nervous during the conversation, realizing it probably looked like she had planned for Donna to come by. But Steve mentioned how he had wanted to get out there since moving into town a few weeks ago and that Donna had been kind enough to agree to go with him. Steve and Wes chatted for a minute, but found very little common ground at first. Not wanting to risk further awkwardness, Hannah said, \"Wes, we should get walking again. I'm starting to get chilly.\"\n\nThe two couples parted ways, and Donna turned around several times to watch Hannah and Wes depart. One of those times, she caught Hannah looking back at her, as well.\n\nNot long after they had moved on, Steve cleared his throat and said, \"Donna, can I ask you a question?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she answered, her mind still on her sister.\n\n\"I'd really like to... you know... hold your hand while we walk.\"\n\nDonna was quiet for a moment, then answered, \"That's not really a question, Steve.\"\n\nHe laughed bashfully, putting his head down before looking at her and smiling. \"OK, how's this, then? Donna, I want to be more than friends. I know you could do a lot better than me, but since you've put up with me this long, would you consider... you know... dating me?\"\n\nDonna felt her chest tighten up. Internally one voice squealed in happiness while another warned, Danger! Danger! He'll leave you once someone better comes along!\n\nAfter a dozen or so steps passed in silence, Steve spoke again. \"So if I've been misreading you and the answer is no, then that's OK, I'll try not to make it awkward. But if it's yes, then... I'd really like to hold your hand while we walk.\"\n\nDonna tried to keep her rapid breathing from being too loud, but she couldn't stop the puffs of air from floating up and betraying her agitated state. She looked out at the river and wiped a tear from her cheek. She wasn't even sure what had caused it to fall. Looking ahead, she could see from her peripheral vision that Steve had slipped his glove off of the hand nearest her.\n\nYou're not the kind of girl guys stay with. It's a waste of time. Wait until you're thinner: he'll like you more.\n\nShe was used to those voices. They seldom left her alone for long. But then, unbidden, came Hannah's voice. Don't let him win.\n\nGritting her teeth in determination, Donna inhaled deeply, pulled off her glove, and took Steve's hand. It was warm to her touch, and just the feel of it made her heart flutter. Steve assumed she was shaking from the cold. In truth, she was sweating in terror.\n\nLooking straight ahead, both of them smiled.\n\n*******\n\n\"I swear, you are the most boring person I've ever known. I can't even believe we're related.\" Hannah was leaning back on the couch, holding a glass of orange juice and covering her eyes with her hand.\n\n\"I don't think I'm boring,\" Donna said defensively. She hadn't anticipated spending Christmas and New Years with Hannah, but she had played a few local shows during the holidays, and with her album almost finished, she wasn't going to fly home. Besides, she wasn't sure if should could face her father yet, not after all she'd learned lately.\n\n\"Ugh! It's New Year's Day. We spent all last night watching TV. Is this normal for you?\"\n\n\"It's normal for most people... I think,\" Donna said, trying not to sound insecure. She was also trying not to sound nervous. Steve had been booked for a series of out-of-state shows over the New Year holiday, keeping him on the road for almost a week. They had been dating for a month now, but Donna was still insecure. They hadn't slept together yet, though they had progressed to some exciting make-out sessions on the couch. During one of them, she was beginning to take off her shirt when they heard Hannah unlocking the door. Donna still didn't know how far she would have been willing to go that night if they hadn't been interrupted. But long after Steve had left, she woke up from a very intense dream and rubbed herself to such a climax that she had to roll over and bite her pillow, lest she wake up her sister in the next room.\n\nWhat still held Donna back, though, was the fear -- the near-certainty -- that Steve would soon find someone more attractive than her. And that's why she was so nervous that week. Steve wasn't alone on his road trip. Sure, he had a roadie and a sound guy and someone working promotions, but there was also Fiona.\n\nFiona was nice and friendly and perky and talented and had a good future in country music. Fiona was also a gorgeous redhead with a perfect body, a flawless face, and everything that Donna knew she couldn't compete with. A week on the road with Fiona was... well, Donna had spent the week bracing for the inevitable. She and Steve talked on the phone almost every morning, but she couldn't imagine he wasn't comparing her to the perfect specimen in the next hotel room.\n\nHe would be back that afternoon. She'd find out then.\n\n\"No, it's not normal,\" Hannah was saying. \"Most people go out and party.\"\n\n\"No one forced you to stay here,\" Donna said confidently. She knew Hannah's rant was mostly bluster. Hannah had been reluctantly learning that her former lifestyle had never made her happy. It had been mostly an act, an act that Hannah was having a hard time letting go.\n\n\"Well, maybe I just didn't want to leave you here wallowing in your insecurities,\" Hannah muttered.\n\n\"How charitable of you,\" Donna replied sarcastically. \"And when does Wes get back?\"\n\nHannah sneered at her sister. Yes, she was in a bad mood because Wes was also gone for the holidays, visiting his parents out of state. And he had been staunchly against having her travel with him. We're not at that point in our relationship yet, he had told her. Which was pretty much the same thing he had said the past three or four times she'd tried to move them towards a more physical relationship.\n\nBefore leaving on Christmas Eve, he had at least kissed her. It had been a long, gentle kiss at the door to his place. Hannah had hoped it was an invitation to take her shoes off again and stay the night, but then he broke the kiss and said, \"I'll see you in a week.\" Hannah had left there frustrated, ready to lock herself in the bedroom and release some of the sexual tension she was feeling. She hadn't even noticed that she had surprised Donna and Steve on the couch.\n\n\"He gets back tonight, but he can't see me because he has to be back at work tomorrow,\" Hannah growled.\n\n\"Tomorrow night, then?\" Donna asked.\n\n\"No. Friday. It's like he doesn't even miss me. At this rate, I bet you'll see some action before I do,\" Hannah said, mostly to herself.\n\nDonna half-smiled and shook her head. The chirping of her phone got her attention. It was Steve.\n\nHome in a couple hours. Dying to see you, but I'm going to need to crash first. Dinner?\n\nDonna sighed. Sounds good, she replied.\n\n*******\n\nSteve did not break up with her that night, but had instead been excited to talk with her about his road trip. He pressed her for advice, entertained her with stories, asked about her week, and in every way made it feel like everything was normal. Better than normal, even. He had missed seeing her, he said. They walked back to her place, talking as they went and holding hands.\n\n\"What was it like sharing a stage with Fiona?\" Donna asked. Sharing a stage wasn't the main thing she was interested in, but it was the safest question she could ask.\n\nSteve laughed a little and shook his head. \"Fiona is...\" Donna's heart felt like it stopped while Steve searched for the right words. He looked at her eyes, narrowed his own, and asked cautiously, \"Are you two good friends?\"\n\nDonna rapidly shook her head. \"We've never clicked... just a client,\" she answered.\n\n\"OK,\" Steve said, relaxing. \"Fiona is a little self-involved. It's like she thinks she's a bigger star than she is. I mean, she's talented... I get that. But please don't book me with just her again! It was painful to have to listen to her talk. Especially in that fake accent.\"\n\n\"Her accent is fake?\"\n\n\"I would put money on it. That girl is not country at heart.\"\n\n\"But she's got the look, right?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah. That'll get her far, but she...\" Steve paused and looked at Donna. When he searched her eyes, his face softened. \"Oh God, Donna. Did you think...?\"\n\nDonna was mad that she was exposed as the insecure girlfriend. She held back tears but didn't dare let herself speak. Instead, she just shrugged. Steve leaned in and held her chin with his hand. Pulling her face closer, he kissed her softly.\n\n\"I don't think I could ever be interested in a girl like her,\" he said. \"Especially when there's a girl like you around.\"\n\n\"A girl like me?\" Donna asked, trying but failing not to read into his words.\n\n\"There's only one girl like you, sweetie,\" he smiled. \"And I'm lucky I found her.\"\n\nAt that point they were walking up to her building. Donna squinted her eyes, trying to decide whether to invite him up. Just then, Steve yawned.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't get to sleep this afternoon. I still need to crash early.\"\n\n\"Friday?\" Donna asked, not realizing that Steve had not been privy to the internal process that had boiled down to that one word.\n\n\"Hmm?\" he asked.\n\n\"Can you come over on Friday? Let me make you dinner.\"\n\n\"OK,\" he said with a grin. \"What can I bring?\"\n\n\"Something sweet?\"\n\n\"I'll be over right after my meeting with Patch.\"\n\n\"Great,\" said Donna, then threw herself at Steve, almost knocking him over as she wrapped him in a tight embrace. Hannah would be gone with Wes on Friday, leaving her and Steve alone for a few hours. She would go as far as she dared with him that night.\n\n*******\n\nHannah was just pulling into Wes's driveway on Friday night when Donna called.\n\n\"What?\" she asked, slightly annoyed. She knew Steve was coming over and that Donna was nervous, and she did not want her evening ruined by Donna freaking out on her.\n\n\"Can you, um... text me before you get home tonight? Like, when you're on your way?\"\n\nHannah was silent for a few seconds. Why would...? Oooohhhh shit.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said coolly. \"I'll text you when I leave Wes's place, OK? That'll give you about a half hour.\"\n\n\"Thanks!\" Donna replied, hanging up quickly.\n\n\"Go get 'im, girl,\" Hannah said as she put her phone in the purse. She felt proud of her sister, hopeful that she was finally going to take that next step -- the step that would defy the insecurities that had been seared into her soul from childhood. So what if their father hadn't loved Donna? There were plenty of men who would truly love her, if she could only see that. Steve seemed to be one of them.",
        "Hannah was so distracted as she knocked on Wes's door that for a few moments, she wasn't even thinking about herself. She barely noticed the sound of Coby the dog whining in the garage. Wes greeted her with a kiss on the cheek, took her coat, then ushered her to the dining room table. Hannah paused to take in the candlelit scene. It was... well... romantic. She wasn't particularly into that, but she had an idea what it signified.\n\nThen she remembered the last time Wes had cooked her a meal like this...\n\nHannah's nature was to be blunt. But she had been learning to show restraint, and in this situation, it seemed wise not to confront Wes about his plans for the evening. She had learned a lot of things about him in the past month, and one of the things she had learned was to let him follow whatever plans he had made. Interrupting his plans only frustrated him. He was an engineer, on and off the clock.\n\nShe wanted to rush to the end, to finish the meal, to skip the conversation, to drag him... wait. Hannah realized that the whole process was like a tease... or not really a tease if it did finally get to the bedroom. It was a build-up. He was prolonging this, making her think about it for weeks, and now for hours. It was... foreplay. And it was working.\n\n*******\n\nDonna, meanwhile, was agitated for a different reason. Steve had no idea what she was hoping to do that evening. She knew he would like it, but part of her still wasn't sure. Part of her was scared that her body, once exposed in all its nakedness, would repulse him. He had put his hands on her body several times, even a little under her shirt. He had laughed when she called herself chubby, saying she must be joking. But just the same, she felt unattractive and undesirable. And that made sex a daunting, fearsome prospect.\n\nShe tried to distract herself by running to and from the kitchen, bringing out plates of food, more drinks, napkins, a fork to replace one that had fallen.\n\n\"Hey,\" Steve said at one point. \"Chill.\"\n\nShe stopped and looked at him. He seemed worried.\n\n\"You don't have to impress me or anything, OK? Just... sit down and hang out.\"\n\nDonna sighed and sat down. Maybe it wasn't all nerves that had her worked up. She did feel attracted to Steve and she had masturbated a few times that day, imagining the two of them together. It had been nearly five years since she had felt a man inside herself. She had to admit, she was more than a little excited at the thought of him pushing into her depths. Of closing her eyes and letting him pull her close to his naked warmth. She must have been letting her mind wander, because Steve asked, \"What are you smiling about?\"\n\nDonna shook her head clear and said, \"Oh, just... you know... enjoying being with you.\"\n\nSteve smiled. \"Me too,\" he said. \"But, you know... with you.\"\n\n*******\n\nAfter clearing away the dinner plates, Wes asked if Hannah wanted some coffee.\n\n\"I don't know, it's kinda late for caffeine, isn't it?\" she said, fishing for a hint of his plans.\n\n\"I've got decaf,\" he answered. Hannah's shoulders slumped a little. \"Or...\"\n\n\"Or...?\"\n\n\"Or you could stay later,\" Wes said, putting his hands on her shoulders and rubbing gently.\n\nFeeling her lip tremble a little -- or was she shivering? -- Hannah considered saying, Decaf is fine, just to show that she was still in control. But what she said was, \"I'd like that.\"\n\nWes gently patted her shoulders once, then went to the kitchen. Hannah exhaled loudly and undid her top button.\n\n*******\n\nDinner was finished and Donna was putting the last of the plates in the sink. Steve pulled a large tray out of the freezer.\n\n\"I bought an ice cream cake. Is that sweet enough?\" he asked.\n\nDonna's eyes widened and her mouth formed an O. \"I'll get more plates,\" she said softly. They put the tray on the table and tried to cut out a piece of the dessert. It resisted even Donna's sharpest steak knife.\n\n\"I thought these things were supposed to be able to cut an aluminum can,\" Steve huffed, trying to force the blade into the cake. Just then, his hand slipped and the knife nicked the side of his hand. He pulled his hand back in surprise and put his mouth on the wound. Donna cried out in alarm -- worried about Steve as a boyfriend but also as a musician under her management. A severed finger wouldn't be good for business. She could already hear Patch shrieking in anger.\n\nShe pulled the towel from under the tray and gave it to Steve, who put pressure on the wound while Donna ran in search of her seldom used first aid kit. Returning with bandages and ointment, she saw Steve smiling and examining the small cut. It was still bleeding slightly but was not bad at all.\n\n\"I think I'll live,\" he said as Donna gingerly placed a bandage on his finger.\n\n\"And you may even play the fiddle again,\" she said, lightly kissing the covered wound. Then, looking up at Steve's face, she leaned closer and kissed his chin, which was all the higher she could reach. Steve leaned down and met her lips with his own. They stood at the table, tongues carefully exploring as lips held fast. Steve slowly pulled his hands out of Donna's grip and wrapped his long arms around her. Donna moaned at the feeling of being surrounded by him.\n\nSteve paused to catch his breath, and he rested his cheek on Donna's shiny brown hair. With his mouth close to her ear he whispered, \"Donna, I think I'm in love with you. I hope it's not too soon to say that.\"\n\nDonna remained in his embrace and began crying. \"Please don't hurt me,\" she said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nSniffing and pulling back to look at her boyfriend's concerned expression, Donna explained, \"I'm so scared that you'll change your mind. That I won't be... enough for you.\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Steve asked, rubbing her back. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Pretty enough, sexy enough, skinny enough, cool enough...?\"\n\nSteve pulled her to his chest to stop her from continuing. \"Donna, you're so beautiful and sexy that I find you intimidating. I couldn't handle any more.\"\n\n\"You have to say stuff like that,\" she objected. \"You're my boyfriend.\"\n\n\"Do you know how hard it was for me to talk to you the night we met? Do you know how many acts I sat through, waiting for just the right comment that would get your attention and not make you roll your eyes and walk away? Do you know how desperately I wanted to meet you that night?\"\n\nDonna smiled weakly. She had forgotten about that night. \"No,\" she said, wiping her cheeks dry.\n\n\"And then when I saw you on stage, and you blew me away with your voice and your songs and your stage presence...\" Steve laughed, \"You could have been offering me a job as a back-up singer in a heavy metal band and I would have said yes if it meant following you here. All I wanted was a chance to know you.\"\n\nDonna leaned against Steve. This wasn't going at all like she had planned. She still felt scared. She still didn't know how to let herself believe him. She still thought she should wait until...\n\nNope. That was it. No more excuses. She decided to pretend, just for a minute, that she was Hannah. And so with all the assertiveness and confidence she could fake, she told herself, I'm in control here, grabbed the bottom of Steve's shirt, and pulled it off of him. She did it so quickly and so smoothly that she was almost as surprised as he was. But before he could say anything, she pulled her own sweater over her head and pushed a gasping Steve backwards towards her bedroom.\n\n*******\n\nHannah and Wes lay on his bed, most of their clothing tossed about the room. Hannah reached again for his cock and was rebuffed yet again, for the third time that evening.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he mumbled, his lips bumping against hers. Hannah moaned in frustration, but this time Wes broke their kiss and in one smooth motion slid her panties down and off. Trailing kisses down her smooth, flat abdomen, he paused just above the small triangle of hair above her slit. Hannah was panting in anticipation of this moment. It had been months... months since anyone had touched her there. She smiled, picturing cobwebs between her thighs, and a small chuckle became a cry of joy as Wes suddenly licked the length of her slit.\n\n\"Ooooohhhh, yes, please,\" she moaned, feeling a slight release in the tension that had been building for so long. Just the knowledge that this evening would be spent in bed with Wes both relieved and heightened her agitation.\n\nHannah writhed slowly on the bed, arching her back and flexing her long, thin legs over and over. She wrapped her hands around Wes's head and ran her fingers through his soft large curls. His tongue probed deeper, teasing her entrance before moving back to her outer lips. The beard. He was growing the beard again and it was just past the prickly stage. The little hairs stimulated her sensitive labia. She remembered that he had never really liked having a beard but originally grew one only because she liked it. He hated how itchy it made his neck, but he did it for her. Because he loved her.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" she whispered, smiling broadly and wishing his hands could touch her everywhere at once. She stretched out her legs and rested her calves on his broad back. She had recently learned about his kayaking hobby, something she had never known in all their months together before. His back was broad and muscular and she shivered at the feeling of his strength under her legs.\n\nWes pushed at her thighs, forcing her legs up and open even more. Hannah grabbed behind her knees to hold them in place as Wes sucked at her pussy. As he moved slowly up, Hannah's breath quickened. She was close already. It hadn't taken long -- or, actually, it had taken months. Wes's lips reached her clit and Hannah shuddered. As his tongue circled around her nub, Hannah rubbed the back of Wes's head, encouraging him to continue.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he paused and looked up at her. She looked into his eyes and mouthed, \"I'm so close.\" Wes only squinted and Hannah remembered how little night vision he had without his glasses -- another thing she had only learned recently. \"So close,\" she moaned, eliciting a smile from her lover and an eager prolongation of his ministrations.\n\nWes kissed back down her slit, licked the length of her folds, then moved back up to press his tongue against her clit. He repeated that pattern again and again, winding up the tension inside her.\n\n\"Yes, yes... yes! Yes!\" she urged him each time he pressed his firm tongue against her most sensitive spot. But he would back away for a few seconds, causing her to whimper until he returned, pushing her closer... closer... closer...\n\nThen he pulled completely back, breaking all contact. Hannah arched her head back and moaned, bracing for the next touch of his lips. Surely this next time would push her over the edge and into...\n\nOh GOD! Wes pushed firmly into her, sinking past her entrance and into her depths with one long thrust. The feeling of finally being filled magnified all of Hannah's sensations. She pushed her hips up, grinding her pubic bone against his and pushing herself into that state she had been hotly pursuing all evening.\n\nWes held still, forcing himself deep inside her as her walls clenched around him. He kissed the sensitive spot where her neck swooped into her shoulder. He carefully worked his hands around her body until she was fully embraced by him.\n\nAnd still she came. She looked up at him in adoration, realizing she really knew him, that she loved him, that he loved her, and that all of that made this more beautiful and exciting than anything else her body had experienced to date. Rhythmically forcing her hips against him, she chanted, \"Wes, Wes, Wes, Ohh God, Wes.\" His lips pulled at her nipples, forcing her thighs to clench in reflex. Every touch... every little move... she shivered, knowing she was slowly descending.\n\nHannah put her hands on Wes's cheeks, looking deep into his eyes. Panting heavily, she wanted to say something. \"I... I... I... don't know,\" she got out. \"I don't know what to say.\" Her face beamed, glistening with a thin layer of sweat. \"It was never like that before, was it?\" she wondered aloud.\n\n\"No,\" Wes agreed. \"But then again, you weren't really there before, were you?\" He puffed steadily as he began thrusting into her slick depths.\n\nHannah looked away and considered that comment. She put her thoughts on hold, realizing that Wes had been much closer than she realized. After only a minute of moving gently between her legs, he was clearly holding back.\n\n\"It's OK,\" she whispered into his ear. \"I'm here now and I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nWes's arms moved tighter against her as he groaned his release. Hannah silently counted the pulses, kissing her lover's neck with each one. No, she wasn't going anywhere. Not that night, and not for a long time.\n\n*******\n\nDonna insisted they keep the lights off.\n\n\"Whatever you want, babe,\" Steve had replied in the hastily agreeable tone of a man watching a woman prepare to undress for him.\n\nShe closed the door to keep out the light from the living room. The half-moon filtered through with enough light for Steve to make out Donna's beautiful curves as she slipped off her bra and panties. Sliding under the covers, she said, \"Yikes! These sheets are cold!\" Steve stood frozen in uncertainty until she insisted, \"Come warm me up!\"\n\nHe quickly doffed his pants and boxers, then joined her in bed. Donna rolled over onto him and they both gasped at the sensation of full body contact.\n\nDonna straightened up a bit, steadying herself over Steve. He looked up in awe at the large, smooth breasts dangling in front of him, and he cautiously ran his hands up her sides and around to cup them. Donna held still, trembling in excitement and fear as Steve touched her. Then, snapping out of her trance, she reached between her legs and took hold of his member. It was warm and solid, longer than she had experienced but no thicker than she remembered.\n\nThere would be time later to take it slow. There would be time to explore, to lick and suck and kiss and feel. But Donna knew her own fragile state of mind, she knew how easily her resolve might wither. And she didn't want her insecurities to spoil this moment. Her body was ready; her body was beyond ready. She ached for this.\n\n\"Before I lose my nerve,\" she said softly. Steve nodded in the darkness. Donna slowly ran his tip along her folds, taking in the sensation of this foreign flesh touching her so intimately. Lining his head up to her entrance, she inched herself down a little. It was more difficult than she had expected, but she continued pushing down. Pulling her hand away, she steadied herself by putting both hands on Steve's chest. Light brown hair ran from his thin, toned abs up to the top of his chest. She focused on the feeling of his hair on her skin to distract from the pressure of his cock opening her up.\n\n\"oooOOOOHH!\" Steve groaned as she sank down. He looked almost panicked and Donna wondered if their romp would be over before it even started. She paused, not wanting to overstimulate him.\n\nSensing her concern, Steve looked up and said, \"No, it's OK. You just feel... amazing.\"\n\nDonna gasped, \"You do too.\" Then she rose up a little and pushed down harder, forcing her tight channel all the way down. She felt him pressing deep inside her, almost uncomfortably deep. She sat still, breathing deeply and lightly squeezing around his cock. Steve in turn flexed his penis, the unexpected twitch making her realize just how amazing it was that a part of him was so deeply inside her.\n\nAnd he wouldn't stop touching her. From her hair and face, down her shoulders, across her breasts, around her back, all over her belly, and especially the wide hips she always tried to hide with longer shirts and looser pants. Steve's hands roamed all over her body as she held herself still on top of him. Self-consciously, Donna giggled and grabbed his wrists as they lingered on her chest.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's just so much to take in at once,\" he answered breathlessly. \"I want to touch every part of you -- it's all so beautiful. Next time I want the light on so I can see you even better.\"\n\nDonna fought back the urge to contradict him. Instead, she pressed his hands tighter against her breasts, wincing at the sensation of his guitar-string calloused fingertips on her nipples Slowly she began rocking back and forth, groaning a soft oooohhhhh as his tip stirred her depths. She was answered by a muffled moan from the man below her. Steve pushed up a little, even though it wasn't possible for him to be any deeper inside her.\n\n\"Is this OK?\" he asked softly, sliding his hands down and lightly gripping Donna's waist.\n\nDonna nodded and hummed \"Mm-hmm.\" She also lifted herself up a little bit, ahh-ing at the feeling of his crown dragging along her walls. She realized that, as long as she focused on the erotic sensations and didn't think about Steve looking at her, she was much better able to enjoy their coupling. She leaned forward, putting her weight on her elbows on either side of Steve. Her face lined up with the top of his chest, and Donna put her face just below his collarbone. He smelled musky, manly, hot.\n\nShe heard him grunting as he slowly pushed up into her, but she tried to tune it all out. She tried to focus on the feeling of her walls slowly being pushed apart, then closing, then spreading, then closing. She could move her hips in just the right way to feel a consistent, delicious pressure on her clit. She homed in on that, spreading her legs just a little more to get the feeling she needed. Little sparks of extra pleasure sent chills up her spine. Soft hair tickled her nipples and she pushed harder against his chest.\n\nMore skin. She wanted more skin.\n\nAs if he had read her mind, Steve moved his hands from her hips and up her back, wrapping her up in a lover's embrace. His hands almost covered her whole back, his long fingers spreading from shoulder blade to shoulder blade. She felt smaller, fragile, and yet... safe. Every touch communicated acceptance.\n\nYes, that was it. Acceptance. That's what she wanted. She didn't need to tune Steve out. She needed to bring him into better focus, to see that he wasn't repulsed by her or distant or distracted. He wanted her. He chose her. He loved her.\n\nAs Donna sped up her motion on top of Steve, she listened to his desperate breaths just above her head. \"Donna... Oh God, yes... Ohhhh yes... Oh God, Donna, you feel amazing... So beautiful...\"\n\nHe wasn't closing his eyes and picturing the girl down the hall, like her college boyfriend used to do. He wasn't imagining scenes from his porn collection or his fantasy world. He was making love to her, and he was loving it!\n\nAnd Donna was loving it, too. Oh God, she thought, it might really happen. \"Don't move,\" she pleaded. Steve held still, pushed up as deep as he could go. Donna had found the perfect friction and was frantically pushing against that spot. Part of her was scared and wanted to stop. But her insides felt so tightly wound up, so on the edge, she couldn't bear to think of stopping now.\n\nNo... no... no... don't... stop... she grunted as she squeezed around the shaft that was driving her towards her peak. No, she wasn't going to stop. No, she wasn't going to get scared and hide. She lifted up her head, her bangs covering her face as she sucked in air. She felt the room shake and saw flashes behind her eyelids. She teetered on the precipice, and when she felt Steve's hands squeeze her back just a little tighter, she fell over the edge.\n\nFor Donna, cumming was usually a simple, quiet moment in the silence of a lonely bedroom. Years of sharing dorm rooms and apartments had trained her to minimize her pleasure for the sake of discretion. But she was in no mind to consider discretion that night, and as her walls clenched tightly around Steve, she cried out like one relieved of a burden she had carried for ages. She wrapped her arms around Steve's torso as she trembled and twitched, her legs trying to close but finding they could only grip tighter to the man in between them.",
        "As she regained the ability to determine her movements, she rested her head again on Steve's chest, lying there until her breathing slowed and her thoughts had cleared. Steve was rubbing her bottom, slowly running his hand along her lower curve and back up again. She must have lain there in his arms for at least five minutes, until she realized he was softening inside her.\n\n\"Oh my God, I'm sorry,\" she said softly, squeezing his cock with her tired pussy. \"You need to... uh... do you want to switch or something?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Steve grunted, tracing his fingertips up her spine. \"Oh... no, I'm fine. I, uh... I kinda finished with you.\"\n\nDonna smiled. She had been so lost in her own pleasure, she hadn't even noticed that she was dragging Steve along with her. She giggled softly, thinking of past lovers' oblivion to her pleasure during sex, and how refreshing it was not to be an afterthought.\n\n\"Um, Donna... should I have pulled out or something?\" Steve asked hesitantly. \"We sort of skipped that conversation in the heat of the moment.\"\n\nRolling off of her lover and onto her side next to him, Donna draped an arm and a leg across him and mumbled, \"We'll worry about that tomorrow, OK?\" It would be a while before she could fall asleep, but until then, she watched her boyfriend doze off, a contented smile on both their faces.\n\n*******\n\nDonna heard a muffled noise coming from the floor. She stirred from her bed and picked up her pants. Pulling her phone from a pocket, she saw a message from Hannah.\n\nOn my way. See you in 30. She looked at the clock. It was mid-morning already.\n\nSteve was rolling towards her, groggily rubbing his eyes. \"Hey gorgeous,\" he smiled, eyes still squinting.\n\n\"Hannah's on her way,\" she replied with a grin. \"You can shower if you're quick.\"\n\n\"Join me?\" he said, raising his eyebrows.\n\n\"Not if we need to be quick. You go ahead.\"\n\n\"Ladies first,\" Steve insisted.\n\nDonna shrugged and headed for the shower. When she was done, she dressed and tidied up the room while Steve showered. Just as she stepped out of her bedroom, Hannah was walking into the apartment. The sisters locked eyes, then each smiled.\n\n\"Have a good night?\" Donna asked.\n\n\"Let's just say I'll be getting out of your hair sooner rather than later,\" Hannah replied plopping down on the couch. \"You?\"\n\nDonna blushed and unconsciously glanced towards her bedroom door. Hannah smiled and nodded in understanding, giving her sister an exaggerated wink and two thumbs up. Donna sighed and said, \"We need to talk details later.\"\n\n\"Oh, you better believe we will,\" Hannah agreed. \"I think we both have a lot to talk about.\"\n\nDonna headed back to her bedroom, saying, \"I'm going to make sure Steve knows you're here.\"\n\n\"Sounds good. Oh, and Donna?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Is there a reason for the melted ice cream covering the kitchen table and dripping onto the floor?\"\n\nDonna's face registered confusion, and then embarrassment.\n\n\"I mean,\" continued Hannah, \"I could think of several reasons to cover a table in ice cream, but I don't think you've quite reached that level of sexual experience yet, young grasshopper...\"\n\n*******\n\nSix months later\n\n\"...and that's about it, Penny,\" Hannah said, standing across from her sister's marble gravestone. \"Donna will be by to visit soon, I hope. But she gets car sick so easily these days. Steve's taking good care of her and is going to be a great Daddy. I can already tell he's going to be the kind of father we should have had, the kind we always wanted. I think they're waiting until after the baby is born to get married.\"\n\nShe paused, letting a few tears run down her cheeks. Looking up at the trees overhead, she continued. \"It's not easy, Penny, it really isn't. I'm not as strong as you think I am. I still hate him, and I want to just run away from it all, but I won't let him win. Donna, too. She's really the stronger one, I think. I keep walking a fine line, so close to fucking it all up again, but I've got a great safety net, now. You were right. It's so much better this way. Harder, but so much better.\"\n\nShe stood silently for a few minutes, then turned to leave. She stopped abruptly, turned around, and placed a small card and envelope among the stems of the fresh flowers she had placed on the ground in front of the gravestone. The card began:\n\n<p align=\"center\">Miss Hannah Naples and Mr. Wesley Donovan\n\ncordially invite you to the celebration of their marriage...</p>\n\nThe End "
