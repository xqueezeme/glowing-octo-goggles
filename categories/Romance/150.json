        "Geoff was awake long before the sun rose. It was the first time in years he truly looked forward to celebrating Christmas. He wandered through the house while imagining decorations everywhere. When he walked into the kitchen, he swore he could smell a holiday meal. Then reality hit. The rooms were dark... and empty.\n\nAfter he left the military, he worked hard to establish his company. With all the constant dealings, he stayed busy. There had always been a new venture, another merger. One day was the same as the next. Weeks, months, even years... they all passed while he built an empire--not for the money but because he saved jobs. It was a way of giving back, something his grandfather had done as well.\n\nHe never thought about how alone he was until he met Poppy and Robin. They brought a joy to his life he hadn't even realized was missing. Listening to the young girl made him smile. Everything in her life changed when COVID hit yet her main complaint was that she couldn't play with her friends from school.\n\nGeoff was restless. Watching the clock didn't help either. He tried to work on the house but he couldn't concentrate. Finally, he decided to clear out some of the extra materials sitting around. He put them all in the current mudroom until it was time to shower and dress. When he opened his closet, he swore. Because he initially planned to be working on the house and yard, he only packed old jeans and shirts. The remainder of his wardrobe was in his apartment. Then he remembered the casual outfits he brought back from the week he spent at his headquarters. He paired khaki slacks with a burgundy colored sweater. Carrying a dozen bags and packages, he walked to Robin's house.\n\nIn the past, Robin and Poppy opened their gifts before breakfast. Having to wait caused the seven-year-old to whine and complain. Robin held back from yelling but finally sent her daughter to her room. The mother wouldn't admit it but she was on edge. No one had joined them for Christmas since Poppy's father left.\n\nOnce Poppy had been old enough to verbalize her wishes for the day, they made up a plan, including their meals, and stuck to it. Robin didn't mind. She didn't have to figure out what to cook each year. With her daughter at the age she wanted to help decorate the house, they slowly came up with things the child could do by herself. Lost in thought, Robin didn't hear the knock on the door.\n\nGeoff shifted the packages he held and knocked a second time on the door. He had debated walking around to the front of the house but decided to go to the back the way he always did. Robin finally answered, making him think she had been in the middle of something.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Robin,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"Thank you and Merry Christmas to you too. You didn't have to get anything,\" she said when she saw all the bags and packages he held. \"That's not why we invited you.\"\n\n\"I never thought it was.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure whatever you chose will make Poppy happy.\"\n\nGeoff didn't answer. He hadn't only bought gifts for the young girl. He had several for Robin as well but he didn't want to ruin the surprise. Instead, he turned the subject away.\n\n\"It smells great in here.\"\n\n\"I thought about making something special but stuck with something simple that Poppy likes. She had so many changes to handle over the year that I didn't want to add another one.\"\n\n\"I could have pitched in, you know. I'm not the greatest cook but I can read recipes.\"\n\nRobin laughed. She tried to imagine him in the kitchen trying to make a dish just from a recipe.\n\n\"OK, so maybe not but I know how to call and have something delivered,\" he said, grinning at her as he spoke.\n\nJust then, Poppy ran into the room. Robin wasn't sure if she heard them talking or if she had been bored and just wanted out of her room.\n\n\"Merry Christmas,\" she yelled. \"Did you bring presents?\"\n\n\"I found these on my porch. Santa must have dropped them off at the wrong address.\"\n\n\"Are they for me?\"\n\n\"Well, I saw your name on the top one. Have you been good this year?\"\n\n\"I was--most of the time. Sometimes I forgot.\"\n\nPoppy looked at the floor. The happiness Geoff saw on her face disappeared. He was sure he saw a tear in her eye. He thought back to when he had been her age. How would he have managed to get through months of limitations the way she had to?\n\n\"I think Santa can forgive you this year. He knows it's been rough on all kids,\" Geoff replied, reassuring the child.\n\nRobin crouched next to her daughter. \"If I was Santa, I would say you did amazing this year.\"\n\nPoppy smiled again. She hugged her mother then moved toward Geoff. Although he had a mask with him, he hadn't remembered to put it on. However, Robin didn't say anything when her daughter put her arms around his waist. They had been home for months, staying away from anyone who might pass the virus on to them. Besides, she knew Geoff--and all the crews working on his house--always wore masks. It was time to let go of her fear and live a normal life again.\n\n\"Do you want to see our tree, Mr. Geoff?\"\n\n\"I sure do. We should put these presents by it too,\" he said, smiling at Robin as he followed Poppy to the living room. \"Maybe I should put bigger numbers on my house so Santa doesn't get mixed up again next year.\"\n\n\"Big ones, like this,\" she replied, holding her hand as high as she could. \"And put lights on it so when Santa flies over he can see them. But then he might think kids live there and forget to stop at my house.\"\n\nGeoff smiled. \"I don't think he'll ever forget where you live.\"\n\nRobin listened as she walked behind them. Geoff was so good with Poppy. As she had before, she questioned why her ex-husband didn't want anything to do with his daughter. However, it was his loss.\n\nPoppy pointed to assorted ornaments on the tree she had made. Her enthusiasm showed on her face. Geoff smiled as he took in the holiday decorations. Nothing looked expensive--or breakable. It was a tree meant to enjoy, not as a showpiece like his parents had. He found an empty spot and set everything down.\n\n\"Mama, can we open presents?\"\n\n\"We're going to eat first. I have it all ready,\" Robin said.\n\n\"I hope you cooked something good, Poppy. I'm really hungry.\"\n\nGeoff patted his stomach as he talked. Poppy giggled and took his hand as they returned to the kitchen. He didn't catch everything she said, but that wasn't new. The child often talked about several things at once. He didn't care, though. As long as she was happy, he would listen, nodding and grinning off and on as if he understood her.\n\n\"Look, Mr. Geoff. I put the dishes on the table again. Mama helped me with the tablecloth though. It has Santa and trees and presents and even snowmen on it.\"\n\n\"I love it,\" Geoff said. \"Maybe I should get one.\"\n\n\"You don't even have a real table yet.\" Poppy shook her head and giggled again.\n\n\"Ah, you're right. Maybe next year I will.\"\n\nWhile talking to the little girl, he noticed Robin went into the kitchen. He promised himself he would find time to talk to her about his life before the end of the year. He hadn't finished his thoughts when Robin called them to the table. Poppy sat in her usual spot, as did Robin. Geoff took the last remaining seat. As he looked around, he was sure if anyone saw them, they would assume they were a family.\n\nThey talked as they ate. Poppy tried to guess what was in the packages Geoff brought with him. He continued to tell her they were from Santa. Robin listened as her daughter named odd items she thought they might be. Geoff shrugged and said Santa was the only one who knew. Of course, Poppy was at the age she wasn't sure she believed there was a real Santa Claus, so she was suspicious of his answers.\n\n\"Mama, I'm done eating. Can we open presents now?\"\n\n\"We have to take care of the leftovers first. Help me and it will only take a couple minutes.\"\n\n\"I can help if you tell me what to do,\" Geoff said.\n\nWith the table empty again, they went into the living room. Poppy sat on the floor within inches of the tree. Robin curled up on the sofa. Geoff dropped onto a footstool near them.\n\n\"Poppy, before you start opening anything, I want you to remember what we talked about last night. Christmas isn't about how many presents you get. Many children won't receive even one gift.\"\n\nPoppy nodded, deep in thought, making the adults wonder what was on her mind. They waited but she didn't say anything. Robin smiled, giving her permission to open a present. Geoff wasn't surprised when she picked a large box labeled from Santa as her first choice.\n\n\"I hope Santa didn't think I was the kid when he left that at my house. He might have put something like a fire truck in there.\" Geoff grinned. \"Or it might even be some toy soldiers.\"\n\nOf course, Geoff knew it was a complete set of books recently released from a popular children's publisher. Robin watched as the pair bantered back and forth. When Poppy finally got the box open, she carefully lifted the books out, placing them in front of her as she pushed the packaging to the side. She ran a finger over the top one with care before hugging it close to her. That set the pattern for each of her gifts.\n\n\"Mama, can I give Mr. Geoff his presents now?\"\n\nSeeing her mother's quick nod, she moved to the back of the tree, bringing out a box with his name on the tag.\n\n\"This is from me and mama. We picked it out together.\"\n\nReceiving a gift never crossed his mind. Geoff held it much the way Poppy had with the books. He glanced at Robin before carefully taking the tape and paper off. The last time anyone gave him a present--other than Max and his wife--had been when he was about Poppy's age. He knew even then that his parents hadn't done the shopping. Christmas Day never held a feeling of love and joy the way it should have.\n\n\"Do you need help? I'm good at ripping the paper off.\"\n\n\"You know, I think that's a great idea. How about if we each start at a different place and see who can take the most off first?\"\n\nAs she had so often before, Robin marveled at the man's patience. Anyone seeing him with her daughter would assume he was her father. Her heart pounded as she imagined them as a family. Although she heard them talking, she didn't intrude. Poppy needed to feel special to someone other than her own mother. Geoff winked when he saw Robin watching them. She blushed, a faint pink coloring her cheeks. Both adults turned their attention back to Poppy as she ripped into the box for Geoff.\n\n\"This is... thank you, Poppy. I love it. I can't wait to hang it up,\" Geoff said when he saw the wooden welcome sign. \"This will be perfect by the back door. I'll keep it in my office until the house is done. I wouldn't want it to get scratched up.\"\n\n\"Mama, can I get another one now?\"\n\nThe time flew as the three of them took turns opening gifts. Poppy screamed when she saw a huge craft kit. Robin gasped when she saw the cream-colored purse from the famous maker Coach. She knew the prices were far higher than what she could afford even if she saved for a year. Geoff shrugged and smiled. He hugged Poppy when he opened the stack of papers she drew telling a story.\n\nThey finally had all the gifts opened. Poppy sat in the middle of hers, touching one, then another. Robin kept the Coach bag at her side, running her fingers over it when she thought he wasn't watching. Geoff stacked everything they gave him on the floor before standing up and looking down at Poppy.\n\n\"I have one more gift but I don't want you to peek. Maybe your mama can make some sort of blindfold for you. Does that sound all right?\"\n\n\"How will I see to walk?\"\n\n\"I'll carry you,\" Geoff said. \"However, I don't want your mom to see until after you do so she has to wait in the living room.\"\n\nPoppy nodded. Her eyes sparkled while her mother tied a towel over her eyes. Geoff lifted her into his arms and left the room. He hoped Robin stayed where she was. For some reason he didn't want to admit, he wanted to be the only one to see the girl's reaction. It didn't take long before he stopped.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Poppy,\" he whispered as he removed the towel from over her eyes.\n\nExpecting a scream of excitement, Geoff hadn't been prepared for silence... or tears.\n\nGeoff kneeled in front of Poppy and held her hands. \"Honey, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's for me?\"\n\n\"I built it just for you. It's even pink, one of your favorite colors. Go ahead. Look inside.\"\n\nThe sparkle returned to her eyes. Once she stepped inside, he crouched near the door to watch her. He hadn't wrapped anything yet she took her time with each item. Several craft kits covered the table. Books of all sizes on a wide range of topics filled the shelves. He stacked soft shirts and jackets on a small stand. A soft blanket draped over the chair where he put a bright pink pillow.\n\n\"I should get your mom like we promised. Are you all right staying here alone?\" Geoff asked.\n\nA quick glance his way was the only reply she gave. He chuckled as she turned from him to look at all the presents. He jogged to the back door and let himself in.\n\n\"Robin? Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"Hey, do you trust me?\" Geoff saw her nod and continued. \"Then close your eyes and I'll take you to her. Promise me you won't look.\"\n\n\"OK but--\"\n\n\"Please? Just take my hand and close your eyes.\"\n\nRobin stared into his eyes and nodded. Even though she didn't know much about the man, she was positive he wouldn't do anything that would hurt her or her daughter. She held out her hand and closed her eyes.\n\n\"Good girl. Now then, I'll walk slowly so you can follow without tripping or falling.\"\n\nHe loved the way her hand felt in his. If it had been any other time, he would have pulled her into his arms and held her close. That would have to wait. He shook the images from his head as he walked across the grass to where he put the playhouse. Once there, he stopped. Then he squeezed her hand.\n\n\"Don't open your eyes yet. I want to let Poppy know we're here.\"\n\nAs eager as Robin was to know what was going on, she did as he said. Only a couple minutes passed before she felt Geoff's hand again.\n\n\"You can open them now.\"\n\nRobin blinked a few times. She knew they had been in the backyard but nothing prepared her for the soft pink playhouse in front of her. The roof matched the one recently installed on Geoff's house. Even the basic shape resembled his.\n\n\"Mama, look! It's from Mr. Geoff. And it has books and crafts and a table and even a place to take a nap. Come and see,\" the child said, pulling on her mother's hand in her eagerness.\n\nRobin struggled to hold back her tears. It was obvious Geoff paid attention to what her daughter treasured the most. They spent the next hour drawing pictures, only going back inside when Poppy asked for a snack, which turned into a meal of leftovers enjoyed around the Christmas tree. Robin couldn't remember the last time she felt the true joy of the holiday and knew it was because of Geoff.\n\nPoppy had fallen asleep earlier than normal after the excitement of the day. The adults settled in the living room similar to how a married couple would relax at the end of the day. Geoff cleared his throat. He needed to begin before he changed his mind.\n\n\"Talking about myself isn't something I do, Robin, but I know you have questions. I can see them in your eyes.\"\n\nHis honesty settled Robin's nerves. \"Where do you go when you leave town?\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard of Holt Land Enterprises?\"\n\nRobin nodded. Although the company's base was in the western part of the United States, the owner showed up in the news quite often. They were worth more money than she could ever imagine. Their lifestyle--at least according to the media--matched that of an elite group of actors, musicians, and business owners.\n\n\"The original owner was my grandfather. My father took over when he died.\"\n\nGeoff took a deep breath as memories from his past trickled through his mind. He wasn't anything like his family and often felt as if he didn't belong. Even though his grandfather owned a multi-million dollar company, he always made time for his family. His grandmother adored the man. She did whatever she could to make his days easier. Geoff loved spending time with them. It broke his heart when he lost them. His father took over the family business and it all changed. His parents held a huge party the day after his grandfather's funeral to let people know he was in charge. He took a swallow of wine to wet his dry throat and continued.\n\n\"My father loves the attention from the media and tends to act as if he's better than everyone else. He surrounds himself with employees who never question him and jump at anything he says. My family decided I should be a lawyer. They didn't ask me what I wanted or give me a choice, really. After two years taking classes I wasn't interested in, I left school and joined the Army. I knew my parents wouldn't approve so I didn't tell them until I was ready to leave for boot camp. I haven't talked to them since.\n\n\"I have my grandfather's head for business though, and after I left the Army, I began investing in companies falling into bankruptcy that I felt had potential to grow if handled better. Ironically, I soon discovered I needed a lawyer to take care of the endless legalities. Max and I met in the service and hit it off right away even though he's quite a bit older than I am. Thankfully, I was able to talk him into working for me. The man is a genius at what he does.\"\n\nRobin sipped her wine as she listened. She was, by nature, curious. It was her way of learning about others.\n\n\"My headquarters are about six hours from here where I normally put in long days--and sometimes nights--working to turn around companies on the verge of closing and putting people out of work.\"\n\n\"That's your goal, isn't it? Helping others--not making money,\" Robin said.\n\n\"Money is nice. It makes life easier. Unlike my father, though, I care about people more than adding to my bank account. And I don't need the world trying to be my friend just because they want a handout. Seeing the house come alive again, getting my hands dirty... it feels good. Don't get me wrong. I love the business world and don't see that ever changing but I can do both. I don't always have to be at the company headquarters.\n\n\"In fact, I can work from anywhere. However, I wouldn't consider putting my employees out of work just because I decided to move,\" he said, taking another sip of wine.\n\n\"I can see how much you love what you do. It shows in your eyes when you talk about it.\"\n\nGeoff laughed. \"Yeah, I do. Nothing would be possible without my staff though. I appreciate them and compensate them well. This house was Bill and Penny's dream retirement home. When he got sick, they asked me if I was interested in it. Penny knew it would be too much for her to take care of alone. Plus, they wanted someone to restore the place with the attention to detail it deserved.\"\n\nThey sat in silence, both deep in thought. Robin realized Geoff had done all the talking while she hadn't shared anything about her own life.\n\n\"Poppy's father left when she was three. We divorced a few months later. I'm not sure if she even remembers him and he never contacts her. When we were married, I didn't work, choosing to be a stay at home mom instead. My husband was a banker so we did OK. One day I came home from running errands and found a note saying he wanted something more than the boring life we had.\"\n\nGeoff felt Robin's pain. Yet he could tell she had more to say. He refilled their glasses and waited. The night air felt refreshing. He loved the outdoors.\n\n\"I guess I should be thankful he didn't totally empty our bank account but suddenly I had a mortgage and utilities to pay without a steady income to cover them. I had always liked working with numbers so I took classes at the local college and found a job as an accountant. I don't make much but I thought the child support the court ordered Poppy's father to pay would help.\" She laughed before continuing. \"He never sent anything.\"",
        "Geoff was sure a good lawyer would be able to help her. He made a mental note to talk to Max about it and get his opinion. Then again, he didn't want her to think she couldn't handle things herself or that he was taking over.\n\n\"Some people might think Poppy and I do have a boring life. Even before COVID, we didn't socialize much other than school activities, but everything costs so much. The little I make doesn't allow for name brand clothes or new cars or trips every few months. Kids can be cruel, even at Poppy's age. The wealthy kids teased her because she didn't have the latest sneakers or jeans. She handled it far better than I would have at that age. Then came the restrictions from the virus. She struggled in the beginning--we both did--especially when the schools closed and went to online classes. There were slow changes in her but once she met you...\"\n\nGeoff nodded. He understood all too well how mean kids could be. In his case, despite attending a private school his parents chose, he dealt with bullying because he was skinny. His years in the Army certainly changed that.\n\n\"You've been so patient with her right from the beginning.\" Her words were almost a whisper. \"You'll make a great father someday.\"\n\nLost in her own thoughts, she didn't notice the look on Geoff's face.\n\n\"Without the guidelines and the masks, I would...\" He closed his eyes and shook his head. \"I care about you, Robin. I dream of kissing you, of holding you close, and more.\"\n\nShe faced him and stood, staring into his eyes as she held out her hand. He gasped as he rose from the patio chair and touched her warm skin. A haze of fog ran through his head when their lips met in a soft gentle kiss. He pulled her close to his body as his tongue slid between her lips. It wasn't enough--for either of them. Her body burned when she felt the bulge he rubbed against her until the sound of a car horn startled her. No one could see them but the intrusion reminded her where they were.\n\n\"Geoff, I... we... not out here, not--\"\n\nHis mind cleared enough to understand what she was trying to say. He leaned his forehead on hers and just held her. It would have to be enough until he could figure out how to be sure Poppy didn't catch them.\n\n\"Soon,\" he said.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe beginning of the next year wasn't any better than the previous one. Social distancing and masking continued. School boards discussed letting the children return to class but changed their minds when the number of virus cases increased again. Geoff worked on small projects in the house while the assorted professionals did the main work. Each day he looked around after everyone left and imagined it done.\n\nMax kept in touch as usual. Once again, he discovered a discrepancy in the contract of a new purchase that required the pair to investigate closer. As before, Geoff packed a bag for his stay in the city. He also called the contractor to reschedule work crews until he returned. Then he walked over to Robin's house to let her know he was leaving. He didn't want her worried when she realized he was gone.\n\nHe meandered across the countryside as a way to clear his mind. Unlike the last time he traveled to his office, he paid attention to the closed signs and boarded up buildings in each of the small towns he drove through. It wasn't only the owners of the stores who lost income. Employees did as well. However, when the government chose to increase and extend unemployment benefits, people ended up with more each week than by working.\n\nIt bothered him that he couldn't come up with any solutions. With all his knowledge of taking failing companies and turning them into thriving businesses again, he should be able to figure a way to improve the economy of a few small towns. He understood the intricacies of keeping a place running. It didn't matter if they were large or small. They all needed staff to stay open. The labor shortage could have an impact on both the growth and failures of businesses. As he often did, he tucked the problem into the back of his head, planning to ask Max later.\n\nWhile thinking of his options, Geoff felt the rumble in his stomach reminding him he skipped lunch. He pulled in line at the same sandwich shop he went to the last time he was in town. Then he drove to the office, storing his bike before gathering his food and bag. Once sitting at his desk, he took out the documents he needed and ate while reading them. Then he called Max.\n\nThe men worked for two weeks before Geoff packed up his things and went back home. Max promised to search for ways to help companies stay open without going against the virus guidelines. They knew it might require a complete restructuring for some of the owners. Yet he hoped whatever idea they ended up with, the results would be profitable.\n\nThe problem stuck with him as he pulled into his driveway. He was tired from all the late nights and long calls required to correct what seemed to be an endless list of issues. Some were due to factory shutdowns because of the virus. He hadn't been the only one who had to scramble for alternate options to stay open. With all the stores that permanently closed, he wondered how much thought the owners put into restructuring the way they ran them in order to stay open. People didn't always think about what their decisions did for others.\n\nHe took his bag from the bike and turned to go inside. The air smelled fresh and clean. A light breeze rustled the leaves on the huge oaks and maples. Instead of opening the door, he dropped his bag on the steps and walked around the property. The peacefulness calmed his mind and settled the stress of work. A stump made the perfect place for him to sit and relax. He didn't go in until the mosquitoes annoyed him.\n\nA glance at Robin's dark house made him realize it was too late to tell her he was home. It would have to wait until the next day, he decided as he closed the door behind him. Of course, he didn't know Robin watched out her bedroom window each night to see if he was home. They each slept that night with dreams of a future that didn't include a fence between them.\n\n* * * *\n\nAfter their conversation over Christmas, Robin and Geoff talked more about their pasts, including good and bad family history. They shared meals together several nights a week. Poppy helped him build some bird feeders while Robin caught up on her work. Yet Geoff still hadn't figured out a way to have Robin to himself for a night.\n\nThen the COVID guidelines and restrictions changed. Restaurants and stores opened to the public again. The world was slowly making its' way back to normal, or close to it. Poppy was thrilled to hear she could go back to school. She was so excited she screamed and ran around the yard. Robin and Geoff watched her, glad to see the little girl so happy.\n\nSchools had to devise new safety precautions for cleaning the classrooms. Restaurants struggled to get the foods they needed because of shortages. Things were heading in the right direction, yet it all moved as slow as a snail. More people were getting the vaccine to help prevent their risk of contracting the virus. Robin couldn't imagine the small stores and businesses suddenly recovering enough to open again. People she knew, friends, neighbors, they wouldn't ever have the chance to return to the jobs they had before. It was like starting over again. She wasn't sure if her own job would remain one she could do at home or if she would be required to work in the office again.\n\nGeoff continued the work on his house. Rooms torn to the studs soon had drywall, electricity, and flooring. Each time Robin toured the place, she loved it more. Although she and Geoff were even closer than before, their discussions about the future remained vague. She didn't know what he planned to do with the house once it was done. A part of her was afraid he would leave.\n\nThen the number of virus cases increased again. Poppy's school closed until it was safe for the students to be there together. She cried herself to sleep when she heard. Robin's boss called and told her to stay home to do her work. Geoff had trouble when lumber prices skyrocketed. He still had a decent sized supply but it wasn't always what the contractors needed. The house was close to finished although most rooms had final touches to do. Light fixtures waited in boxes. The bathrooms needed the plumbing done. Even though he crossed items off the list, more popped up.\n\nDuring one of their conversations, Max mentioned a vacation once it was safe again. He laughed when he said his wife decided she wanted to take a road trip instead of a cruise. Geoff promised to have a room ready for them whenever they showed up. It excited him when he thought about showing Max and his wife the house. So far, only Robin and Poppy saw the changes.\n\nThe men again discussed how to move forward with the business. Their conclusion was that he had to go back into town. As he had before, he told Robin his plans before leaving. The difficulties of the past year had been hardest on Poppy. She wasn't old enough to fully grasp what happened. When Geoff told her he needed to go back to his office for a while, she cried. She clung to him and begged him not to go. He saw the fear in her eyes and promised her he would be back. He even gave her his phone number so if she was sad, she could call him. However, he told her he might be in a meeting and not able to answer right away. She wiped her tears when he reminded her he had left before and always came back.\n\nHe thought of Robin as he backed the bike out and headed down the road. With more stores open, he decided to shop for something special for Poppy too. He already had an appointment with a jeweler near his office to look at engagement rings. Maybe he could find something for the young girl while he was there.\n\nMax noticed right away how fidgety his boss was and smiled. He might deny it, but he was in love. It showed in his eyes and by how he talked about Robin and Poppy. Despite his curiosity, he didn't ask anything. When Geoff was ready to talk, he would.\n\nThe company headquarters employed over fifty people at any given time. That didn't begin to include the subsidiaries or factories or even the companies he owned partial shares in. Each place had its' own issues to solve but Geoff didn't plan to give up until he had the best long term solutions for them all.\n\nAfter an especially long day, he checked the time, and then picked up his phone. Robin answered right away, as he expected. Just hearing her voice helped him relax. Poppy was still awake so he talked to her too. She made him laugh with her made-up stories. After the call, he swore. When he bought the house, he hadn't ever expected to live there. Now, he considered it his home--and he wanted Robin and Poppy there with him.\n\nShopping for Robin had been easier than he thought. The jeweler showed him a display of sparkling rings most women would love. However, they weren't Robin's style. Then he spotted a ring as unique as she was. The elderly jeweler explained how legend claimed that particular style ring represented a true partnership where a couple met by chance, fell in love, and became one in marriage.\n\nHe imagined it on her finger and knew it was the one. He saw the matching wedding band and nodded. Then he looked for something meaningful for Poppy. She was an important part of what he hoped would be his new family. He spotted a pink diamond pendant in the shape of a heart and knew it was perfect.\n\nThe next day he went over the notes with Max. It wasn't easy but they managed to find the solutions needed. Finally, Geoff was home again. He hid the jewelry in his dresser but knew that having the rings was only the beginning. Planning the actual proposal was next and he wanted it to be perfect.\n\nThe first morning home, he only had time to send Robin a quick text saying he would be over as soon as he had a chance. The contractor had some concerns to discuss before continuing with the work. It was late afternoon before he had any time to himself. He opened the gate and looked around. He could hear Poppy but didn't see her anywhere. A quick peek into the playhouse showed it was empty.\n\n\"Mr. Geoff! I missed you!\" She ran toward him from where she had been next to the garage. \"I was getting bored. Mama is working again.\"\n\n\"Well, how would you like to check my house with me? We can see what all the workers did while I was gone. I'll text your mom to let her know you're with me in case she comes outside.\"\n\nShe waited while he sent a quick message to Robin telling her he had Poppy with him. Then he slipped his phone into his pocket and smiled.\n\nPoppy asked about the assorted equipment and containers as they walked through the main floor. He explained it all in simple terms that satisfied her before climbing the steps. Geoff mentally went over the remaining work needed. After stopping in what was to be the main bedroom, he realized Poppy wasn't behind him as she had been.\n\nHe wandered through the rooms until he found her sitting in one of the near-finished bedrooms. She had her arms on the window ledge, staring outside. He stood in the doorway and waited to see what she did. Unsure how she knew he was there, her soft voice startled him.\n\n\"What if you don't live here forever? If someone moves in who has only boys, I won't have anyone to play with. Boys can be mean and they don't like all the stuff I do.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I'll move?\"\n\n\"You go away all the time, to where you work. Sometimes you don't come back for a long time. Mama said with the virus thing better, people can do stuff like they used to. I have to go back to school soon and mama might have to go back to where she was working before. I won't be able to see you so much or cut the grass with you. Mama said we should be happy that the germs are not making so many people sick but...\"\n\nGeoff hesitated. He couldn't promise he would stay or confirm he would leave. The decision was up to Robin even though she didn't know it yet. An image of the rings hiding in his dresser ran through his mind. Maybe this would be the perfect time to talk to Poppy about his desires.\n\n\"You know, why don't you wait here? I'll be right back, OK?\"\n\nPoppy nodded. Geoff saw the tears in the corners of her eyes. All he wanted to do was make her happy forever. His heart pounded as he took the two boxes out of the dresser. He put one in his pocket and kept the other one in his hand. It was small enough to hide by wrapping his fingers around it.\n\n\"I'm back,\" he said when he returned to where Poppy waited. \"I'm sorry you're sad.\"\n\n\"Mama says it's OK to cry.\"\n\n\"She's right. People cry for a lot of reasons.\" Geoff dropped to the floor and pulled Poppy toward him. \"Crying shows we have feelings. Sometimes we laugh so hard we cry. We cry if we're sick and yes, we do cry when we're sad.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to move though.\"\n\nPoppy cried harder, the tears dripping off her chin. Geoff felt as if he was making things worse instead of seeing her smile again. He cleared his throat and started again.\n\n\"How would you like to be part of a secret?\"\n\n\"I love secrets!\"\n\nGeoff laughed at the instant change in her. The pink box burned his palm where he kept it hidden. All the words he practiced using disappeared.\n\n\"Poppy, I haven't said it enough, but I love you. I love your mom too.\" He opened the box to show her the necklace. \"I want to ask her to marry me but only if I have your permission.\"\n\nHe knew he should have said more. He should have explained himself better. There was so much going through his head. Poppy stared at the pink heart. It was easy to see she wasn't sure what was happening.\n\n\"This is for you. A promise gift, because I promise to love you and your mom forever. Will you wear it now and go with me to ask her?\"\n\n\"If you get married, will you be my daddy?\"\n\nGeoff's throat felt too dry to speak. He barely had time to nod before she jumped into his arms. When they finally stood up, Poppy held his hand. She touched her neck and smiled when her fingers ran over the heart.\n\n\"Let's go talk to your mom,\" he said.\n\nRobin looked startled to see the pair walk into her home office. \"Is something wrong?\"\n\nGeoff had been in the small room before but never with Poppy. He held her little hand and hoped she didn't say anything before he could.\n\n\"We have a surprise for you, mama.\"\n\n\"Robin, we've never been on a date but the time we've spent together taught me one thing: I want to be with you forever. I wanted to make this special, to say the right words, and have everything perfect. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that I love you. Marry me.\"\n\nPoppy moved toward her mother and touched the necklace. \"He asked me first, mama.\"\n\nRobin had imagined what it would be like married to Geoff. She just never expected it to happen. Her mind reeled. During the brief time she stared at her daughter's neck, Geoff opened the box he had kept in his pocket.\n\n\"Say yes, Robin. We'll be a family. Once the house is done, it will be ours. The past year showed me just how important you both are to me. Each time I had to leave, I couldn't wait to get back.\"\n\nHe held out the ring he chose for her and waited. Poppy stood at his side, waiting for her mother's answer. Robin stared at the ring and gasped. Her mind was a fog of haze that left her unable to think clearly. She loved him. She knew it with everything in her. The proposal took her off guard. She hadn't expected it even though she had dreamt of it.\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispered.\n\nPoppy jumped up and down as Geoff put the ring on Robin's finger. She giggled when they kissed. Too excited to wait, she tugged on her mom's arm.\n\n\"He'll be my daddy, won't he, mama? Mr. Geoff said if you got married, I could call him daddy.\"\n\nRobin stared into Geoff's eyes. \"Yes, he will be.\"\n\nThere was no doubt the man loved the little girl. From the beginning, he had been patient with her, spending time talking to her--and more importantly, listening. Geoff was right--they hadn't ever been on a date. However, the evenings they spent together brought them closer than going out to dinner or seeing a movie would have. She was sure he had secrets from his career in the military but she accepted that. If he ever wanted to talk about it, she would be right there to listen.\n\nThe pandemic had changed many things in the world. Not everyone would recover. Businesses would struggle for months, or realize they couldn't find their way back and close. COVID brought so much negativity with it. Yet for Robin and Poppy, it brought them Geoff. Their lives would never be the same again. Soon had arrived."
