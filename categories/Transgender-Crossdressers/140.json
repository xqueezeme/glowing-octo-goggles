        "\"Where's Mackenzie,\" Tubbins asks for the third time since I scooped him up. He keeps looking behind us. The rest of the children settled into my wake when I kept running. After about a half mile, we come to the first split in the tunnel, and I set him back down. He looks like he's about to cry, and he's not the only one. I think they all can sense my unease. \"Why isn't she with you?\" \n\nI kneel down and put both hands on his shoulders while looking him in the eyes. \"Mackenzie bought us time, sweetie.\" He sniffles a little as he nods. \"And now, I am going to go back and make sure she's okay.\" \n\nRaphe and Sera talk over each other in their urgency. \n\n\"You're going back there alone?\" \n\n\"You're leaving us here alone?\" \n\n\"This is not a debate or a democracy.\" I stand up and unsheathe my sword. \"I am going back for her. You two get the children to safety. Remember the location we discussed?\" Raphe swallows hard and nods. \"Good. Make your way over there as quickly and safely as you can. Mackenzie and I will be along soon.\" They all look at me with trepidation, and I offer them a smile. \"Courage, little ones.\" With that, I spin on the heel of my boot and sprint off. \n\nSo much effort wasted on trash. On the unworthy. Amaranth's voice echoes in my head. How you disappoint me, Charlotte. If you had only trusted m- \n\n\"Shut it, Amaranth.\" My teeth grind in anger as I push her out of my mind. All that matters is my real Mistress. Nothing will keep me from her. Not you, not him... not anyone!\" \n\nI come to a stop as I hop up on the platform in the station, looking about for any signs of where those machines have taken her. Scorch marks are scattered about where I last saw her. Gods, she almost melted the concrete! That would make sense, since she was trying to distract them. Still, I heard her lay into that... thing. There ought to be three mounds of scrap with the amount of firepower she was throwing at them, not just one. \n\nSomething moans as it approaches from behind me. I reverse my grip on the hilt of my blade and thrust backward, gutting a Deadie before yanking the blade back out. I don't even bother to turn around to look as I walk over to the epicenter of the charring, and kneel down to examine the wreckage. If it took all of her casting to do this to just one of them, then I'm going to have to amend my tactics. Direct explosive attacks are out... but the things still have roughly human anatomy. I look around and find a relatively undamaged arm lying a short distance off, still intact. The blade flares, and a moment later the arm lays in two pieces, cleanly severed at the elbow joint. I smile grimly and lash out in an arc. The Deadie approaching from my left hits the ground. Twice. \n\nWith that out of the way I run to the doors leading into the substructure, stopping to survey the room once I enter. Some kind of service room? Meant to allow maintenance workers access to the building's support machinery? There's a short hallway directly ahead of me, and I can hear the faint sounds of some kind of walking machine echo back to me. I creep along the hall and peek around the corner. \n\nI can see one of them now. It's moving in a patrol along the hallway and, oh good, it's back toward me. I round the corner and slink down the hall toward it. The sentry has a little more distance to go before it reaches the next intersection. I take off at a dead run, closing the distance with my sword held out to my side and trailing fire behind it. It surprises me how easily my sabre cuts through the joint of its' left knee, and it doesn't seem to react right off as it tumbles backwards. I scramble to my feet and round back in on the thing. \"Alert! Unit compromised! Reque-\" The blade slices into the cables and hoses of the sentry's neck, and it's head flies away in a shower of sparks. \n\nThe blade's fire winks out, and I smile a bit to myself. Not bad for a showy dancer, eh Captain? I head through the door at the end of the hallway and gasp. Scorch marks! Mackenzie was here! Hold on a little longer, Mistress... I'm coming for y- \n\n\"Halt!\" Shit. Stupid, Charlotte... very stupid. \"Stand fast!\" I leap backwards as the sentry makes a grab for me, barely evading it's grasp. It lumbers towards me and reaches again, only this time it draws back a stump, it's left arm at the elbow falling to the floor with the clang. \"Halt!\" I roll under its' legs and clamber up its' back, pulling out the shotgun and placing the barrel right at the base of its' head. I let loose with both barrels and instantly regret it; the shriek of metal shearing through metal coupled with the boom makes far too much noise for my liking. \n\nI jump off of it's back as it crashes to the ground, shaking my head in disgust. All this flashiness is wasting time. I must find her, and this is slowing me down. I head up the hallway, following the scorch marks on the walls. \n\n*** \n\nI can barely hear a man's voice, low and soft as I step into the boiler room. I can see nothing yet though, the pipes and clouds of steam obscuring my view, but I can hear him all the same. I take another step between the pipes, and it's then that I can hear Mackenzie whimper. The man I hear talking... time slows to a crawl as I draw my blade. \n\nYou are not going to have any chance against Him. You know that, right? Amaranth's voice mocks me as I continue through the steam. I had only the merest shadow of his power, and look what I was able to do to you! To Mackenzie! What hope can you possibly have against him? \n\nI killed you to save her, Amaranth. This fool is not going to be any different! My Mistress needs me. She's my friend, my lover... my owner. That's all that matters now. I won't let her down, I simply will NOT. The steam finally parts ahead of me. \n\nHe's standing with his back to me, hovering over Mackenzie and talking to her in hushed tones. She's curled up in a fetal position, rocking herself back and forth. She's babbling incoherently and sometimes even screaming him to stop, though it doesn't look like he's doing anything to her. My heart leaps to my throat as I watch. \n\nThe flame imbuement stays off. I watch him for a few moments before taking a single step forward, toe down first followed by the heel. Silently I pad towards him, one agonizing step at a time. He bends over Mackenzie to say something, and I take off at a dead sprint, my sword raised high for the killing blow. My heart pounds madly as I close the distance, and only at the last moment does he turn around. His face freezes in horror as we lock eyes. \n\nThe blade sinks deep into his skull, a sound like that of a watermelon being dropped from a great height echoing off the walls of the room. Blood spurts from the wound as I wrench the blade out and watch as his body drops to the floor like so much dead weight. Good riddance to rubbish. \n\nMackenzie stirs on the floor, and I rush over to her. Gently, almost fearfully I cradle her head in my hands and lift it into my lap. \"Mistress? Mistress, please. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Yeah... yeah. I think I'm okay, Cherry.\" She reaches up and strokes my cheek with her fingertips. \"Thanks for coming back for me, babe.\" \n\nI giggle in relief as I take her hand in mine and squeeze it gently. \"I thought I had lost you there for a second. I... I don't know what I would have done if you were gone.\" I lean over and kiss her nose before setting my forehead on hers. I inhale deeply and close my eyes. \"You're the most important person to me, ever.\" \n\nMackenzie turns three shades of red and grimaces as she slowly gets to her knees. \"Gods, always with th' sappy shows of affection. We got work ta do, and all you can think of is perfessin' yer undying love to me yet again.\" She pauses for a moment and the grimace turns into a faint smile. \"There'll be time enough for that later.\" \n\nI can't help but hug her hard around her neck. \"As you wish, Mistress. So, it it over? Are we...?\" \n\n\"Nope. That dude was an honest-to-gods blood mage. He had some fucked up plans for everythin', and we figured big in them.\" She gets to her feet, almost losing her balance in the process. I grab the neck of her duster in order to help her regain her footing. \"He was gonna use us to create places where things could grow. Places that he owned, and he was gonna use them drones out there to work it tirelessly.\" She turns back to me with a deadly serious look that chills me to my core. \"Cherry, this place has ta be destroyed. It ain't just the people in it, but the machines and the means to make more! Somethin' like this can't be left alone. Nothin' can be left for anyone else like him to use. Do you understand?\" \n\nI sheathe my sword in the scabbard slung over my shoulder and nod. I start to look away but she grabs me by the shoulders. \"No, Cherry. I don't think ya do at all. I'm talkin' about Bringing. Down. The Grasp. No matter WHAT the cost.\" \n\nThere is such desperation in her eyes. Mackenzie isn't one to get rattled like this, so if this... structure has her so worked up, then it must be serious. \"Of course. I'll do exactly as you say, Mistress. What would you have of me?\" \n\nShe looks away and shakes her head slowly. \"I dunno. I know I'm gonna have to blow it up somehow, but I can't generate that kinda firepower all by myself. I'm gonna need some kind of help.\" \n\nI tap my finger to my lips. \"That rail car we hid next to, by the support beam? That was a fuel car. We can use your magic like a fuse to ignite it, and that may weaken the foundation enough to bring it all down on itself.\" I smile and look to her for approval. \"Like a controlled demolition.\" \n\n\"Well, it'll probably lot messier than that, but yeah.\" She nods and starts heading for the door. \"Come on. The sooner we do this, the better.\" I fall in step behind her as she goes and almost run into her as she stops. She turns around to me and looks at me again. This time she's smiling, but there's also tears in her eyes. It's such a bittersweet expression, and it tears at me in ways I can't even begin to understand. \n\n\"Mistress...?\" \n\n\"Cherry. Charlotte, listen to me.\" She licks her lips and pulls me close to her. \"I'm not one fer words, an' I've always preferred to let my actions speak fer me. But I've known ya for so long. You've been my best friend, you've been my lover and now you've given me th' chance to be so much more.\" She shakes her head before kissing me on the cheek. \"What I'm tryin' to tell ya is that I love ya, Cherry. I might've been able to avoid all that shit with Amaranth if I 'ad just toldja so then... but I'm tellin' ya now.\" \n\nA sob catches in my throat as I stare at her, and I can barely bring myself to answer her. \"I-I love you to, Mistress. Mackenzie.\" \n\nShe nods and smiles at me, then pushes the door open. \"Come on. We got work to do.\" \n\n*** \n\nIt takes us a little while, but we have all the flammables we can find piled up around the four huge support columns in the basement. A train, more like a large trolley, is waiting for us at the entrance to the building. Mackenzie has me manning the controls as she turns to me and gives me a thumbs up. \"Start 'er up, Cherry. Let's get the hell outta here.\" \n\n\"Right, Mistress.\" I throw down the lever and the trolley lurches forward, and Mackenzie smiles a wide, happy grin. \n\n\"'ey, Cherry... ya wanna see some REAL fireworks?\" \n\nI smile at her and nod. \"Yes, I do. I never get tired of seeing your power on display.\" \n\nHer grin becomes feral as she turns back to look at the building. We've pulled out into one of the tunnels, speeding into the black. \"Oh yeah. You just watch.\" She sets her feet as though bracing for something and crosses her arms over her chest. She closes her eyes and begins to chant. I've never seen her chant when casting a spell before, and part of me knows this is something... special. Big. \n\nFlames ignite at her head and run down her body, enveloping her whole form and making her glow with a brilliant orange hue. The flames leap higher and the glow gets brighter as her voice grows louder, the chanting becoming more like shouting now. Her duster kicks up in an arcane vortex, and a huge orb made up of oranges, yellows and reds begins to form above her. She opens her eye and laughs almost maniacally, pointing at the building. \n\n\"Finally figured out how ta direct the energy for a Holy Fire and make it an attack!\" The roiling orb streaks away from her and back towards the building, and she laughs maniacally. \"Gods! It's beautiful!!\" It's a full few seconds before the groan of metal and stone competes with the sounds of earth moving. Mackenzie freezes before slowly turning back to me. \"We... we may have used too much fuel.\" \n\n\"What d-\" The thunderous sound of debris grows louder, and suddenly my question seems like a silly one. My jaw drops as the rumble becomes deafening, and I spin around to throw the throttle open on the engine. \"We're not going to outrun it,\" I shout over the din as best I can. \"If you have any ideas, now would be the time,\" \n\nShe spins back around and braces herself against the back of the car. A jet of flame, larger than I've ever seen her make, throws the car forward even faster. I nearly fall before catching myself against the doorframe to the cab. The dust cloud begins to overtake us, and I know that the heavier stuff will follow soon. I start to head over to where she is standing. She turns to yell at me, but the words are lost in the deafening roar. \n\nThe world around me shakes violently, the sounds and sensations overwhelming me as I scream despite myself. I glance up as we explode back out of the debris cloud. It expanded outward into the open space of another hub. No sooner do I see that than we careen into another tunnel on the other side. The tunnel entrance behind us fades to a pinprick. Mackenzie slumps over against the railing. The roar of the wind overtakes everything else as we hurtle up a slight incline and out into daylight. A distant part of my brain tells me we just cruised past the outskirts of the Valhavia district to be above ground. Three miles in the longest, scariest minute of my life. \n\nMackenzie looks around blankly for a moment, then a slow, wide grin spreads across her face, stretching from ear to ear. She looks at me and pants, leaning back against the railing and putting her hands behind her head. Her hair blows about in the wind, and I swear she's never been as beautiful as she is right now. I can't help but return the smile as I fold my hands in front of my body. \n\n*** \n\nThe swell of my belly is more pronounced these days, and it's a little hard getting around. If you had told me when I was Tony that I would know what morning sickness is like, I would have laughed you out of the room. It's okay, though. All of the pieces have finally fallen into place, and I know what my true place in this world is. I bite my lip and run my hand in a slow swirl over where I just felt a kick. \n\nI open the cabinet and put away the cup I just finished drying while Mackenzie curses from down the hall at some bit of machinery that isn't doing exactly what she wants it to. She's a little more cross than usual. I chuckle softly to myself for a moment, then gasp as I can feel the baby kick again, harder. Ooh, he's a feisty one! Takes after his father, I suppose. Patience, little one. You'll get to explore the world soon enough! \n\nI reach into the cabinet to put away a bowl, when a shooting pain runs up my arm. Oh, that hurt! I've got to get back into shape after the baby comes. I've let myself go a bit since I started to swell. No excuse for being lazy, now. \n\nMackenzie comes in and pours herself a cup of coffee before sitting down at the table. \"Fuckin' drive shaft. Would you believe that piece o' shit torqued another one ta shreds? ...I guess I'll just have some coffee since someone won't let me have a cigarette.\" She shoots me an irritated look over her cup as she takes a sip. \n\n\"It's not good for the baby, Mistress. You'll just have to learn to deal with it.\" I smile back at her before reaching to put away another dish. The pain is worse this time, and I gasp in surprise at it's strength. \n\nMackenzie arches an eyebrow and sets her cup down. \"You know, I'm not sure I want you doin' things like chores this far along. Maybe you oughta take it easy, let someone else do the work fer a while. That's what we have all these little jerks for, ain't it?\" \n\n\"Hey,\" Tubbins says, frowning. Mackenzie ruffles his hair playfully. \n\n\"It's fine, Mistress. It's not anything that we should be worried about.\" I frown at her and lean up against the counter. \"Besides, you and those little jerks wouldn't pick up after yourselves to save your life.\" \n\n\"Smartass. I'm just sayin' is all.\" \n\n\"Yeah, smartass.\" Tubbins mimics her right down to her tone. \n\n\"TUBBINS! You watch your mouth.\" He scurries behind Mackenzie as I scold him. \"Such language, and a certain adult should know better than to use it in front of children, too.\" \n\n\"Aw, c'mon! 's nothin' he hadn't heard before.\" Mackenzie laughs and leans back in her chair. \"No harm done.\" \n\n\"Momma, can I have a cookie? You said that if I was good, I could have a cookie.\" Tubbins comes around from behind her and pleads with me, looking up at me with those adorable puppy-dog eyes. \n\n\"Of course, sweetie. Language aside, you have been a good boy.\" I reach into the cupboard to get the container of cookies. The pain nearly blinds me this time, and I drop it to the floor below. Porcelain shatters and cookies roll everywhere. I bite my lip and hiss. \"My arm!\" \n\n\"That does it. Cherry, no more chores for you. This ain't normal.\" Mackenzie is up and at my side, both hands on my shoulders. \"C'mon. We're getting you to a doctor.\" \n\n\"It... it'll be okay. Perhaps I just need a little rest.\" I brace myself against the counter for support. \"There's no need to bother a doctor about something like this.\" \n\nMackenzie looks at me dubiously. \"Okay,\" she says tentatively. \"Trust your instincts, Charlotte. You know best.\" She gives my shoulders a squeeze and goes to clean up the mess. \"C'mon, squirt. Help me with this and I'll get ya somethin' else.\" \n\nTrust your instincts, Charlotte. I can hear Mackenzie's voice echo softly, and see her sad smile in my mind's eye. Suddenly, everything seems off. It feels like I am here, and yet not really. But why? We have a wonderful life now. Everything is as how it should be. Everything is perfect. \n\nPerfect. Like a dream come true. Haven't we earned that? \n\nIt hits me with the force of a thunderclap. Too perfect. Nothing ever shapes up precisely the way we want it to, and this feels like someone has granted every small wish I've ever wished for. As if they're trying to distract me from something important. None of this is real. I look around as, one by one, the images of this idyllic life fade into nothingness. The bright sunlit room turns gray, pipes materialize out of the walls and steam hisses in the background. \n\n*** \n\nMy sword is held high as I lunge in. I can see the surprise in his eyes as I bring the sabre down in a brutal swipe. It sinks deep into his skull, a sound like that of a watermelon being dropped from a great height echoes off the walls. Blood spurts from the wound as I wrench the blade out and watch as his body drops to the floor like so much dead weight. I spit on his corpse. \n\nI run over to Mackenzie, lying curled up on the floor in a fetal position. She isn't moving. Kneeling down, I pull her head into my lap and try to rouse her. \"Mistress. Mistress, please... answer me.\" ",
        "She looks up at the ceiling with her unseeing eye, her mouth working but not making a sound. \"Mistress. Mackenzie, please.\" \n\n\"Maggots. In the...\" She winks a few times. \"In the...\" \n\nSomething is wrong... No. No. She just needs a little more time for things to clear up. \"Mistress, you're not making any sense.\" I stroke her cheek gently and help her sit up. \"We need to get going. We can't stay here.\" She's dead weight in my arms, unmoving.. \n\n\"...\" She says nothing, only stares across the room. Her jaw works wordlessly as she gazes off into the distance. She looks absolutely haggard. \n\n\"Mackenzie?! Please! Now is not the time for play!\" I shake her a little, hoping that will rouse her out of... out of this. \n\n\"...\" Nothing. No response at all. I find myself wishing for the dream again. \n\nTears start to flow, and I touch my forehead to hers. \"Please!! For the love of the Gods, Mistress... Please Wake Up!\" \n\n\"...\" \n\n\"Mackenzie,\" I say sniffling, \"get up. Get up.\" Nothing. I try to mimic her posture, but the sobbing undercuts my authority. \"Mackenzie, you awful slut get up!\" \n\n\"...\" \n\nI slap her. Her head whirls to the side and remains there, as if staring in that direction is no more or less important. \"Mackenzie!! Please!\" I slap her again. I cry. She just sits there mumbling. \n\nMaybe... perhaps if I can get her out of here and into more comfortable settings, then I can... Possessed with the idea, I wrap her arm around behind my neck and hoist her up. Dragging her along with me is slow going as we make our way out into the hall. \n\nWe limp to the platform. The area still seems empty, and I laugh lightly. \"I'll bet they're still running, Mistress!\" She cooes like a baby in response and drools a little. I'm going to have to find something; I can't carry her all the way to Tournesol's like this. \n\nWe round the corner, and my heart skips a beat. Baron Rasputin is slowly descending down the massive marble staircase, clapping sarcastically the whole while. There doesn't appear to be anyone with him, but that doesn't comfort me in the least. \n\n\"Well, well well, now! It looks like the trash has somehow managed to do what we couldn't.\" He comes to a stop at the base of the stairs and laughs cruelly. \"Do you have any idea how long some of us have been trying to do what you just pulled off? I mean, how do you deal with someone who can kill with a thought, or make your assassins reveal who they work for?\" \n\nI say nothing to him as I watch him. All I see is someone who needs to die. \n\n\"You know, there used to be ten noble houses here in New Verdia. Powerful families, all of them. He eliminated two of them outright, and over the course of a year purged another four as they tried to rebel against him.\" He shakes his head and chuckles a bit. \"It was a bloodbath all around.\" \n\n\"And this was what it was all about.\" He spreads his hands wide to encompass everything around him. \"Not just this place, mind you. The power vacuum his death would leave behind. The resources to turn the weak and ordinary into those magnificent machines you got only the smallest taste of. The access to true power. And it's all here, just waiting for me to pick it up and make it mine.\" \n\nNothin' can be left for anyone else like him to use. Mackenzie's voice echoes in my head. At the time, I didn't understand what she had meant. It has to end here. This stranglehold they have on everything must be broken. \n\nI ease her down and prop her up against the wall before turning to face him. He sneers at me and laughs contemptuously. \"You know, I didn't think the little pyromaniac had it in her to be able to kill him.\" He unsheathes his bastard sword and holds it to his side at the ready. \"I mean, it had to be her, right? It couldn't possibly have been you. You're just a toy; a pathetic little shit who can't even do it's own thinking for itself.\" \n\nI unsheathe my blade and twirl it up into position over my head. He boggles for a moment and starts to laugh uproariously. \"Oh, please! You mean to tell me it thinks it can fight?\" He wipes a tear away from his eye and sighs. \"Let me tell you what's going to happen, creature. I'm going to run you through without breaking a sweat. The firebug is going to die painfully after that, and then I'm going to claim what is rightfully mine.\" He grins and brings his sword up in front of him. \"I should thank her before I do, though. She gave me quite the gift when she took him ou-\" \n\nI sprint, shrieking, at him, my sword flaming brightly and trailing fire. He barely manages to parry the attack, shock written all over his face as he backpedals quickly away. The advantage is mine to take as I strike again, this time with a thrust meant to gut him. He spins out of the way and brings his blade up and around to take my head. His strike catches nothing but air as I duck under the swing and pop right back up, slugging him in the face and staggering him back a bit. He leaps backwards in order to create some breathing room between us. \n\n\"You're... you're shitting me.\" He wipes the blood trickling from his mouth and starts to smile. \"Well, now I know how Amaranth died. Maybe it wasn't that red-haired bitch that killed him. Maybe it was you.\" \n\nI pull the shotgun out of the holster and take aim. His jaw drops as he frantically grabs at a device hanging on his belt. The round ricochets off of some kind of shield and whines off into the distance. \"You dishonorable sack of shit! You would use a gun in our fight?! Have you no honor?\" \n\n\"I'm interested in killing you, not fighting.\" The shotgun stays out as I charge him yet again, both weapons held out to my sides as I close the distance. I leap at him and bring my sword in a downward strike, expecting it to smash into his shield. Instead, he parries my attack with his sword before bringing his knee up into my gut and doubling me over. He reverses his grip on his sword and tries to stab me through the back, only to miss as I roll forward and behind him. I kick out at his legs but miss when he leaps over the attack, spinning as he lands and swinging in a vicious arc at my left side. I have barely enough time to parry the attack with the shotgun, his sword's edge biting into the barrel of the weapon and rendering it useless. \n\n\"So much for the gun, peasant!\" I skitter away from him and throw the weapon at him to force him to duck. When he comes back up, I am running back at him with my sword held high over my head. This time my attack does bounce off of his shield, but the device on his belt overloads and fizzles out. The power of Mackenzie's imbuement was too much for it. He backs up a few steps before dropping back into a defensive stance. \"It looks like we're going to face each other on the field of honor after all, assassin.\" I'm sure he meant that to be an insult. \n\nWe circle each other warily for a moment, searching for an opening in the other's defenses. His lips curl cruelly as he banters with me. \"Killing her was actually rather enjoyable. You know... Professor Tournesol? That little bitch took something that was mine by right. I can tell you right now, payback felt good.\" My eyes narrow. \n\nHe shifts his weight onto his back foot, the subtle move telegraphing his intent to me. I drop my blade just a little to give the indication that I am taking for the bait, and he snarls in triumph as he leaps forward for the strike. He thrusts directly out, and I spin away as my sword arcs around to take his head. It's only at the last moment that I see my mistake. His weapon is double edged, making it deceptively faster than what it looks like. I manage to take a step back, but I can feel the tip of his blade bite into my left arm. The sting of pain races up my shoulder, and I can feel the wet warmth of blood running freely down my arm. \"Got you,\" he whispers as he doubles back and strikes again, but all he gets is empty air as I roll away from him and open up some distance. \n\nI bring the flat of my sabre over the wound and activate the imbuement, searing it shut. I scream from the pain (Mackenzie always made this look so easy!), but at least I don't have to worry about bleeding to death. \n\n\"Well now. Perhaps not as skilled as we had hoped?\" He smiles and brings his sword up in front of him. He circles in slowly, like a cat closing in on its' prey. \"This is what happens when lower class trash tries to become more than it actually is.\" He feints before darting in for my left flank, hoping to take advantage of my injury. I can see the tip of his blade arcing in as he swings hard with both hands. He means to finish me off here, but he's overestimated how badly hurt I am. I'm a fencer; I only need one hand to swing my own sabre. It's almost too easy as I sidestep the slash and cut across his face, producing a wicked gash from the top of his left cheek all the way down to the base of his jaw. \n\nHe backpedals immediately, his hand raising in disbelief to touch the wound. It's not a serious injury, but it is meant to insult his skill as a swordsman. His eyes flash angrily at the slight, and his jaw twitches in rage. \"You should have bought better teachers.\" The ice in my voice could freeze beer as I smirk at him mirthlessly. \n\nHe rounds on me, charging full tilt and screaming. \"Enough! I've dealt with you for long enough, trash!\" He's overextended! I must strike now! \n\nI barely dodge the overhead chop before swinging low and hard. The blade cuts deep into the back of his knee, severing ligaments and destroying the joint. He drops onto it, screaming in pain as another sword strike cuts into his arm, slicing his hand off at the wrist and sending his broadsword clattering to the ground. The screaming stops as he clutches his wrist and starts to tremble in shock. He looks up at me, and I see disbelief and fear in his eyes. It warms my heart to look upon him like this. \n\n\"In... in the future, I'll know to stay away from you and yours,\" he says pleadingly. I walk around behind him and bring my sword up. He's actually begging for his life. The 'hero' of New Verdia, champion of the ruling class, is grovelling to live. How pathetic. \n\n\"What future would that be?\" His face freezes in unadulterated terror as he looks back at me, his mouth moving in an attempt to say something else. He never gets the chance, though. One vicious swing of my sabre, and his head flies off. His body falls forward and slams into the ground. \"Tell Amaranth I said hello, bastard.\" \n\nThe flame imbuement winks out as I sheathe my sword and make my way back over to where Mackenzie is propped up. I kneel down and gently drape her arm around my neck. It's only then that I collapse onto the floor in a heap. I feel so drained, physical fatigue combining with a building sense of worry that saps my spirit. She's barely made a sound the whole time. She just sits there with that vacant look in her eye. What if... What if she doesn't get better? What if... no. First things first; I have to get her someplace safe. Once that happens, I can move on from there. \n\nI close my eyes to rest, and the dream replays in my head again. The happiness, the warmth... I can still feel it. It was a lifetime, a moment ago. I cling desperately to that feeling, even though it was only an illusion. I can discard it once she is okay, but I need a refuge from the despair that's gnawing at my chest. I won't need it when we can work on building the real thing. \n\nSomethin' like this can't be left alone. Nothin' can be left for anyone else like him to use. Mackenzie's warning echoes in my mind, and I know it to be true. How long will it be before someone else finds this and uses it for their own purposes? We will never be safe until it all is destroyed. Not just us, but all of New Verdia is in peril so long as it all exists. My home. \n\nI prop myself up on my elbows to look around. The question is, how am I to do it? Everything is here, just as it was in the dream. The fuel car, the explosive materials... even the trolley we had used to escape is sitting on the tracks. There's only one thing that is missing from it all; Mackenzie. \n\nNothin' can be left for anyone else like him to use. I know, I know! But I don't have a way of setting up the explosion. I need you, Mackenzie. I crawl over to her, then kneel down beside her and stroke her hair. \"I need you so much. Why won't you come back to me?\" \n\nNo matter WHAT the cost. I don't understand. I can't set this off without her. How am I sup- \n\n\"Me...\" \n\nDid she just... \"Mistress, did you just say something?!\" I grab her by the shoulders and look her in the eye. \"Mistress, speak to me! Oh, Gods! Everything is going to be okay!\" \n\n\"Me... fuse.\" Slowly her eye rolls up and looks at me. There's a faint glimmer of the person I love there, but she seems... fractured. If feels like I am looking at an echo of who she is, but there is something of her still there. That can be enough. I can fix her, just like she fixed me. Everything is going to be ok! I smile as I brush a lock of her hair away from her face. \n\n\"Yes, yes! We'll get you out of here, and you can set it all off from a distance. We c-\" \n\n\"Me... fuse. Timer.\" \n\nMy face scrunches up in confusion. \"I don't understand. What are you trying to say?\" She just sits there, looking at me when it... My blood runs cold. She wants to die here! My heart plummets into a pit in my stomach and I wilt there in front of her. My hands start to shake uncontrollably as I look in horror at the person I love. \"No...\" \n\nShe nods ever so slightly, staring just slightly past me with that transfixed gaze. \"Yes. Me...\" \n\nI reach out for her, cupping her face in both hands. \"No! Nonono! There has to be another way! I can help you... make you better just as you did for me. We can still go home and build the life we want together. We've been through so much. We deserve that!\" \n\nShe whimpers in a low, soft voice as her lip starts to tremble. \"Broken. Hurts...\" Sadness clouds her eye, and I can see a tear start to well up there. I hear her voice from the dream again, whispering quietly to me. No matter WHAT the cost. \n\nBut, there has to be another way. There just has to! Maybe if I can find some fuse wires and somehow rig it all together, then I can set it off and get her out of here. Something... anything other than what she's asking of me. I look frantically around in search of an answer, but in my heart, I know it's not possible. The whole station has to be detonated, not just set on fire. And the only way we have of doing it... \n\n\"Then I'm staying with you. I am NOT leaving you here to die alone, Mistress. Do you hear me? I won't leave you here!\" \n\n\"Kids...\" A tear rolls down her cheek as she stares unblinking at me. I crumple in front of her and grab her hand, holding on as though for dear life. I can't let go of her. I won't let go of her! She's everything good about my life... she always has been. \n\n\"Please... please don't ask this of me. I can't do this. I just can't...\" I sob uncontrollably, my shoulders shaking violently as I sit there, staring down at the cold metal floor. \"I need you, Mackenzie. Please don't send me away! Please!!\" \n\n\"Fading...\" There's an almost desperate quality to the way she says. It forces me to look up at her, and I know it to be true. As much as that realization hurts me, forcing her to live a life trapped within her own mind like that would be hell for her. Her soul would snuff out, just like a candle's flame with a jar placed over it. She has to be free. \n\nI tilt my head back and scream for all I am worth at the ceiling. The sound echoes off of the walls and reverberates down the corridor, and still I go on. It's my rebellion against a world that offered me the body I always wanted, then punished me every step of the way for taking it. One that showed me the person I was to belong to, only to snatch her away from me and delight in my pain afterwards. \n\nAfter what seems like forever, my head drops to my chest, my voice raw and tears streaking my face. I am broken and spent, and I have no more will left to fight. I lean over and give my Mistress a kiss on the cheek before wrapping my arms around her neck. \"I will do as you ask, Mistress. I belong to you... now and forever. I love you so very much, Mackenzie\" And with that, I get up to make the final preparations. \n\n*** \n\nI'm standing on the back of the trolley as it speeds along, looking back. The top of The Grasp dominates the skyline, even from the outer edges of the city. I grip the railing tightly, waiting for the sound of the blast I know will be coming any moment, announcing I am truly alone in this world. \n\nMemories of her float to the surface; some of when I was Tony, others as Charlotte. Battles fought, heartfelt conversations shared and love made to each other swirl about and around, and I can't help but smile bittersweetly. I knew her for 13 years, and was her lover for one. Oh, but that one... I wish so desperately I had more. I once thought that having a body that fit my sense of self was the greatest blessing I could ever hope for. I was such a fool. She was the greatest blessing. \n\nI feel the earth shake as a low rumble rolls in the distance like thunder. Something dies within me as I slowly drop to my knees and cry. Through the tears I see the brand on my hand, and I collapse, crying uncontrollably. \n\nThat was only last night. \n\n*** \n\nIt's been a long, long time since I lost the most important person in my life. It still hurts so badly when I think about it. There's a hole in my soul that I just can't quite seem to fill without her. In many ways, it is just like the days when I was Tony... living a life that isn't entirely true to what I am. But, I have found ways to adapt. And I found new purpose in the world after my beloved died. \n\nOur actions so long ago had a profound impact on New Verdia and the land around it. Most of the city's leadership had been in his pocket. Had been under his thumb. Had been in The Grasp, and lay dead. With the land's sudden resurgence, the ones that remained lost their stranglehold over the resources they had kept for themselves. New Verdia itself dwindled away into nothing, with most people moving away and the city being picked apart for raw materials to be used elsewhere. The ones that stayed built a small but prosperous agricultural village in it's shadow, naming it simply Verdia. The other city-states divided up the land not claimed by Verdia's inhabitants, which rapidly changed from a desert to gently rolling arable land. \n\nLaw enforcement for the city proper lay in chaos for some time, and the 'crimes' of two women that briefly captured the attention of the city's populace were all but forgotten as political realities shifted and power brokers left for other venues. With no one really paying attention, I staked out Professor Tournesol's old property and set up a small orphanage there. Children who were lost in the confusion came to my door. Young adventurers, who braved New Verdia's ruins to make a name for themselves and found only hard times, would help me with the day-to-day operations of the place. \n\nThe children from the original gang stayed with me for some time, with most of them moving into farm work when they got old enough. Tubbins stayed the whole time, though. I came to love that delightful child as my own, and watched with pride as he grew up into an honorable man. He married a wonderful woman by the name of Adelaide, and they both became my helpers in running the orphanage. ",
        "\"Hello Charlotte. It's a nice day today, isn't it?\" Adelaide smiles as she puts a gentle hand on my shoulder. \"Are you doing okay out here by yourself?\" \n\n\"Oh, yes. The pain isn't that bad today, so I thought I'd come out here and enjoy the weather for a bit.\" I take a small sip of lemonade and then smile at her. \"Did that husband of yours come along with you as well?\" \n\n\"Sure did, Momma!\" Tubbins' arms wrap around me from behind and pull me into a bear hug. Dear Gods, how I love that boy. \"Thought we'd come by and take a look at your tomatoes, see how they're doing. Not to mention you, too.\" \n\n\"Oh my sweet boy! An old lady like me is lucky to have someone like you to look after her.\" I pat his cheek affectionately before turning around to look him in the eyes. \"How are the others?\" \n\n\"Oh, they're doing okay. The kids are at home with a sitter right now, and since most of the harvest work is done we'd figured we'd come over and see what you were up to.\" His eyes twinkle merrily as he puts both hands on my shoulders. \"It's good to see you again, Momma. I hope you haven't been getting into too much trouble out here.\" \n\n\"Well, with the last of the children gone this place seems so empty. It feels too big for one person, but I couldn't run an orphanage forever.\" I straighten out his collar and smile impishly. \"Besides, from what I've heard you're the one who needs to be told not to get into trouble, Tubbins.\" \n\nAdelaide grimaces a little at the mention of his pet name, though it drops as soon as she sees that I notice it. She is his wife, after all. She can call him whatever she likes, but he'll always be my Tubbins. She smiles as she comes over to join us. \"Oh, I make sure he does exactly that, Charlotte.\" She arches an eyebrow and swats him on his butt. \"You can be sure of that.\" \n\nHe plays up being indignant for a moment before pulling her into an embrace and kissing the top of her head. \"That's right. Anyway, we'd heard that there was some kind of blight affecting some the other farmers' tomato crops. We thought we'd stop by and check yours just to make sure. Then afterwards we could keep you company for a while. Sound like a good idea to you?\" \n\n\"Oh, yes. I'd like that more than anything.\" I hobble over to my rocking chair, taking care to move Mack out of the way and set her gently to the side. I ease into the chair, wincing a little as I pull a blanket over my lap before setting my glass down. I reach back down for Mack and pull her up into my lap, stroking the scabbard. \n\nTubbins' smile fades just a little as he sees the sword, and a hint of sadness creeps into his eyes. \"You okay, Momma? It's not often I see you with your old sword these days.\" He kneels down beside me and whispers quietly in my ear. \"I know. I miss her too.\" Adelaide clears her throat and backs up a little to give us some space, becoming acutely interested in some potted plant. \n\n\"I... I wonder. Did you ever blame me for not coming back with her?\" I look up into his face as a lump starts to form in my throat and tears threaten to well up in the corners of my eyes. \"I wanted to. I tried so hard...\" \n\nHe takes my hand and kisses the back of it before holding it to his cheek. \"Even then, I knew you did. You loved her with everything you had, just like she did you. I never blamed you. Not even once.\" \n\n\"Oh my boy...\" The tears really do start to flow as I squeeze his hand. He smiles at me and pats my head affectionately. \"Thank you. Now, off with you. Go tend to real business instead of dealing with the likes of me.\" I wipe them with the sleeve of my shirt and force a grin. He smiles and nods before turning to go, and I watch them head off to the far corner of my yard to look at the tomato plants. I keep up the smile until I know they're far enough not to notice anything unusual, then grimace in pain as I shift in my chair. \n\nI don't like lying to them. The pain is much worse than I had let on, and it's coupled with a fatigue that has settled deep in my bones. I'm so tired today, and it seems to take so much effort even for the most basic of things. I cradle Mack in my hand, stroking her lovingly before reaching into my pocket. I pull out the little iron rose she made for me so very long ago and bring it to my lips, kissing it lightly. \n\nYou gave me so very much, Mackenzie. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about you. I miss you, my Mistress. \n\nSomething in the distance catches my attention, and I set her down. A hunched and elderly woman emerges from the opposite corner of the yard. She looks so old and gray, and yet moves along with a speed I wouldn't expect for someone her age. Even older than me, I suspect. She has an old rifle strapped to her back as she makes her way towards me, and starts to break out into a wide grin as she gets closer. There's something so familiar about her, but I can't quite place where I know her from.  \n\n\"Knew I'd find ya out here. Knew it in my bones, I did!\" She grins impishly as she sidles alongside me, patting my head. \"How ya been, smooth one?\" \n\n\"I... I know you. You're... you're the one who-\" \n\n\"You and Red did a lot o' good, you know that? Righted something that had been wrong for a long, long time.\" Her smile fades a little as she looks at me. \"I'm just sorry it cost you so much.\" \n\n\"Why? Why did you choose us?\" I shake my head slowly. Part of me feels so resentful at what was asked of us, while another part wants to thank her desperately for the chance to finally be what I am. \n\n\"Because everythin' comes around, Charlotte. Especially with you two.\" \n\n\"Why did she have to die? Why was she taken from me? I miss her...\" My voice catches a little as I look into her eyes. \n\n\"Oh, yer missin' something, alright.\" She takes my hand in hers and presses something into it with the other. It feels warm, comforting even. I look down to see a small vial of water stopped up with a cork. \"But not fer much longer. Thank ye for what you've done. Ye may not realize it yet, but that difference you wanted to make in th' world? Ya made it, and in spades.\" She smiles and turns to leave. \n\n\"Wait! Don't go! I have so many questions still!\" \n\n\"And the ones you really want the answers to are in what I gave ya. When yer ready, seek them out.\" She smiles and waves at me as she disappears the way she came. \n\nI close my eyes as a knot forms in my throat as I drop back into my chair, confused and feeling hollow. I don't understand at all. It's not the least bit fair. Mackenzie should be here, sharing in a life we made with each other. I finally open my eyes with a tired sigh. \n\nThe crystal vial glints as it catches the sunlight. Memories of that first night in the desert race through my mind as I turn it over in my hand. This was how it all started, and if there's even a chance I can find some kind of answer... I look back up to see Tubbins and his wife inspecting the tomato plants. He looks up at me and smiles, waving to me before going back to whatever he was doing before. \n\nI uncork the vial and bring it to my lips, letting the liquid wash over my lips and down my throat. It's not long before I feel a tingling in my chest that slowly radiates outward. The pain... softens, and I feel warm. Content, even. My head drops back against the headrest of the chair and I close my eyes, savoring the feeling. It's been a while since I've felt this good. The fatigue seems to drain from my body, and I feel younger. Much, much younger. Whatever it was she gave me, it is making me comfortable at the very least. I could sit like this for hours. \n\nDaylight seems to fade a little, and the air grows a little more chilly. Odd, have I been sitting here that long? It doesn't feel like it. I'd best get inside, I suppose. I open my eyes and gasp; I'm not in my yard anymore. I'm in some kind of building, and it feels cold and sterile. Where am I? I get up from my chair and turn around, only to find that there's no chair at all. Gods, what is going on here? Answers, she told me. My curiosity overwhelms my apprehension as I make my way to the door ahead of me. \n\nI place my hands on the knob to open it before pausing, almost afraid of what I might find waiting for me beyond it. Butterflies flit around in my stomach, and my hands shake a little as I push on it, swinging outward and affording me a view of the other side. My heart stops as I look out over the platform. Everything looks as it did that night, right down to Baron Rasputin's body lying on the floor. \n\nI shake my head in confusion. How is this possible? Is this a dream? Or worse, another of his illusions? There's no pain like before though, and I feel warm... complete. Just like I did that night in the desert so very long ago, . Trust your instincts, Charlotte. Unlike before, that thought drowns out the doubt. \n\nI step past the scorch marks and the slag heap, past the bodies of the two Deadies I killed. My heart is pounding, and it feels like it'll burst through my chest at any moment. My breathing comes in ragged gasps as I reach the edge of the platform and round the corner. I'm so scared, more so than I've ever been in my life. But I can't turn back now. Not when I am so close. Not when I am within a few steps of seeing... \n\nHer. She's propped up against the massive concrete pillar, just as I had left her so long ago. Her hands are down at her sides, arcane fire gathering around her just as I had seen in the illusion he tried to trick me with. She's rocking back and forth, muttering to herself but unable to cast her Holy Fire spell. She even less lucid than I remember. \n\nI don't even breathe as I stand there for a moment, and I'm terrified to think she might be real. All these years waiting, and now there she is before me. I've dreamed of seeing her again so many times, only to wake up cold and alone. So close, so very close. I take a tentative step towards her, then another. Her muttering becomes audible as I get closer to her. \"... lost count. I've lost count. I can't...\" \n\nNow I understand. Everything becomes clear as crystal to me. I kneel down beside her and wrap my arms around her shoulders to pull her into a hug. \"Hello again, Mistress.\" \n\nShe turns to look at me, momentary shock melting into joy at seeing me. She whimpers a little and smiles. \"I lost... count, Cherrrry. Can't too... soon\" \n\nI sit down and pull her close to me, stroking her hair before kissing her gently on her cheek. \"It's time now. Let me help you. What do I need to do?\" \n\n\"Be here...\" She seems to be drawing strength from my presence somehow. She puts an arm around me and closes her eyes. \"Kids?\" \n\n\"Don't worry, they're safe. You should see them, all grown up. Everything worked out in the end, my sweet Mackenzie.\" \n\n\"Good,\" she sobs. Fire builds up all around us, swirling and twisting as it obeys her command. I can see that multi-colored orb of energy start to form above us, and I can't help but smile. The heat becomes more intense as arcane energy flows into her. It won't be long now before it reaches critical mass, but that's okay. Everything is okay, now. I pull her close and nuzzle her neck. My heart is beating so hard. \n\n\"Hold on, baby. We're almost home.\" \n\n\"Love... you, Cherry.\" \n\n\"I love you too, Macken-\" \n\n*** \n\nTimothy gingerly holds the tomato in his hand, inspecting it for any infestation or damage. He lets go with a satisfied smile and turns back to me. \"Well I don't think we need to worry, Addie. Truth be told, it looks like it's gonna be another good year.\" \n\n\"Hate when you call me that.\" I slap at him playfully before pouting. \"I hate that name almost as much as I do 'Tubbins'.\" \n\nHe rolls his eyes at me. \"There's a lot of history with that, I'll have you know.\" His smile grows far away, and I know he's reliving those early days. It irritates me a little to know that I can't share it with him, but it doesn't hurt to let him have it all the same. \"A lot of memories. Many good, some not so good.\" \n\n\"Well, that's fine and dandy, but I'm not gonna call you that. You're Timothy, as far as I'm concerned.\" I cross my arms across my chest and flounce away. That always gets him to chase after me, which is exactly what I want him to do. \n\nHe laughs and runs up behind me, wrapping his arms around me and pulling me into a bear hug. \"I'm whatever you want me to be, just so long as I get food and lovings!\" I giggle and try to twist away from him as he tickles my ribs. \n\n\"Stop that! Come on, lets go check on Charlotte. She didn't look well when I left this morning.\" \n\n\"She was OK a few minutes ago. She was just sitting on the porch with that sword of hers up in her lap.\" He frowns at the thought before shaking his head. \"She calls it 'Mack' now.\" \n\nI sigh a little and look down at the ground. \"She never got over her death, did she?\" \n\nHis frown deepens as I move to his side and pull him into an embrace. \"They were my parents, as far as I am concerned. When Mackenzie died, I...\" He pauses for a moment and squeezes me hard. \n\n\"I know. Let's just head back.'\" We both make our way back to the porch but her chair is empty, that sword of hers propped up against it. \n\n\"Charlotte?\" He calls out to her as his pace quickens. He gets there before I do. I look at him in confusion for moment as he bends down to pick something up in the seat of the chair. I crane my neck to look over his shoulder. He turns to me and holds up a little metal sculpture of a rose. \n\n*** \n\nAuthors Note: \n\nYeah. Us too. It wasn't supposed to end like this. \n\nWe started this project in February of last year. By May, Apothecary29 and I had a clear vision of the way it was going to end. We knew who the bad guy was. We knew how they were gonna get there. We knew how they were gonna beat him. We knew how the epilogue was gonna go. Because of how I normally do things, we kept a tight, heavy lid on the end, only giving away the smallest scraps and bits, but always something moving it forward. It was then going to pull together in the final few chapters like a well-laid-out net. I thought it was pretty darn clever. Apparently, so did the people who wrote The Legend of Korra. \n\nI had seen Avatar. I was always aware that the magic systems between the original show and this world were similar and that Avatar had a whole \"Air Magic returns from the grave\" theme, but I thought the similarities ended there. \n\nBlood magic. Class warfare. Power stealing. Godhood. The similarities were really, really creepy. I've heard of this Korra show, but never seen it. I found out that I was about to unveil a bastard clone (at best) the night after I posted Chapter 10 (of a proposed 13 at the time). Those last three chapters would have been a whirlwind of (seemingly) plagiaristic events. There is no way that anyone who had seen that show would believe that it had come to me on my own. \n\nBut it wasn't too late. We hadn't actually revealed too much. So we rebuilt. It was just a few ideas at first, ways to take the hints we'd been dropping for many chapters now and tie them up in a different shape. The further we went, the more perfect it felt. And the more awful. Just... awful. \n\nIt wasn't supposed to end like this. \n\nWe stand by the story as posted as the superior ending, plagiarism notwithstanding. It was a huge learning experience for us on many, many levels. If you stuck through the whole thing (which you probably did, or you wouldn't be here), you have our undying gratitude. \n\nOn behalf of Ap, we would both like to thank LittleGrue for her indispensable assistance in editing, and so much more."
