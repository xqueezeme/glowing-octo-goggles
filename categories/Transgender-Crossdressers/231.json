        "You were finally moving away from home! Hallelujah!\n\nGoodbye small town thinking and boring familiarity. You were off to the big city, you were off to college, you were out on your own for the first time ever. It was time for higher learning and expanding horizons. You simply could not wait. This last year back home had been claustrophobic. You had decided to wait a year after graduating in order to wait for your girlfriend Samantha, who was a year behind you in school. The plan was that the pair of you would head off together to share your new lives side by side. Your parents had tried to encourage you to move on without her, but you were young and in love and ignored their advice.\n\nWaiting ended up being a huge mistake. Not only had you given up a good soccer scholarship by waiting but Sam, despite your best efforts to help her, had ended up flunking out of her graduating year. She was going back to try again but you simply could not wait for her any longer. You had to get out. Friendly as it was your tight knit community was suffocating you. Besides, working at your uncle's car and truck wash was hardly what you wanted to be doing with your life right now. You had places to be, things to see, subjects to learn. You had to find the real you out in the wide world, away from the comfort and shackles of home. You had actually left a few days earlier than planned. You knew you had a room waiting for you and you just couldn't wait any longer!\n\nNow here you were on the highway. The sun was shining and a good song was playing on the radio. The rushing wind from your open window blowing in your face. You drum the beat of the song on the steering wheel as you push the pedal down just a touch more. Everything was almost perfect, almost how you imagined it would be. You look beside you at the empty seat where Sam was supposed to be sitting. She was supposed to be with you, in your dreams of this moment she was always there as you faced this new challenge together. It would have been a wonderful shared moment. Sure the pair of you would fight and bicker from time to time, but she was yours and you were hers. It had been that way all through high school. You already missed those sky blue eyes and long flowing wheat blonde hair. Those big tits and round fleshy ass. Shaking your head you remind yourself it would only be a year. You just had to make it through a year by yourself. You were going it alone, you didn't know a soul in this new city. That didn't bother you, but it would have been so much nicer with Sam there.\n\nAfter a long day's drive you finally see your new city in the distance. There it was, there was your life for at least the next four years. Sure you'd come home for holidays and such, but this was where you'd spend the vast majority of your time. A huge grin spreads across your face as you push the old truck just a bit faster.\n\nYou'd only actually been here twice before. Once was years ago during a trip with your family and the other just a few months back when you came to tour the campus and get a look around. You didn't know much about the city but you knew how to get to your new school at the very least. You follow the exact route you had taken last time. Like last time you grimace as you get caught up in big city traffic. This was going to take some getting used to. It honestly felt like it would have been faster to get out and walk!\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity you finally get to your college. You look at the old stone buildings, the lush green spaces, the walking paths, the well dressed people carrying books and engaging in passionate debate as they walked. Yep, you'd finally made it. After a bit of driving around campus lost and overwhelmed, your head spinning this way and that like a tourist, you finally find your dorm and your parking spot. It is mostly empty as fall classes hadn't started yet but it was hard not to notice yours was the only truck in the lot. God, could you look more like a small town red neck right now?\n\nGetting out you grab your backpack and duffel bag and lift them from out of the open back. You see the three story early 1900's era brick building which would be your new home. The old gray Gothic stone building just screamed academia. There were other newer dorms, one that was even co-ed, but this was the most conveniently located. With Samantha not being around you definitely decided to pass up on the co-ed dorm, it was going to be hard enough with all these college hotties around without the constant temptation being right where you lived as well. Plus you kind of liked the old fashioned feel to this old place. Above the heavy wooden double doors set into the stonework was the name \"Chapel Hall\". Indeed, a small chapel sat next to the dorm hall.\n\nAs you approach a pair of guys about your age were just walking out. You give them a friendly nod and a smile but they ignore you, allowing the door to swing closed behind them despite the fact it would have only taken a second to hold it open for you. They almost bump into you as they make their way past. Big city life you remind yourself, things were different here.\n\nHeading in you are greeted with the dry dusty musty smell of the venerable hall. You quickly find the Hall manager. She is an enormous woman wearing an outrageous polka dotted purple and white moo moo. She had to be tipping the scales at over 350 pounds. She gives you a hard look as she finds your key and a bit of paperwork. Giving you the evil eye she says. \"No drugs, no smoking, no parties, no girls overnight, quiet after 11 pm.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Yep, I got it. You won't get any trouble out of me Ma'am.\"\n\nShe smiles, surprised at your manners. \"Ma'am?\" She hands you your key and pats your cheek. \"I think you'll get along here just fine my dear. Your room is on the third floor.\"\n\nYou flash her a friendly smile and you were on your way. No elevators in this old place so you head for the stairs at the end of the building. You power your way up the stairs, taking them three at a time despite the weight of the pack and duffel bag. You hit the top of floor hardly out of breath. You are greeted by a common room meant for residents of this floor only. It had a television, basic but comfortable looking furniture and a few tables and chairs. Light filtered in from windows along both sides of the area. It was currently empty. The whole place had an almost disturbing silence to it. You knew in a few short days the place would be a beehive of activity. Walking over the creaky hardwood floor of the common area you head toward the hallway and the rooms.\n\nYou quickly find the right door, Room 313. You unlock the door and slowly open it with a low creeeeaaak. It was quiet and appeared uninhabited at the moment, though you could tell your roommate had already moved in. The left side of the room already had some stuff unpacked, a laptop, some clothes, etc. Looks like you had the right side. The room was split in two mirrored halves. Straight in front of you two basic desks sat side by side facing out a pair of windows. The leaves and branches of an mighty oak tree swayed slowly to the breeze outside, the orange light of sunset lit the tree's leaves with a warm glow. To the left and right of the room were matching single beds with drawers underneath. Shelves and cupboards lined the walls above the bed and a large three foot tall dresser sat at the foot end of each bed. To the left was a door that must have been the attached bathroom.\n\nYou take a deep breath in and let it slowly escape your lips. Here you were. Your very own space. Away from your parents, away from your town, away from everyone. Shared though it may be, it still felt like it was yours on in some important way. This all felt so monumental. You felt so...free.\n\nJust then the bathroom door swings open and someone who you assume must be your new roommate walks out. He had on an over sized thick blue bathrobe which was currently hanging open. The smooth creamy pale soft looking skin of his middle chest and stomach peaking through. A big white towel was currently over his head as he dries his hair with both hands, he hadn't seen you yet.\n\nYou weren't trying to look but you couldn't help but notice the rather impressive bulge filling his tight black and white briefs.\n\nYou clear your throat to announce your arrival. \"Ahem.\"\n\n\"AAAHHH!\" He screams in a high pitched shriek as he jumps back. The towel drops down around his thin shoulders and he instinctively grabs the edges of his robe and pulls it tight around his svelte frame.\n\n\"Whoa!\" You exclaim, yourself becoming startled by him being startled. \"Whoa there!\"\n\nHe stares up at you with huge soulful chestnut brown eyes as he catches his suddenly rapid breath. You'd scared the hell out of him. A rosy blush had spread across his cheeks and the top of his nose. He looks straight at you only a moment before he breaks eye contact, looking off to the side. He had just past chin length tussled thick slightly wavy black hair, heavy black eyebrows tapering toward the ends, naturally long lashes both top and bottom, a round button nose, and full plump lips. His features were fair and smooth, his wide friendly face possibly indicating a trace of Hispanic blood. Being a fellow freshman, the only thing you really knew about him, you guessed he was likely right around your age but he looked young. He was a small man, just over five and half feet tall and slender. His slim neck, forearms, and calves coming out from the robe betraying the fact that he wasn't an active guy like you were.\n\nAs the pair of you stand momentarily in awkward silence he flicks his head forward, causing thick strands of hair to fall forward around his face. Concealing it behind a broken curtain of black wavy hair. The motion seemed almost unconscious, a nervous tick perhaps. Tilting his chin down he peeks up at you again through his wet hair.\n\nHe seems at a loss as to what to do with himself for a moment. First he nervously ties the fabric rope belt around his waist. His hands then scramble around before grabbing the inner edges of the towel draped over his neck, holding the towel like an old fashioned professor might do to his lapels of a suit vest. He clasped it in a tight grip. It was almost as if he was trying to cover his already covered torso with the towel, talk about body conscious! You had really thrown this poor guy for a loop with your unexpected arrival.\n\nYou laugh. \"Chill out dude. It's just us here. I've seen it all before.\" He cocks his head gives you a funny expression and you hasten to add. \"I play sports. Soccer and swimming. I've been in more change rooms and seen more dongs than I care to remember.\" You turn and throw your backpack onto your new bed and set the duffel bag on the dresser. \"We're roomies now. We better get comfortable with each other.\"\n\nHis dark untamed mop top was heavy and still too wet, but he kept the towel clutched tight to his body protectively. In a whisper soft voice he replies. \"Sorry, um, you just startled me. I wasn't expecting you yet. I, uh, I'm kind of shy.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" You smile and turn back to him. You hold out your hand. \"I'm Jonathan by the way. Most people call me Jon.\"\n\nHe carefully holds both sides of his towel to his body with his left hand as he uncertainly reaches out with his right. You clasp hands and shake hands, his palm was baby soft to the touch. Obviously not a guy who worked with his hands, not surprising given you were in college. He flinches a bit at your overly enthusiastic firm grip, his slender hand squeezing uncomfortably in yours. This guy was fragile. You loosen your grip and continue the friendly shake.\n\nHe nods and returns a bashful smile. \"Hello Jonathan. My name is Charlie.\"\n\n***\n\nThe pair of you shake hands for about ten seconds too long. You finally let his small hand go and try to pull yours away.\n\nYou see another blush light his face through the curtain of hair as he lets your hand go. \"Oh...sorry.\" He says as he pulls his own hand back. \"Uh...I, uh...I'm just going to get dressed.\" He points towards some clothes piled on his bed. \"I'm...uh...going to get dressed...in the bathroom. I'll get dressed in the bathroom.\" You can see him flinch as he knew how stupid that must have sounded.\n\nYou give him a long sideways look. \"Yeah...sure, whatever dude.\"\n\nHe nods then rushes to grab the clothes. Taking them all up in a big ball then rushing back into the bathroom and slamming the door behind him. Man he was awkward, he didn't seem comfortable in his own skin. But you had taken him off guard and if he was indeed shy he probably didn't feel comfortable in the presence of a stranger. You were sure the awkwardness would pass soon enough.\n\nYou turn and zip open your duffel bag. Taking the laptop from the top you walk over and set it on your desk. Leaning forward you peer out through the leaves and branches at the green space just beyond. The area sat in the courtyard between three different dorm halls. Currently there was only one couple out there. The girl was sitting up and the guy was laid out, his head resting on her thigh. He looked up at her as she looked down at him as they spoke. They were obviously smitten. You smiled as your thoughts returned to Samantha.\n\nReturning you start to unpack, mostly putting clothes away in various drawers. You really didn't have that much with you. Just clothes, computer, phone, everyday necessities, and some school supplies. In twenty minutes you had completely unpacked. You sit on your bed, it was firm, the bedding clean and soft. You look toward the bathroom door. Charlie was still in there. After all day on the road you seriously had to take a leak.\n\nYou speak up, confident your voice would reach him. \"Hey Charlie, you going to be long? I really gotta go man. I've been driving all day and...\"\n\nYou hear his voice on the other side of the door. \"Sorry! Be right out!\" The door opens almost instantly. Had he just been standing on the other side of the door? His floppy tussled hair was all around his head, that curtain of hair still covered his face. It looked like that was the look he was going for. He was wearing relaxed fit faded blue jeans and wore at least four layers over his upper body. Undershirt, t shirt, vest, and loose flannel over shirt. He wore a wooden pendant on a leather string around his neck. He had a bit of a 90's grunge look to him.\n\nAs the pair of you look at each other he flinches and shifts uncomfortably. He blurts out in his soft voice. \"Uh...I have to wear compression shirts and vests. I've got a medical thing. In case you see them around and were wondering.\"\n\nWhat the fuck? Why even say that? Dear lord if this guy could be any more ill at ease you just weren't sure how. Was this his first contact with humans? What a weirdo.\n\nYou just smile, you were okay with weirdos.\n\n\"Sure Charlie, whatever. None of my business my man.\" You make your way to the washroom in something of a hurry. The pair of you shuffle clumsily back and forth a few times as you try to get around him and he tries to get out of the way. Finally you just grab him by the shoulders and move him to one side. At 6' 2\" you were at least a half foot taller than him and much more built, moving him was no problem at all. It was a bit rude...but nature called!\n\nYou rush in, leaving the door open behind you, and merciful relief comes to your over full bladder. \"Ahhh.\" You sigh in relief as the yellow stream fell into the bowl. Calling over your shoulder you say. \"I guess both of us couldn't wait to get here. I was surprised to see you here.\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah.\" You hear from the other room. You could barely hear his soft voice.\n\n\"You from the city here?\"\n\n\"Uhh...no.\" He doesn't offer any more. You could already sense that keeping a conversation up with this guy was going to be tough.\n\nYou zip up and wash your hands before strolling back out. Charlie was sitting on his bed, his hands gripping the edge and his legs hanging over the side. He slouched forward. Grabbing your desk chair you spin it around and sit on it backwards, your lean muscled forearms resting along the back. \"Not from the city huh? Me neither. I'm from a little town out of state. It's a flea speck, there's no way you've heard of it.\"\n\nCharlie gives you a pained smile as he forces himself to engage. \"Oh. That's cool. I...I'm from Canada.\"\n\n\"Oh wow! Really?\" You say. \"I've been up there a few times. Soccer tournaments. Toronto & Montreal. Nice country.\"\n\nHe looks at you a moment, you could barely see his face through the hair. That hair in your face would have driven you crazy.\n\nSilence fills the room.\n\nHe finally says. \"Never been there, I'm from out West.\" And with that he just leaves it hang in silence once more. Where out West? Nothing. He didn't want to share, that was fair enough you supposed.\n\nYou were about to move the conversation along when he sputters, conscious that you were waiting for him to say something. \"B-b-but I've got some family down here somewhere.\" He laughs at something only he knew. \"Long lost family. It's a big mystery. My Grandma said she has a sister...they were separated. She was taken up North. The sister stayed down here, was just a baby, probably doesn't even know.\"\n\n\"Oh, uh, that's interesting.\" You grin. What an odd mix of silence and over sharing Charlie was. \"So...you're kinda American then. A few generations removed.\"\n\nCharlie lets out a thin nervous laugh.\n\nYou chat a few more minutes. Telling him about the drive and how frustrating you found the city traffic. Try as you might you couldn't hide your bubbling enthusiasm about everything. He sat and patiently listened, hardly moving as you spoke. During a break in your chatter you pause to give him a chance to chime in.\n\nAgain the tension ratchets up as the silence fills the small space once more. Charlie just sat there waiting. He was obviously not a people person. Ah well, you didn't mind carrying the conversation. Besides, he was only your roommate. He didn't have to be your friend.\n\nYou stand up and stretch. \"God, I'm starving. Have you eaten yet?\"\n\nHe looks up at you like a startled rabbit. \"Uh...uh no actually, but uh...\"\n\nYou slap him on his slender shoulder. \"Good! Come on. My treat. I could go for some pizza. Sound good?\"\n\n\"Uhhh...\" He says uncertainly.\n\nJust then a knock comes to the door.\n\n***\n\nYou and Charlie look at each other, it was obvious neither of you knew who it might be. You were already standing so you walk across the room and open the door.\n\nStanding at the door was an older gentleman. He had gray-black balding hair, glasses, gray slacks and a cozy looking blue and gray checkered button up sweater over a white collared shirt. His skin was a chocolate brown. He was as tall as you were and had a deep barrel chest with a middle aged gut to match. You suspected he may have played some football in his youth.\n\nHe looks at you obviously surprised, you were not who he was expecting. \"Oh! You're...uh...Jonathan, Jonathan Spencer. Correct?\"\n\nYou nod and smile as you reach forward and shake his hand. \"That's right.\" He takes your hand in his and you share a firm handshake.\n\n\"I hear you're one hell of a defensive midfielder. Going to try out for the team?\" He asks. You wonder how he knew this about you.\n\nYou nod. \"I was thinking about it.\"\n\nHe grins. \"Good. I'm sorry to bother you but is Mr Fox in by chance?\"\n\nYou pause. \"Mr Fox? You mean Charlie?\"\n\nHe nods. You show him in. Charlie was still sat on his bed, he hadn't moved. Having another person in the room doing little to ease his obvious tension.\n\nThe man crosses the room in three long strides and forces his hand into Charlie's for an enthusiastic hand shake. \"Charlie, I am the Resident Dean for Chapel Hall. I am here for guidance or help for any of my boys here. You can call me Professor Williams or Doctor Williams.\" He was smiling ear to ear, your presence seemingly forgotten. Letting go of Charlie he steps back, Charlie just squirms uncomfortably. \"On behalf of the University I wanted to come personally say hello and thank you for choosing our fine institution. I believe you'll find we can help you get on the right path.\"",
        "He looks back over to you and chuckles. \"How does it feel to be roommates with a genius?\"\n\nYou were stunned. \"What? A genius? Charlie? Wow!\"\n\nHe nods then returns his gaze to the VERY ill at ease Charlie. \"We have never seen such scores on the placement tests. Not bad for home schooling!\" He laughs. He then says to your roommate. \"Your parents deserve the highest praise young man. We understand you could have gone anywhere, Ivy League or overseas. We appreciate you showing your faith in us, and we will show our faith in you. Just tell us if you need anything. Anything at all.\"\n\nYour poor roomie was squirming like a worm on a hook. He still hadn't said a word and obviously did not appreciate this kind of attention. You decide to throw the poor guy a life line.\n\nStepping forward you say. \"Thank you Professor. I'm sure Charlie appreciates the visit but we were just heading out you see and...\"\n\nSeeing the opportunity to escape Charlie begins nodding furiously. \"Uh...yes sir, sorry, we were just leaving.\"\n\nThe Resident Dean lets out a big belly laugh. \"Of course, of course. You probably want to get to know your new campus.\" He grips Charlie's shoulder and gives it a supportive squeeze. \"Well don't let this old man stand in your way.\" He makes his way out. As he passes through your door he turns back. \"A pleasure to meet you young Mr Fox. And you too Mr...uh...Spencer.\"\n\nYou smile and wave as you close the door behind him. \"Thank you sir. See you again sometime.\" You shut the door.\n\nYou hear Charlie let out relieved sigh. You suddenly had so many questions about your mysterious little roommate. A real live genius, here sharing a room with you. Crazy. The questions begin to turn over in your mind. Those could wait however.\n\nYou give him a warm smile. \"Come on Charlie. Let's go.\"\n\nIn that soft voice of his he says. \"Okay Jonathan.\"\n\nCharlie gets up and grabs a faded olive colored denim army style jacket, adding yet another layer to his upper body. It wasn't even cold out. Ah well, he was obviously an odd duck. Perhaps he was some sort of savant or something.\n\nCharlie gets his keys, wallet, and phone and falls in behind you. Together the pair of you make your way out to find a restaurant or pizza joint.\n\n***\n\nYou walk side by side in silence as you head out onto the foot paths. You knew there was a campus pizza place, now you just had to find it.\n\nStopping a nearby group of girls you ask directions. You see as they give you both an approving thirsty look. You were used to it. You had natural manly chiseled good looks, you were in top physical condition, and you had free flowing shoulder length coppery brown-blonde hair and piercing hazel eyes. You knew you were a looker but you didn't let it get to your head. But these girls were checking you both out. You realize Charlie had an attraction all his own. That sort of effeminate boy band look, he was almost...pretty. Add to this his sulky quiet vulnerability and yeah, your roommate could drop some panties if he wanted to. No problem at all.\n\nHad you not been happily connected with Samantha Charlie could have been one hell of a wingman through college. The girls give you directions then head on their way, looking back over their shoulders to check the pair of you out one last time before they leave.\n\nYou smile at Charlie and give him a knowing wink. He doesn't respond. You got the impression he had genuinely missed just how much those women had been checking him out.\n\nThe light of the day was rapidly fading and the path side lights were beginning to flicker to life. You eventually track down the restaurant It was in the basement of a rather plain looking stone building, you would have never found it had you not gotten directions. As you enter you are quickly greeted and shown to a table. Like the rest of the campus it was pretty dead in here. It was dimly lit and a stereotypical sort of nondescript campus rock played over the house speakers. The pair of you are shown to a booth. Charlie leaves his coat on as if he wanted to be ready to leave at a moments notice.\n\nThe waitress comes up. You smile. \"I'll have a pint. Whatever you have on tap is fine.\"\n\n\"Sam Adams okay?\" She asks. You nod. \"I.D.?\"\n\nShit. \"I'll have a coke.\" You correct yourself.\n\nShe gives you a knowing sympathetic grin.\n\nShe turns to Charlie. \"Same?\"\n\nYour roommate shakes his head and says softly. \"No. Do you have any juice?\"\n\nShe chuckles. \"Speak up sweetie, I can barely hear you.\"\n\n\"Uh...orange juice please.\" Charlie says in an even more quiet voice.\n\n\"Sorry, what?\" She leans in.\n\n\"He said Orange Juice.\" You say boldly in his stead. You then take the initiative. \"And a large all dressed pizza. That good for you Charlie?\"\n\nYour roomie nods. The waitress smiles and heads on her way. You look around seeing what was happening. The answer was...absolutely nothing. Just a few other tables having supper like you two.\n\nYou look across and can actually watch as Charlie screws up his courage. He manages to speak up, his voice taking on a higher octave as he increases the volume. \"Hey, so, uh, what are you studying? What's your major?\"\n\nYou grin. \"Kinesiology. Sports medicine and all that. I was going to try to go pro in soccer but...I'm just not that good if I'm honest. Even my girlfriend Samantha says so. What about you?\"\n\nHe reaches out and begins playing with the salt shaker with fiddling nervous fingers. \"Biology.\" He says. A pretty vague answer, you were getting used to that.\n\n\"Oh, that's cool. So many interesting disciplines in Biology.\" You chuckle. \"I didn't do too bad in Biology actually. No genius mind you.\"\n\nEven through his hair and the dim light you see another blush come to his face. He didn't like that, you remind yourself not to bring it up again. You say. \"I did pretty good at the whole dissection stuff. Steady hands. Did you do stuff like that? Being home schooled?\"\n\nHe shakes his head. \"No. I don't hurt animals.\" Is all he says.\n\nYou shift. \"Well, I didn't hurt anything, they were already dead ya know.\"\n\nHe hurries to say, obviously worried he'd offended you. \"No, I didn't mean...\" That awkward silence again as he clams up and looks off to the side.\n\nYou laugh if off. \"It's okay man.\"\n\nMercifully the waitress is back with your drinks to interrupt the hitch in the conversation. You grab the frosted mug and down three big swallows. You were more parched than you realized.\n\nYou smack your lips and let out a satisfied \"Ahhhh.\" Followed by a small belch. \"Ha. Geez. Excuse me.\" You look across at him. \"So, we're going to be roomies for a while. At least for the year, maybe more. Let's get off on the right foot. Anything I need to know about you? Anything you need from me?\"\n\nHe looks left and right, he rarely kept eye contact for very long. He nods. \"Good idea Jonathan. Um, yeah. My privacy. I need my privacy okay? Please don't look through my stuff or anything? Or walk in on me when I'm getting dressed.\"\n\nYou give him a single solid nod. \"No problemo and understood. You have my word. And you can call me Jon if you want.\"\n\n\"Anything you need?\" He asks.\n\nYou give him a sly smile. \"Well, not really. I'm easy to get along with but...my girl, Samantha, she might come visit at some point. She's hoping to get into this school. And...he he he...if she does...\" You trail off.\n\nCharlie leans in. \"If she does...if she does what?\"\n\nYou let out an exasperated sound. How was he not picking this up? \"If she does, well, you might want to make yourself scarce from time to time. Let me have the room to myself. Know what I mean?\"\n\nYet another blush fills his cheeks, man this guy was a blusher. \"Oh! Oh yes, of course. Of course.\"\n\nYou shoot him a look. \"Hey, if you ever need the same, just let me know yeah? Text me or something, we'll trade numbers. Do you have a girl Charlie?\"\n\nCharlie shakes his head, his eyes suddenly become very focused on his orange juice.\n\n\"No little Canuck hottie waiting for you back home?\"\n\nHe shakes his head again.\n\n\"Single huh?\" You ask. Charlie nods. You think back to the interaction with the girls on the path. Something suddenly dawns on you. \"Charlie...are you gay?\"\n\nCharlie looks up at you, a rare moment of connection with those huge chestnut brown eyes of his. \"Um. No. No I'm not gay Jonathan.\"\n\nYou honestly weren't sure if he was telling the truth or just being defensive. You smile. \"Okay. Cool either way. I was just curious.\"\n\nYou watch him nervously turn his drink glass and fidget. He was a virgin, you were one hundred percent sure. You could just see it. Well, college would probably be the time and place then. No where better. You thought college would be healthy for you to spread your wings, poor old Charlie here needed it even more.\n\nYou offer, desperate to keep the conversation moving. \"Hey, want to see my Sam?\" Without waiting for an answer you pull out your phone and find the right album. You open it up to see the latest picture of her. It was a close up from just before you left this morning. Her sky blue eyes twinkled in the morning light. You pass the phone over. Charlie reluctantly takes it and sets it in front of him on the table. You smile proudly. \"Pretty hot huh?\"\n\nHe stares at her on your phone screen, not touching it. \"She's...she's beautiful.\" He says in a strange tone that you couldn't quite read.\n\n\"Ha ha! Isn't she though.\" You felt a bit weird doing this but it was at least something to talk about. Besides, you knew Samantha did it too. A big part of your connection was your shared good looks, you just looked good together. You were the best looking boy in town, she was the hottest girl, it seemed inevitable. You indicate a swipe motion. \"You can look through there if you want.\"\n\nHe didn't seem particularly interested but he politely begins looking through your photo album of you and Samantha together. All the usual couple photos flash by. His big eyes taking in each happy photo. You notice him suddenly stiffen up, his eyes widening as his thick eyebrows raise. Looking down you see he was looking at a photo of a naked Sam on her knees looking up at the camera, her lips wrapped around your hard cock.\n\nYou burst out laughing. \"Ha ha ha ha! Holy shit! I forgot I left that in there!\" You snatch the phone back as Charlie looks up at you with stunned eyes. \"Ha ha ha ha! Sorry dude. You saw a little more than I meant.\" Popping the phone back in your pocket you quip. \"Glad it was you to stumble across that, and not my parents or something.\" It might have been your turn to blush but you didn't blush easily, you just thought it was funny.\n\nCharlie starts to giggle and cover his face with his hand. Your grin widened, finally something that loosened this guy up. The pair of you sit laughing as the waitress arrives with your pizza. She sets it on a tray in the middle of the table. Taking up the pizza slice serving thingy you hive off two pieces for Charlie then serve yourself three.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He says. He picks up his knife and fork and begins eating. You watch him slicing it into bite size pieces and shake your head.\n\n\"Dude, just grab it, by the crust.\" You laugh. \"Is that a Canadian thing?\"\n\nHe looks up. \"Uh, no. I just...uh...that's how I eat...\" He suddenly smiles. \"Okay!\" Grabbing one of the slices he brushes his long bangs to the side and stuffs the pizza into his mouth. His cheeks bulging with pizza he smiles again as he starts chewing. It was a silly little moment, but it was a moment. You weren't sure why but you really liked Charlie. He was so odd but he seemed like a good guy. Also, he was even further away from home than you were and he was just as alone as you were. You felt an odd kinship with this strange little man.\n\n\"Ha! There ya go.\" You encourage him happily as you start scarfing down your own. It was pretty good.\n\nThings ease up with Charlie as you continue to eat and drink together. You ate most of the pizza yourself but he didn't seem to mind. There wasn't much more conversation but what there was was pleasant.\n\nYou pay the bill and the pair of you are soon on the way back to the room. It was dark out now, only the regular lamps along the path and the lights of the building illuminating the way. Side by side you walk down the path together.\n\n***\n\nYou have only just set off for the dorm when you clear your throat. \"I'm just going to make a quick call.\" Those pictures of Samantha had you missing her already. Not one tiny iota of you regretted being here or leaving without her...but it sure would have been nice to have someone to lie with at night.\n\nYou call your girlfriend as Charlie walks quietly beside you. You hear Sam's familiar voice. \"Hey babe!\"\n\n\"Hey Sammy! Miss me yet?\"\n\n\"Of course! How was your first day in the big city?\" There is a moment. \"Have you cheated on me yet?\"\n\nYou laugh, you knew she was teasing but you also knew it was a concern of hers. You play along. \"Actually I just took someone out for dinner. Now we're going back to my place. Just the two of us, alone. It's going to be awesome.\" You shoot Charlie a playful wink. He forces an awkward chuckle.\n\n\"You shit.\" Sam gripes.\n\n\"Ha ha ha. Nah. My new roommate Charlie and I just grabbed some pizza. He arrived early too. He's a cool guy, I think you'll like him.\" You say. As you turned that statement over in your mind you weren't actually too sure of that. Sam could be mean, cruel even, to those she thought were weird or geeky. You really didn't care for that facet of her personality but when you were around she would behave herself.\n\n\"Handsome?\" She asks.\n\n\"Very handsome.\" You respond.\n\n\"I can't wait to meet him.\"\n\nThe conversation moves on to how your trip was and how you were settling in. There really wasn't much to tell yet, you'd just seen her that morning. But it was nice to hear her voice regardless. Before too long you are saying your goodbyes.\n\n\"Bye baby, love you!\"\n\n\"Bye Sam...\" You hesitate just a heartbeat. \"...love you too.\" You say like you knew you ought to. It's not that you didn't love her but...anyways.\n\nYou hang up and put the phone in your pocket. Looking to your side you discover Charlie was gone. Peering back over your shoulder you can just make him out standing perfectly still in the middle of a dark spot along the path. You stop and turn. \"Charlie?\" \n\nHe excitedly waves you over. You walk back, confused as to what was happening. As you get closer your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness. His face is up turned, his ever present bangs pushed to the side, he looks this way and that, his head darting here and there. A look of wonder on his delicate features and his full lips in a big smile.\n\n\"Charlie?\"\n\n\"Shhh.\" He whispers as he raises a hand. He points skyward at nothing in particular. \"Do you hear them?\"\n\nOh Jesus, was this guy about to snap? Was Charlie crazy?\n\nListening into the still night you initially hear nothing. And then you do! Ticking, clicking, chirping.\n\nCharlie looks at you with wide eyed wonder. \"Bats!\" He whispers excitedly. A bright grin on his face. He looked so...happy. \"Come on.\" He says in hushed excitement as he heads off the path and over toward a large open green space nearby. You hesitate a moment. Man this guy was one strange dude. You have a brief internal debate on what to do, but you eventually follow.\n\nYou catch up to him as he is sitting down on a bench overlooking the open space. You take a spot on the opposite end of the bench, leaving a good arms length between you. The pale light of a gibbous moon bathed the area.\n\n\"There!\" Charlie says in a hushed tone as one of the nocturnal little mammals swoops overhead and out over the field beyond. \"There!\" He points as another zips across the open space. \"They're hunting. Eating bugs.\" He informs you. His excitement is infectious. \"They sound different than back home.\" He giggles. \"There's one!\" One flutters by to the left, extremely close to the bench.\n\nWell. This is not what you were planning to do tonight but...what the hell. As if you had anything better to do. The pair of you sit in silence as you watch and listen to the bats on their night hunt.\n\nIn the wane white light shadows were more pronounced and everything took on an almost magical quality. Looking over at your companion even he looked different. He had pulled his hair back to get a better look, the moonlight shining straight down onto his dainty features. His hair tucked behind his ears so he could hear better. His ear, it was small, like the rest of him. Delicate. You notice the smooth gentle curve of his jaw line and his soft rounded chin. His full plump lips were in the most pleasant and genuine smile you'd ever seen. His raven black thick wavy hair glistened. His pale slender fingers gripped the front edge of the bench, he was on the edge of his seat. He looks left, right, spins back again. Completely caught up in the moment. His wide expressive eyes looking upon the scene before him in an almost reverence. He glances those huge soulful eyes toward you and flashes you a joyous look. He lets out a little laugh at sharing this moment with someone. There is just a brief second's eye contact before he looks back again.\n\nHe was so...he was so...\n\nYou shake your head. A trick of the moonlight. You look back out to watch the nocturnal hunters do their business. You say in a low quiet voice. \"Do you like bats Charlie?\"\n\nHe nods. \"Sure. Bats, animals, plants, just nature really. I used to go hiking and camping all the time back in B.C. A lot of times alone. It's so quiet out there. So peaceful.\" He is quiet for a time before he says. \"I'll miss that.\"\n\nYou stretch your legs and put your hands behind your head. You listen to the trills and clicks of the bats. A little night time symphony with an audience of two. You suggest. \"There are trails and campgrounds around here.\"\n\nHe laughs. \"Trails are okay. But I like to get off the beaten path.\" You believed that. Charlie definitely didn't seem the type to take the road most traveled. \"Yeah, I'll have to look into it.\" He replies.\n\n\"Well...let me know. Maybe we can get a group together, make a whole thing out of it.\" You offer.\n\n\"Oh...uh, sure Jonathan.\" He says quietly, obviously not sure about that last part.\n\nThe pair of you watch the scene for what must be an hour. It was a quiet time, easy, comfortable. Charlie was finally just himself and it was nice to see. This is not something you would normally do but it was pretty damn cool, you couldn't deny it. Eventually though you'd had enough. You were getting cool, you didn't have as many layers on as he did.\n\nSlapping your knees you announce. \"Well, I'm heading home. You coming?\"\n\nHe nods. He reaches up and tussles his hair, his curtain of bangs returning. You return to the path, Charlie in an even better mood than after the pizza.\n\n\"How's Samantha?\" He asks.\n\n\"Oh fine. Misses me like crazy.\" As you thought about the empty bed awaiting you...you were missing her too.\n\nBefore long you see the old chapel, then the dorm hall beside it. The very sight of it brings a smile. A little place of your own. Not your parent's house, not a hotel room, not a friend's house. A room all your own...well, half a room.\n\nYou say in unmasked exuberance. \"Ah, home sweet home!\"\n\n***\n\nThe pair of you make your way into the hall. In the common room of the third floor you meet Luiz who was kicking back and watching a movie. You introduce yourself and your too quiet roommate. Sitting down on one of the chairs you begin striking up a conversation with the man. Charlie fades off and heads to the room. You learn Luiz had been here a long time, this was his fifth year in the hall and he didn't seem to be in any particular hurry to get out.\n\nYou sit and chat learning a few things along the way. You learn that the big woman you met was the resident manager who kept things in order in the hall. She lived on the first floor. Everyone called her Mama Rose and she was a sweetheart who loved her boys as long as they followed the rules. She wasn't strict but she was no push over either. You learn Professor Williams, the Resident Dean that you had met earlier, was rarely seen. He was technically available for advice and guidance though few actually made use of him. You also learn that there was something of a rivalry with the dorm across the yard. It was something that stretched back almost a century. Finally you learn that the days of freshman hazing were over, but that you might have a rough time with some of the more senior students regardless.",
        "You sit a while but the movie Luiz was watching was atrocious. You excuse yourself and head to your room. You hear Charlie just finishing a phone call as you enter. \"Okay, love you to Mom. Yep, bye.\"\n\nYou close the door behind you and hang your jacket on a hanger on the back side of the door. Charlie had on a set of full on pajamas. Blue and white striped, loose button up shirt and pants that matched. Over the years of traveling around for soccer tournaments or swim meets you had never met a guy your age who actually wore old man pajamas like this. After a moment's thought...you would expect no different from Charlie.\n\n\"Going to bed already?\" You ask, it was not quite 11 pm.\n\nHe shakes his head. \"I can read if you want to stay up. I don't mind.\"\n\nYou shrug. \"Eh, we'll see. I might watch a movie or something. Let me know if I'm bothering you.\"\n\nHe nods.\n\nPeeling off your shirt you throw it in a ball at the base of your dresser. Looking in a mirror that was set up on your side, opposite the bathroom door, you take a quick look at your exposed upper torso. Fuck, while you weren't obsessed with your looks you had to admit that you were looking good. With only having your lame ass truck wash job this past year you had stepped up your workouts. Washboard abs, nice V taper, wide thick pecs, round shoulders, and definition everywhere. Add to this that all of the outdoor swimming you had done over the summer had given you a perfect bronze tan.\n\nAt the corner of the mirror you can see Charlie looking at you, staring at you. Eyes wide. Obviously admiring your fit body. You'd seen it before, that look of envy on guys who didn't have the discipline or desire to get into shape. You see a blush come his face as he turns away suddenly. He grabs the back of his desk chair with both hands and stares out the window.\n\nYou sigh. You knew this wasn't going to go over well. Charlie being as bashful as he was. But this was your space too and you'd be damned if you would be creeping around hiding yourself for however long you stayed here. It wasn't who you were and you needed to be comfortable as well. Charlie wanted his privacy and you would respect that, but that didn't apply to you. You were very comfortable with your body, it helped that you had nothing to complain about down below.\n\nYou unbutton your pants and slide them off, followed by your socks. Without a pause you then slip off your boxer-briefs. Charlie gripped the chair in front of him and wasn't moving a muscle. With it being dark outside you knew he was likely seeing what was happening behind him in the reflection off the window.\n\nIt felt good to be naked, you'd always enjoyed it.\n\n\"I'm hitting the shower.\" You say as you head into the bathroom. Once more you leave the door open behind you. He might have to take a leak or something in the meantime. You stop then return to the main room, you'd forgotten your bathroom kit. Charlie stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, his eyes darting everywhere but on you. You felt bad making him feel uncomfortable, but it was something he would have to get used to if he was going to live with you. You grab the kit then head back in.\n\nYou unpack your toiletries and take a quick hot shower. It was a small walk-in affair, no tub or anything. But at least the pressure was good and the water was hot. You then freshen up a bit at the sink. You put your razor beside Charlie's, you make a mental note that Charlie's razor looked brand new. You brush your teeth then wipe the steamed mirror with a hand towel and brush your hair. You look at your shoulder length hair...it looked so...small town. You'd get a cut tomorrow. Maybe a fade on the sides, keep some length up top.\n\nHeading back out you see Charlie was sitting up in his bed, his legs under the blankets, pillow behind his back. He had open a thick plain looking book in what appeared to be French. Without otherwise moving his eyes quietly follow you as you walk across the room. Opening your dresser you pull out a fresh pair of undies.\n\n\"Whatcha reading?\" You ask in a friendly manner.\n\n\"Sartre.\" He responds as he peeks once more your way.\n\n\"Oh.\" You had no clue. Some French biologist maybe. You pull on the underwear. \"Good book?\"\n\n\"Eh, I guess.\" He states flatly.\n\nNot exactly a glowing endorsement. Why was he reading it then? You sit on your bed and look at your computer. Ah fuck the movie, you were going to turn in. Lying down on top of your blankets you put your hands behind your head and stare up at the ceiling. You say. \"G'night Charlie. It was good to meet you.\"\n\nCatching the hint your roommate puts his book away and turns off his reading lamp. The room falls into darkness, just a slight glow from the pathway lamps outside filtering in creating a dim lit corridor down the center of the room between the two beds. You hear him shuffle as he gets under his blankets.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Jonathan.\" His soft light voice floats across from the impenetrable darkness of his side of the room.\n\n\"Yes Charlie.\"\n\n\"It was good to meet you too.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Jonathan.\"\n\nYou chuckle. \"Yes Charlie.\"\n\n\"Um...nothing.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"What is it Charlie?\"\n\n\"Do, uh, do you want to have breakfast together?\"\n\nYou chuckle again. He was a funny funny guy. \"Sure Charlie. Good night Charlie.\"\n\n\"Good night Jonathan.\"\n\n***\n\nLying there you soon hear Charlie's deep steady breathing. He must have fallen straight asleep.\n\nYou lie there in the quiet staring up into the darkness. What an amazing day it had been. It really felt like that trite expression: The first day of the rest of your life. You'd taken your first steps out on your own. You reflect over the day gone by.\n\nThe long drive, your anticipating growing with every mile of distance put behind you. The way through the city traffic. Getting through the campus. Meeting Mama Rose. Finding the room. Startling your new roommate. Meeting Charlie.\n\nMeeting Charlie.\n\nYou turn your head though you could see nothing of his side of the room. You do hear his breathing had gotten even deeper, heavier, more forceful. Hopefully he wasn't a snorer.\n\nHe was so different from anyone you'd met before. You couldn't put your finger on it. He was cut off, guarded, but oh so open and vulnerable. His awkwardness and shyness had a strange charm. There was a deep intelligence there but he didn't flaunt it. You'd just met him but you genuinely liked him, a lot. He was different and right now in your life different was good.\n\nThe memory comes to you of Charlie staring up into the night, his soft fine boned features bathed in the cool moonlight. That innocent joy on his face as he watched the feeding bats. You remember him stuffing that piece of pizza into his mouth as if it was a moment of rebellion...no...as if it was a moment of emancipation. You remember his big chestnut eyes on you as you left the bathroom after your shower...\n\nYou smile and shake your head. It really had been an overwhelming day. It seemed like everything about it made you happy, you'd associated everything that had happened with your big moment of freedom. You were being ridiculous. So ridiculous. It was a big day for you, a day you had dreamed about for years, this was probably normal.\n\nFrom the other side of the room you suddenly hear his breathing stop altogether for a moment...followed a little muffled gasp, as if through a pillow. \"...ohhhmmm...\" It was so very soft and muted, had it not been so quiet in the room you never would have heard it. Was he dreaming? His breathing had become shallow, rapid, and erratic. Slowly...slowly...it returns to normal. A small gentle high pitched moan accompanying his breathing as it finally returned to normal. He was quiet once more.\n\nYou finally get under the blankets and before long you are drifting off to sleep. Your only memory of the dreams of that night are the clicks and chirps...of bats.\n\n***\n\nYou wake early, as you often did. You were a naturally early riser and generally only needed five or six hours sleep to feel well rested. Sitting up you swing your legs over the side of the bed. The room was already well lit from the bright rising sun. Squinting as you look out the window you remind yourself to get some curtains or something to put up.\n\nLooking over to your roommate you see he is lying face down, his arms under the pillow beneath his head and his dainty right foot sticking out of the covers over the side of the bed.\n\nYou get up and go take a piss. You splash some water on your face and freshen up a bit. Shave, brush your teeth, etc. Heading back to the room you throw on a t shirt and sit at your desk to start getting a few thing set up with your laptop. First connecting to the dorm wireless, then setting up your student account on the various campus sites.\n\nYou hear Charlie start to rustle and move. He turns over on his back, slowly opens his eyes, then shoots up to a sitting position. He looks around as if reminding himself as to where he was. He settles after a moment. He looks over to you and smiles. \"Good Morning Jonathan.\"\n\nYou smile and nod.\n\nHe rubs his bleary eyes. He crawls out of bed and grabs many of the same clothes as he wore yesterday before stumbling to the bathroom. His zombie stagger revealing that he was not a morning person. He is in there a long time before finally reappearing. \"Food Services Dining Hall good enough?\" He asks.\n\nYou look over your should at him as you close your computer. \"Yeah, breakfast. That's right. Uh. My food card isn't active yet.\"\n\n\"Mine is.\" He produces it from his pocket and shows it too you. \"It's unlimited too.\" He grins. \"It was one of the perks they offered me. I owe you one anyways.\"\n\nPerks? No one offered you any perks. You remembered waiting nervously for the acceptance letter to arrive. You were pretty sure you'd make it in but until it actually arrived there was at least some doubt. It sounds like Charlie had had a bidding war for his attendance.\n\nYou get up, throw on some pants and slip on your shoes. Together you make your way, after a few wrong turns, to the food hall. It was sort of a buffet affair with a large common room eating area. You both load your plates and Charlie pays. As you head into dining area you notice the same group of girls you had asked directions from last night sitting at one of the large round tables. \"Come on Charlie.\" You say as you make a beeline for their table.\n\n\"Uh...\" You hear him say behind you.\n\nAs you arrive they all look up and smile. Four college aged cuties...man, if you weren't already taken...\n\n\"These seats taken?\" You ask. There were plenty of other places to sit, but you were in the mood to meet some people.\n\n\"No!\" One of them says. \"No, go ahead. Did you guys find the pizza place okay?\"\n\nYou set down your tray and nod. \"Yep, thanks again.\"\n\nReluctantly Charlie takes a seat beside you. You smile at him, he grimaces back. He was not happy with this at all. Ah, it would be good for him to socialize a bit.\n\nYou and the four girls begin some lively flirtatious chit chat. You learn a bit about each other. Charlie just sat quietly beside you. The inevitable topic of your availability was subtly questioned.\n\n\"I've got a girlfriend back home, she'll be joining me next year.\" You inform them, much to their chagrin. \"But my quiet Canadian friend here...he's a free man.\"\n\nHe looks at you with wide frightened eyes. You give him an unspoken little look as if to say. 'Dude! Go for it!' This was low hanging fruit, he just had to reach out and grab it. If you could help him 'become a man' you'd consider that a big accomplishment for your freshman year.\n\nYou crow. \"Yep, single for the moment.\" You laugh and shoot him a wink. \"I suspect that won't last long.\"\n\nThe girls were very much interested in this news and begin talking to him. Asking him all sorts of questions and giving him pretty smiles and suggestive stares.\n\nCharlie remained quiet, awkwardly quiet, painfully quiet. His scared eyes darting this way and that. He was blowing it! You nudge him elbow to elbow. \"Come on Charlie, speak up.\" You turn to the girls. \"He's just a bit shy...\"\n\nCharlie stands up suddenly. \"I-I-I've g-got to...g-go!\" Without another word he turns and walks briskly away, almost tripping over his chair in the process. He storms out of the hall, his half eaten breakfast sitting there on the table. You and the girls all sit there stunned.\n\nYou turn to them. \"Sorry about that. I...uh...I better see...\" You point over your shoulder. They just nod, not sure of what to make of it all.\n\nYou stand and sprint out of the hall. You don't see him in the hallway. You continue your way out the doors and you finally see him walking briskly out along one of the paths. You rush to catch up.\n\n\"Charlie! Charlie wait!\" You call out. You run up beside him. \"Dude, calm down. What's wrong?\"\n\nHe stops, his small hands balled in fists. His face was turned partially away from you, his hair covering his eyes. \"D-d-don't you ever do that to me again!\" He hisses. Holy shit...was he crying!? He was crying! You couldn't believe it, this guy was one sensitive soul!\n\nYou put a hand on his shoulder. \"Hey man, calm down. I didn't know you'd react like that. I was trying to help you out.\"\n\nHe was fuming, he continued to hide his face from you. \"I-I-I don't n-need your help J-J-Jonathan.\"\n\nPeople were turning their heads as they walked by, wondering what the drama was about. You couldn't believe you were doing this with a guy you just met yesterday evening. With your roommate of all people. You were not used to this among your male friends. This display of emotion might be something you ribbed a friend about back home or just told them to suck it up. But you lived with this guy, you needed to mend this fence. More importantly...you truly felt bad that you'd hurt his feelings. You felt downright retched about it.\n\n\"Charlie. I'm sorry, really. I was a total asshole back there. A total total asshole. I should have at least talked to you first.\" You squeeze his slender shoulder. \"It won't happen again, okay? I promise. I promise you that.\"\n\nHe is quiet a time. He finally nods. \"Okay Jonathan.\" He reaches up and squeezes your hand in his, an odd gesture to be sure. \"I'll...I'll see you back at the room.\" After a moment he adds. \"I-I'm sorry I acted like that.\"\n\n\"Sure Charlie. It's okay. I'll see you later.\" You watch in confusion as he walks away. You hoped he was okay. You hoped things were still cool between you.\n\nOkay, wow, lesson learned. You would be more careful with Charlie in the future.\n\n***\n\nYou start walking toward the campus bookstore, you had noticed a hair salon near there when you were on the way to breakfast. As you go you just couldn't let go of what had happened, it played on you. Your downcast mood was slowly but surely starting to turn sour.\n\nFuckin Charlie. Man he over reacted. You kept running the scene over and over in your mind. You were just trying to help him get some tail. Most guys would have thanked you! What was wrong with him? You shake your head. This was bothering you WAY more than it ought to. What the hell was wrong with you? You simply could not understand the intensity of your emotions right now.\n\nIf you were truly honest with yourself it wasn't the embarrassment of the scene, you could give a shit about that, it was the fact you hurt him. That was what was really getting to you. You felt like you'd whipped a puppy or something.\n\nYou find a quiet area and pull out your phone. You dial Samantha, you just had to talk to someone. Anyone. She has barely answered before you go off on Charlie. You tell her all about the scene at breakfast. You tell her how you were just trying to give a guy a hand. You try to explain what was riling you up but you failed miserably.\n\nThere is silence for a time on the other end of the line. \"Jon.\"\n\n\"What?\" You snap.\n\n\"Who the fuck cares? Seriously. Who cares?\" She responds. \"This guy sounds like a total shut-in perma-virgin nerd loser. Fuck him. I mean, if he's got you so mad kick his ass or something. He's not worth your time though.\"\n\nThe conflicting emotions rising in you surprises you. Just moments before you were ranting about him now suddenly you felt defensive of him. You sigh as your anger subsides. \"He's not a loser. And I'm not kicking anyone's ass. Jesus.\"\n\nShe wonders. \"Were you trying to impress the girls or something?\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\"\n\n\"Better not have been! Anyways, than it's no big deal. None of your business if he's a virgin. Let the loser be a loser.\"\n\n\"He's not a loser, he's cool.\" You insist.\n\n\"Doesn't sound cool. He's an emotionally fucked up asshole. Probably a faggot.\"\n\n\"Don't say that Sam!\"\n\n\"Calm down. Why is this bothering you anyways? He's just your roomie for fuck sake, who cares?\" She laughs. \"I know what it is! You're missing me already aren't you? That's got you all crabby. Awww, my Jon misses me. Maybe next year we can get an apartment together, huh? A little love nest of our very own. Doesn't that sound nice?\" She coos.\n\nYou close your eyes and rub them with your fingers and thumb. You let out a long sigh. This had been a huge mistake. You shouldn't have called her. She just didn't understand, hell...you didn't even understand. \"Yeah, that does sound nice. Uh...I gotta go okay. Sorry I bothered you.\"\n\nShe laughs. \"No bother. You know it is still early, you could probably get another room. Dump the loser Jon.\"\n\n\"Bye Sammy.\" You say.\n\n\"Bye baby, miss you. Love you.\"\n\n\"Yeah...um yeah...love you too.\" You hang up.\n\nYou take a deep breath. Pull yourself together Jon. You were acting so fucking weird. You put the phone away and go to continue on toward the hair salon...no. Not yet. You hated dancing around shit, you'd deal with this head on. You jog off toward the dorm.\n\n***\n\nYou burst into your dorm room scaring Charlie half to death. He was sitting on his bed, no book, no device, just sitting there alone.\n\nYou say in an upbeat tone. \"Come on Charlie, let's get out of here.\"\n\nHe looks up at you surprised. \"What?\"\n\nYou grin. \"Let's get out and stretch our legs. Take a tour of the campus. I saw a few ponds and a stream along the West end. Plus I need to get my haircut. Maybe we can swing by Biology and Kinesiology. See some of our classrooms. Come on, don't make me go alone.\"\n\nIt was obvious what you were doing, trying to put the morning's drama behind you. You didn't care if you were obvious. You just didn't want to be angry or confused anymore. You wanted to make things cool again with the one person you knew in the city.\n\nCharlie smiles. \"I thought you'd be mad.\"\n\nYou quip. \"What, mad at myself being an asshole? If I did that I'd be like mad all the damn time.\"\n\nHe laughs. \"Um, okay.\" He gets up and grabs his jacket.\n\nTogether you make your way out. You swing by the salon first and schedule an appointment for later in the afternoon. After that the pair of you explore the expansive campus. You take side trails and cut through buildings. You find hidden little nooks and dead ends. The older buildings were the most interesting. You get into places you probably weren't allowed to go. You check out your different departments, scope out a few classrooms you knew you'd be going to very soon, and even ride a few elevators just for the hell of it. After a while you are starting to get a sense of the layout.\n\nYou stop and talk to the various people you meet as you were want to do, Charlie happy to stand quietly with you as you introduced you both and began to converse. You don't press him to engage, allowing him to grow into the discussion if he wanted to. When others do start to talk with him you give him some time and space to respond but if you notice his anxiety rising you step in and take over.\n\nHe eventually acknowledges exactly what you were doing for him. You just smile and tell him. \"No problem.\"",
        "The companionship is easy and pleasant. Now that you knew of some of his sensitives and oddities and he knew of your lack of subtlety and energetic exuberance the pair of you got on extremely well. You don't talk all that much, learning more about each other bit by tiny bit. The conversation might have been a bit sparse but you enjoy each other's company regardless. He was just nice to be around.\n\nAt the ponds you stay for a long time, watching the frogs and water fowl do their thing. At one point you stand watching him as he follows a frog along the edge of the pond. You think about Sam's comments. You had to forgive her for what she'd said. She just didn't know Charlie. She didn't understand. She was just being protective and supportive of you after your nonsensical ranting. Once she met him she'd see how great he was.\n\nThe day whisks by in no time at all. The pair of you barely make it back in time for your hair appointment.\n\nYou say. \"If you want to head home...\"\n\nHe smiles. \"I'll wait. I don't mind.\"\n\nYou look at him for a spell. Outside of Sam, your Mom and maybe your sister you didn't know anyone else who would just wait around for you to get a haircut. It weirded you out on some level, but Charlie was Charlie. Weird is what he did. You nod.\n\nYou head in and quickly start looking through one of the hair style books they had, you hadn't had time to really think about it. You had not expected your whole day to flash by like it had with your new friend. You smile. Yeah, he was a friend wasn't he? Not just a roomie, but a friend. You snap back to reality as the hair stylist walks up. \"Jon? Your turn.\"\n\nShit, you hadn't chosen yet. You give the woman a vague description of what you wanted, fade along the sides but with some length up top, and let her work her magic. You'd seen a lot of guys in soccer with that style, you thought you'd give it a try. You sit and watch in amazement as your long locks fall to the ground. You'd worn your hair like this since...you couldn't remember when. Well, not anymore!\n\nWhen she is done you sit and stare in the mirror. Oh wow, you looked so different. Good, but different. The top still had a decent amount of length, still plenty long enough to run your fingers through it. You still had maybe a half inch long hair as far down as mid way, after that though it got gradually got short. Real short...to the point of non-existence around the base. You run your hands along the side of your head...so short! It felt funny, sensitive, ticklish. Your hairdresser seemed very pleased with the results as she looked you over. You definitely didn't look 'small town' now. You thank her and pay her and you were on your way. You walk out and soon find your new friend sitting on a nearby bench. He looks up and gives you a huge bright grin.\n\n\"Nice!\" He says.\n\nYou chuckle. \"Yeah, not bad huh?\" You run your fingers along the side of your head, feeling the super short hairs against your sensitive scalp. \"Feels weird though.\"\n\nHe stands and reaches up to feel for himself. You were not expecting this! You go to recoil...but you don't. His slender fingers brushing slowly and gently along the side and around the back of your newly shorn head, his eyes focused on the new style. His finger tips rub and stroke the tender skin. Tracing lightly around your newly exposed ear. Time...almost seems to slow down.\n\nWithout meaning to you shift yourself forward, moving into his space, moving right up close to him, almost enveloping him with your larger frame, looking down at him as he looks up at you and lightly strokes your head. You stood so close you could smell him. He slowly moves his gaze, those chestnut brown eyes, to look into your eyes...\n\nWhoa! You blink and take a sudden step back, pulling yourself away from his touch. \"Uh...yeah. Feels weird dude. I'm so used to longer hair.\"\n\nHe is still gazing at you intently. This time it was your turn to look away, to break eye contact. \"I think it looks good.\" He assures you in his soft voice.\n\n\"Sure, thanks. I hope Sam likes it.\" You say. You then repeat again for no reason. \"Yeah, I sure hope Samantha like it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she will.\" He replies solemnly.\n\nTogether you grab an early supper then head back toward the dorm. You were starting to notice more and more students arriving now. The front of your hall far more busy than what it had been even just this morning. You see two more guys with suitcases and backpacks making their way into the hall.\n\nA few of the new arrivals were out on a lawn tossing a Frisbee around. One of them waves at you. \"Hey, wanna join?\" They were fellow freshman, like you they looking to make new friends in this new environment.\n\n\"Sure!\" You call out. Turning to Charlie you say. \"Join me?\"\n\nHe is hesitant for a moment, but he finally smiles and nods. The pair of you jog forward and join the toss about. There were about eight of you tossing the disk and chatting, making introductions, posturing, the usual stuff. Very casual. Charlie is quiet but keeps the rhythm of the game going easily, no one pays him much mind.\n\nAt one point the Frisbee is tossed just a bit too far and too high. Your eyes focused skyward you run for it. You run, you leap, you reach. One of the other guys calls out. \"Look out!\"\n\nCRUNCH!\n\nYou feel something, someone actually, collide with your shoulder and side. Being an athlete you keep your concentration and nab the Frisbee from out of the air and land on your feet. You hear a meaty thud as someone lands hard onto the ground beside you. The others howl with laughter and cries of \"Ohhhh!\"\n\nLooking down at your feet you see little Charlie crumpled on his side. He groans and rolls in pain. The pair of you had been going for the same throw and hadn't seen each other. He definitely got the worst of it. You toss the Frisbee back to the others and hold your hand up to indicate you were done. They wave back and continue their play. You look down and smile. You'd taken more than your fair share of falls like this, you were pretty sure he wasn't too injured.\n\nKneeling down over him you roll him over to his back. He looks up at you, the pain fading from his expression as he gazes up you. You bend down over him and look him in the face. He seemed okay. As he gazes he goes to reach up in an attempt to touch your face.\n\nYou push his hand away. Weird enough him stroking your hair in public. \"You okay?\" You ask.\n\nHe gives you a cringing smile. \"Yeah, sure.\" He just lay there looking up at you, not attempting to move. Just looking. Seeming to enjoy this moment despite the pain.\n\nYou laugh. Grabbing his hand you say. \"Get up dude. You're okay.\"\n\nYou easily power him up off the ground, he was as light as he looked. You dust him off.\n\n\"Gonna kiss his boo boo?\" One of the guys call.\n\nYou laugh and flip the guy the bird, this elicits more laughter from the others.\n\nCharlie was holding his shoulder and limping. The right side of his body had taken the brunt of both the collision and the landing. \"Oooo, that hurts. I'm...I'm just going to go in.\" He moans.\n\nYou follow along. \"Lucky for you you are roommate is with a Sports Medicine guy huh? Treatment and rehab is right up my alley.\" You hold out your 'healing hands' in demonstration.\n\nCharlie is laughing through his pain. \"You literally haven't even taken one single class yet.\"\n\nYou just grin as you help him up the short couple of stairs to the main doors. \"Don't worry. I'm a natural.\"\n\n***\n\nInside the hall you see a lot more people now. The place must have been half full now. The huge roly-poly form of Mama Rose, in a fashion disaster black dress with a bright pink rose pattern splayed across it, was rushing this way and that trying to help all the new young men get settled in. She was in the center of a whirlwind of activity, and she seemed happy as a clam.\n\nSeeing Charlie holding his shoulder and limping she rushes up. \"Oh, what happened sweet thing?\"\n\n\"I fell.\" Charlie says quietly.\n\nYou chuckle. \"Sweet thing? Am I a sweet thing too Mama Rose?\"\n\nShe gives you an exaggerated 'hubba hubba' sort of look up and down your rugged physique. \"Honey, if Mama Rose was thirty years younger I'd show you what a sweet thing you were.\" She growls like a hungry tiger.\n\nYou burst out laughing as she smiles and heads off to help some other hapless freshman. The way you heard Colleges were she could probably get in trouble just for saying that, she didn't seem to care. Among her boys she was in her element.\n\n\"Oh my god, she's awesome.\" You say.\n\nCharlie giggles. \"She pinched my cheeks when I moved in.\" Both of you laugh as you continue on your way.\n\nYou help Charlie up the three flights of stairs. Your strong hands holding him by his shoulder and left elbow. He accepts your help gladly, leaning into you whenever he needed to. You were really starting to worry about his knee, it might be worse than you initially thought.\n\n\"Do you want to see a doctor? I could drive you, I have truck.\" You offer.\n\nHe shakes his head and grunts. \"No, I just want to rest.\"\n\n\"Well...let me look at it at least.\"\n\nYou might not have taken classes yet but you'd done some reading as it was a genuine interest of yours, plus you'd been on the receiving end of treatment various times over the years. You walk through the common room where three guys were chilling out. You notice Luiz sitting in the exact spot from yesterday and you give him a nod of acknowledgment He gives a little two finger wave back.\n\nYou get into the room and help your roommate onto his bed. He sits on the edge of his bed gripping the edge of the mattress slouched forward, his legs hanging over the side. \"Thanks.\" He says.\n\nYou look at him with concern. \"Charlie, I was serious. Would you let me look at your knee? I'd just like to check a few things. It could be a serious injury.\"\n\nHe looks up at you and is quiet.\n\nYou say in your most disarming tone. \"Um...I know, your privacy. Uh, do you have any shorts you could wear or maybe your bath robe? In your jeans I can't...\"\n\nHe says in his soft voice. \"You're worried about me.\"\n\nYou weren't sure if that was a question or a statement. Leave it to Charlie to make an awkward situation even more so. \"Well, kinda. I mean I feel kind of responsible. And, this is what I'm going to be studying. I swear, I'll be gentle. I just need to see the knee, that's all.\"\n\nHe nods. \"Okay Jonathan...okay...\" He sits a long moment without moving, as if he was turning something over in his mind.\n\n\"Would you like me to leave? While you get changed?\"\n\nHe shakes his head. He starts to undo his jeans, unfastening each button of his button fly slowly and deliberately. As if each button was a separate monumental decision he had to make. It is quiet in the room, every second felt like a minute. This was a big deal for Charlie, you felt for the poor guy.\n\nYou grab your desk chair and position it between the beds facing Charlie's bed. You then go and lock the door as you try to lighten the mood. \"There, no one will walk in. Don't worry Charlie, like I said when I met you. I've seen it all. You ever notice those gross old men that hang out in change rooms? Fuck, they're always naked.\"\n\nHe lets out a little halfhearted laugh, appreciating your attempt.\n\nHe stands and turns away from you and grabs the waist of his pants...and stops. He just stops.\n\nYou let out a sympathetic sigh. \"Hey, you know what. It's okay. We don't have to do this buddy. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't anything serious.\"\n\n\"No...I want you to. I want to.\" He says in a voice you could barely hear. \"It's just...it's only my second day and...I'm not allowed...I'm not allowed to...\" He trails off.\n\nYou cock your head. What the hell? \"Not allowed? Not allowed what?\"\n\n\"Um...I'm not supposed to...\" Nothing more was forthcoming.\n\n\"Listen, I don't know what you're talking about. I know you said you had a medical thing. But...you're your own man Charlie. We're out on our own now. No more parent's rules.\"\n\n\"No more parent's rules...\" He repeats to himself.\n\nYou couldn't help wonder why you were trying so hard to get this man's pants off. Sure you were worried about him, but...that wasn't it. You soften your tone. \"It's okay Charlie.\"\n\nIn a whisper he says. \"Okay Jonathan.\"\n\nThe trust he was showing you, a man he just met 24 hours ago, touched your heart. This couldn't be easy for him.\n\nHe lets go of the waistband of his loose fit jeans and allows them to fall to his ankles. He steps out of them and kicks them off to the side. He stood still as he worked up his nerve. His back was still turned to you...and you were mesmerized.\n\nYou didn't mean to, you really didn't mean to, but you couldn't help but stare. You had told the truth, over the years you'd seen it all in the various change rooms and locker rooms...but you hadn't seen this. His butt it...it wasn't... You were so confused. You KNEW he was a guy, you'd seen the bulge, but from behind...from behind he did not look like a guy at all, at least from the waist down. He had a curve to his hips, his smooth pale legs had a shapeliness to them, his ass was...it was beautiful! It was fucking beautiful! He wore tight men's briefs which only acted to highlight the differences from what he was supposed to look like. His cute bubble butt was rounder, wider than it should be...it was the ass of a woman. And a fine woman's ass at that! It wasn't as big and pronounced as Samantha's but it had a cute attraction all its own.\n\nYou consciously had to remind yourself who this was in front of you. Your unconscious brain though...it liked what it saw!\n\nHe turns back toward you, his head was down and you could see that furious blush through his bangs. Looking back down you see...yeah, he was a guy all right, no doubt about it. Fuck...and what a guy!\n\nYou can't help but let out a guffaw. Now that you had a closer look, wow! His prodigious bulge was outlined pretty well through his tight underwear. Hell, it likely rivaled your own, and you were the biggest guy you knew.\n\n\"Jesus Christ Charlie! You are hung my man!\"\n\nHe shifts uncomfortably and looks down toward his pants. You throw up your hands. \"Sorry, sorry! I shouldn't have said that.\" You smile at his blushing face. \"It was a compliment. I mean, it's not the axe but how you swing it but...it helps to have a big axe.\" You laugh. \"Dude, you are going to be a hit with the girls. I am telling you.\"\n\nYou pat the bed. \"Okay, sit down.\" You interlink your fingers and stretch them out as you take your seat. \"The doctor is in.\"\n\n***\n\nCharlie takes his seat in front of you. You were face to face, Charlie on his bed and you on your chair. He was up a bit higher than you. Carefully you take his leg and rest it on your thigh. You could already see an ugly looking bruise forming around his knee.\n\nNon-consciously your eyes run up and down his shapely leg, it took everything you had not to run your hands over them. They were pale, a creamy white. There was hair but just a fine light wisp, soft to the touch.\n\nNot like the thick coarse hairs of your legs. With your large strong tanned hands you gingerly begin feeling and probing around his injured knee. He flinches at first then forces himself to relax. You feel the front, around the kneecap, you run your hand along the sensitive underside. You get him to flex it, bend it, turn it. Your steady fingers feeling around at the tendons and joints and muscles. You were pretty confident nothing was really damaged, just a nasty bruise.\n\nYou don't say anything however.\n\nYou continue to feel his soft supple flesh. Gripping just a little higher up the thigh, running just a little lower down the slender calf. You begin to give him a light massage. No words were spoken, no words were needed. You rub and knead his lithe limb. As you go you begin exploring out from the knee more and more, you oh so slowly start to rub your outstretched hand up his inner thigh...stopping three quarters of the way up. You hear a soft sigh escape his lips. He sat perfectly still, watching you work his flesh in your large steady hands.\n\nYour eyes were locked on his shapely leg, you freeze as you stare.\n\nFuck. Fuck. Fuck no. No! This isn't happening right now.\n\nYou sit still. He sits still. Both of you knowing damn well what was happening but not acknowledging it. You could just make out his crotch peeking out from under his layered shirts. He was getting hard. Fuck...you were getting hard! You also notice a dark patch of wetness beneath his balls, probably sweat from the Frisbee...but you hadn't noticed it before. You grit your teeth. NO!\n\nYou push your chair back and too abruptly set his leg back onto the ground. He lets out a little yelp.\n\nYou say brusquely. \"It's fine. It's all fine. Just a bruise.\" You tear your eyes off of him, you were furious with yourself. Fuck you wanted him right then. You fucking wanted him!\n\nHe sits still. In his soft voice. \"Okay Jonathan. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Why don't you call me Jon?\" You snap. \"Everyone calls me Jon. Jon! Everyone. Why are you so fucking...\" You cut yourself off.\n\n\"Oh...um...oh...I'm sorry...\"\n\nYou sigh as you grip your forehead. \"Sorry. Christ, sorry Charlie. I don't know what's gotten into me. You can call me Jonathan if you want to.\" You wanted him to call you Jonathan, it was different, it was special. In that moment of caring you become a slave to your desires once more.\n\nYou look back up at him. You see in his wide brown eyes he was just as confused as you were. He didn't know what to do or say. But like you he didn't want it to end.\n\n\"How's...how's your shoulder?\" You move to sit beside him on the bed. He doesn't answer you, he just stares at you with those eyes...those incredible eyes.\n\nWithout hesitation you reach out and brush his hair back from his face. You hand resting gently on his smooth slender neck. Your gaze was locked in his. \"Your shoulder okay Charlie?\" You whisper as you begin to rub the back of his neck gently, his thick soft hair caressing the back of your hand. \"It's okay?\"\n\nHe gives you a slow barely perceptible little nod yes. He was lost in the moment. His breath picking up, that adorable flush brightening his face, his mouth slightly parted. He didn't move a muscle. He wasn't resisting you in the slightest.\n\nYou weren't thinking about his shoulder anymore. You start to run your fingers through his thick rich raven black hair, it was so different from Samantha's straight thin blonde locks. You reach up with your other hand and, after a brief pause, so very lightly begin tracing your index and middle finger around the edges of his full plump kissable lips. His breathing picks up more. You trace and feel those full pink lips. He...he kisses the tip of your middle finger...and again...he opens his lips and...sucks...sucks so lightly on the tip of your finger. You watch mesmerized as he tenderly licks and sucks the sensitive tip of your middle finger, his beautiful eyes locked on yours.\n\nReaching back around you cup his head with both hands, your fingers running through his hair, your inner wrists touching his dainty jawline. You pull him toward you, reaching out to him with your lips. He closes his eyes and lets out a long hot breath, parting his lips for you. You pull him closer...closer... Your nose brushes softly against his... Closer...\n\nBAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!\n\nA loud hammering knock on the door drums through the room shattering the fragile intimate moment.\n\nThank God!\n\nYou shake your head, shaking off his bewitching effect on you. You stand abruptly, actually pushing roughly off of him. Forcing him back onto his bed. You spring away from him as if he was red hot. You hurry to move toward the door. \"Put your pants on. Put your fucking pants on!\" You order your roommate in a hushed but brisk rude tone.\n\nYou instantly regret your harsh tone. Deeply deeply regret it. You wanted to apologize, you wanted to scream at him, you wanted to jump out the window, you wanted to jump on him and ravish him. You didn't know what you wanted! Your head was a dizzying confused jumble.",
        "Samantha, Samantha. Think of Samantha!\n\nHe scrambles to the ground and pulls his pants on, buttoning them up quickly. You shift uncomfortably, just then realizing the raging hard on you were sporting. You adjust your long shirt to cover it. He stands facing out the window, he was tense, confused, afraid. He didn't know what to do. He covers his face with his hand and trembles. Your first instinct was to go to him, to hold him...\n\nFUCK! STOP THIS!!\n\nYou glare at him. Not gay he said, yeah fucking right. He was gay alright. So what the fuck was your excuse?\n\nYou turn to answer the door.\n\n***\n\nYou open the door. A short chunky guy with a bad stringy beard greets you. \"Hey bro. Gang Beasts in the common room. You in?\"\n\n\"Yep.\" You say, seeing an escape route.\n\nLooking over your shoulder he calls to Charlie. \"What about you bro?\" There was no answer. He shrugs.\n\nYou step out of the room and close the door too swiftly behind you. It closes with a slam. The guy continues to go door to door seeing who was interested in the game. You walk to the common room to see a group of five guys, four of them playing the game on a PlayStation that hadn't been there before that was hooked up to the television.\n\nThey give you a quick nod to acknowledge your entrance. You nod back and take a seat on a couch a bit further back, away from the controllers. You had no interest in playing, you had just needed to get out of the room for a while.\n\nYou couldn't believe what had just happened. You could still feel you had a half chub from the experience. Sitting by yourself you turn things over in your mind. Taking time to try to sort things out.\n\nSomeone asks if you wanted to play and you shake your head. \"Nah, I'll just watch.\"\n\nYou think and think. These feelings were all new to you. In all your experiences you had never for a second considered yourself...that way. The more you dwell on it you slowly come to the dawning realization. It wasn't because Charlie was a man that you were attracted to him, it was because Charlie was Charlie. His gender seemed like just a detail. Now it sure didn't hurt that he was so effeminate. The image of his hot little ass flashes in your mind.\n\nYou take a deep fortifying breath. This was no different than those girls, it was just another temptation. Think about Sam, think about Sam. Think about your future with her. All those plans you had together. You'd always been together, you were meant for each other. Before long you have settled your turbulent mind. Your eyes starting to glance periodically toward the hallway toward your room. How was Charlie doing? You'd been rough on him. Once more you had been a complete asshole to the guy. You think you better to leave it settle, just for a bit longer. Both of you had been really riled up there.\n\nYou sit and begin to halfheartedly chat with the others. Most of them were focused on the bright silly game on the screen however.\n\nOut of the corner of your eye you see someone come out from the hall. It was your roommate. His eyes were focused on you as he limped your way. He did indeed look like he had settled down after your bout of passion, much like you had just done. He takes a seat beside and smiles at you. There was a strange confidence in him, as if he knew what must be done.\n\n\"Hey Charlie.\" You say sheepishly.\n\n\"Hey Jonathan.\" He looks around to make sure no one was looking or listening in, then he pats your knee. \"I just wanted to say that...what just happened. It was all my fault, okay. Don't blame yourself, don't feel bad, it wasn't you. My Mom warned me. She told me what College might be like. I didn't listen. I'm so dumb sometimes.\" He laughs. \"I didn't even last a week before I...well...anyways.\"\n\nDumb!? This guy was a genius. \"Charlie, you're not dumb. And it sure as hell wasn't all your fault.\"\n\nHe continues to smile. \"I like you Jonathan. I'm sorry if I messed it up. I was being selfish. Why don't we try again from the beginning?\"\n\nYou actually had to fight a tear from coming to your eye. Thinking back you realize Charlie had just sat there, you'd done everything, not him. You initiated everything.\n\nYou shake your head in disbelief at your treasure of a new friend. \"Charlie Fox, you are a bigger man than me. Yeah, lets start this again.\"\n\nThe pair of you smile at one another as your friendship is forged anew. You lean over and give him a big friendly hug. It was so natural, so comfortable, so right. You'd never felt so at ease with someone...and considering all that had happened between you that day that was saying something. As you embrace you thanked whatever twist of fate had brought this wonderful little man into your life.\n\n***\n\nAs you part from your hug pat your friend on the shoulder. \"Come on, let's show these guys a thing or two.\"\n\nThe pair of you go to sit closer to the game playing group and soon are joining in. The first few games you and Charlie get owned but after a bit you've caught on. The game is silly rollicking fun, lots of shouting and cheering and gloating among the group of mostly strangers. During the bits where you had to give others a turn you and Charlie would sit side by side giving and taking banter with the others. Charlie is quiet of course but his silly grin tells you he was enjoying himself. After a particularly exciting match where it had come down to just you and him the game swings back and forth, coming close so many times, before he eventually dumps you to your doom. You cry out \"Nooo!\" and reach over and give him a shake and both of you start laughing.\n\nHis sparkling brown eyes and wide smile telling you he was having the time of his life.\n\nThis group wasn't everyone that lived here yet, but judging by who was here it looked like you had a pretty good group of guys on your floor. Extremely international too, you coming from a small predominantly white town this was all new for you. It was...nice. The different accents giving a cool variety to the voices in the room.\n\nEventually you drift away from playing the game and start chatting with the others in you open outgoing way. You learn of where they are from, their majors, how excited they were for the year to come. Like you a few of them had girlfriends back home. When these would be brought up Luiz would just smile as if with some unknown knowledge and shake his head sadly. People start asking about parties and pussy, and where to find them. Then the conversation really picks up.\n\nAt one point a guy named Caden points over to you. \"You guys a thing?\" There was zero judgment in his words, just curiosity.\n\nYou look at him confused. Turning your head you notice you had at some point stretched your left arm out along the back of the couch and Charlie was sitting closer than would be considered normal. He was almost hip to hip with you, his shoulder almost pressed to your ribs. You could see Charlie blush through his long hair as he shifts away from you in embarrassment.\n\nYou laugh and take him around the shoulder and give him a big kiss to the side of his head. \"That's right! Hands off Charlie boys, he's all mine!\" There is some laughter and you join in. You loved this type of attention. Putting your arm around the guy to your right you do the same to him. He pushes off of you with a sour expression and the laughter escalates. \"He's mine too. I'll have all y'all before this year is up!\"\n\nThere are roars of laughter as you, in a playful way, try to kiss and molest the guy beside you as he fights you off.\n\nAs the merriment subsides you say. \"Nah, Charlie and I are roomies. Just friends. I have a girlfriend, she'll be here next year.\"\n\nThe night wore on with more chillin out with your new floor mates. At one point Charlie starts suddenly. \"Oh...It's late...I need to call home. I'm late.\" He mutters. He gets up suddenly and without a word heads for the room, limping along in an obvious hurry. You watch his baggy jeaned butt head off, knowing what was under that loose denim.\n\nOne of the guys scoffs. \"Pffft, does he gotta go call Mommy? Get a lullaby.\" He didn't mean anything by it, it was just the nervous posturing between young men as they figured out the natural pecking order.\n\nYou fix him with a stare of your intense hazel eyes. \"Maybe he does. What, you don't love your Mom?\" His smile fades as you hold his gaze in yours. You alpha male the fuck out of him. You knew exactly what you were doing. You were putting up a sign post among these guys, 'you mess with Charlie you mess with me'. You were also letting it be known you weren't cool with bullies in general.\n\nHe shifts nervously. \"I didn't mean anything...\"\n\nYou smile, letting him know all was cool. The tension quickly subsides and the carefree Jonathan was back again. As the night continues you make a point of mending things with the guy you'd stared down. There are more games and a lot more joking and chatting. Sports was a big topic for a while. You were happy to learn, thanks to the international contingent, there were other soccer fans among you.\n\nFinally you get up and stretch. You give the guys a nod goodnight and head off to your room. You weren't actually tired...you just wanted to go to your room...for some reason.\n\nAs you walk in Charlie was sitting cross legged on his bed still on the phone with his Mom, he turns away from you as he hurriedly finishes his conversation. \"Oh! He's here, I should go. - No. - No. - No please, I don't... - Yes Mom. - Yes Mom. - I'm sorry Mom. - I won't, I promise. - No! No, I want to stay. - No please. - Okay. - I'll do better. - I gotta go Mom. - Yep. - Sorry, yes Mom. - Yes Mom. - Again, sorry I was late calling you. - I'll do better. - Love you too. Tell Dad I miss him. - Okay. - Bye bye.\"\n\nHe hangs up the phone and looks at it as he sets it on his desk. That hadn't sounded like a nice conversation. He reaches up and wipes his eyes...wipes tears from his eyes! You feel a painful pang in your heart at the sight of it. He sniffles and forces a giggle as he looks up at you. \"Guess I'm a bit homesick.\" He lies.\n\nYou give him a warm gentle smile and say in a soft voice. \"Sure Charlie.\"\n\nYou stand there as the realization dawns on you that just a few hours ago, when the two of you were last in the room alone, it had gotten steamy between you. Where was the awkwardness? Where was the uncomfortable tension? It wasn't there.\n\nCharlie fishes out the book he'd been reading the night before. He begins to read with very little enthusiasm.\n\n\"Hey, you want to go do something?\" You ask. \"We could go find some trouble to get into. Or maybe watch the bats again if you want.\"\n\nHe shakes his head. \"No, I've got to finish this book.\" He informs you. \"I'm behind on my reading.\"\n\nYou look at him in puzzlement. Classes hadn't even started yet. \"Oh, uh, okay.\" You think about what you might go and get up to tonight by yourself...instead you sit on your bed. \"Mind some company?\"\n\nHe glances up through his hair, a little smile playing on his lips. \"No, of course not.\"\n\nYou spin and stretch out on your bed. Feet crossed, hands behind your head. It was quiet for a time, just the occasional turning of a page. He read fast you note.\n\n\"How's the knee?\" You ask to break the silence.\n\n\"It hurts.\" He informs you.\n\nHe lies down on his bed and rests the open book on his chest. Each of you lie in your own bed staring at the ceiling in silence. Not exactly the type of adventure you thought you'd be getting up to in college. But right now you didn't want to be anywhere else.\n\n***\n\nThe time ticks by. You lie there, each in your own bed, staring up.\n\nYou finally say. \"What do you want to do Charlie? In Biology or just, ya know, in life. What do you want to be?\"\n\nHe is quiet a long time before he says in his quiet voice. \"I want to travel. See different cities. Go far away. Hike. Explore. Maybe sail. Buy a boat or something.\"\n\nYou chuckle lightly. \"That sounds awesome. I meant career wise. What kind of Biology job are you going to get?\"\n\nHe is quiet again for a time. \"I...I don't want a job.\"\n\nHuh? Who doesn't want a job? You look over at him, he was staring up at the ceiling. He was so...different. \"Don't want a job? Are you guys rich or something?\"\n\nHe replies. \"My Dad's a judge, he does okay. But um...\" It seems to dawn on him he hadn't given you the right answer to your question. \"I dunno, a job, um, maybe I'll teach English overseas or something.\"\n\nTeach English overseas? You'd heard that could be a pretty exciting gig for a short time but that few stuck with it. If he wasn't trying to be a biologist why was he taking biology? With an intelligence like his you had assumed he had some grand destiny in front of him. You don't press him on it.\n\n\"What about you Jonathan?\" He asks.\n\nYou smile. \"Well, when I was younger it was all about the soccer. I'm pretty good. But...you know, so few people actually go pro. I'm not THAT good, even Sam says so. You have to be really special to make it. No. I'll be an Athletic therapist or trainer or something, I'd like to stay in sports in some capacity. Sam wants kids. We're going settle down, raise some kids, own a house. Then, you know, the American dream and all that jazz.\"\n\n\"That sounds wonderful.\" He says. \"Samantha is very beautiful. So very beautiful.\" There is another quiet moment. \"You deserve a beautiful normal woman like her. You two look so good together, so happy, in your pictures. What an exciting future you'll have.\"\n\nNormal woman? He had such an odd way of putting things sometimes.\n\n\"You'll find someone too Charlie. I know you will.\" You laugh. \"Hopefully someone with a boat.\"\n\nHe laughs too. \"Yeah, maybe.\"\n\nThe pair of you talk like this for a time, sharing your hopes and dreams for the future and learning more and more about each other. You felt like you could tell him your deepest secrets, not that you really had any.\n\nEventually he goes, gets his pajamas and heads into the washroom to get changed. You peel down to your underwear and lie atop your blankets like you often did. He walks back in and puts his old clothes in a hamper he had for dirty laundry. You watch as his gaze drinks you in as you are laid out in front of him in only your boxer-briefs. You shoot him a wink and he smiles bashfully. He bites his bottom lip with an impish grin and turns away from you with a giggle.\n\nThis was sooooooo weird. This was like nothing you'd ever experienced before with a friend. You openly lusted for each other, there was no secret about that anymore. And yet, thanks to the new understanding you'd forged that night, you knew nothing would come of it. You would respect his privacy and he would respect your relationship with Samantha, and in this mutual respect your friendship was solidified. By your attraction being out in the open it somehow made it easier to deal with. But still, it was soooooo weird!\n\nYou could cheat on Samantha of course, she'd never know. But that isn't who you were. You took your bond with her seriously. It had been a close call before, but you'd been caught up in an unexpected moment of desire. Now you knew. Besides, you didn't know what a fling would do to Charlie. You were pretty sure he wouldn't be the type to just casually have sex and not get emotionally attached. Also...you still honestly weren't sure how comfortable you were with getting it on with a guy. It didn't repulse you but...you just didn't know how you felt. Or how you'd feel afterward. No, you respected yourself, Samantha, and Charlie far too much to try to fuck around like that.\n\nEventually lights are out and you lay in the dark. Some muffled noises of your neighbors now heard as the place was starting to become more inhabited.\n\n\"Charlie.\" You say to the darkness.\n\n\"Yes Jonathan?\"\n\n\"I...I forgot to activate my meal card today...\"\n\n\"Breakfast together? My treat?\" His voice soft, almost melodic.\n\nYou smile, you weren't sure how you knew but you felt that he was smiling too. \"I'd like that.\" You say.\n\n\"Good night Jonathan.\"\n\n\"Good night Charlie.\"\n\nYou soon drift off to sleep...\n\nThe dreams you have that night were...hot, steamy, erotic. Glimpses of soft pale flesh, the feel of thick raven locks gripped in your fingers, the natural smell, the skin of that tender slender neck in your mouth as you sucked on it and tasted it. Full pouting lips kissing and mouthing all over your body, a slender body in your strong arms. Your steamy breath caressing each other, small hands clutch and claw at your lower back in desire, pulling you in. You hear the soft sighs and moans of passion, you could feel the layers of clothes in your hands as you tore them away, you feel the cheeks of a cute bubble ass in your hands, you feel hot sweaty flesh against flesh, your hard chiseled body against a smaller softer one, you feel legs wrap around you, you feel the warm hard results of your excitement pressed between you, both yours and...his.\n\nAnd then...the eyes...those eyes...those magical beautiful alluring big chestnut eyes!\n\n\"Charlie!\" You hear your own voice cry out.\n\nYou start awake with a gasp. You were sweating and breathing heavy. It was quiet in the room, dark. Only the path of light from the windows down the center of the room, the weak glow of morning just starting to brighten the night sky outside. You hear Charlie's soft sleep breathing from his shadow. Looking down you see a quivering tent at your crotch. You were hard as tempered steel. Your cock ached for release.\n\nYou bury your face in your hands. Oh man, you had it bad.\n\n***\n\nAnd so begins your life with Charlie.\n\nYou sneak into the washroom and rub one out in the shower. An activity that would become all too common in the days ahead. You think of Sam as you do so, though intrusive thoughts of your roommate appear unbidden. In the morning you go out to a nice breakfast together.\n\nThings really begin to pick up that day. Classes begin the next day and you still had a lot to do. Books and supplies to get, orientations to attend, and a few other things. The real rush of new and returning students hits the campus full force. Where there was once silence and space now there are people everywhere. Energetic young men and women all excited for the new year. All meeting, talking, introducing. Being an outgoing sort you meet so many new and interesting people that day.\n\nThe day flits by with you and Charlie doing your own things to get ready. Your favorite part of the day is the end, when you and your roommate just lie on your beds talking about the day gone by and the week to come.\n\nThe first week breezes by and you begin to settle into what would become your new routine. It was a strange mix of you and Charlie doing your own things punctuated with precious time where you would be inseparable. You had different circles, different activities. You would work out while he would study, etc. You had separate classes and separate interests but when you could you absolutely loved being with your little friend and he with you.\n\nHe was the Yin to your Yang, the cold to your hot, the sweet to your spicy, the brains to your brawn. You were opposites yet complimented each other perfectly. Hour by hour, day by day, you learn more and more of each other. Every morning you eat together and every night you take time to tell each other of your day. The physical temptation never wanes but you had set your boundaries and you stick to them.\n\nThat first Saturday night was an interesting one as you once more make an ass of yourself.\n\nYou are sneaking back into the dorm. You'd been out with some of the guys from the hall to a beginning of semester party. It had been a good time and holy shit had you been a hit with the girls. Your good looks and charisma making you an instant hit. They had been damn near throwing themselves at you. At one point you had two little hotties pressed up against you on either side. A buxom red head and a minxy little short haired Asian. They had been wet from head to toe for some reason, likely having taken a dunk in the pool at the party house. You flirted shamelessly and joked and even groped a bit, not as much as they did to you mind you. Despite the alcohol and their lewd invitations your resolve stood strong, in fact it was surprisingly easy.",
        "The four of you sneak back into the dorm in that loud sneaking way drunks have. It was in the early hours of the morning, a few of the guys were still up but most everyone was asleep. \"Shhhh. Mama Rose'll hear us!\" One of them says and you all start laughing as you stumble by her door. One of you falling down, you and the others help him back up. You say your goodbyes at the stairs and you stagger your way to your room.\n\nYou'd left your keys at home since you knew Charlie would be in. You hadn't planned on being out quiet so late. You are happy to see by the light under the door he was still up. You knock lightly. After a moment the door opens. You lurch into the room as Charlie closes the door behind you. You could see on his computer screen some school work open, he was such a workaholic.\n\nYou turn and sway back and forth as you smile down at him, a wide stupid drunken grin. You step up to stand so very close to him, he grimaces and turns his face from your breath. Luckily or unluckily for Charlie you were a big silly teddy bear when you were drunk.\n\n\"Hi Sharlie.\" You slur, that goofy grin only widening as you looked at him.\n\nHe laughs. \"Oh man are you drunk.\" He pushes against your chest with both hands, you take an uneasy backward step.\n\nYou blink one eye then the other. \"Yeah I hads a couple...drinks. Um. Hi Sharlie.\"\n\nHe shakes his head and walks back to sit at his computer and return to his work. \"Hi Sharlie.\" You say once more.\n\n\"Hello Jonathan.\" He says without looking. \"Did you have a good time?\"\n\nYou smile. \"You call me Jonasan. He he he.\" You belch. \"Woulda been funner wish you zhere... Dere were lotsa girls zhere.\"\n\nHe ignores you as you just stand grinning like a fool and watching him. You sway this way and that but you stay stood in the middle of the small room. Just staring. He finally looks over his shoulder and sighs. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"You're shexy. How you like zhat? I don't get it. You're not shupposed to be like zhat.\"\n\nHe rolls his eyes. \"You're drunk.\"\n\nYou keep smiling. \"Yeah.\" You then have a brilliant idea. \"Hey, let's kish.\"\n\n\"Ew, gross. No thanks. I don't kiss drunks.\"\n\n\"Okay. Hey, less go get pizza.\"\n\n\"No thank you.\"\n\n\"Oh...okay. Hey, you should come out wish me nex' time. We'll get shit faced togezzer.\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nYou giggle. \"Okay...Hey I know! Let's kish.\"\n\n\"Jonathan...sit down before you fall over.\" He was taking this all very well considering, it helped the pair of you were so comfortable together already. He trusted you even in your inebriated state. It was a well placed trust, you'd rather tear your own arms from your shoulders than harm a hair on his cute little head. He says again. \"Come on, sit down Jonathan.\"\n\n\"Yes shir!\" You sit on his bed with a clumsy thump. \"He he he. I'll shleep here tonight.\" You bounce up and down a few times on your butt.\n\nHe sighs. \"On your bed.\"\n\nYou grumble in disappointment as you stagger over to your own bed. You were having fun listening to his instructions though. You laugh. \"Tell me what elshe to do, you're tha...tha bosh. Want me to get naked.\" You laugh again. \"I shows you mine if you shows me yoursh.\"\n\n\"I've seen yours...a lot.\"\n\nYou laugh harder. \"Oh yeah! Ha ha ha! I'm such a shlut.\"\n\nYou just keep staring and smiling at him like a love sick puppy. He is focused on the screen, his fingers flying over the keyboard faster than you could process. You continue to sit and admire him. After a while he can't ignore you any longer. He looks over his shoulder and laughs. He was exasperated but he was also entertained by your making a fool of yourself. \"What now!?\"\n\n\"You're cute!\" You state boldly.\n\n\"You're drunk.\" He replies again, equally boldly.\n\nYou sigh and blow out a long breath. \"Yeah. I sink I am.\" The room was spinning and you were having a harder time focusing.\n\n\"Lie down Jonathan.\" He says, a firm note entering his soft voice.\n\n\"Yes shir.\" You follow direction, lying on your back but with your head turned towards him. \"Want me to get naked? Hey, um, let's fuck.\"\n\n\"Oh my god, you are incorrigible!\"\n\n\"Hey!\" You exclaim, taking playful offense at the comment. \"I'z never even been to Germany!\" You retort.\n\nHe starts to laugh, a long hard genuine belly laugh. \"That doesn't even make any sense!\"\n\nYou are grinning ear to ear, his laughter was music to your soul. You blurt out. \"Shleep wish me tonight Sharlie. Shleep wish me.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\" He gets up. \"Come on, get under the blankets.\" He helps you under your covers, you still had your clothes on but you didn't care. You look up at him as he tucks you in and pats your broad chest. \"Good night Jonathan.\"\n\nYou look up at him, your bleary eyes seeing only his face clearly. \"I won't ever drink no more Sharlie. I won't if you don' want me to.\"\n\nHe smiles as he looks at you. \"God you are so wasted. You don't even know what you're saying. Go to sleep Jonathan.\"\n\n\"What bout a shreesome? We could do zat right? I bet I could comvince Shamansa. You shaid you thought she's pretty.\" You were trying to make some bargain to get him into the sack somehow, but you were sounding like an idiot.\n\nHe shakes his head. \"No thank you.\" He says in a soft patient voice.\n\nYou do your best to fix his gaze, staring right into those wonderful eyes of his. \"I'll...I'll do anysing you want me to. Jusht ask.\"\n\nHe pats your chest. \"Go to sleep Jonathan.\"\n\n\"You calls me Jonasan.\" You sigh. \"Just...a kish? Just on tha sheek? ... Please.\" You turn your head to present your five o'clock shadowed cheek.\n\nHe leans over and gives you a gentle peck. You close your eyes and smile.\n\n\"Okay...breakfasht in tha morning?\" You ask like you always did. You were starting to drift off already.\n\n\"I doubt you'll be in any condition.\" He says. \"And I have to be out early.\"\n\nYou hum happily and say. \"Mmm. Okay...breakfasht in tha morning then.\" Your confused drunken mind causes you to burble out non-consciously, just as you fade away. \"Love you Sharlie.\"\n\nYou pass out.\n\nThe next day you surface in total agony, suffering one of the worst hangovers of your life. Your mouth was cotton, your head pounding, your eyelids sandpaper, you were in agony. You thought actually dying would probably feel better right now. The only small mercy is that you'd finally gotten around to getting curtains up the previous day.\n\nCracking your bloodshot eyes you look over...Charlie was gone. Off to the library or something no doubt. You were alone. The hazy memory of last night comes to you. The party, the girls, the revelry, the sneaking in, the...ohhh no! You moan in regret as you feel the complete fool. Oh Jesus, what must he think of you now?\n\nYour eyes slowly focus closer to you.\n\nOn your desk beside your bed...an energy drink, a brand new thermos mug likely full of coffee, a fresh orange, and a bacon and egg breakfast bagel sandwich. You collapse back into your pillow and groan into it. \"Oh my god...I don't deserve him...\"\n\n***\n\nTwo nights later it is Charlie's turn to be embarrassed. Unlike with you it was through no fault of his own.\n\nIt was Monday night. The day had gone by as it usually did. This week was a big one for you, the last soccer try out was on Thursday and you were starting to sharpen up for it. You were in good physical condition but being out of competitive soccer for a year had dulled your skills. You were starting to work on them with a few other guys you knew.\n\nThat night you get home tired, exhausted from a hard day's training. You shower and you talk with Charlie as you did. You tell him about the training and your classes. He tells you of his day. You were nervous for the try out but talking with your friend made all of that tension just go away. The pair of you do your talk in bed thing then you drift off to sleep.\n\nYou are woken by the sound of thrashing and movement on the other side of the room. You hear whimpering and whining and rapid breathing. Something was wrong!\n\nSitting up you turn on your bedside lamp. Charlie was sat up in his bed. He was shaking all over, his arms trembling out in front of him. His eyes were wide, confused, terrified. They dart around the room but you get the sense they are not seeing what you are seeing. He was up and his eyes were open but you got the sense he was trapped in some horrible dreamscape. He is almost hyperventilating. The light only seemed to intensify his delirium.\n\nHe gasps. \"What...what's happening? Where...? Where...?\"\n\nYou sit staring at him. You had no idea what to do. Do you wake him? You'd heard something about that being bad. You'd never had to deal with anything like this before.\n\n\"Charlie?\" You whisper.\n\nHe doesn't hear you.\n\nHe turns and starts scrambling through some books beside his bed. He is whimpering. He is so frightened. \"I'm...I'm trying...I'm trying...I'll do better...I'll do better...\" His motions get even more desperate, he claws and tears at the books looking for who knows what. He is talking fast, berating himself viciously. \"I'm sorry...I'm sorry Mom...I'm sorry...I'm so stupid...I'm so stupid...everyone knows that...they see it...I know, I can tell...I'm so stupid...I'm so stupid...I hate myself!\"\n\nHe was so frightened, so very frightened, so hopelessly alone in his plight.\n\nYour heart was breaking watching this. You simply couldn't just sit there and do nothing. You get out of bed and take the step across to his side of the room. Sitting on the edge of his bed you take him by his slender shoulders, turning him carefully away from the books he was clawing at.\n\nYou say in a slow gentle voice. \"Charlie, Charlie, wake up. Wake up. Everything is okay, you're having a dream. Charlie.\"\n\nHe is trembling, his confused eyes looking at you but not really seeing you. He begs at you. \"I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'll do better!\"\n\nYou bring him in to a big warm embrace. His small shaking hands are ice cold against your bare chest. He shakes and shivers. You just hold him, saying soothingly over and over. \"It's just a dream. Wake up Charlie. It's just a dream.\"\n\nSlowly...slowly...slowly...his breathing begins to return to normal. After a time you hear him moan woefully. \"Ohhhh noooooo.\"\n\nThis time it was really Charlie, he was awake.\n\n\"Oh no, I had one of my episodes didn't I? Oh my god.\" He rests his head on your shoulder. \"I am SO sorry Jonathan. I am so so sorry.\"\n\n\"It's okay.\" You assure him. You pull back, still holding him by the shoulders. \"Are you okay Charlie?\"\n\nHe can't even meet your gaze. He was humiliated. Utterly humiliated at his show of weakness. His head was bowed and his shoulders slumped. He whispers. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I woke you up.\"\n\nYou smile. \"Please stop apologizing. It's okay, really.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a time, the pair of you just sitting together in the silence. He finally says. \"I...I haven't gotten...a counselor down here yet.\" He still can't meet your eyes, he was so embarrassed. \"I've...I've got...they call it impostor syndrome...I've got that among other things. I'm sorry, I'm so fucked up.\" That was the first time you'd heard him swear. \"I should have warned you. You don't need a fucked up friend like me.\"\n\nYou lean forward and hug him again. \"Oh yes I do.\" You say firmly. \"It is okay. We're all fucked up one way or another.\"\n\nHe takes a deep shuddering breath. \"I'll go get a therapist tomorrow. You don't need to see this. They can put me on drugs...I don't like them but...I can...\"\n\nYou pull back again. With the tips of your fingers you touch his soft chin and you guide his face to look at yours. He tries to evade but eventually he finally looks into your eyes. You say with the utmost sincerity. \"It is okay Charlie. Okay? You don't have to go on drugs if you don't want to. I don't mind. Not one bit. Don't feel bad. Okay? If you let me know what I can do I'll help where I can. Okay? I don't mind. Do you believe me Charlie?\"\n\nHe is looking at you, unsure of what to say.\n\n\"Do you believe me Charlie?\" You ask again in a gentle tone.\n\nHe nods slowly. \"I believe you Jonathan.\"\n\nYou smile. \"Okay.\" You hug him once more. He lets out a long sigh as he rests his head on your big chest, you feel the fear and tension slowly release from his body as you hold him in your strong arms. You stroke the soft pajama fabric along his back. You feel like you could hold him like this forever. You just wished you could shield him from the demons he had inside himself.\n\nYou sit with him for close to an hour. Just talking. Just being there.\n\n\"Do you need me to stay with you tonight?\" You ask, not a hint of sexuality in your genuine offer.\n\nHe shakes his head. \"I'll be okay. Thank you.\"\n\nFinally, when he is ready, you hug one last time and you return to your bed. You turn off your bedside lamp.\n\nDarkness...silence.\n\n\"Charlie.\"\n\n\"Yes Jonathan.\"\n\n\"Breakfast in the morning?\"\n\nThere is silence. Then through a little sniffle you hear. \"Always.\"\n\n\"Good night Charlie.\"\n\n\"Good night Jonathan.\"\n\n***\n\nThe next morning things are back to normal, if anything your friendship had been taken to another level. You'd known him a week and he was easily your best friend, there wasn't even a close second. He was so different from the buddies you grew up with or the new pals you'd met at University. With them it was all about getting out and doing things, having fun, talking about shared interests. You had good friends but you only now were realizing it was all very surface level. With Charlie it was something else entirely.\n\nAnother day goes by and now you were starting to spend more time with Charlie than your other friends. You were still getting ready for the tryouts but you were now specifically making extra time for him. Even just sitting quietly with him as you both did school work was nice. You even go to a symposium with him where they were debating a variety of religious and philosophical issues. Nothing to do with Biology but you were learning Charlie had a wide array of interests. You sat patiently, only partially understanding most of what was said. These people had a language all their own. Suddenly you were the quiet one and Charlie the talker. You watched him proudly as he engaged.\n\nBy getting to know him you were starting to get a sense of just how smart he really was. He was smart. So smart. So fucking smart! But he was so humble about it that it was easy to miss. He never ever showed off or made others feel lesser than him, but he would always rise to any intellectual topic no matter what it was. Whether it be with fellow students or professors or visiting lecturers you began to realize that he was always the smartest guy in the room, yet nobody else realized it. He would always make others feel smart and even give credit to them for his ideas, which they would always accept without hesitation. He was a wonder to behold.\n\nIt is Wednesday night, the night before the big try out. You knew college soccer would be as far as you'd get if you were lucky enough to make it, but you sure wanted to give it a good try. You take it easy on the training ground, sticking with some passing and a light workout. You wanted to be fresh for tomorrow. You get in sweaty but still full of energy.\n\nAs you walk through the common room you notice a big whiteboard had been put up and a table with everyone's name was up on it. Some joker had started a pool on a variety of things that might happen in the year to come. Only five dollars to enter. You see the various categories. \"Most likely to get arrested.\" \"Most likely to flunk out.\" \"Most likely to pass out in public.\" \"Most likely to lose their virginity.\" and other jokey things. You see your name on there a few times for different things. The final column catches your eye. \"Most likely NOT to lose their virginity.\" Under this heading you see the same name again and again. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. You grit your teeth. Fucking assholes. You look at the ever present Luiz who was sitting in his usual place, did he even have classes? He just shrugs. \"Five bucks if you want in.\"\n\nYou shake your head and go to your room.\n\nAs you enter you see your roommate on his bed. He had his laptop beside him and papers laid out all around him. He was neck deep in some project or another.\n\nYou point over your shoulder. \"Hey, sorry about that stupid pool out there. Don't listen to them.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"Huh? Oh that.\" He smiles. \"I don't care.\" He just laughs it off. \"They're probably right.\"\n\nYou glance over the papers on his bed. You can't help but notice they are soccer related. You see positional charts and print outs of stats and figures. On the screen of his computer you see a paused grainy video of a soccer game.\n\nWith a suspicious tone you ask. \"Whatcha doing Charlie?\"\n\nHe looks around and starts organizing some of the papers. \"I've been looking at some of your game footage and digging into your stats. I did a comparative analysis with other players of your level then corrected and compensated for a few factors. It didn't help that you are from such a small town.\"\n\nYou stand perplexed. \"What?\"\n\nHe finds one of the papers he had been looking for and points at it. \"Here it is. You said you weren't good enough to go pro. I checked it out. Given the data I was able to get my hands on, and more than a little informed guess work, I'd say you actually have a decent shot. Comparatively speaking.\"\n\n\"What?\" You weren't processing what he was saying.\n\n\"Sure. I mean it would be hard, but I've found various examples of players who were once at your level that made it.\" He looks up at you again and smiles. \"You're right. You are good. Really good. Europe might be tough but the MLS is a possibility, maybe even the national team.\"\n\n\"I...I don't...huh?\" He may as well have been speaking Latin.\n\nHe continues. \"I was looking at your game film, what I could find anyways, and comparing it to the raw numbers and a scout report I was able to dig up I think I might have something. It is your positioning. You've got the skills, you've got the physicality and the conditioning, your passing is phenomenal. You just get dragged out of position too easily. Not good, especially for a defensive mid. And you are too willing to just clear the ball when you could play it out instead. Probably due to lousy coaching. These are things that aren't too hard to correct.\"\n\n\"Charlie...what are you talking about?\"\n\nHe laughs. \"Soccer, football, what do you think I'm talking about?\"\n\nYou say in a stunned voice, repeating the phrase you'd drilled into your head over and over again during the last year. \"I'm...I'm not that good Charlie. Even Sam says so.\"\n\n\"Well...I think you could be.\" He looks up at you with a bright grin, his eyes lock on yours. He says in an innocuous happy matter of fact sort of way. \"I believe in you.\"\n\nYou are hit with a thunderbolt that nearly knocks you back a step. \"What...did you say?\"\n\nHe laughs at your stunned look. \"I said I believe in you. If you really really want it I think you can do it. With a lot of hard work of course.\" He adds. \"There are no guarantees obviously.\" There is a moment of silence as everything sinks in.\n\n\"HA HA HA!\" You cry out. Rushing forward you scoop him in your arms and spin him around, papers go flying in all directions. He laughs and giggles and the unexpected excitement. He throws his arms around your neck and holds on for dear life as you whoop and laugh and spin.\n\nYou were on top of the world. A dream you thought dead and buried was rekindled once more. In these past few minutes he had done more than any coach or motivational speaker ever could. It wasn't the stats or the analysis, as nice as that had all been, it was his belief in you that made you feel suddenly invincible.\n\nYou set him down in front of you. Looking at the papers all around you say. \"This must have taken you forever! Why...\" You don't ask the question, you already knew the answer. He just smiles."
