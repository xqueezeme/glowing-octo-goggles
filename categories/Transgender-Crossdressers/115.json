        "We were on the couch, his arm around me and my head against him. I was wearing a red retro dress. The fifties housewife look had become one of my defaults over the past month. Chris seemed to really like it and had even bought me a few new ones so I did not have to keep using his exes clothing. Though to be honest I had pretty much kept all of it.\n\nIt was strange our relationship outside of the more sexual aspect had not changed that much Chris still watched me game and we would watch old comedies. Only now we would cuddle on the couch while we watched. I still cooked and cleaned up a bit, but now I did it while wearing cute dresses. He had even bought me an apron. I was starting to get used to wearing women's clothing, and acting more feminine. I was even starting to prefer dresses over pants.\n\nI had started thinking of myself almost exclusively as Amelia rather than Zach, which I was finding weird, but Chris was very much enjoying it. I looked up at him and smiled as he kissed me. Tightening his arm around me we started kissing deeper. We slowly parted and smiled at each other.\n\n\"Chris, I have a question.\" He gave me a puzzled look, but nodded for me to continue. I gulped a little nervous to continue. \"So, are we like dating now or is this just like a quarantine thing?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I understand the question babe.\"\n\n\"I mean like am I your girlfriend do you consider me your girlfriend, do you even want me as your girlfriend?\" He smiled and chuckled a little. I gave him an angry glare, but he kept chuckling.\n\n\"Amelia, I think you know the answer to that, you have been a girl to me since I first saw you in that wedding dress.\" I gave him a happy but severe look.\n\n\"You did not answer the question though\" he laughed and gave me a quick kiss.\n\n\"Do you want me to be your boyfriend?\" He was still smiling.\n\n\"Yes I do.\" He shrugged.\n\n\"Then you are my girlfriend Amelia, and I have no intention of letting you get away. This time I kissed him letting it linger.\n\nDo I love him? I wondered to myself that, was for later I felt my body once again surrendering to the pleasure of him. Our kiss got deeper and our hands started to roam each other's bodies. My hand trailed down his chest, then back up he pulled me tighter to him, putting a hand on my thigh and rubbing it gently.\n\nHis hand traveled upward till it rested on my slowly hardening clit. I let my hand travel down to his cock he was wearing plaid pajama pants and boxers so I could really feel it getting harder under my hand. We were still slowly kissing as he lifted my dress running his hand over my bare thigh then slowly pulling my five inch clit out of my panties he started stroking me gently. He had never seemed to mind that my clit was not really a clit. I moaned and took his cock out of his pants. It was so much bigger than my clit, a whole nine inches.\n\n\"It's so big baby\" I grinned and kept stroking it, laying my head down on his chest so I could watch my hand on his cock. I felt him kiss the back of my head and he started to stroke my clit a bit harder. I moaned softly and felt him moan too. Precum started to leak from his tip. I leaned down and licked it off of him slowly savoring it. I started to slowly suck his cock his grip on my clit did not change and I moaned as I took him as fully as I could into my mouth. I still could not take all of his massive member into my mouth, a fact that often annoyed me. I wrapped my lips around him and sucked harder, bobbing my head on him he moaned and I felt his hand on the back of my head. I felt his cock tense. I knew what that meant. I kept going, I wanted his cum. He came hard into my mouth filling it up. I sucked until he had finished then leaned up smiling, showing him the cum in my mouth then swallowed it and showed him my empty mouth. He kept stroking my clit. I moaned softly, his big hand wrapped around me. I moaned and he stroked harder and I started to cum too. He caught it all in his hand and lifted it to my lips. I licked it up but before I could swallow he kissed me hard tasting my cum. I kissed him back my cum spreading across my lips and chin. I giggled when we broke the kiss.\n\n\"What was that?\" I playfully demanded. He shrugged.\n\n\"It seemed like a good idea at the time\" he paused and whipped a bit of cum off my lip and tasted it himself. \"Did you not like it?\" I playfully hit him.\n\n\"Of course I liked it, that was really hot, just did not expect it.\" He smiled and kissed me again.\n\n\"Well I can be kinky too.\" I giggled.\n\n\"I'm not sure if that counts as kinky, but I'm willing to try almost anything once.\" We grinned and cuddled up again watching the TV till we got tired enough for bed.\n\nWe headed for his bedroom and I changed into a pink nighty leaving only my panties on under it. I kissed him and cuddled up with him under the covers, laying on my side with his arms around me. I felt him rising against me.\n\n\"Mmmm I like that baby\" I felt him thrust against me a bit harder rubbing his cock between my ass cheeks even though my panties, it felt good and I moaned softly in pleasure. \"Want to do me before bed baby?\" I asked in my best seductive voice. He grunted and reached for a bottle of lube he had taken to keeping closer to the bed. He lubed up his fingers and reached into my panties finding my hole he slowly started to rub around it then inserted a finger into me.\n\n\"Mmmmm that's good baby I like that.\" He kept fingering my boipussy making sure I was ready for him. He pulled away from me for a moment and lubed himself up. Then pulling down my panties he pressed the head of his cock into me while I was still on my side. I moaned, feeling him fill me up, there was no more pain, only pleasure as he cock slid into me. \"Oh fuck baby that's so good.\" My pussy seemed to be molded to his cock by now. Chris took me around the waist and started to thrust inside of me. I moaned for more loving his hard cock buried deep inside of me. He pulled out suddenly but motioned for me to get on top, I gladly did getting on top of him I pressed myself back down on his cock moaning as I did.\n\n\"God baby I love watching your face as you do that\" he said with a smile I was starting to find so sexy. I grinned and started to ride him, my pink nightly flapping a bit as I did. He reached up and pinched my nipples gently through the nighty. I kept riding him feeling his huge hard cock rubbing hard against my g-spot. I tried to tighten myself around him and he moaned so it must have felt good.\n\n\"Oh god baby I'm gonna cum\" I gasped out as I rode him harder\n\n\"Do it baby cum for me. I want to see your face as you cum hard for me baby.\" He grunted. I could tell he was close. With a loud moan I started to cum just as I did he started to cum hard deep inside of me.\n\n\"Oh fuck baby fill my pussy up make me pregnant with your hot sperm.\" We both sat there for a moment, his stomach covered in my cum I slowly got off his cock and cuddled up with him again. His hand rested gently on my ass, and I handed him some paper towels to clean himself up.\n\n\"I love you\" I looked up at him. He was holding me close to him, his arm around me, my arm around him. I reached up and kissed him slowly.\n\n\"I love you too,\" and I found I meant it. At that moment I realized fully that I would be a girl for him for the rest of my life if he wanted me. I did not know what the future would hold for us but I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to be. Zach was dead in my mind from that point on. I was only Amelia.\n\nThe next morning came to soon Chris was already awake and showering, by the time I woke up. I ideally thought about joining him but part of me would not let me do it. He might love me but he had not really seen me naked. It was silly I know, but I didn't really want to remind him that I had a male body.\n\nHe stepped out of the shower and came back into his, well our bedroom. I smiled and he looked me over leaning down, he gave me a kiss. I smiled up at him.\n\n\"I wish I did not have to go to work.\" He grimaced.\n\n\"I mean you just have to go down the hall to your office and that's about it.\" I giggled when he stuck out his tongue.\n\n\"I don't want to go because I have a beautiful girl in my bed.\" I blushed. \"I love how you still blush when I say that.\" I blushed more and got on my knees. Wrapped my arms around him and kissed him.\n\n\"Got time to fuck me quick?\" He laughed a bit but shook his head no.\n\n\"Sorry babe, my boss wants me online early for a meeting.\" He grabbed my ass and squeezed. \"Not that you make it easy.\" I kissed him and swatted his ass.\n\n\"Go on then babe, have fun at your meeting.\" He rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Yeah fun\" he kissed me and pulled away headed for his meeting. I pulled out my laptop and started watching a voice tutorial. I had two classes later, but my homework was done and this was what I was doing to pass the time. Eventually I switched to a tutorial on how to move more like a woman.\n\nI was trying and if I was going to do this I was going to do it right. I put on another dress, this one a green, retro dress and made sure my petticoat fit under it well. I had been learning to care for those as well some black thigh highs, panties bra and garter set. I was lucky Chris's ex seemed to have a flat chest. Hell I was lucky that she seemed to be my size. Most of her clothing fit me after all.\n\nChris was still in his meeting by lunch time, but I brought him a sandwich off screen. And I went to my class. I messed my hair up and put on a hoodie, but left my dress on under it. No one seemed to notice. Class ended and I sat around waiting for my next one again no one noticed. Finally I was done for the day.\n\nI got up and started on dinner, putting two lamb shanks and a whole head of garlic in the crockpot and covering it in salt and pepper. I set it on low and set a timer for four hours. I did some basic cleaning and then gamed for a while. While I was on the computer I noticed Chris trying to sneak up on me and I spun around making him laugh.\n\n\"Done with work babe?\" He smiled.\n\n\"I got to take a lunch break after all, thanks for the sandwich. Classes go ok?\" I nodded. He leaned down to kiss me. I kissed him back. \"Best part is I only have two hours left after.\" I grinned.\n\n\"Good dinner should be ready by then\" he made a show of sniffing the air.\n\n\"It smells wonderful babe, you feed me well, maybe that's why I love you.\" I blushed.\n\n\"I love you too\" I stood up and put my arms around his shoulders. \"One hour huh? Sounds like you have time to make me moan.\" He grinned and kissed me. I could feel my clit getting hard in my panties. I leaned over to his ear, nibbling the lobe a little. \"I want your dick inside me baby.\" I used my most seductive girly voice. He shuddered in pleasure and then turned me around and bent me over against the wall. He lifted my dress up and I took hold of it. I heard him unzipping his pants. He pulled some lube out of a drawer on my desk and spread it liberally on his cock.\n\nHe pressed his cock into me wasting no time and groaned in pleasure. I really had wanted this, he started to fuck me hard. Moaning loudly I wondered ideally if the neighbors could hear but the thought was fleeting as I gave into the pleasure. My clit bounced between my legs as he slammed into me I screamed to god and tried to stay upright he took me around the waist holding me up I put both hands against the wall letting him pound me with reckless abandon.\n\n\"Oh fuck baby that fuck me like a little whore I love being a whore for you\" he slapped my ass and kept pounding me my knees shook I could feel my orgasm building.\n\n\"I'm gonna make you cum you little whore, you were never a man you were always a whore I just had to fuck it out of you.\" He slapped my ass again and again. I gasped and screamed a little in pleasure.\n\n\"Cum inside me baby fill your whore's pussy up with your cum.\" He grunted; we were both so close I could feel it. With a final yell he started to cum driving me over the edge my cum hit the floor fortunately missing my dress.\n\nHe gently reached down and pulled my panties back up and smoothed out my dress helping me sit back in the chair. He kissed me.\n\n\"You are amazing, Amelia I love you.\" He kissed me again and I kissed back.\n\n\"I love you too Chris, thank you for making me a girl\" he smiled I smiled back. I really did love him after all. To think at the beginning of the school year I was just some guy, some loser who never got dates. Now here I was in love with a man. The man who had taken my virginity. A man who was twenty years older then me.\n\nI wondered what my family would think. Then again did I care? I was happy that was enough for me."
