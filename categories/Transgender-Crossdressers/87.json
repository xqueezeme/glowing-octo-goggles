        "'Do you like how this feels?' she whispered to him.\n\n'Yesss..' he hissed back at her.\n\nHer mouth returned to his penis, and he watched as her cheeks hollowed with suction. Her eyes remained locked on his, as her head began to slowly move down his shaft until her nose rested firmly into his shaved pubic area.\n\n'Oh God..' he moaned, 'that's sooo good, please.. don't stop.' he couldn't take his eyes off of her, she was perfect.\n\nShe opened her mouth around his shaft, and let her tongue cradle its underside as she slowly lifted it until only the head of his penis remained in her mouth. She wrapped her lips around this most sensitive part of him, and sucked gently for a moment, before lifting further, and holding the base of his penis in one of her delicate hands. 'It feels so nice in my throat.' she purred. 'Do you like being inside my throat?' she asked, and then began gently kissing the head of his throbbing penis.\n\nKelly was lying on his back, on the bed he'd be sharing with his 'roommate' Beth, his legs were spread around Beth, who had kept him in this prolonged state of sexual delirium, his knees raised on either of her. He was losing the battle to remain still, the animal instinct inside urged him to thrust his hips, and lodge his penis deep into her mouth. 'God yes, I've never felt anything so good..' he groaned.\n\nShe smiled and returned her shiny red lips to the head of his penis, her eyes remained on him, and she asked 'Ready for something that feels even better?'\n\nNothing could feel better than this, she was toying with him, she must be toying with him. He nodded, without saying a word. She slightly tightened her grip on the base of his penis, then licked her lips and moved her mouth to his testicles, softly sucking one into her mouth. Kelly could feel the vibrations coursing through his body as she moaned softly. She let the first testicle slip past her lips and took the other inside her mouth, her tongue slowly rolled along the soft hairless skin of his scrotum.\n\nKelly could only groan in response.\n\nBeth lifted her mouth from his testicles and moved her mouth lower until he could feel her tongue on this anus. He tensed, and his eyes bulged. She could feel him tighten up and whispered 'Relax Kelly, I promise this will feel incredible.' and she moved her mouth back to his puckered ring. She let her tongue softly play there, she wasn't trying to push herself inside, she was only licking, or maybe slathering. He closed his eyes and tried to relax. This sensation was absolutely unknown to him, the last two days had been filled with similar unknowns, but everything had been incredible so far. He relaxed further, and Beth loosed her grip on his penis and began to slowly move her hand up and down his shaft.\n\n'Kelly, I want to do something for you, something that will change your life, forever.' she whispered to him. She continued to slowly stroke his penis. 'This will feel so good, it'll be hard for you to not want this all the time.' she continued stroking. 'So I can either suck your dick and let you shoot your cream down into my tummy..'\n\nKelly groaned and lifted his hips.\n\n'Or if you want more, if you want to be spoiled forever..' she paused, and felt his penis throbbing madly in her hand, she knew she'd edged him for long enough. 'If you want that.. you have to ask me for it.' she said, in a voice that triggered his hips to lift off the mattress once again.\n\n'Yes.. please, I want to be spoiled, more..' he groaned.\n\nHer finger slipped past his sphincter more easily than she expected, she wondered if Kelly had been naughty and put other things in there before, no matter, she was about to show him her magic trick, and she knew he'd love it.\n\nKelly's eyes opened when he felt her finger slip inside him. He gasped but said nothing, at that moment he only wished she'd start sucking him again. Her finger and her mouth would have been indescribable.\n\nBeth moved deeper into his anus, her fingertip was expertly searching, and there it was, she'd found his prostate, the fleshy bump inside, much easier to find with poor Kelly having been subjected to her considerable oral skills for so long, always kept just below the stimulation needed for the boor boy to gain release. She slid her finger along the enlarged bump, and took her remaining hand from his penis, gripping one of his thighs.\n\nKelly lifted his hips again, and felt a strange sensation, first, a bit like he needed to urinate, but that quickly passed. It was something else now, and it felt nice.\n\n'Are you okay Kelly?' Beth cooed. 'Does this feel good?' as she slowly moved her finger along his prostate, she kissed his inner thigh, she knew what his answer would be.\n\n'Yeah.. it feels good.. don't.. don't stop..' he whispered to her.\n\nShe grinned, and remembered her first time, in a situation not so unlike this. She knew things were definitely about to change for this cute boy, it made her feel so naughty to be the one that would show him, in a way, the one that would turn him.\n\n'Oooo.. that's nice.. I.. ooo.. I feel... I....' he was groaning.\n\nShe softly licked along his thigh 'It's okay, just let it happen..' she whispered, her finger was moving faster now, and his hips were jerking around more erratically.\n\n'Kelly, just let go, just relax, just let it happen Girl..' she purred seductively.\n\nAt that, Kelly surrendered and felt his entire body explode into the most mind-shattering orgasm he had ever felt in his life. Semen had erupted from his penis and covered his stomach. Had erupted from his.. penis.. his... soft penis.\n\nWhat?\n\nHow was that possible? How had he just cum so violently, without Beth holding his penis? Without her stroking it, without it... being.. hard.\n\nHow was that possible?\n\nBeth, slipped her finger from inside his anus and moved her head past his shriveled manhood. Kelly couldn't see the grin on her face, as she let her tongue slide along the puddles of cum that had formed on his stomach. He said nothing, utterly confused, he watched her silently. She slurped up one particularly large puddle of his seed and savored it for a moment before swallowing it. Kelly moaned, realizing she was eating his cum, like an animal. She took a finger and swirled it around in another of the puddles, then lifted her face so he could see, she brought the finger to her mouth, and she licked it clean.\n\nHe just watched, lust beginning to rise within him. She swirled up another fingerful of his cum, then slid her body up towards him, and kissed him for a moment, before offering him her finger.\n\nHe looked at the finger, unsure for a moment, then looked back at her and parted his lips.\n\nThey showered together, playing with each other's bodies, Kelly understood that Beth was a guy, well, used to be a guy, she still had a penis, although it was considerably smaller than his own. Her testicles were similarly smaller. He knew how crazy that sounded.. 'Her penis' and 'Her testicles', but Beth was absolutely female. The only logical explanation he could think of was that she was born a female with the wrong genitals, and her genitals weren't freaking him out nearly as much as he would have imagined, in truth, as he moved his hand to her girl cock, he thought it looked cute.\n\n'I want to do something for you.' Kelly said, he'd decided that he wanted to suck Beth's cock, it didn't feel gay, not at all, Beth wasn't a guy, he was mixed up a bit, but he knew he wanted to make her feel as good as she'd made him feel. 'Can I suck your.. I mean, if you'd like that, I could suck your...'\n\n'My cock?' Beth asked him.\n\nKelly nodded his head, and looked down at his hand, cupping her smallish testicles, and shriveled penis. He looked back into her eyes, and she smiled at him and brushed a soft hand against his cheek. 'Let's talk..' she said, turning off the shower, she led him to their bedroom, both wrapped in towels in the way that women typically wore after showering.\n\nThey lay in bed, gazing into the eyes of each other on their sides. It was quiet for a bit, and then Beth spoke 'I think it's sweet you want to make me cum.' she moved closer, and kissed him softly. Kelly was still confused, he didn't typically have any desire to suck dick, but Beth, everything was so different with her.\n\n'So Kelly, I want to be honest, okay?' she said.\n\nHe nodded, he didn't like the sound of that, but he nodded.\n\n'I don't get hard anymore.' she said 'I take pills, and one of the side-effects, there are a couple of side effects, I've gotten smaller down there, and, it doesn't get hard anymore..' Kelly's eyes opened in surprise. She took his chin in her hand 'It's okay, I don't care about that anymore, it really is okay.' she said, reassuring him.\n\n'But, why? why would that be okay? he asked, puzzled.\n\n'The pills make it easier for me to look on the outside, how I feel on the inside.' she smiled 'Does that make sense?' she wanted him to understand 'I take female hormones, so my skin softens, so my body looks more feminine, so my breasts will keep growing.' she smiled 'I'm a woman Kelly, why would I care if I could get a boner?'\n\nHe swallowed, that was a lot to take on, he considered her words and simply couldn't imagine himself being in a place mentally that would leave him not caring if he could ever get sexually excited again. 'So, you don't get horny?' he squeaked out.\n\nShe laughed 'Kelly, I'm horny all the time, I just don't get hard anymore. From the moment Marcy brought you by the pool I've been thinking of playing with you.'\n\n'But if you don't hard..' he blinked.\n\n'So tell me, did I just get you off pretty good? she grinned at him,\n\n'God yes, that was the most intense...'\n\n'Your dick was soft when you got off, do you know that?' she asked simply.\n\nHe nodded 'I thought, maybe.. it just went down quick or something.' he quietly hoped.\n\n'Kelly, you began to soften pretty quickly after I started rubbing your P-spot.' she stated, matter-of-factly. 'You had that orgasm with a soft penis, and it felt incredible, didn't it?'\n\n'The best I've ever felt.' he admitted.\n\n'That's how I cum now, my dick doesn't get hard anymore, but if my P-spot is getting worked on..'\n\n'You keep saying 'P-spot' what's that all about?' he asked.\n\n'Our prostate silly. Guys can cum pretty hard just by having their prostate stimulated, the way you just did, for the first time, and the way I do, every time.'\n\n'So, do you rub back there? or use a toy or something?' he asked.\n\n'I like dick.' she stated flatly, which caught Kelly off-guard. 'Nothing makes me feel more like a woman than to have a man fucking me, and making me cum from fucking me.' she grinned, a bit wickedly. 'Nothing makes me feel sexier than knowing my body can cause a man to cum deep inside me, and that his cock inside me, can make me cum too.'\n\nKelly's penis was immediately at full attention listening to her speak. He looked down and saw the tent in the towel. Beth never took her eyes off of his, she reached a hand, lifted the towel away from his crotch, and began slowly jerking him off.\n\n'Does that turn you on Kelly? Hearing me tell you how I like to get fucked?' she purred seductively.\n\n'Hell yes.' he nodded, he didn't know how he'd find her 'P-spot' but he would do whatever she needed him to do to make her cum. 'Just tell me what to do so you cum..' he said, moving to his knees.\n\nShe smiled 'I will Kelly, I like you. But don't worry about me getting off right now, let me make you feel better again, okay?\n\n'I feel bad. You've already gotten me off harder than I ever have in my life, and I haven't done anything for you, Let's have sex, I want you to get off..' he pleaded.\n\nShe shook her head 'That's only for my Sponsor, I made him a promise that would just be his.' she smiled at him then 'but I can play other ways. Now, do you want me to suck your dick, or do you want me to play with your P-spot again?'\n\nWhen they'd finished, they took another shower, then got dressed. Beth helped Kelly find a nice pair of women's stretch jeans that hugged his ass, and legs. She picked out a cute beige cotton sweetheart-cut top. They found a pair of white-canvas converse sneakers that were almost a perfect fit for Kelly. Then Beth sat down with Kelly and showed him how to do very basic, very modest makeup. They settled on a simple lip gloss, the slightest bit if mascara, the two wanted Kelly to look cute, and not like a slut. They wanted it to be obvious, the cute guy, wearing womens clothes, was also wearing makeup. Obvious, but not ridiculous. When they were finished, Kelly looked like Kelly, just a bit.. maybe just a bit prettier.\n\nThey walked out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen, both had worked up a bit of an appetite. As Beth rummaged through the refrigerator, she heard a familiar voice 'Well there the two of you are!' Marcy said. Beth closed the door to the refrigerator, and the two of them smiled at Marcy, who already had Kelly in a hug.\n\n'Hi Marcy, do you have any burgers hidden in here?' Beth jokingly asked, while winking at Kelly.\n\n'Sorry, no burgers. But hey, if you really want a burger, why don't you girls head into town, go to Reggies, best burgers in town! she said.\n\n'Girls?' Kelly thought, that was the second time today he'd been referred to as a girl, Beth first, with her finger in his ass, and now Marcy calling them 'girls.'\n\nHe wasn't a girl, he DID like bras, and panties, and nylons, and he really did like how he looked at that moment, and he loved his makeup, but he wasn't a girl. He kind of felt girly, sure.. but he was a guy. He was a guy. He. was. a. guy.\n\n'That's a great idea, I couldn't deal with another salad right now.' Beth laughed, then reached her hand to Kelly 'Let's go girl, I'm starved!'\n\n'The fuck??' he thought to himself, as he followed her out of the house.\n\nThey took Beth's car into town, to a little burger joint that smelled incredible as they parked. During the ride, they spoke sparingly, Kelly was worried that these women thought he wanted to be female, he worried that he was going out in public wearing women's clothes, with makeup on, well, just a bit of makeup, but still.\n\nAs Beth turned off the car, she looked at Kelly and said 'Confused, right?'\n\n'Yeah, really confused.' he said, not knowing what more to add.\n\n'It's okay, I was confused too.' she shrugged. 'Let's get some food.'\n\nThey walked into the diner and sat at a booth in the corner. Both ordered burgers, fries, and a drink.\n\nBeth then looked at Kelly and said 'So, we were talking about feeling confused. Particularly, how confused I was.'\n\n'Really? I mean it doesn't seem like you have been confused a lot..' he answered, feeling even more confused.\n\n'I told you, we're a lot more similar than you think. We both ended up at Marcy's for nearly the same thing, the first night I spent at Marcy's I cried myself to sleep, I wanted to go back home, I wanted to run further away, I wanted all of the mixed emotions to go away, I wanted to just be 'normal' and have the chance to have things be 'normal' again.' for the first time, Beth didn't look happy, in fact, her face was incredibly sad. 'I didn't know exactly what I wanted, I knew that if I pretended I was a normal boy, I'd never be happy.' she looked at him 'Does that make sense?'\n\nHe nodded slowly, he hadn't felt 'normal' for a long time.\n\n'I knew that when I put on my sister's underwear, it felt right, it excited me, but it calmed me, I know that sounds crazy.' she said.\n\n'It makes you feel comfortable but really sexy, and then you don't know what to do with all those feelings.' Kelly said.\n\nShe nodded at him 'I was at Marcy's for about a week, I didn't have anyone there to talk through all of this with like you have with me.' she took a deep breath 'Then one night Marcy said someone wanted to meet me, someone had seen my photos on their website. She said that I didn't have to meet anyone, but thought if I did, it could help me understand a lot of the confusion I was feeling, and so I agreed, and later that night, I met my Sponsor.'\n\n'What happened?' Kelly asked.\n\n'I was really scared, I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't what he turned out to be. We talked about what made me happy, and what made me sad. He asked me if there were no rules in the world, and if anything was possible, what would I want to be completely happy. ' She smiled, remembering that night. 'I told him if there were no rules, and anything was possible, that I wanted to be a woman.' she giggled 'I guess I'm heading in that direction.'\n\n'You are a woman.' Kelly stated 'Just look at you, nobody in this world could say otherwise..' his words weren't meant to compliment her, they were a simple statement of fact. Beth was a lot more of a woman than some women that are born with vaginas.\n\nHer eyes sparkled at his words 'You're sweet Kelly.' she paused a moment, then reached into her purse, and rummaged a bit, producing a photo, and sliding it across the table to Kelly.\n\nHe took the photo, and turned it over, he could see it was a school yearbook photo. The guy in the photo look unremarkable, he figured he was probably a Senior, the smile looked phony. He quickly felt jealous, this guy was the 'Sponsor'? This guy got to fuck Beth? How did this guy end up having that kind of power? He immediately decided he didn't like this asshole.\n\n'So this is him, this is your 'Sponsor'?' he said, sneering a bit at that word.\n\nBeth laughed out loud and shook her head 'No Silly, that was me..'\n\nKelly looked at the picture again, then to Beth, then back at the picture, and shook his head 'Nope, I don't believe it. aside from the obvious things, even the chin is totally different in the picture.' he observed.\n\n'You're right, and my cheekbones, and my adam's apple..' Beth grinned back at him. 'The miracles of surgery I suppose.'\n\nKelly kept looking from the picture to Beth, back to the picture. 'Really? These are two absolutely different people..' he thought out loud.\n\n'Imagine, the 'me' that was inside, and then the 'me' that was on the outside in that photo. I wasn't sure who I was on the inside until I had some long conversations with my Sponsor, and then we both realized what I needed, in order to be comfortable. What I needed to have on the outside, what I needed the world to see, was how I felt on the inside.' she nodded to herself, accepting that explanation of things as accurate.\n\nKelly listened silently until she was done speaking. 'I'm not sure what the difference is between the 'inside me' versus the 'outside me'. I know they aren't the same, but I don't think the two are so far apart, as what you were dealing with.'\n\nBeth nodded 'We're all different, you have to decide what's right for you.'\n\nThe Server brought the two burger plates to their booth, and they finished shortly after, mostly in silence. All through the meal, Kelly wondered what his 'inside me' would look like if it was the version of him the world could see.\n\nOn the way back to Marcy's, they stopped at the mall, Beth wanted to pick up a few things, and by this point, Kelly really didn't give much of a shit if people thought he looked different, or weird. He was enjoying the afternoon hanging out with Beth, even though she was 'her Sponsors' they'd played around, and she'd made him feel things he wouldn't have imagined a week ago. Beth asked him to wait outside of one of the stores while she ran in, and he busied his time looking through the window of a women's clothing shop, that featured mannequins in underwear. He thought how ironic that he would have killed to have just one of those sets a few days ago, and now he had a drawer full of those delicate treasures waiting for him back at Marcy's. He lifted his gaze from the display, and noticed two guys walking past her in the reflection of the window, he could clearly see they were both looking at his ass in those tight, stretchy jeans. They both had a look that made it clear they appreciated the view.",
        "That felt.. it felt.. empowering. He watched their reflection as they passed by, smiling to himself when Beth walked up behind him, and slapped his ass playfully 'i wish you would have seen it Kelly!' her voice filled with excitement.. 'Two guys just walked by..'\n\n'and they were checking out my ass..' he finished.\n\nBeth kissed Kelly on the cheek, and took his hand 'Let's get back to Marcy's.'\n\nAs they drove along, Beth asked Kelly how it felt having guys checking out his ass.\n\n'I don't know, part of me freaked out a bit, another part of me really got off on it. I mean, it made me feel powerful.\n\nBeth nodded. 'I love it when guys check me out. I wonder how many would freak out if they knew about my, umm.. little surprise.'\n\nKelly fidgetted a bit, he wanted to ask, but it would be uncomfortable, but he was so curious 'Beth, umm, about that, your umm 'little surprise', so I was wondering..'\n\nShe looked over at him, and tilted her head a bit as if waiting for him to continue.\n\n'Is that part of the 'inner you' too?' he squirmed a bit.\n\n'It's definitely part of the 'outer me' isn't it?' and she giggled.\n\n'Yeah, I guess, I'm just curious..' he kept dodging the question.\n\n'Are you trying to ask me something?' she wanted him to face it, and ask the question.\n\n'Yeah, so, are you. I mean, you said you had some surgeries, and your breasts are incredible, so I wondered, are you going to have, you know, surgery down there too?' he managed to ask, in a roundabout way.\n\n'No, I'm fine with that part of me, I don't think it defines 'Beth', and my Sponsor doesn't have any problem with me keeping it. So no, I'm keeping it.' she felt better, getting that cleared up.\n\n'If your Sponsor wanted you to get the surgery there, would you?' he asked.\n\n'I would.' she nodded 'You have to understand, he's made it possible for me to be Beth, without him, I'd be the guy you saw in the picture, but sadder.' she sighed 'If he wanted me to have that surgery, I'd do it without a second thought because no matter how much I could ever do for him, it would never be a fraction of how much he's already done for me.'\n\nKelly nodded, trying to process that level of devotion, was it devotion? was it commitment? was it simply love? He couldn't imagine wanting to ever have that part of himself cut away, he didn't feel selfish to think that nobody, regardless of how much they could do for him, would ever be enough that he'd so casually agree to have such a radical change made to who he was.\n\nThey hung out at Marcy's watching movies on the couch, and snacking on popcorn, they laughed together through the funny movies, and held onto each other through the romantic movies, finally it was late and they got up to bed. Beth closed their bedroom door, and Kelly was rummaging through the dresser, looking for something to wear to bed, she stepped close behind him, and pulled her arms around him, holding him close 'Kelly, I'm so glad I met you.' and she pulled him close.\n\nHe felt the emotions rising up in his chest again like it'd done at least half a dozen times since he laid eyes on her. He didn't want to freak her out and say what he was feeling, but she was kind of doing that, right? 'Me too, I've definitely never met anyone like you.' he smiled warmly, turning his head back to her, then glancing down past her waist 'I mean, seriously.' he giggled, meaning no harm.\n\nShe spun him around and kissed him deeply, then pulled back 'Kelly, I have to leave in the morning. I'm going to be gone for a while.' her face saddened 'I wish I could spend more time with you, but..' she shook her head 'I want to see you again when I get back..'\n\nKelly stood looking at her, unable to believe this incredible woman, this beautiful woman that seemed to understand him so well, that had been so much fun to be with, this woman that he had fallen for, fallen hard for, was now saying she had to leave. 'Leave for... how long?' he whispered, his heart already felt broken, this was it, his first love, breaking his heart.\n\n'I don't know, my Sponsor, we.. he's taking me with him, it doesn't usually happen, usually, he just comes by once in a while to visit, maybe spend a weekend, but sometimes..' she shook her head 'I love him, I won't not say that. I love being with him, and how he makes me feel, I feel so complete in his arms.. But, you're special to me, I love you too, I just love you in a different way, I love you like, ugh, I don't want to say this and have you hate me..' she shook her head.\n\n'What different way?' Kelly whispered, listening as everything continued falling apart.\n\n'Like.. oh shit Kelly, I don't want to hurt you!' she sobbed.\n\n'Say it..' he whispered.\n\n'I love you like you were my girlfriend. Like we were girlfriends.' she said, hoping he would understand.\n\n'So you see me as a woman? not like, I mean, you don't see me as a man?' he asked, now he too had tears on his face.\n\nShe took his face into her hands and kissed his lips, she didn't say a word, but slowly shook her head, and turned him to face the mirror. He looked at his reflection, he gazed at the women's clothes he was wearing, and the mascara that had begun to run onto his cheeks, at the lip gloss, that had kept his lips feeling so sexy since this morning. How he'd enjoyed freshening it up throughout the day. He looked in the mirror at all of this and realized he didn't feel like a man, and at that moment, he didn't look like a man.\n\nThey held each other through the night, and the morning came too soon, Kelly had gotten little naps here and there, but he wanted to be awake, and not waste any of what little time he had left with Beth. He quietly watched her sleep, smelled her, softly stroked her hair. He knew that everything would be different with her now, and wondered when he'd see her again.\n\nSometime before 9:00am he rolled over and reached an arm out to touch her, and found himself in bed alone. He bolted upright and used all of his focus not to start crying. He got out of bed and noticed a card, propped against a small gift box on the dresser. He wanted to unsee it, it would be too difficult to look, but without realizing it, he had the card in his hand, struggling to read the words it contained as tears fell from his cheeks.\n\n'Dearest Kelli,\n\nI wanted to let you know that I already miss you terribly. I wish I could be there with you, as you continue to discover more about yourself, and find the best way for your 'inner you' to become the 'outer you.'\n\nI bought this for you yesterday, I think you'll understand how this simple token connects us, for me, it signifies a journey I've completed, for you, it signifies a journey you may just be starting. I hope that your journey leads you to the same happiness that I have felt. I know I'll see you again, I hope you don't hate me.\n\nLove,\n\nBeth'\n\nHe opened the small box, and found that it contained a small gold chain and pendant. A pendant of a butterfly. He smiled, although tears were rolling down his cheeks..\n\n'I love you too Beth, but you spelled my name wrong..' he laughed.\n\nA thought began to form in his mind, he straightened up, looked deeply at his reflection in the mirror, he turned his face a bit from side to side, observing his features, his chin, his brow, his nose, then he inhaled deeply. 'A journey.' he said quietly to himself.\n\nHe cleaned himself up and decided to apply his makeup the same way Beth had taught him, he thought she'd grin and tell him he looked good, and so that made him smile. He picked out a different pair of jeans that fit snugly, and a simple yellow knit top, he ran his fingers through his hair, giving it a swept-back look, then picked up Beth's gift, placing the pendant around his neck.\n\nIt was a new day, and he wouldn't spend it crying. He walked into the kitchen, and as he opened the refrigerator, he heard Marcy's voice 'Good morning Girl!' she sounded excited 'I just heard from someone on the website that wants to meet you!'\n\nKelli grinned at Marcy and simply said 'Let's make that happen.'"
